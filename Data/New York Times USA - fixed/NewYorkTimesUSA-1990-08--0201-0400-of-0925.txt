HEADLINE: OIL SURGE: CONSUMERS ALREADY TAKING A BEATING;
Mortgage Rates Up a Quarter-Point in Just a Few Days

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Home mortgage interest rates, which last week were hovering just above 10 percent, have increased quickly in recent days, following the yields on Treasury bonds onto higher ground.
A rapid series of increases in mortgage rates totaling more than a quarter of a percentage point in the last few days is a reminder of how the effect of higher oil prices spreads through the American economy. ''These rates are probably high enough to put a damper on activity in the housing market,'' said Thomas M. Holloway, an economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association.
An increase of one-quarter point on a 10 percent $100,000 mortgage would increase monthly payments by $18.53, to $896.10 a month. 
Since last Wednesday, before Iraq invaded Kuwait, oil prices have increased about $8 a barrel, causing economists and investors to expect a rise of half a percentage point or more in inflation over the next year. Expectations of higher inflation have caused interest rates on long-term Treaury bonds to rise almost half a percentage point, which has pulled up rates on home mortgages.
 
Two Increases in a Day
At Countrywide Credit Industries Inc. of Pasadena, Calif., the nation's largest independent mortgage lender, rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were raised twice yesterday. The rate at the end of the day was 10.33 percent, up from 10.14 percent late Friday and about 10.08 percent last Wednesday.
Although other mortgage lenders' rates vary slightly, the upward trend has been the same.
''We take in about $20 million of mortgage applications a day and have to adjust our rates to reflect changes in the prices at which we can sell the mortgages,'' said Stan Kurland, chief financial officer at Countrywide. Mortgage banking firms, like banks, savings and loan associations and other lenders, package mortages into securities, which are then sold to pension funds and other investors as higher-yielding alternatives to Treasury bonds.
On days like yesterday, when rates are rising rapidly, Mr. Kurland said, the firm expects to receive a greater than normal volume of applications. ''A lot of mortgage brokers and real estate agents will see yields moving higher and decide to push through as many applications as they can, before rates move up more,'' Mr. Kurland said.
To avoid the risk of losing money when interest rates are rising, mortgage lenders frequently adjust rates charged to homebuyers. The lenders are vulnerable to a loss if, for example, a loan was made at 10 percent but sold to investors at a higher interest rate of 10.50 percent 75 days later -after the mortgage application has been processed and the loan placed with similar mortgages into a package of securities.
 
Housing Already Weak
The mortgage rate increases come at a time when activity in the housing market has already been depressed, with high vacancy rates in many parts of the country, a slowdown in economic growth that is threatening to become a recession and greater caution among bank lenders, many of whom have been hurt by defaults on loans to developers.
Commerce Department data show that housing starts fell for five consecutive months, to an annual rate in June of just 1.18 million units, the lowest level in nearly eight years. Sales of new homes have also been depressed, but they improved slightly in June, thanks to a decline in interest rates that began in April. ''But now we are moving back to nearly the same rates as April, so I expect a negative response by consumers,'' said Mr. Holloway, the economist.
Interest rates on 30-year conventional, fixed-rate mortgages, which are not backed by any Government guarantee or insurance, such as those quoted by Countrywide, remain lower than average rates charged earlier this year. According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, a Congressionally chartered but privately owned agency that buys mortgages and sells mortgage-backed securities, the average interest rate in May was nearly 11 percent.
Treasury bond yields closed yesterday at 8.79 percent, up nearly half a percentage point since last Wednesday and the highest since May 10.

HEADLINE: Dow Plunges by 93.31; Stocks Slide in Tokyo

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices plunged again yesterday as continuing tensions in the Middle East pushed up oil prices, leading to investor fears that inflation will heat up.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 93.31 points, or 3.3 percent, to 2,716.34, its biggest one-day decline since Oct. 13, 1989, when it fell 6.9 percent, or 190.58 points, to 2,569.26. Volume was 240 million shares, with declines exceeding advances by a ratio of roughly 6 to 1.
In Tokyo, the 225-share Nikkei average fell 916.23 points or 3.1 percent, to 28,599.53, yesterday. The average dropped quickly in the morning session again today but rebounded somewhat in the afternoon and closed down another 946.17 points or 3.31 percent, at 27,984.29. 
Yesterday's decline in New York followed a 55-point tumble in the Dow on Friday and an 88-point overall loss for last week.
The anxiety over inflation also caused a plunge in long-term Treasury prices. The yield of the benchmark 8.75 percent bond maturing in 2020 climbed to 8.79 percent, the highest in almost three months and nearly a quarter percentage point above Friday's close. As stock prices tumbled however, investors shifted funds to Treasury bills and other short-term investments, causing bill rates to fall to their lowest levels since 1988. [Page D14.] Oil stocks continued to move higher on the prospects of rising prices, while declining issues included transportation stocks, which are sensitive to oil prices, and utilities and banking issues, which are sensitive to higher interest rates.
Officials of the New York Stock Exchange held a briefing to calm concerns about how the exchange and its member firms withstood yesterday's sell-off.
Richard Torrenzano, an executive vice president of the Big Board, told reporters that all the computer systems for executing trades were operating without difficulty. He said that market ''circuit breakers,'' which delay or halt some trading in times of big declines, appeared to have steadied the market.
 
Confusion on Index Trading
Some traders asserted, however, that new rules made trading in stock index futures even more volatile than they otherwise would have been and left many traders confused because they were uncertain how markets would act after the rule went into effect. [Market Place, page D8.] At the opening of trading in New York, the stock market reacted swiftly to the sharply lower Asian and European markets. The beginning of trading in many stocks, including several of the 30 issues of the Dow Jones average, was delayed.
In the first few hours, the Dow average dropped more than 107 points, as rumors spread that Saudi Arabian troops were headed for the Kuwaiti border. The rumor was later denied by the Saudi Press Agency.
By noon, the market had recovered some earlier losses, but was still down more than 80 points on about 190 million shares traded. As volume slowed in the afternoon, the Dow lost only about 13 more points for the day.
Traders at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company noted that institutional investors, who normally trade in large blocks of stocks that require special handling, were active in the market but that there was no panic.
''There is scattered selling and the institutions are picking their spots to buy or sell,'' one trader said late in the day. ''The blocks are ordinary and there were none of any real size.''
Similarly, some brokerage firms reported that retail selling was busy, but not extraordinarily so. Declines were broad, with what are normally lower-volume stocks suffering as well as widely traded issues. On the American Stock Exchange, which includes many oil companies that rose in price because they are expected to benefit from higher oil prices, the index was off by only 1.83 percent, or 6.36 points, to 340.27. But the Nasdaq composite index fell 4.17 percent, or 17.42 points, to 400.04, its lowest level in more than a year. On March 20, 1989, it closed at 398.50.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index closed at 334.43, down 10.43 points, its lowest level since May 1, when it was 332.25.
The new ''circuit breaker'' rule on the Big Board, which was used for the first time on Friday, came into play again yesterday. When the Dow falls more than 50 points, the rule restricts traders who use computer programs to initiate sell orders. Such program traders are not permitted to sell stock on a downtick, which is when a stock's last sale is lower than the one before.
The rule is part of a package of measures the stock exchange approved earlier in the year to try to curb market volatility.
As a result of the those rules, there were far fewer program trades than normal yesterday. Program traders were in the market only twice, to buy and not to sell, said Birinyi Associates, which tracks such activity.
The effect of both trades added 21.04 points to the Dow. The first program, from 10:25 A.M. to 10:30 A.M., added 18.07 points, and another from 1.59 P.M. to 2:03 P.M. added 2.97.
 
Top 10 Gainers
Among the top 10 gainers on the Big Board yesterday were ARCO, up 3 1/2 to 137 1/8; Great Northern Iron, up 3, to 56 1/4; Oryx Energy, up 2 5/8, to 54 5/8, and Phillips Petroleum, up 1, to 82.
Some of the top losers included UAL, down 12 1/2, to 110. An employee-led buyout of the airline company is still reported to have financing problems, but there is speculation that the company's board may agree to extend by a day or two the Aug. 9 deadline for a financing package.
Walt Disney was down 7 1/8, to 102 3/8, following a recommendation by a First Boston analyst to hold instead of buy the stock because of lower projected 1991 per-share earnings.
If the economy slips into recession, entertainment stocks are considered among the first to be affected. Time Warner, another entertainment concern, hit a new low during the day of 83 5/8, closing down 6 3/8, to 83 3/4.
Phelps Dodge, the big mining company, closed down 5 1/8, to 62 5/8, and Warner-Lambert, the pharmaceuticals and consumer products company, closed down 5, at 62 1/2.
 
Tokyo Stocks Drop
By Reuters
TOKYO, Tuesday, Aug. 7 (Reuters) - Tokyo stocks regained in the afternoon some of the morning's sharp declines. Brokers said a flood of futures arbitrage-related index buying brought the Nikkei average of 225 stocks back up to 27,653.07, which was 946.46 points or 3.31 percent below Monday's close.
The average fell quickly after the opening, dropping 1,327.67 points at the midday recess over over fears that rising oil prices will cause serious problems for the oil-dependent Japanese economy.
Volume was a thin 150 million shares by midday, against 170 million on Monday morning. Volatility from light trading had already been exaggerating market declines in the two weeks before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait on Thursday drove up oil prices sharply.

HEADLINE: Talking Business; with Pfeiffer of Compaq;
The PC Surge In West Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The European Community's program to turn its 12 nations into a single market is creating a bonanza for makers of personal computers in general and for the Compaq Computer Corporation in particular. Analysts expect the Western European personal computer market to grow by as much as 25 percent this year - twice the pace of the more mature American market - as businesses try to improve their efficiency.
Compaq, which is based in Houston and is the second-largest personal computer company in Europe, behind only I.B.M., may do even better. Its European sales, which now account for about half of corporate sales, could total $1.8 billion or more this year, up at least 50 percent from last year's $1.17 billion. 
In a telephone interview from Boston, where he was talking to securities analysts, Eckhard Pfeiffer, the 48-year-old West German who is president of Compaq's Munich-based international operations, discussed his strategy for maintaining high growth in Europe.
Q. Compaq's European sales are growing two to three times as fast as the market. What is your secret?
A. We have been continually expanding our geographical marketing coverage and we're positioned in all the major growth product areas. We now have almost 1,500 dealers in Europe and they are in all countries in Western Europe. Although we have major accounts managers, we sell exclusively through our authorized dealers.
I.B.M. has a large dealer base but also sells directly, very much to the annoyance of dealers. So does Olivetti. It's an advantage for us and to their detriment. In most cases, an end user needs a whole range of hardware, software, service, training and supplies. No single hardware supplier can provide that.
Apple, which is now third in Europe, has tried to create a dealer network that handles Apple only. We believe very strongly that you have to provide a customer with more than one choice.
Q. How about your product line?
A. In PC's, we're in the high-performance segment, with our Deskpro machines based on Intel's 386 processor.
We're extremely well-positioned in laptops and have taken a strong position against Toshiba since 1988. Laptops, which account for 12 to 15 percent of the PC market in units, should be growing in the 70 percent range this year. And our Systempro computer, which has minicomputer capability and which is largely used for networks as file servers, is the highest-performing product on the market today.
Q. What kind of annual growth do you anticipate for the PC market in Western Europe?
A. We have a healthy economic climate in Western Europe, with the exception of the United Kingdom, and there's gigantic investment. We estimate the size of the market in 1990 will be six million units. It will continue to grow in the 20 percent range over the next three to four years, but that doesn't mean we have to slow to that level.
Q. How do you deal with the corporations that want a supplier who can service them on a pan-European basis?
A. If we're involved with a major account, we let the major account know which dealer is available to service it in the country required.
The dealer industry in Europe is very different from the industry in the United States, where almost 80 percent of distribution goes through chains. But Computerland is pretty well operational in all countries today. Businessland is trying. And we're beginning to see European channels made up of joint ventures - like the International Computer Group, a joint venture of British, French and German companies.
Q. How quickly do you see the PC market in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union developing?
A. We conservatively estimate that the industry may ship 250,000 to 300,000 units to Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union in 1990. It could be a 750,000 to one million market in 1991.
Given monetary union, East Germany will grow the fastest because it now has a hard currency to make investments and to create a free-market system. The second-largest opportunity is clearly Russia, although it obviously depends upon what happens politically and economically there.
Q. How are you trying to establish yourself in the East?
A. We now have about 18 dealers selling in East Germany. Robotron, the East Germany state computer company, is dissolving into many entities. We have been meeting with people in the parts that would be in the PC end but don't have final agreements at this time.
East Germany was firmly embedded as one of the major computer suppliers to the Comecon countries. That role has to be somewhat maintained. It is not going to happen with the old Robotron but with what is coming out of Robotron. We have already seen nice-sized orders coming in from East Germany that are going to be shipped out into other countries.
We recently announced our first dealer partners in Yugoslavia. We've started the dealer-selection process in Hungary. And we're beginning to establish contacts in Poland and Czechoslovakia.

HEADLINE: Commodity Chief Approved

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The Senate has approved the renomination of Wendy Lee Gramm as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.
By a voice vote on Saturday, the Senate confirmed Mrs. Gramm, who is 45 years old, as the top Federal regulator of the futures industry for a new five-year term. Mrs. Gramm became head of the agency under President Reagan in February 1988 and was renominated to the post by President Bush. She is an economist and the wife of Senator Phil Gramm, Republican of Texas.
 
One of the issues confronting
Mrs. Gramm is final Congressional action on legislation to reauthorize the commodity agency. The bill, which would increase the agency's budget and regulatory power, has been held up in the Senate because of a turf battle between the agency and the Securities and Exchange Commission over the regulation of stock index futures.
Mrs. Gramm also faces the challenge of intense industry opposition to the agency's proposed rule to restrict the practice of dual trading, in which a floor broker makes simultaneous trades both for customer accounts and for his or her own account, creating potentially serious conflicts of interest.

HEADLINE: U.S. Is Urged to Make Major Computer Effort

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The United States should undertake a major effort to develop superconducting computers that can operate a million times faster than today's fastest machines, a national panel recommends.
The recommendation is in a report now being completed by the National Commission on Superconductivity, a group of industry, academic and Government officials established by Congress in 1988 to advise it and the President on national strategies in superconductivity.
The full report, being sent to the President on Tuesday, has not been made public, but the executive summary has been released. 
The report said it should be possible, using superconductors, to develop a ''petaflop'' computer, capable of performing a million billion mathematical operations a second. The fastest supercomputers today now perform about a billion operations per second, which is known as a ''gigaflop.'' The term ''flop'' refers to a ''floating point operation,'' a type of arithmetic calculation.
Superconductors are materials that conduct electricity without losing energy through resistance. They could make possible extremely fast computers, super-efficient electricity generators and transmission systems and powerful electromagnets that could be used in such applications as trains that would float above their tracks magnetically and travel at high speeds. However, these applications will not be feasible for at least a decade, experts say.
Superconductivity could once be achieved only by freezing certain metal alloys to temperatures near absolute zero, about 460 degrees below zero Fahrenheit. New materials discovered several years ago are superconducting at temperatures as high as 235 degrees below zero Fahrenheit.
 
National Program Is Urged
The discovery of the ''high-temperature'' superconductors set off a flurry of work around the world and has led to numerous calls for a national program to help the United States stay competitive with the Japanese and Europeans.
The commission's report agrees in many ways with previous reports by a Presidential advisory panel known as the ''Wise Men'' and by the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment.
It states that the effort by American industry to exploit the new superconductors is ''insufficient, especially compared to Japan, where it is twice as large.'' High interest rates and unfavorable tax policy make it difficult for American companies to undertake projects that will only pay off in the distant future, if they pay off at all, the report says.
The report does not, however, recommend an increase in Federal financing, which it says is adequate. An increase in Federal money could not ''be spent sensibly at this point,'' David W. McCall, the commission chairman and head of the chemical research laboratory at the American Telephone and Telegraph Company's Bell Laboratories, said in an interview.
Instead of more money, the commission is recommending that superconductor research efforts be focused on two particular goals.
One is the development of the petaflop computer, which the report said would have broad uses in areas like weather prediction and aircraft design, as well as military uses like target identification and cryptography. Such a goal might be controversial because some computer experts think computers using conventional silicon chips are gaining in speed so quickly that superconducting computers, which require special refrigeration, might never be economically feasible.
The other goal is to develop wires made out of the high-temperature superconductors that would be suitable for use in motors, magnets, generators and energy storage systems. One big obstacle in harnessing the new superconductors is that they have been difficult to make into wires that are malleable enough and that carry enough current for practical uses.

HEADLINE: Productivity Rise First in Six Quarters

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 6

 BODY:
The productivity of American workers improved for the first time in six quarters, climbing in the second quarter at an annual rate of 1.6 percent, the Labor Department said today.
Analysts said they were encouraged by the gain in nonfarm productivity - defined as output per hour of work - especially in light of recent data showing rising unemployment and stagnant economic growth.
''It's one tiny bright spot in the midst of a lot of negatives,'' said David Jones, an economist with Aubrey G. Lanston & Company. 
But economists said the 1.6 percent gain was still below the level needed to lift the standard of living of Americans sharply and improve the nation's ability to compete.
 
Jump in Hourly Labor Costs
They also were disturbed by the report's findings on hourly labor costs, an important measure of inflation for businesses. Those costs rose at an annual rate of 5.6 percent in the second quarter of 1990, well above the 3 percent rise for all of 1989.
''The inflation numbers for the rest of the year look horrible, especially with the shock of the Middle East oil crisis,'' said Michael K. Evans, who heads a Washington economic forecasting firm.
The productivity rise in the second quarter was the first increase since productivity climbed five-tenths of a percent in the final quarter of 1988, the Labor Department said.
Although the report offered good news on the performance of American workers in the April-June period, the department said revised figures for last year showed productivity actually fell three-tenths of a percent rather than increased nine-tenths, as first reported.
 
Worst Since 1981-82 Recession
The poor 1989 showing was the worst since nonfarm productivity dropped nine-tenths of a percent in the 1981-82 recession, the Government said.
The report showed that from April to June, the number of hours Americans worked fell by a tenth of a percent, a likely sign that workers were being laid off in the face of slower economic growth and businesses were not hiring as many new workers, analysts said.
In revising numbers for the first quarter of 1990, the agency offered slightly better figures, saying productivity fell 1.9 percent rather than the 2.7 percent plunge first reported.
Today's report showed that unit labor costs, a key gauge of future price inflation, rose 3.9 percent for the April-June period, compared with a 3.3 percent increase in all of 1989.

HEADLINE: Dollar Loses Draw as Safe Haven in Time of Crisis

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The dollar, a longtime haven for investors in times of military and political crisis, has been all but shunned since Iraq invaded Kuwait.
Stock and bond markets around the world dropped sharply yesterday, and news reports indicated that Iraq had taken American hostages and may be building up forces along the Saudi Arabian border. But the dollar did not rise against the major European currencies; in New York it actually fell at one point below its lowest post-World War II close against the German mark of 1.57. [Page D16.] The dollar rose only against the Japanese yen. But the yen has been weaker than the dollar all year, and its fall yesterday was considered a flight from the yen, not a retreat to the dollar. 
''I don't think the dollar has any safe-haven attractiveness right now,'' said Claude Tygier, a foreign exchange specialist, partly because of the unattractiveness of the United States economy right now.
Neal M. Soss, chief economist at the First Boston Corporation, added, ''If you call this a flight to quality, you have to call it a flight to the Deutsche mark.''
 
No Big Flight to Gold
Gold has also lost a little of its luster as a haven. It rose $7.30 an ounce yesterday, to $384.70 in New York, but that is still below the high of $386 it reached on the day of the invasion, when it jumped $12.
''If you are sitting here in the West, gold is not necessarily the safe haven,'' said Ian C. MacDonald, manager of precious metals at Credit Suisse in New York. ''But still, for many countries in the third world, it is the only safe haven they've got.''
The fall of stock and bond markets yesterday, which was worldwide, was a response to rising oil prices, which were pushed even higher by the growing embargo on buying Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. The higher oil prices, if they are maintained, will increase inflation and cause the rate of economic growth to slow as discretionary spending is reduced. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, oil rose $3.56 a barrel, to $28.05.
Long-term interest rates around the world are also rising sharply in anticipation of higher inflation, which is another blow for stock markets.
In Japan, which imports virtually all its oil, the Nikkei 225 index of the Tokyo stock exchange yesterday slid 916.23 points, or 3.1 percent, to 28,599.53 and continued to fall today. At yesterday's close, the index, which was tumbling before the invasion, was down 13.5 percent since July 19 and just above its low for the year of 28,002.07, set April 2. But volume was thin, at 330 million shares, which some traders said indicated that the selling was not done in panic. Interest rates on Japan's benchmark 10-year bond rose 26 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.96 percent.
In Hong Kong, the decline was even steeper, with the Hang Seng Index down 248 points, or 7.42 percent. In Germany, the DAX index dropped 100.01 points, or 5.4 percent, hitting its low for the year of 1,740.93. The yield on Germany's 10-year bond rose 10 basis points, to 8.88 percent.
In France, the blue-chip index, known as the CAC-40, fell 5.12 percent, to its lowest close of the year at 1,773.79. The FTSE-100 index in London faired a little better, falling only 64 points, or 2.82 percent, while the yield on the 10-year gilt, its benchmark bond, rose 30 basis points, to 11.88 percent.
Even in Norway, where oil revenues account for about a quarter of the economic growth, the stock market fell 5.2 percent because of the fear of inflation rising worldwide and slowing economic growth, traders said.
One of the main reasons for the apparent change in attitude about the dollar as a haven is that the United States economic situation, especially with a sharp rise in oil prices, is all negative for the dollar.
Virtually all recent economic statistics suggest that a recession is now more likely, which would mean lower interest rates as the Federal Reserve seeks to avoid an even sharper economic decline. Lower rates and a recession both make dollar-denominated investments less attractive. Higher oil prices also mean rising inflation, another negative for the dollar. And with an energy tax increase a less likely alternative for reducing the Federal budget deficit, the nagging deficit issue looks much harder to resolve.
By contrast, the outlook in Germany is much healthier, even counting the rise in oil prices. The economy is growing and there is general confidence that the Bundesbank, the nation's central bank, will work to restrain the impact of inflation from the unification of the two Germanys and a lasting oil price increase. And because of higher oil prices, the Bundesbank is considered even more likely now to raise interest rates, which will make the mark even more attractive than it is now.
''It seems unlikely that the Germans will face any significant policy dilemma,'' said John Lipsky, director of international bond research for Salomon Brothers in London.
Mr. Tygier, foreign exchange specialist, said that another reason for the apparentchange in attitude toward the dollar is the relative ease and speed with which money can be moved around the world now because of deregulation of many markets.
Mr. Lipsky said that the United States still has the characteristics of a haven currency: a very large and open market and political stability. But he said that the markets in other countries, like West Germany and Switzerland, have grown and are beginning to make them alternative havens.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Continues Its Slide On Interest Rate Concerns

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar lost more ground yesterday against all primary foreign currencies except the Japanese yen amid speculation that recent signs of economic weakness will lead to lower United States interest rates.
But the drop was tempered by uncertainties about Iraq's occupation of its neighbor in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait. Those worries made some traders reluctant to push the dollar lower. 
The dollar moved sharply lower as trading began in the United States. The currency fell toward its lowest level in more than two years against the West German mark, but later recovered somewhat as rumors swirled about what might happen overnight in the Gulf.
''This is all emotional trading,'' said Liliana Nealon, the first vice president in the New York office of the Union Bank of Switzerland.
She said the traders expected interest rates to fall in the United States in the wake of last week's unemployment report that indicated that the economy might be headed toward a recession, increasing chances that the Federal Reserve would encourage lower interest rates.
But Ms. Nealon said the traders also feared that an eruption of new military action in the Persian Gulf could drive the dollar higher because many investors viewed it as the safest to hold during international turmoil.
President Bush said on Sunday that he was ''ruling out nothing at all,'' including a military blockade, to choke off Iraqi trade, in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last Thursday.
The invasion has led to sharply higher oil prices around the world, and the dollar gained against the Japanese yen yesterday, largely because the Japanese economy is considered vulnerable to increases in oil prices. Japan depends almost entirely on imported oil.
By the end of trading yesterday in New York, the dollar had risen to 150.35 yen, up from 149.925 yen late Friday. Earlier, the dollar rose to close at 149.50 yen in Tokyo, from 149.35 yen on Friday. In London, the currency rose to 149.55 yen.
But the dollar lost ground against the British pound. In New York, the pound rose to $1.8725, from $1.85375 late Friday. In London, the pound rose to $1.8725, from $1.8570 late Friday.
The American currency also fell against the German mark, falling to 1.57875 marks, from 1.5935 marks late Friday. That approached the lowest level for the dollar since it reached an intraday low of 1.5615 marks on Jan. 4, 1988.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with those of late on Friday, included: 1.3310 Swiss francs, down from 1.3505; 5.2890 French francs, down from 5.3415; 1,154.50 Italian lire, down from 1,166.00, and 1.14955 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15125.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Fears of Escalating Inflation Spark a Rise in Gold Prices

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Gold futures prices rose yesterday on New York's Commodity Exchange, reflecting continuing fears that the soaring price of crude oil -now at the highest level in more than four and a half years - will lead to higher inflation.
On other commodity markets, grain and soybean futures rose, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
Gold futures settled $7.30 to $7.80 higher in New York with the contract for August delivery at $384.70 an ounce; silver ended 5 cents to 5.7 cents higher, with September at $4.92. 
On the New York Mercantile Exchange, West Texas Intermediate crude oil finished $1 to $3.56 higher, with September at $28.05 a barrel, the highest settlement for a near-month crude oil contract since the latter half of 1985; heating oil futures settled 3 cents to 8.97 cents higher, with September at 75.55 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 3 cents to 9.34 cents higher, with September at 81.52 cents a gallon.
Strength in petroleum and precious metals was enhanced yesterday by a fear that Iraq's occupation of Kuwait could draw the United States into a Middle East war.
Analysts said the gold market was thinly traded and seemed to have encountered strong resistance near a bid of $385 an ounce. They said the market's next move would probably depend on overnight developments in the Middle East.
Grain and soybean futures rose on the Chicago Board of Trade, paced by sharp gains in corn and soybeans as the crude oil and gold rises stoked inflation fears.
Crude's gains also sparked speculation that the Soviet Union, which exports oil to European countries, might soon have more money for grain imports, said Joel Karlin, a grain-market analyst with Research Department Inc. in Chicago.
After the close, the Agriculture Department released weekly crop-progress statistics, showing slight deterioration in the condition of the soybean crop and slight improvement in the corn crop's condition, although both crops remained in mostly good-to-excellent shape.
Crop development continued to lag far behind the normal pace, a function of the heavy spring rains that delayed planting in some areas.

HEADLINE: BUSH SENDS U.S. FORCE TO SAUDI ARABIA AS KINGDOM AGREES TO CONFRONT IRAQ; Seeks Joint Action

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7 

 BODY:
Declaring that Iraqi forces massed in Kuwait posed an imminent threat to Saudi Arabia, the United States today ordered thousands of paratroopers, an armored brigade and jet fighters to the Middle Eastern kingdom, officials said.
 Declaring that Iraqi forces massed in Kuwait posed an imminent threat to Saudi Arabia, the United States today ordered thousands of paratroopers, an armored brigade and jet fighters to the Middle Eastern kingdom, officials said.
 An American military official said tonight that Egypt had agreed to join a multinational force with the United States, giving the operation an international Arab presence that Washington considers critical. The Bush Administration has also approached some of the gulf states, Morocco and Pakistan to seek their involvement, the official said. An Egyptian Defense Ministry official in Cairo denied that his country was sending troops to Saudi Arabia. 
 It was not clear tonight exactly how many American troops were moving to Saudi Arabia or whether this would be just the initial deployment of a larger force. The contingent, estimated at between 6,000 and 15,000, was assembled after King Fahd of Saudi Arabia gave his final permission to President Bush, officials said.


Saudis to Raise Oil Output
 In addition to the military movements, the Iraqi Government was confronted today by a Saudi decision to increase its daily pumping of oil by two million barrels, a figure that represents half the total production of Iraq and Kuwait. Other oil producers are also expected to follow suit, forcing down prices that have risen sharply since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Thursday.
 The military contingent is considered too small to conduct a full-scale war with the forces of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. It could not do much more than slow an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia.
 But it appeared sufficient to give the Saudi Government the military and political backing that King Fahd needed to resist pressures to support a fellow Arab leader. The King chose the side of Mr. Bush and the extraordinary coalition of Western nations, Japan and the Soviet Union.


Bush to Address Nation
 Administration officials said the President plans to address the nation in a televised speech Wednesday at 9 A.M., after the troops are in place.
 In making the riskiest move of his Presidency by sending American soldiers to a region that has proven a quagmire for other Presidents, Mr. Bush was taking the perilous gamble that Mr. Hussein would be frozen in his current position. But the clear danger was that the Iraqi leader's response would be military in nature.
 Mr. Hussein has staked his future on the military adventure in Kuwait, and to retreat from the occupied emirate now would mean forsaking his newly bolstered position in the Middle Eastern power balance, abandoning an attempt to grab control of the world oil market and jeopardizing his political existence at home in Baghdad.
 The military deployment drew quick support from Democratic and Republican lawmakers after Mr. Bush notified Congressional leaders this morning.
 The deployment was part of a two-pronged international assault on the occupation of Kuwait that escalated today with a steady tightening of economic sanctions. Turkey cut off the flow of oil from one of two Iraqi pipelines, and Bush Administration officials indicated that Saudi Arabia was expected to do the same with the other pipeline in addition to boosting its daily oil output to help offset any cuts in the world supply.
 These actions climaxed a diplomatic offensive by the United States that has included dozens of telephone calls by Mr. Bush to other world leaders. Senator Bob Dole, the minority leader, said he understood that the military aid to Saudi Arabia ''is going to be a big multinational force'' with ''a lot of contributors.''
 The deployment capped an apparently successful mission by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney to Saudi Arabia and to Egypt, where he reportedly secured permission for an American aircraft carrier to sail through the Suez Canal.


Some U.S. Units Arrive
 But the exact sequence of events was unclear. The arrival of some American military units in Saudi Arabia today suggested that Mr. Bush may have already persuaded the Saudi King to join his military showdown with Mr. Hussein and that Mr. Cheney's mission had served only to make the arrangements final. Mr. Bush had spoken to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt and to King Fahd in recent days.
 For his part, Mr. Hussein vowed today to resist the growing foreign pressure, which includes a worldwide trade ban imposed by the United Nations on Monday. Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said that in a ''very difficult and very negative'' two-hour meeting on Monday, Mr. Hussein told the highest-ranking American diplomat in Iraq, charge d'affaires Joseph Wilson, that ''he had no intention of leaving Kuwait and had every intention of staying and claiming it as his own.''
 By this evening, the White House was maintaining silence on troop movements to Saudi Arabia. After making daily appearances to discuss the Kuwait crisis in recent days, Mr. Bush remained out of the public view apart from two brief appearances in which he refused to take questions or make any statements.
 Mr. Fitzwater said the United States had information from Kuwait ''showing that the Iraqi forces are there in considerable quantity and they are in an offensive posture.'' He added, ''There is an imminent threat to Saudi Arabia from the way that they are positioned and located in Kuwait.''


Iraqi Troops Near Border
 Administration officials have said that there are between 100,000 and 120,000 Iraqi troops in Kuwait and that Iraq has been concentrating large portions of that force on the southern border with Saudi Arabia. Mr. Fitzwater declined to provide details on the Iraqi movements but said, ''There have been changes of a sort that cause us to believe there is a growing and continuous threat to Saudi Arabia.''
 Opening a Cabinet meeting today, Mr. Bush told his top advisers that the United States had made clear to Saudi Arabia that the threat posed to its security by the Iraqi troops on its border was also a threat to the national security of the United States, Mr. Fitzwater said.
 The United States intelligence information indicating an impending threat from Iraq, the assurance of American military backing and the participation of other nations appeared to be the final elements that secured Saudi Arabia's agreement to allow the stationing of foreign troops on its soil.
 If the reports of Egyptian and Moroccan involvement were true, that would have lent even more weight to the effort to persuade King Fahd to join in an American military operation.
 As air and land forces headed for Saudi Arabia, the Dwight D. Eisenhower, a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier, was steaming toward the Suez Canal with its 12 escort ships. Administration officials said Egypt had agreed to allow the carrier to pass through the canal tonight, enabling it to join the carrier Independence and its accompanying vessels, which were taking up position in the northern Arabian Sea, where its jets would be within striking distance of Iraq.


Blockade of Oil Shipments
 Another carrier group, the Saratoga's, accompanied by 2,100 marines and the battleship Wisconsin, left Florida today on a 10-day voyage to the Mediterranean. Those ships would be used to blockade Iraqi oil shipments if such action was needed to enforce the United Nations sanctions, which ban all purchase of Iraqi commodities, including oil.
 France and Britain also have been bolstering their naval presence in the area as officials from both countries said they were prepared to join a blockade if necessary.
 Because of their fears about how Mr. Hussein might respond to military moves against him, the United States and other Western countries worked frantically today to speed the departure of their citizens from Iraq and Kuwait. The United States said 39 Americans who had been missing were safe in Iraq but were being held against their will in a Baghdad hotel while diplomats worked to secure their release.
 Reflecting the tension of the diplomatic contacts, Mr. Fitzwater took care not to characterize the Americans in Baghdad as ''hostages'' and refused to say what steps were being taken to gain their release.
 News reports from the region said an Iraqi Airways plane carrying Japanese citizens and other foreign nationals landed in Amman, Jordan, today. Meanwhile, Britain worked to open land routes from Baghdad to Turkey and Jordan so private citizens and non-essential diplomats could flee Iraq.
 Armed with the United Nations sanctions, the international community tightened its economic chokehold on Iraq. The Turkish Government agreed to seal off the flow of Iraqi oil at twin pipelines that terminate at the Turkish coast.
 Bush Administration officials also indicated that Saudi Arabia was expected to take similar action to shut down the other major pipeline out of Iraq, which crosses its territory.


Pipeline Flow Reduced
 The pipelines had been carrying about 1.6 million barrels of oil a day, more than half of Iraq's total exports of 3 million barrels a day, but the Iraqis began reducing the flow significantly on Monday, a move the United States attributed to a slash in demand that grew out of an international boycott of Iraqi oil.
 After a meeting between King Fahd of Saudi Arabia and Mr. Cheney, who presented American intelligence reports indicating that Iraq seemed on the verge of attacking Saudi Arabia, Administration officials said the Saudis also agreed to increase their oil production by two million barrels a day.
 That would offset some of the reduction in the world supply caused by the boycott and thus cut into one of Mr. Hussein's primary goals - taking control of oil production and driving up prices to replenish his country's treasury, which was drained by a decade-long war with Iran. It also would take some heat off the Bush Administration, which is under pressure from Congress to use strategic petroleum reserves to counter rising gasoline prices.
 The United States Justice Department has launched an investigation of those price increases to determine whether they were justified by rising prices for crude oil or violated antitrust laws.
 After his meeting with King Fahd, Mr. Cheney flew to Egypt, where he met with President Hosni Mubarak in hopes of securing his country's aid, including the passage of the Eisenhower through the Suez Canal. Mr. Cheney then flew to Morocco to continue his quick round of diplomatic contacts. #20 Calls to 12 Leaders In Washington, Mr. Fitzwater said Mr. Bush's telephone contacts with world leaders had accelerated to one almost every hour. He said the President had made 20 telephone calls to 12 different leaders over three or four days, in addition to regular meetings with his top advisers and a luncheon today with William Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence.
 Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d was to fly to Ankara, Turkey, today to meet with President Turgut Ozal. After that, he was to fly to Brussels for a meeting of the foreign ministers of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
 On Capitol Hill, although there was no formal announcement of the military deployment by the White House, several Democratic lawmakers issued statements backing Mr. Bush's decision.
 ''I fully support the President's deployment of U.S. forces to Saudi Arabia,'' said Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. ''I hope the nation will rally behind him.''
 Senator Christopher J. Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut, called it ''the right move.''
 ''It's entirely appropriate for us to work with our allies around the world and nations in the region to isolate Iraq politically and economically and put military pressure on Saddam Hussein to leave Kuwait,'' he said.
 Senator Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who chairs the Senate Armed Services Committee, was in Georgia tonight and said he had no direct knowledge of the military moves. But he said he thought that a limited American military operation in Saudi Arabia would draw Congressional support if it was backed by Arab nations.
 ''My hope is that we'll continue to confine our role to protecting air bases'' and perhaps using American troops to mine highways from Kuwait on which Iraq might send tanks into Saudi Arabia, he said.


Predicting Iraqi Reaction
 He said Iraq would take Saudi Arabia's agreement to station foreign troops on its soil and raise oil production ''as a virtual declaration of war.''
 In the Middle East late tonight, Saudi Arabia and four other members of the Gulf Cooperation Council issued a call for Iraqi troops to leave Kuwait and refused to recognize what they called the ''puppet'' government installed by Baghdad in Kuwait.
 The move was politically important because it put an Arab stamp on the efforts against Iraq, in an attempt to prevent Mr. Hussein from casting them as the work of ''foreigners'' seeking to subjugate Arabs.
 Saudi Arabia, which had been notably quiet until today, also gave other indications of a stiffened resolve. Its tightly controlled press openly criticized the Iraqi invasion for the first time, and King Fahd was shown on television meeting with the exiled Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, and other members of his ruling family.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
U.S. and the Soviets as Allies: It's the First Time Since 1945

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Aug. 7

 BODY:
In the five days since Iraq occupied Kuwait, the Soviet Union and the United States have begun testing a new working relationship that is without precedent since the outset of the cold war.
Their remarkable joint venture in foreign policy began last Friday when Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and Foreign Minister Eduard A. Shevardnadze emerged from an airport meeting here to call for a worldwide arms embargo against Iraq.
By today, Bush Administration officials were indicating that the United States was prepared to invite the Soviet Union to join any international naval force assembled to enforce sanctions against Iraq. [Page A8.] More-Low Key Approach ''For the first time since World War II, we are virtually acting as allies,'' said Maksim A. Yusin, who has been covering the story for the Soviet Government newspaper Izvestia. 
Moscow's approach to the crisis has been more low-key than Washington's.
While the United States has pressed for the most sweeping United Nations embargo in history against Iraq, the Soviet Union initially favored holding some sanctions in reserve.
 
Meetings With Iraqis
While the United States has flaunted its military potential, a Soviet spokesman cautioned today against ''muscle-flexing'' and played down the Soviet decision to dispatch a destroyer and an antisubmarine ship to the Persian Gulf to protect Soviet merchant ships.
While the White House has reportedly contemplated ways to unseat the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, Moscow has met regularly with Iraqi officials here and in Baghdad, in hopes of keeping a dialogue open with its erstwhile client.
But behind such tactical differences is a degree of coordination that is all the more significant because the Middle East has long been an arena of superpower rivalry.
Throughout the crisis, the two countries have kept in frequent contact in Washington, Moscow and New York.

Yesterday Mr. Baker and Mr. Shevardnadze talked by phone for half an hour, discussing the plight of their citizens trapped in region and agreeing to support strict sanctions in the United Nations Security Council. Today Jack F. Matlock, the American Ambassador in Moscow, paid a call on the Foreign Ministry to discuss the gulf conflict.
Soviet officials have publicly ruled out joint Soviet-American military actions against Iraq, but they have suggested that they do not consider a blockade of the Persian Gulf to fall into the same category, and as a rule the Kremlin is a strong supporter of international peacekeeping efforts.
Mr. Yusin, the Izvestia correspondent, said he believed the Soviet Union would cooperate in an international naval blockade if such a strategy had United Nations approval.
 
A Contrast to the Past'
''If it is done under the flag of the United Nations, the Soviet Union might participate,'' Mr. Yusin said in an interview. ''But it is my personal feeling, based on some informal conversations, that they would do it only under the U.N. flag.''
At a news conference today, Yuri Gremitskikh, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said as far as he knew the Americans had not made a proposal to Moscow, and he declined to speculate on the possible response.
The relatively sanguine Kremlin attitude toward American military activity in the gulf is a startling contrast to the past, when Moscow regularly denounced American maneuvers as provocative.
 
Criticism Avoided
Soviet officials have deliberately avoided criticizing the United States for sending warships to the gulf. There has been no Soviet comment so far on the deployment of American forces to Saudi Arabia.
In a briefing for Soviet reporters yesterday, First Deputy Foreign Minister Aleksandr M. Belonogov suggested that the United States might intervene militarily if Iraq moved against Saudi Arabia or threatened American citizens.
Mr. Yusin, one of the correspondents present, said Mr. Belonogov declined to answer questions about how the Soviet Union might react, but ''we got the feeling that the Soviet Union would give moral support to such action.''
 
A Shift in Strategy
Moscow's approach to the Iraq-Kuwait conflict follows logically from its shifting strategy in the Middle East over the Past two years.
Where in the past the Kremlin sought to project its influence into the region largely through client states like Iraq and Libya, more recently it has courted pro-Western Arab countries, Iran, and even Israel.
The overriding Soviet interests now, officials there say, are stability in a region so close to their borders, and acceptance by the industrialized capitalist nations, with the attendant economic benefits.
''Countries like Iraq or Libya, extremist forces headed by dictators, play a destabilizing role in the region,'' said Mr. Yusin. ''Although we are still connected with these states by treaties of friendship and cooperation, we have less and less in common with them.''
 
Moscow Seeks Investments
Moreover, while Iraq is regarded increasingly here as an expensive deadbeat - its debts to Moscow for arms sales are estimated at $20 billion -Moscow has had high hopes that moderate, pro-Western Arab states, including Kuwait, would invest in the anemic Soviet economy.
Soviet commentators and Western diplomats cite several reasons why Moscow has been more low-key than the United States in its response to Iraq, aside from a general distaste in the current leadership - and the Soviet public - for military action.
One is the hope that the Soviet Union may yet be able to exert some influence or play a mediating role if it is not quick to sever its longstanding ties to Baghdad.
Soviet and Arab officials said Baghdad had so far flatly rejected Kremlin pressure, but Yuri Glukhov, the Middle East specialist for Pravda, wrote today that Moscow was ready ''to render any possible cooperation to the sides in the Iraq-Kuwait conflict.''
 
Soviet Citizens in Kuwait and Iraq
Soviet officials said their initial decision to suspend arms sales to Iraq and to join the United States in promoting sanctions was a difficult one, suggesting that it may have encountered some resistance within the leadership.
Moscow is also clearly nervous about the fate of nearly 900 Soviet citizens in Kuwait and about 8,000 in Iraq - including crews that maintain oil equipment and about 1,000 military advisers.
Another factor is that Moscow does not want to get too far ahead of Arab governments or to jeopardize its standing in the Islamic world, which depends to some extent on not seeming too eager to please the United States or its major ally in the region, Israel.
''For the Soviet Union, it would be a little premature to go against dominant opinion in the Arab countries and enter too direct an alliance with the United States,'' said Stanislav Kondrashev, the influential commentator for Izvestia, in an interview.
 
'Our Enlightened Interests
Despite the differences, Mr. Kondrashev said he believed Soviet-American cooperation had already helped speedily mobilize world opinion, brought some pressure on Arab countries to support sanctions and lent credibility to the Soviet efforts to forge a new relationship with the West.
''It underlines what is the most important thing for the Soviet Union is to have this kind of cooperation with Western countries,'' he said. ''It is a matter of our enlightened interests.''
''True, you cannot say that Soviet and American interests coincide in the Middle East,'' added Mr. Yusin. ''But I think we have passed a critical moment: now we cannot say that our interests and American interests there are opposed.''

HEADLINE: BUSH SENDS U.S. FORCE TO SAUDI ARABIA AS KINGDOM AGREES TO CONFRONT IRAQ;
Bush's Aim's: Deter Attack, Send a Signal

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The American troops and planes being sent to Saudi Arabia tonight are intended to be part of a broad international force designed to deter an Iraqi attack on Saudi oilfields and to intimidate President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
The first United States contingent is not large enough to take on the million-member Iraqi Army. More than 100,000 Iraqi troops are in Kuwait. But Pentagon officials said the force could be considerably augmented if the need should arise.
The move ordered by President Bush is plainly intended to demonstrate that any Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia would mean a direct confrontation with the United States, a confrontation that would bring the full weight of American military force against Iraq from bases around the world and aircraft carriers deployed in the region. 
Moreover, by deploying the American troops as part of what is intended to be an international force, Washington has sent a signal that such an attack would put Baghdad in conflict with Western nations other than the United States as well as some Arab states.
A military official said tonight that the United States had contacted Egypt, Morocco, Pakistan, and Persian Gulf states about participating in the international ground force. He said that Egypt has agreed to make forces available. An American miltiary official said that he had been told that the Egyptian contribution is said to be 2,000 to 3,000 men, but details about Egypt's role were sketchy. An Egyptian Defense Ministry official in Cairo earlier denied that his country was sending troops to Saudi Arabia.
 
A Light, Flexible Force
An Administration official described the initial complement of American forces as a light, flexible force.
It was unclear tonight precisely how many American ground troops were being rushed to Saudi Arabia by air as well as sea. Estimates ranged from 6,000 to 15,000.
Military officials said that the initial deployment involved a brigade from the 82d Airborne Division, to be sent by air from Fort Bragg, N.C; a brigade from the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division at Fort Stewart, Ga., including tanks and armored personnel carriers, to be sent by sea, and elements of the 101st Airborne Division of helicopter-borne troops, to be sent by air from Fort Campbell, Ky. An Army paratroop brigade consists of about 2,000 men.
Pentagon officials said the function of the paratroopers will be to protect the air bases.
The Air Force is sending two squadrons of F-15 fighter planes as well as AWACS radar surveillance planes. There are 24 planes in an Air Force squadron. One American official said some F-16 fighters would also be dispatched, but this could not be confirmed.
To shore up the defense of Saudi Arabia, the Navy is deploying a second aircraft carrier in the northern Arabian Sea within striking distance of Iraq. This will be done by sending the aircraft carrier Eisenhower from the Eastern Mediterranean through the Suez Canal this evening, a movement that was approved by the Egyptians as Defense Secretary Dick Cheney visited that country today.
The carrier Saratoga, which left Mayport, Fla., today, will take the Eisenhower's place in the Mediterranean. The Saratoga is accompanied by the battleship Wisconsin and ships carrying the 26th Marine Expeditionary Unit based at Camp Lejeune, N.C.
Navy ships full of supplies stationed at Diego Garcia, an island in the Indian Ocean, are also steaming toward the gulf.
A headquarters for the Central Command, the successor for the Rapid Deployment Force created by President Carter, has been established in Saudi Arabia. #65,700 Saudi Troops The American troops are intended to be part of an international air, land and sea force, which officials hope will include a sizable Arab as well as Western European component. Mr. Cheney flew today from Saudi Arabia to Egypt and then Morocco, consulting with Arab leaders about an Arab role in the multinational force.
The American troops and whatever other foreign contingents are sent will join a Saudi force of about 65,700 troops, many of whom are mercenaries from Pakistan. The Saudis possess considerable technological strength in the air, with advanced AWACS radar-surveillance planes to monitor troop and air movements and squadrons of American-made F-15 warplanes manned by United States-trained pilots. Hawk surface-to-air missiles are the mainstay of the Saudis' air defense network.
A Bush Administration spokesman, reflecting the uncertainty over Iraq's reaction to the move as well as Washington's continuing quest for international partners, declined to say precisely how large the American troop presence in Saudi Arabia would be.
A senior Administration official said the purpose of the international troop deployment was to land a force ''sizable enough to give the Iraqis pause, but not enough to kick them out'' of Kuwait.
By deploying an initial ground force, supported by American warplanes and aircraft carrier groups, the official said the United States strategy was to ''show our commitment'' and gauge Mr. Hussein's reaction in the next day or two.
 
Saudis to Raise Production
Representative Les Aspin, the Wisconsin Democrat who chairs the House Armed Services Committee, said that the deployment ''discourages Iraq from doing the wrong thing militarily and encourages the Saudis to do the right thing economically.'' Saudi Arabia has agreed to increase oil production by 2 million barrels a day to compensate for the shortage caused by the sanctions against Iraq.
''A brigade of 3,000 men is not going to hold the line against the Iraqi Republican Guard force of seven divisions,'' Mr. Aspin added, referring to the American Army units dispatched today. ''But it establishes a presence across the line in Kuwait. If Iraq attacks across the line now, it is at war with the United States and that is a different story,'' Mr. Aspin added.
Thomas L. McNaugher, a military specialist at the Brookings Institution, added that the American deployment was intended to reassure Saudi Arabia that any attack would precipitate a war with the United States.
''It is the kind of force that you would want to move in initially but just the beginning of the kind of force that you would want to move in if you were encountering a full-scale Iraqi armored attack,'' said Mr. McNaugher.
 
For a War, More Force
He added that a full-scale war with Iraq would require more ''heavy'' American ground forces and more fighter planes. ''A force adequate to that task could involve two heavy divisions and 10 or 12 air wings,'' he said. An air wing includes 72 planes. In addition to its forces in Kuwait, Iraq is said to have moved several divisions normally deployed close to the border with Iran toward Kuwait and has ordered a mobilization of its reserves.
Iraqi aircraft have been deployed in airfields in southern Iraq. Iraq's air force possesses Exocet anti-ship missiles and Iraq may have acquired more of the weapons from Kuwaiti stockpiles, intelligence reports say.
According to classified intelligence reports, Iraq has been observed loading chemical bombs onto aircraft. American officials believe that the operations were performed in full view of American spy satellites to send a threatening message to the United States and Saudi Arabia.
 
U.S. Firepower Formidable
American analysts say an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia would probably involved two army corps. An army corps includes at least two divisions, and each division at least 10,000 men. One armored push would be made along the coast, while the other would be directed at the Saudi capital at Riyadh.
The American deployment, though relatively small, still leaves the United States with formidable firepower.
Pentagon officials said a group of F-111 fighter bombers, normally based in England, were in Turkey on Monday participating in a previously scheduled NATO exercise. That put the airplanes, which were once used to bomb targets in Libya, easily within striking distance of Iraq and Kuwait.
The movement of a second aircraft carrier to the northern Arabian Sea means that Navy attack planes are in a better position to defend Saudi territory and do not have to fly over other Arab states.
France and Britain are augmenting their small force in the region. The French have put an aircraft carrier based on Toulon, near Marseilles, on alert and a French destroyer is steaming toward the gulf to join two French ships already deployed there. The British are also deploying three ships in the region.

HEADLINE: BUSH SENDS U.S. FORCE TO SAUDI ARABIA AS KINGDOM AGREES TO CONFRONT IRAQ;
Saudis Make a Stand

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, Aug. 7

 BODY:
By allowing American troops to land on its territory and increasing its oil production, Saudi Arabia tonight proclaimed what it has been reluctant to say openly for decades: that its interests lie with the West.
Until it agreed to lend open support to those willing to confront President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and challenge his buildup of troops on its borders, the Saudi Government had gone to great lengths to avoid accusations by more powerful and more militant Arab countries that it is an American client-state.
The action also represents a watershed for the rest of the Arab world. A number of other countries, like Morocco, Bahrain and Tunisia as well as the small Emirates of the Persian Gulf, may now be less bashful about flaunting their close but concealed strategic, military and political links with the United States.
The Saudis and their Arab gulf allies concluded that there was little room for compromise with Iraq over its invasion of Kuwait and the implications of doom it carried for other ruling families in the gulf region. 
''We are at the point where we have no choice but to stand up to Saddam,'' said a senior Saudi official, who asked not to be identified. ''If we were to allow the status quo to remain, there is little question we would be next on Iraq's list.''
Arab officials and oil industry experts in the region asserted that the realignment precipitated by the Iraqi invasion would produce other important changes in the politics and economies of the Middle East, affecting efforts to resolve the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, oil prices and production levels and the future of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
The Saudi official said the concept of ''Arab solidarity'' often invoked by Arab leaders to keep Western powers out of the region was fading for Saudi Arabia and its gulf allies.
The Saudi stand solidified after the failure to forge an Arab League consensus on the crisis because of the explicit support given the Iraqi President by King Hussein of Jordan, Yasir Arafat of the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the leaders of Yemen and Libya.
''There are many elements in the Arab world which want to see the demise of all Arab regimes in the gulf,'' the official added. ''We have to look elsewhere for support.''
Several other Arab gulf and Egyptian officials said in interviews over the last three days that the pro-Iraqi stand of King Hussein and Mr. Arafat was so offensive that neither would get ''a single dollar in aid'' in the future, in the words of a Arab gulf Cabinet minister.
''The governments of the gulf region have washed their hands of Saddam, Arafat and King Hussein,'' said the official, who asked not to be identified.
 
Where They Stand
After an initial period of hesitation after the invasion of Kuwait on Thursday morning, the Governments of Saudi Arabia and its gulf oil-producing allies as well as those of Egypt and Morocco are now unconditional in their condemnation of Iraq through their official newspapers and radio broadcasts, asserting that they will accept nothing less than a return to the situation as it stood before the invasion.
Saudis say that because they are certain Mr. Hussein will attack them as the economic strangulation of Iraq takes effect, they are anxious to give him as little pretext as possible until Western powers are in place to defend them.
For that reason, the Saudis said that while they are willing to increase their oil production slowly to ease the world's thirst for boycotted oil from Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait, they are not in a hurry to shut down the pipeline, known as IPSA-2, that carries Iraqi oil to the Saudi port of Yanbu on the Red Sea.
''Any action by Saudi Arabia to interfere with the flow of oil via IPSA-2 will be regarded as an automatic casus belli by the Iraqis,'' the Middle East Economic Survey, an authoritative oil newsletter that has close contacts with the Saudis, noted on Monday in its weekly issue.
There were unconfirmed reports tonight that the Iraqis had in any case braked the flow of oil through the pipeline because of an abrupt decline in demand resulting from trade sanctions.
 
Fear of Chemical Weapons
Saudi military strategists believe their air force can delay and possibly cripple a land assault by Iraqi troops massed on the Saudi borders with Kuwait.
''A squadron of 60 Saudi jets is enough to wipe out any Iraqi land invasion in an open and very exposed desert territory,'' a Saudi official said.
But the Saudis fear that Iraqi may move to use chemical weapons and missiles, which could inflict heavy casualties before Iraq is suppressed by Western military powers certain to enter the fight the moment Iraq attacks Saudi Arabia.
Today Mr. Hussein said he had no plans to attack Saudi Arabia, but the State Department said Iraq was increasing its troop concentration on Saudi borders.
Saudi Arabian decision-makers are said to be convinced that Mr. Hussein has worked himself into an untenable situation, and their strategy aims at slowly cornering him without outright provocation.
''Saddam has already lost the game politically and economically,'' one Saudi said. ''If he expands it to the military area he will be finished. Our strategy should be to show him that the military option is open for us too by investing in it. We are moving troops and will probably give the Americans some logistical support in some areas of the kingdom.''
In the course of steadily confronting the Iraqi aggression, Saudi Arabia has been taking increasingly bolder steps.
On Sunday it allowed the exiled Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to relay a message on Saudi television to his subjects in occupied Kuwait. The speech was widely broadcast in supporting countries, including Egypt. The Saudis are also said to be supplying Kuwaiti refineries in Western Europe with oil to feed its retail gasoline operation, a network of 4,500 service stations in the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxemburg and Norway.
But oil experts say that the sudden removal of nearly four million barrels a day of oil from Kuwaiti and Iraqi exports will undoubtedly push oil prices much higher and produce logistical difficulties before other producers step in to make up the loss. Prices have gone from lows of $13 a barrel to as high as $24 for the Saudi benchmark variety.
''The more successful we are in effecting the oil boycott of Iraq and Kuwait, the greater the difficulty will be in finding oil elsewhere to replace those exports, even if Saudi Arabia and others with spare production capacity like Venezuela and the United Arab Emirates cooperated by pumping more oil,'' said John Lichtblau, president of the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Foundation.
Of the 13 members of OPEC, only three have the ability to significantly increase oil output. The Saudis are able to boost production by two million barrels a day; Venezuela can produce 700,000 extra barrels and the United Arab Emirates have 500,000 barrels' unused capacity.
The Middle East Economic Survey noted on Monday that regardless of what happens, the damage that the Iraqi-Kuwaiti crisis has already done to the cohesion of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting countries ''may prove beyond repair.''
Sadek Boussena, the OPEC conference president, announced today that he would make a statement on the oil situation Wednesday, probably to answer pressing requests for an emergency OPEC meeting by some of the group's members.
 
Quota Agreement 'Meaningless'
''At any rate the existing OPEC agreement on quotas and production is now meaningless,'' said Joseph Story, an independent oil consultant in Washington. Other OPEC experts noted that a number of the group's members, including Venezuela and Gabon, have wondered aloud whether there is any use in remaining members of an organization that has become largely dominated by Arab politics.
In describing the developments of the last three days, foreign diplomats stationed in the Middle East said the elements of an economic and political confrontation with Baghdad were coming together quickly.
''I think all the Arab gulf states are resigned to the fact that they are entering an unpredictable and very dangerous war with Iraq, but they seem confident of our support,'' said an envoy of one of the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council.
Arab officials estimate that it may take the better part of two months before the economic sanctions bite, but there seems to be a growing feeling within the region that with the support of the West a decisive confrontation with Mr. Hussein will be won by the conservative regimes of the oil-producing countries of the region.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Crisis: Reverberations

 BODY:

IRAQI DEFIANCE President Saddam Hussein said Iraq would confront any ''imperialist or Zionist attempt'' to reverse its takeover of Kuwait. Experts said he was being backed into a corner from which his most likely options were to surrender or to lash out militarily. Pages A9 and A11.
BUSH'S GAMBLE By sending combat troops to Saudi Arabia, President Bush tied the United States' fortunes and his own to an explosive crisis with no clear outcome. Page A9.
TURKISH ACTION Turkey effectively ordered a shutdown of vital Iraqi oil pipelines. Page A10.
OIL PRICES Analysts said price rises might be stemmed by the Saudi pledge to produce two million more barrels daily, combined with expected production increases by other oil-exporting nations. The price of the benchmark American crude closed at $28.31, up 26 cents. Page D1.
FINANCIAL MARKETS The New York Stock Exchange steadied after a three-day slide prompted by the Iraqi invasion last week. The Dow was down 5.70, to 2,710.64. The Japanese stock market rose 3.10 percent, recovering some of yesterday's losses, and other major markets rose or declined slightly. Treasury securities continued to drop and interest rates climbed. Pages D1, D4 and D14.
RECESSION FEARS With the economy already weak, analysts said sharply higher energy costs were likely to slash corporate profits and could lead to a recession. Page D1.
BUDGET TALKS A reduction in the deficit is unlikely in view of the Iraqi crisis, Democratic and Republican lawmakers said. Doubts are growing about whether the economy can withstand $50 billion in belt-tightening while options like energy tax increases and deep military cuts now are unpalatable. Page A14.

HEADLINE: Colombia Swears In President, a Foe of Traffickers

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Amid tight security, Cesar Gaviria Trujillo was inaugurated today as President of Colombia.
A 43-year-old economist and Colombia's youngest President in this century, Mr. Gaviria has a four-year mandate to grapple with daunting problems: enduring left-wing guerrilla armies and violence by drug traffickers who made Colombia the source of 80 percent of the world's cocaine.
''Narco-terrorism is today the main menace to our democracy,'' Mr. Gaviria said in his inaugural speech. 
To guarantee security for representatives from 90 nations, including Vice President Dan Quayle, 22,000 soldiers and policemen patrolled the city, including a 24-block closed area around the inaugural site.
 
'Historic Responsibility'
With the public limited to watching televised coverage, the inauguration was an outgrowth of a presidential campaign that culminated in Mr. Gaviria's election on May 27. After three candidates were killed, the campaign was conducted largely on television. Mr. Gaviria, of the Liberal Party, was the candidate most opposed to the traffickers.
Today, echoing a historic cry of the Spanish-speaking world, Colombia's new President said that the nation's terrorists ''no pasaran'' - ''shall not pass.''
''My Government has the historic responsibility to pacify Colombian life,'' the President told dignitaries assembled in the high mountain air.
 
More Prisons and Protection
To fight ''narcoterrorismo,'' Mr. Gaviria promised to build high-security prisons and to provide protection and anonymity to judges and witnesses. Extradition of Colombian drug suspects to the United States for trial cannot be ''the principal tool of the war against drug trafficking,'' he said.
Mr. Gaviria drew some of the strongest applause when he said of the drug traffic, ''No success will be possible if there is not a substantial reduction in demand in the consuming countries.''
Drug-consuming countries should crack down on money laundering by traffickers, arms sales to traffickers and domestic distribution networks, said Mr. Gaviria.
The drug issue has gripped this country since last Aug. 17, when traffickers killed Mr. Gaviria's political mentor, Luis Carlos Galan.
Today, Virgilio Barco Vargas, Colombia's President since 1986, stepped down without seeing his nemesis, Pablo Escobar, brought to justice. Despite a $600,000 price on his head, Mr. Escobar, leader of the powerful Medellin cocaine cartel, has escaped arrest and has fought the state with a series of bombings and killings.
 
Ex-Guerrilla in Cabinet
To protect Mr. Barco from traffickers, Mr. Gaviria is expected to name him Ambassador to Britain. Last week, Mr. Barco named his chief of staff, German Montoya, Ambassador to Canada.
Turning to the left-wing guerrillas, a fixture on Colombia's political scene since the early 1960's, the new President has chosen Antonio Navarro Wolff, former presidential candidate of the M-19 Democratic Alliance, as his minister of health. Last March, the M-19 abandoned guerrilla warfare.
Mr. Gaviria held out to the nation's four remaining guerrilla groups the possibility of participating in November elections for delegates to a constitutional convention. He is Colombia's first president to give a cabinet post to a former guerrilla.
In recent weeks, peace talks started with three small armed groups. Two larger groups are still at war, fielding a total of about 7,000 guerrillas.

HEADLINE: For U.S. Visa, Peruvians Try Lots of Ruses

BYLINE: By SHIRLEY CHRISTIAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Aug. 4

 BODY:
A notebook kept behind the bulletproof glass where American consular officers talk to visa applicants is proof of the desperation created by Peru's deepening guerrilla violence and economic ruin.
It is filled with samples of fake employment letters, tax returns and bank statements that Peruvians have supplied in vain attempts to get visas to go to the United States.
Lima's street-wise entrepreneurs also manufacture visas themselves, stamping them into passports at prices ranging from $500 to $5,000.
''You get what you pay for,'' said Wayne G. Griffith, the United States consul general, referring to the quality of the fake visas. ''Some people believe they are buying real visas, so they think we are corrupt.'' 
 
How the Fakes Are Used
When the consulate came up with a counterfoil, a special sticker placed in the passport on which the visa is then stamped, counterfeiters began copying it as well. Mr. Griffith showed one fake so good that it could have gone undetected except for the fact that the counterfeiter carelessly used a Spanish-language date stamp.
Most fake visas are likely to be detected by immigration officers at United States entry points, so a more common use of them may be to help the passport holder get a visa for Guatemala or Mexico by showing the United States visa and saying he wants to stop over en route. Once in one of those countries, he may join a group crossing the Rio Grande by foot.
Over the last two years, applications from Peruvians seeking visas to go to the United States as tourists have nearly doubled, from 54,698 in fiscal 1988 to an estimated 104,500 this year. More than 40 percent are being refused because of suspicions that the applicants intend to stay and look for work. Two years ago, the refusal rate was just 22 percent.
The applicants line up by the hundreds each day, despite the fact that there is no sign or emblem declaring the building to be the United States Consulate.
 
'Critical Threat Post'
Lima, afflicted by leftist terrorism that has put a third of Peru under emergency military control, is considered a ''critical threat post'' for employees of the United States Government. A package bomb blew out the plate-glass front windows three years ago.
With legal immigration to the United States virtually closed to any but the immediate families of citizens, would-be Peruvian immigrants find the tourist visa their only option. But to obtain a tourist visa - what the law terms nonimmigrant visa - applicants must prove they have the means to pay for their trip and reason to return to Peru, like property, family ties or a good job.
That's where the creation of fake letters and documents comes in. The consulate has assigned one officer full time to work with the Peruvian police in detecting visa fraud. Since January, Mr. Griffith said, three counterfeit visa rings have been broken up.
Sometimes, however, the falsification involves something simple, like getting a friend who works for an established company to supply a piece of letterhead stationary on which to write an employment and salary report. #4 Do the Interviewing There are also cases of people who legitimately qualify for visas, then sell their passports and report them stolen. After obtaining a new passport, they return for another visa.
The four consular officers who interview the average of more than 500 daily applicants rely on their own admittedly subjective judgments and common sense in deciding whether the person is what he says he is and whether the documents are legitimate.
The interviewers, usually young Foreign Service officers on their first tour of duty abroad, run people through at intervals of one or two minutes each. There is no appeal from the interviewer's on-the-spot decision, unless the visa seeker wants to return with additional information.
''Do you have children here?'' an interviewer asks a gray-haired woman wanting to go to the United States to visit a child there. He wants to know whether she has a reason to return home.
A man is quickly told he cannot receive a visa because he neither owns his own home in Peru, nor has proof of ''solvency.''
A man who presents the last two years' tax forms raises suspicions because his income has supposedly jumped from the equivalent of about $5,000 to about $80,000. The consular officer thinks the stamp on the more recent form is fake.
''I am sorry, sir, but I can't give you a visa,'' he says, without hesitation or explanation.
 
Some Are Quickly Accepted
People whose passports show frequent United States entry stamps from previous trips get visas quickly because it is obvious they have reasons for regular travel and have not abused tourist visas in the past. Likewise, people who bring statements from banks in the United States showing they have substantial balances are likely to receive visas quickly.
A university student said she wanted to go to the United States for the reading of her father's will. He had died after living there 18 years. But the consular officer found that she had no close family ties to bring her back to Peru.
''It's unfortunate, but I cannot give you a visa,'' he said, adding that the estate could be handled by mail.
''Next,'' he said, motioning the next applicant forward.
''This is a lousy job,'' Mr. Griffith said as he watched.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
U.S. Is Ready to Ask Soviets to Help With Naval Blockade of Iraq

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials said today that Washington was prepared to invite the Soviet Union into any international naval force assembled to enforce sanctions against Iraq. They added that they had no doubt that Moscow would want to take part.
A senior Bush Administration official said the United States had not yet formally invited Moscow to take part in such a force, but had signaled to the Soviet Union, China, Britain and France that such a unit might be needed soon to enforce the worldwide economic boycott against Iraq ordered on Monday by the United Nations Security Council.
There have also been reports that an international ground force would be sent to Saudi Arabia, but there has been no indication yet that Soviet forces would take part. 
The Bush Administration's willingness to cooperate with Moscow in a naval force is in striking contrast to the American position of only three years ago.
In 1987, after a Kuwaiti appeal to permanent members of the Security Council, Kuwaiti oil tankers were registered under the flags of other nations to protect them from attack by Iran or Iraq, but the United States declined to let Moscow participate in the operation. American officials did not want to open an opportunity for a buildup of Soviet naval forces in the Persian Gulf.
 
'We Needed to Act Together'
But in the wake of the Soviet-American cooperation in the early stages of the current gulf crisis, senior Administration officials say they are prepared to invite Moscow into any a collective security force that might be assembled to deter Iraq or enforce sanctions.
''We think that they should be part of any multinational naval presence,'' said a senior Administration official. ''We will not try to exclude them.'' He added: ''It flows naturally from everything they have done up to now. I think we both understood that we were staring face to face at the major threat in the post-cold war world. We needed to act together in a way that will demonstrate that we will not just cope with this problem but also deter future situations like this from developing.''
Another senior official said: ''The more the Soviets do behave responsibly, the more it does increase our incentives to see them as possible partners in a military operation.''
''What the Soviets have done up to now should not be underestimated,'' the official added. ''It has had a major impression on the smaller countries who feel much more comfortable about sticking their heads out, knowing that the major powers are together on this thing. It also clearly played a role in getting the Chinese on board.''
 
Moscow's Caution
Asked if Washington was certain that Moscow would want to take part in such a naval force if it is assembled, the official said: ''There is no way that they would want to be left out. I can assure you of that. But what they are telling us now is let's move slowly, step-by-step. First let's see what happens with sanctions and then we will address the issue of a naval force.''
The official said that the statement today by the Soviet Foreign Ministry that a ''buildup in the military presence and naval muscle-flexing in such a very tense and very complex situation is not the best line of action'' reflected Moscow's concern that Washington not take any action on its own.
Nevertheless, Soviet behavior up to now has clearly given the Administration much more room to maneuver.
The present situation contrasts with 1979, when President Carter had to respond to the seizing of American hostages by Iran; he was repeatedly criticized for not taking firm military measures. President Bush thus far at least appears decisive, and one of the main differences between the two responses is the Soviet factor.
Michael Mandelbaum, director of East-West Studies at the Council on Foreign Relations, said: ''Jimmy Carter could not attack Iran for fear of provoking the Soviets to intervene themselves or driving Iran into the Soviet orbit, which would have been a major geopolitical loss for the United States. Bush really doesn't have to worry about either.''
On Monday, John S. Wolf, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs, summoned officials of several important American allies for a meeting about the safety of their nationals working in Kuwait and Iraq.
''It was the usual group,'' said a European official who attended, ''except for the fact that the Soviet representative, Oleg Derkovsky, was also there. So there we were, all sitting around this conferernce table - the Americans, the French, the Italians, the Germans, the Swiss, the Japanese, the Canadians, the British and - the Soviets. It was all very businesslike, everyone speaking together freely, looking at emergency contingency plans for evacuating foreigners. It was just like any other meeting of the allies. It was only afterwards that I thought about how odd it was.''

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
Bush's Gamble in Sending Troops: Stakes Are Certain, Outcome Murky

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
By sending combat troops into Saudi Arabia, President Bush moved decisively today to defend fundamental American economic interests, but he also tied the United States and his own fortunes to a potentially explosive crisis with no clear outcome in sight.
 
The stakes behind the
President's decision were clear: control of oil supplies and prices. By grabbing Kuwait, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq was in a position to intimidate Saudi Arabia and dominate OPEC pricing. President Bush determined that this power - which touches every corner of the world economy - had to be retained by Saudi Arabia and the other members of OPEC, and the only way to insure that was by removing the Iraqi threat to the Saudis. 
The military force assembling in Saudi Arabia and nearby waters provides the reassurance that the Saudi leadership apparently needed to oppose Mr. Hussein.
 
Risks Are Also Clear
But the risks for Mr. Bush are equally clear: Washington is now face to face with a cornered enemy. Mr. Bush's political fate may be on the line, but Saddam Hussein has staked his Government on the success of his Kuwait adventure. He is a man who has demonstrated time and time again to his enemies at home and abroad that he knows no restraints, and Mr. Bush may now have to match him step by step.
Senior Bush Administration officials are worried over several possible Iraqi responses, including the possibility that the Iraqis will take Americans in Kuwait and Iraq hostage. The Jordanians may have been able to restrain Mr. Hussein until now, but that was before he had American troops on his doorstep. What will Washington do if he calls their bluff and engages American forces in a war of attrition that would engulf half of the world's crude oil reserves, send prices spiraling out of control and push the American economy into recession?
Tough questions, Bush aides admit, but, they add, what choice did they have?
 
Joining With Outsiders
No matter who prevails, the Iraqis or the Saudis, the Arab world and the American role in the Middle East are unlikely to be quite the same. The last time the United States or Britain intervened militarily in the region to prop up an Arab Government was in the 1950's, but those initiatives proved to be the curtain calls of a colonial era. In the 1960's, the Arab Nationalist tide loosed by President Gamel Abdel Nasser of Egypt swept the region. That enjoined every Arab leader to live by the maxim: never side with foreigners against Arabs - at least not in public.
As the Arab proverb puts it: ''Me and my brother against my cousin; me, my brother and my cousin against the outsider.'' Even President Anwar el-Sadat of Egypt, who was reviled by the Arab world for aligning his country with the Americans, would never grant them bases.
Today, though, the Saudis joined hands in public with the outsider to confront the Iraqis, because the Iraqis changed the rules first when they invaded Kuwait. Arab leaders were not supposed to align themselves openly with foreigners, but they were also not supposed to devour one another's states. The closest precedent was the Syrian movement into Lebanon in 1976, but that was justified in its origins as part of a pan-Arab peacekeeping effort to end the civil war.
 
'A Line Has Been Crossed'
The Saudis decided that the risks of being accused of collaborating with the Americans were outweighed by the risks of being exposed to Mr. Hussein.
''A line has been crossed,'' said Fouad Ajami, a Lebanese-born Middle East expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''When Iraq shucked off the traditional limits of Arab politics the Saudis decided to shuck off their Arab nationalist scruples too. They understood that this time they could not bury their heads in the sand and wait for the storm to blow over. The idea of keeping the Americans just over the horizon just wouldn't do any longer. The fire was here.''
How will it be put out? There are four possibilities. The first is that Mr. Hussein will do nothing to provoke the American troops, but simply continue to consolidate his hold over Kuwait and launch a virulent rhetorical onslaught against the Saudi Government, hoping to rally the Arab world to his side. This could become extremely uncomfortable for the Saudi royal family.
 
Missiles and Poison Gas
A second possibility is that he will raise the ante by trying to grab a corner of Saudi Arabia or opening fire on American troops. He has missiles, poison gas, a million men under arms and a nation that became inured to war of attrition in the eight-year conflict with Iran.
A third possibility is that the sanctions will begin to choke Iraq and Mr. Hussein will signal a willingess to make a deal.
A fourth possibility, and the one most hoped for in Washington, is that someone in the Iraqi military will decide that Mr. Hussein has gone too far, and hatch a plot to oust him.
 
Removing the Threat
This last possibility is not only the most preferable to Washington but also the only one that would allow a quick resolution of the crisis and a quick withdrawal of American forces.
The mission of the American forces sent into Saudi Arabia today did not seem to be to liberate Kuwait. Their initial mission, at least, seemed to be to remove the immediate threat of an Iraqi attack against Saudi Arabia and the long-term threat of Iraqi intimidation.
But even if Mr. Hussein were to withdraw his forces from Kuwait tomorrow, he would remain a powerful force intimidating the Saudis and he would undoubtedly use his propaganda apparatus to stir up an anti-Saudi campaign throughout the Arab world. For this reason, it is difficult to imagine the Bush Administration's achieving its objectives and feeling free to pull out, without there being a change of government in Iraq.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
Quick Action by Turkey On Sanctions a Startler

BYLINE: By CLYDE HABERMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, Aug. 7

 BODY:
By joining the worldwide sanctions against Iraq today Turkey moved more decisively than many cautious and even nervous people here had wished.
Some news commentators had insisted that given Turkey's geographic and economic exposure to Iraq, it should have been among the last to go along with the economic blockade ordered Monday by the United Nations Security Council.
Instead, the Government cast its lot fully with the American-led effort to cripple Iraq's economy.
In the most significant measure, Turkey effectively ordered a shutdown of vital Iraqi oil pipelines in its territory by banning ships from loading Iraqi crude at offshore terminals in the eastern Mediterranean. 
 
Shutdown Left to Iraq
Turkish officials said that Baghdad may still pump oil through the twin pipelines, which until the invasion of Kuwait last week had carried more than half of Iraq's total exports from its northern fields. But once storage installations are filled at the Mediterranean port of Yumurtalik, the officials said, Iraq will have no choice but to cut off the flow entirely, a process that they expected to take five or six days.
''This way, we leave it to the Iraqis to decide when to shut it down,'' said Mehmet Kececiler, the State Minister for Oil.
To a degree, events had already simplified this decision for the Turks. Feeling the pinch of an embargo led by the United States, Iraq had already closed one pipeline and slashed the flow in the other by nearly a third.
A pipeline that stretches across Saudi Arabia from Iraq to the port of Yanbu on the Red Sea is believed to be operating, but there were reports tonight that its flow had also slowed because of a steep decline in demand.
In Turkey, pipeline officials said that the effect of the Iraqi move was to reduce the oil flow to 44 percent of the 1.5 million barrels per day that used to be carried. ''If they cannot market, they cannot pump,'' said Oktay Vulal, director general of Botas, Turkey's state-run pipeline company.
 
Lone Tanker Turned Away
Forbidding any oil-loading at the Mediterranean end of the line was made somewhat easier by the fact that there are almost no ships around now. Mr. Kececiler said that only one tanker had shown up off Yumurtalik today, from Morocco, and it was turned away.
Losing Iraqi oil will be a big blow for Turks, because they had counted on it for 40 percent of this year's import requirements. Some speculated that Turkey may well be tempted to draw off some of this crude that is now fast accumulating in its reservoirs, taking it, in effect, as partial Iraqi repayment on its $750 million worth of outstanding debts here.
But siphoning off oil could be viewed abroad as an attempt to cheat on the embargo. and despite its caution, the Government has clearly chosen to show solidarity with the rest of the world against a neighbor that is feared but also widely despised.
''They're not going to be isolated,'' a foreign diplomat said. ''They're not going to desert the Western camp - no way. It's not an option.''
 
Iraqi Assets Frozen
Like other countries joining the economic blockade, Turkey ordered all trade stopped with Iraq and Iraqi-controlled Kuwait save food and medicine needed for humanitarian purposes. It also froze all Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets. A senior Government official said, however, that these were meager, amounting to only about $25 million.
Playing down the immediate threat to his country's oil supplies, Mr. Vulal of the pipeline company said that Iraq had already delivered nearly 75 percent of this year's anticipated supplies and that the rest would probably now be obtained with little trouble from Saudi Arabia and other sources.
Nevertheless, many Turks are concerned about the damage that the boycott will inflict on commerce valued at $3 billion a year. That figure includes pipeline fees that Iraq pays to Turkey, an enormous volume of truck traffic between the two countries and the considerable construction work performed by Turkish companies in Iraq.
Some here say that they also fear for the safety of an estimated 60,000 Turkish workers in Iraq, sent there on construction projects.
Others argued that a cautious foreign policy in the Middle East had always worked well for Turkey in the past and should still be maintained, especially given the threat presented by the unpredictable Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein. ''Turkey should be the last to join'' a United Nations blockade, a national newspaper, Hurriyet, said today. ''She has at least this right as a border country.''
 
Baker Due on Thursday
Turkish officials now expect to come under still more pressure with the scheduled arrival Thursday of Secretary of State James A. Baker, who is coming from what United States officials describe as ''broad overall consultations'' on the Persian Gulf crisis.
A senior Turkish official said he expected that Mr. Baker would seek Ankara's permission to use military bases here as staging areas, should there be a decision for military strikes against Iraq. The main site is an air base near the southern city of Adana, where it was disclosed today that the United States has 14 F-111 bombers similar to those used in the raid against Libya in 1986.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
EUROPE AND JAPAN SUPPORT EMBARGO

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 7

 BODY:
As if anxious to dispel memories of their past support for the Baghdad Government, Western Europe and Japan have moved quickly to carry out European Community and United Nations resolutions ordering trade and arms embargoes against Iraq.
But in throwing their weight behind the international campaign to isolate Iraq, Western Europe and Japan are also expecting to pay a stiff price for policies that in recent years have contributed enormously to strengthening President Saddam Hussein's position in the Middle East.
France, Italy, West Germany and Spain have sold weapons to Iraq; France and Japan have given generous credits to Baghdad, and Britain is among numerous industrialized countries to have encouraged their private companies to do business with Iraq.
The immediate impact of the crisis in these countries seems likely to be higher domestic oil prices, which could in turn slow economic growth. But Iraq also has huge outstanding debts to Japan and some European countries on which payments will now be indefinitely suspended. 
 
West Could Face Own Weapons
If the current trade embargo leads to a naval blockade of Iraq, Western nations may find themselves confronting sophisticated weapons, including supersonic aircraft and missiles, that they themselves have supplied.
In the hours and days that followed Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week, Western Europe and Japan have nonetheless closed ranks with the United States, ordering freezes of Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets, banning oil imports from the two countries and forbidding exports to Iraq.
One of the earliest signs of Western Europe's new determination to confront President Hussein has been its willingness to discuss the crisis at the headquarters of the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels. In the past, France in particular has insisted that NATO has no authority to act in the Middle East.
''Usually in these cases you have the United States calling for action and the rest talking about diplomatic solutions,'' one NATO official said. ''Not this time. Everyone, including France, believes something should be done. And everyone, including France, agrees this is an issue of direct interest to NATO.''
France's position is specially complicated because it has long been Europe's main supplier of both armaments and credits to Iraq. For example, during Iraq's war with Iran between 1980 and 1988, France provided some $17 billion of armaments to Baghdad, including Mirage fighters and Exocet missiles.
 
Iraq Owes France Billions
Since the war ended, French construction and electronics companies have also signed important contracts with Iraq. Today, Iraq owes France around $4.5 billion, including $2.5 billion for weapons. Arms sales to Iraq were suspended in May only because Baghdad fell behind on its debt payments.
When the crisis erupted last Thursday, however, France apparently decided it could not be seen wavering. It quickly froze Iraqi and Kuwaiti assets and took the initiative of proposing that the 12-nation European Community boycott Iraqi oil and cut off arms sales to the country.
Some domestic critics have charged that the Government shares responsibility for Iraq's aggression. A cartoon in Le Monde today showed Western hostages being led away by a tank marked, ''Made in France.'' But this has only prompted the Government to take a firmer stance, including dispatching a frigate to join two warships already in the Gulf area.
Britain, in contrast, is not believed to have supplied weapons to Iraq, but British companies have also been vying for lucrative contracts in Iraq. And in recent months, opposition politicians in London have accused Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of overlooking assorted abuses of Iraqi power in the name of protecting British business interests.
Just this year, Iraq ignored British protests and hanged a London-based Iranian-born journalist on spying charges. Iraq was also accused of trying to smuggle American-made nuclear triggers through Heathrow Airport in London and of acquiring parts in Britain and elsewhere in Europe for a gigantic gun. Baghdad denied both charges.
But after the invasion of Kuwait, a former British protectorate with an estimated $28 billion worth of assets in Britain, Mrs. Thatcher immediately ordered a freeze of Kuwaiti holdings and, during a quick visit to the United States, showed herself anxious to coordinate the Western response with President Bush.
 
No Japanese Peacekeepers
Japan's stake in the crisis can be measured by the fact that it has not only been the main provider of foreign aid to Iraq, is a major exporter to Iraq and is owed some $4.7 billion by the Baghdad Government, but has also received about 12 percent of its oil during the first six months of this year from Iraq and Kuwait.
But despite some domestic claims that Tokyo hesitated in responding to the Kuwaiti invasion, waiting until Sunday to announce a full embargo of trade and aid, the Government has insisted that it moved quickly on sanctions, despite the considerable commercial losses involved.
Japan is nonetheless bracing for criticism for not offering to involve its armed forces. ''Our Constitution prohibits our military contribution, even to peacekeeping forces,'' Taizo Watanabe, a Foreign Ministry spokesman, said. ''We have made it clear we will do what we can in a non-military way. But we don't know what kind of a contribution we can make.''
In Western Europe, apart from Britain and France, no other country has so far indicated willingness to participate in a naval blockade of Iraq, while Greece has announced that United States bases in Crete could not be used as a springboard for military action in the Middle East.
In Bonn, a spokesman said the question of West German involvement in a maritime blockade ''has not yet been raised'' and refused to comment further. The magazine Der Spiegel claimed this week that West German firms had helped Iraq develop ''military nuclear technology, construction of rockets and production of poison gases.''

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
Democrats Urge Bush to Pressure Oil Companies on Price Increases

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Congressional Democrats accused the oil industry today of engaging in price-gouging and exhorted President Bush to stop it.
''Someone is making a killing,'' Senator John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts, said at one of three hastily arranged public hearings on sharp increases in American fuel prices following Iraq's occupation of Kuwait.
Charles J. Di Bona, president of the American Petroleum Institute, vehemently denied the accusation. Critics of the oil industry are taking ''a naive, one-sided view of how markets work,'' he said. 
American oil companies had no choice but to pass on to consumers the higher cost of oil on the world market, Mr. Di Bona maintained, saying prices would drop if world prices fall.
 
A Call for Pressure
But angry members of Congress said Mr. Bush should pressure industry leaders for price relief, in much the same way President John F. Kennedy pressured the steel industry in the early 1960's.
Mr. Bush also was urged to tap the Government's crude oil reserve. The aim would be to cushion American consumers against further economic repercussions from hostilities in the Middle East.
Oil companies have raised gasoline prices by as much as 25 cents a gallon since President Saddam Hussein sent his Iraqi forces into neighboring Kuwait last week. Company executives said their prices are the result of increases in crude oil costs, from $16 a barrel in July to $27 after the invasion.
The American Automobile Association reported today that prices for self-service unleaded gas went up an average of 1.5 cents per gallon overnight and have averaged 12.6 cents higher than they were Aug. 1. The average is now $1.20 per gallon, the highest since 1985, said the A.A.A., which checked 1,400 service stations nationwide.
 
Eager to Show Anger
Today's spate of hearings was an unusual occurrence during a Congressional recess. But lawmakers were anxious to vent their constitutents' anger over price increases. They were joined in this high-profile public interrogation by officials of state and local governments and consumer groups.
Despite oil industry denials of price-gouging, several witnesses maintained, the evidence was otherwise. They complained that oil companies are quick to pass on price increases but slow to pass along any savings.
''The American public is angry,'' said Senator Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada. ''They have a sense they are being held hostage to you, the oil companies.''
The industry executives were summoned a day after the Justice Department pledged that it would look into the soaring fuel prices. Anti-competitive pricing activities will be aggressively prosecuted, it said.
 
'On a Massive Scale'
But that did not satisfy angry congressmen.
''In the last week, American consumers have been ripped off on a massive scale,'' Senator Joseph Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut, complained to witnesses appearing before a Senate Commerce consumer subcommittee.
Representative Phil Sharp, Democrat of Indiana, said president Saddam ''may not be the only greedy person in this picture.''
Mr. Bryan cited a nationwide survey by the American Automobile Association showing gas prices up at least 11 cents - and as high as 19 cents - since last week's invasion. The prices have soared despite evidence showing supplies are still plentiful.
''One is left with the inescapable conclusion that profiteering is occurring at the expense of the American consumer,'' Mr. Bryan said.
But Glenn Tilton, president of Texaco Refining and Marketing Inc., said his company was a hostage to supply and demand - and thus had to raise its prices along with everyone else.
Mr. Lieberman said Mr. Bush should summon executives of the big oil companies and tell them to exercise price restraint.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
FEW CHOICES SEEN FOR IRAQI LEADER

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Saddam Hussein, the Iraqi leader, unexpectedly faced with a rapid and menacing global response to his invasion of Kuwait, increasingly is being backed into a corner from which his most likely options are to surrender or to lash out militarily, private and Government experts on the Middle East said today.
Those experts said that in the next several days he may well decide whether to choose war, striking at Saudi Arabia in an attempt to capture or destroy oilfields on which the Western economies rely, or withdraw his forces into Iraq, perhaps through a face-saving negotiated agreement.
President Hussein also could choose to remain entrenched in Kuwait and hope that an international ban on trade with Iraq, imposed on Monday by the United Nations, will crumble. But Saudi Arabia's decision to increase oil production, offsetting some of the shortage of 4 million barrels a day created by the United Nations embargo, makes that option increasingly unattractive. 
If President Hussein backs down or is defeated, the experts say, he probably cannot long retain his grip on power.
 
Choice of 'the Big Gamble'
''The next 24 to 48 hours are going to tell the story,'' a Government official who is kept informed of developments in the gulf crisis said today. ''What he's going to do is really difficult to predict.''
In the opinion of that official and others, any military action by Iraqi forces is likely to occur relatively soon, before American aircraft and troop deployments and naval forces of several nations move within easy striking range.
A speedy march into Saudi Arabia would give President Hussein's forces a chance to reach Saudi oilfields and pipelines, making it much more difficult for Western forces to evict them without destroying centers that supply nearly a quarter of the world's oil.
''If he's boxed in, I don't think anyone should be sanguine about what he'd do next,'' Thomas McNaugher, a Brookings Institution expert on Iraqi military and political matters, said in an interview today. ''He's shown a clear willingness to take the big gamble and use his military options.''
 
A Squandered Opportunity
But Mr. McNaugher and others agreed that President Hussein already appears to have squandered one option: a swift withdrawal of most of his troops from Kuwait and installing a pliable civilian government that could win Arab acceptance.
That would not have been difficult. The exiled Emir of Kuwait is not beloved among Arab heads of state, in part because of Kuwait's persistent violation of OPEC agreements to limit oil production.
Had President Hussein taken that approach before the United States and United Nations acted this week, they said, the Saudis and others would have been more reluctant to support the United Nations embargo or an American military presence.
Even an unconditional withdrawal from Kuwait still would have delivered President Hussein's message that Iraq was the dominant Arab nation and the controlling force in oil production and pricing, Mr. McNaugher said.
''An ability to impact Saudi oil production levels would have crushed the embargo if he could have carried it off,'' a Government official said. But with the Saudis now aligned against it, Iraq has lost its leverage among Arab Governments and the political payoff from a withdrawl.
 
Chance for Negotiated Solution
Helmut Sonnenfeldt, a State Department counselor in the Nixon and Ford Administrations and a national-security expert, said President Hussein still could seek a negotiated solution to the crisis along the lines suggested by his allies in the Palestine Liberation Organization and by King Hussein of Jordan. That peace plan calls for Iraqi withdrawal, an election to choose a new Kuwaiti Government, and some form of subsidization of the Iraqi economy.
With Iraq already under an international order to leave Kuwait and permit the Emir's return, that course ''is not much of an option, either,'' he said. ''But he may think the coalition against him will begin to crack if something reasonable is put forward.''
And to concede defeat now would wreck President Hussein's dream of leadership in the Arab world. ''If you believe this guy wants a bigger position in the world, a position with the have-nots of the Arab world cheering him on, then he's not going to back down,'' a Government expert said.

HEADLINE: THE IRAQI INVASION;
Jordan Talks of Balance But Some See Iraqi Tilt

BYLINE: By JOSEPH B. TREASTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan, Aug. 7

 BODY:
As the crisis surrounding Kuwait expands, King Hussein of Jordan is struggling to balance his old friendships with his recent enthusiasm for Iraq and its strongman, Saddam Hussein.
Though he is a longtime ally of the United States, the King has refused to join in the condemnation of Iraq. Though he is a hereditary ruler from the Hashemite Kingdom, he has remained silent about the forced exile of the Kuwaiti royal family in the face of invading Iraqi troops.
The King is trying to avoid taking sides, his aides say, in the hope that he can continue talking with the Iraqi President and serve as a bridge between him and other Arab leaders to find a peaceful solution to the crisis. 
 
'Wanted to Keep the Doors Open'
Jordan's Prime Minister, Mudar Badran, said that joining with a majority of Arab League members to protest the invasion of Kuwait ''would have closed the door against any possibility of going to Iraq to resolve the situation.''
''We wanted to keep the doors open between us and our brothers in Iraq,'' he said.
Western diplomats who watched an NBC News interview with the King broadcast by Jordan's state-run station over the weekend said that at one point he appeared to have crossed the center of the road in favor of the Iraqi leader.
''I believe he is a person to be trusted and be dealt with,'' King Hussein said of the Iraqi President in the interview. ''He is an Arab patriot in the eyes of many.''
Workers as well as members of the Jordan's political elite said in interviews today that they deeply admired Saddam Hussein for having held off Iran in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war.
They said they had little sympathy for Kuwait, which they said had shared much less of its oil riches with Jordan than their country deserved as a buffer state with Israel.
 
No Recognition, or Criticism
Jordan has so far withheld recognition of the newly installed Government of Kuwait, though it is among the handful of Arab states that have refrained from criticizing the invasion and calling for an immediate withdrawal.
As aid from the United States and the Gulf states has diminished and Jordan's economy has suffered, King Hussein has drawn closer to the Iraqi leader. Diplomats say the two leaders appear genuinely to enjoy each other's company.
For Jordan, with its 360 miles of open border with Israel, the good will of the most powerful country in the Arab world is regarded as vital.
''Iraq's power is our shield,'' said Mahmoud el-Sherif, the editor of Jordan's oldest daily newspaper, Ad Dustour. ''We look to Iraq, a big country, a powerful country, as a political shield against Israeli expansionism.''
There has been little public debate about King Hussein's responsibility toward the Kuwaiti royal family. ''If we had taken a strong position on the royal family of Kuwait we would have lost our leverage with the Iraq leadership,'' said a Jordanian close to the Government. ''That leverage is our priority. We are still expecting movement.'' Caught in the Middle Strong criticism from Washington has led to worry that widespread fighting could develop, with a possible military reaction from Israel. Caught between Israel and Iraq, ''We would become hamburger,'' said Kamel Abu Jaber, a former university professor who now directs the Jordanian Center for Middle Eastern Studies.
The Jordanian Government and many private Jordanians argue that negotiations among Arabs are likely to be most successful in resolving the crisis. They say they do not believe the Iraqi President has designs on Saudi Arabia. But they said economic sanctions or a military strike could provoke an emotional reaction from him.
Many Jordanians say that the invasion of Kuwait does not suggest to them that their small country of 2.8 million people might also be in jeopardy from Iraq at some point.
Instead, they say that Kuwait was a special case, and that in many ways Iraq was justified in invading. Like the Iraqis, the Jordanians believe that Kuwait did not sufficiently contribute to Iraq's costs in the war with Iran.
Not only were Kuwait and Iraq feuding about Iraqi claims that Kuwait had been pilfering millions of dollars worth of oil from border oil fields, but Iraq has also claimed ownership of the territory from the time of Kuwait's emergence as a state in 1961.
''This is a long-term historical dispute,'' one Goverment official said. ''The new element was that with Iraq out of the war and burdened with debts, it considered Kuwait owed a debt and it wanted to be paid. This is an internal dispute between Arab states. It is not like your invasions of Grenada or Panama.''
Jordan has also been disappointed that it has not been able to obtain more financial support and more sophisticated weaponry from the United States.
 
Strong Current of Resentment
The resentment here toward Kuwait runs deep. ''The Kuwait people deserve what happened,'' said Mona Elyamani, a 26-year-old psychology student at the University of Jordan. ''They are very rich and they spend their money playing poker and going to discos. A lot of poor people are starving in the Arab world and they do not look after them.''
Many Jordanians said they felt Arab leaders had been humiliated in relations with Israel and the United States. Though they worried about an eruption of violence, they said they felt inspired by Mr. Hussein's frequent harsh responses to his critics and his quick strike to end the bickering with Kuwait.
''Deep in my heart I am happy,'' said a pharmacist in her mid-30's, who spoke only on the condition that she not be identified. ''We really want someone to give us a sense of worth. We Arabs have been suffering so long.''

HEADLINE: Faltering Hopes for Accord on Deficit Are Dimmed Further by Gulf Crisis

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Democratic and Republican lawmakers said today that Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is a serious setback for already troubled budget talks between Congress and the White House and that it will probably scuttle any deficit reduction for the coming year.
While the negotiators stressed that they had not given up on a budget agreement, the tone of their comments made plain how pessimistic many of them had become. The situation in the Persian Gulf, they said, created new difficulties, political and substantive, in reaching agreement on a package of spending cuts and tax increases to trim $50 billion from the deficit for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1.
In policy terms, there are growing doubts about whether an economy that is showing signs of weakness can withstand $50 billion in belt-tightening, while political options like energy tax increases and deep cuts in the Pentagon budget now become more difficult to sell to the rest of Congress. 
''The bottom line is that those who have been looking for an excuse to avoid making tough decisions on the budget may have found in the Persian Gulf their salvation,'' said Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the Senate Budget Committee. ''The outcome of the budget negotiations this fall will be determined by the events in the Persian Gulf over the next few weeks.''
 
Session in Secluded Setting
After two months of talks that have yielded only partisan bickering, the negotiators are planning to meet in a secluded setting outside Washington in the first week of September to push for an agreement. Lawmakers in both parties have repeatedly said that what the budget debate needed was a sense of crisis about the deficit to overcome political resistance.
''We now certainly have a sense of crisis; the only problem is that it is the wrong crisis,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee. ''The one we have simply feeds into a basic resistance on deficit reduction.''
But even before the situation in the gulf arose, negotiators had become concerned that a $50 billion deficit package could tip a fragile economy into recession and were wondering if a smaller package might make more sense. With the price of oil already up by $5 a barrel, and further increases possible if tensions remain high, the recession fear has become more pronounced and the likelihood of a smaller package is now discussed openly.
''If the oil price stays at that level, it slows the economy more by contributing to inflation,'' said Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee. ''It would be like pulling $60 billion out of the economy before you even get to budget cuts.''
Mr. Bentsen, like other budget negotiators, said those involved in the talks would want to re-examine the economy and the situation in the gulf in September before making a decision about scaling back the deficit package. ''The dilemma we face on the other side is what happens to the financial markets if don't do enough on the deficit,'' he said, adding that actions by the Federal Reserve Board on interest rates will also have a major effect on what the negotiators decide.
 
Less Room to Maneuver
The talks so far are based on the premise that cutting a sizable chunk from the deficit would produce a favorable reaction from financial markets and permit the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates. But with higher oil prices adding to inflation, budget negotiators worry that the board may have less maneuvering room.
The higher oil prices also mean that increases in energy taxes, which had seemed a likely possibility for the tax portion of the deficit package, are now a much less attractive option.
''There's no question that things like energy taxes become more difficult if you're in the middle of an embargo or blockade,'' the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said Monday. ''It makes the acceptance of energy taxes more politically difficult, though not necessarily less desirable.''
On the spending side, cuts in the military budget and in large Government benefit programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security become more politically difficult. Moreover, attempting to cut the benefit programs may be futile because they include provisions for automatic increases when inflation goes up or the economy goes into recession.
''I'm pessimistic,'' said Representative Bill Frenzel of Minnesota, the senior Republican on the House Budget Committee. ''When you combine a slower economy with Iraq and the hastening date of the November elections, it seems to me the momentum has turned the other way. Whenever there is turmoil and confusion, you can always expect Congress to do as little as possible.''
 
Pessimistic View Is Unchanged
Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon, the senior Republican on the Senate Finance Committee, has long predicted that even if the budget negotiators could agree on the ingredients for a deficit reduction plan, they would be unable to sell it to the rest of Congress before the November elections. Mr. Packwood said today that nothing had happened to change his view.
''I don't know what the impact of the Persian Gulf is; I haven't been able to figure it out yet,'' he said. ''But if the argument has been that the deficit is our most important problem and we need to agree on cutting it, I don't see that the situation in the Persian Gulf has changed that problem.''
Negotiators have been deeply divided over how the spending cuts should be divided between military and domestic spending, and the Persian Gulf flare-up will do little to resolve those differences. While lawmakers say events in the gulf should theoretically have little to do with cutting the elements of the military budget that involved countering a Soviet threat, they agreed that the psychological effect of gulf tension could weigh against Pentagon cuts.
''If there is an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia, all bets are off on defense cuts,'' Mr. Packwood said.
 
Escape Clauses in Budget Law
In fact, all bets may be off in any event, due to some provisions in the balanced-budget law. The automatic spending cuts that are due to take effect under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law on Oct. 1 if agreement is not reached on cutting the deficit can be waived by the President with the consent of Congress, if there is a recession or if economic projections predict two consecutive quarters of economic contraction.
The automatic cuts would also be immediately suspended if Congress declared war.
But lawmakers in both parties said it was hard to imagine that anyone at the White House was paying a great deal of attention to the fine points of the budget law right now. As a senior Congressional budget aide said, ''For the time being, I have taken my budget charts and graphs off the wall and replaced them with a map of the Persian Gulf.''

GRAPHIC: Photo: ''We now certainly have a sense of crisis; the only problem is that it is the wrong crisis,'' said Leon E. Panetta, left, House Budget Committee chairman. Pete V. Domenici, Republican on Senate Budget Committee, said ''The outcome of the budget negotiations this fall will be determined by the events in the Persian Gulf over the next few weeks.''

HEADLINE: The Emergency's Here: Use the Oil

 BODY:
American consumers are being ''ripped off on a massive scale,'' Senator Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut said yesterday, voicing anger felt around the country. The anger is directed at gas stations and oil companies that jacked up prices even though the gasoline they were selling was imported long before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
Is that price-gouging? Yes, but trying to do something about it would punish consumers worse. If regulators tried to roll back prices, they would create severe shortages reminiscent of the tortuous gas lines of the 1970's. Nevertheless, Congressional Democrats exhort President Bush to stop the price-gouging. 
They ought to focus instead on something useful that Mr. Bush can do: Open the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, 600 million barrels of oil stored in underground salt domes along the Gulf Coast. Prudent use of the oil reserve can calm jittery markets and minimize the impact of Saddam Hussein's aggression.
As demonstrated anew by yesterday's dramatic announcement that troops will be sent to Saudi Arabia, the President has so far skillfully orchestrated the military and diplomatic counterattack. But by refusing to tap the reserve, he is fumbling the economic response.
The United Nations embargo of oil from Iraq and Kuwait will, if enforced, cut off 8 percent of the world's oil supply. That's no small hit. And traders, fearing the worst, have begun to hoard every barrel in sight, thereby adding to the disruption. The combination of interrupted supply and panicky demand has driven crude oil prices $10 a barrel above last month's level.
That has surely produced windfall profits for wholesalers and retailers who bought oil at pre-invasion prices. Such profits are infuriating but they are not easily eliminated. If Congress were to try, by temporarily rolling back retail gas prices, the outcome would be calamitous. Speculators would hoard low-price gas until the price controls were lifted. That's a recipe for severe shortage. And meanwhile, the artificially low prices would send precisely the wrong signal to consumers, who ought to be conserving petroleum.
Denouncing gas station owners won't help consumers. What would help them is extra supply. That could come from Saudi Arabia, which has now promised to pump an extra two million barrels a day. And it could come from the Strategic Reserve, which was created after the 1973-74 oil crisis as a defense against temporary supply interruptions. In combination with similar buffer stocks in Japan and Europe, the reserve is large enough to offset the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil for up to a year. All that's necessary is a declaration by President Bush that an emergency exists.
The Administration balks because selling oil from the reserve smacks of price control. That misses the point. The purpose of tapping the reserve is not to put a permanent lid on prices. It's to mitigate a temporary supply crunch created by the President's decision, unquestionably correct, to organize a worldwide embargo. The crunch has been made worse by hoarding, which would ease as soon as the President announced the opening of the Strategic Reserve.
If Saudi Arabia pumps extra oil as promised, that solves half the problem. The strategic reserve can handle the rest of the imbalance. The U.S. spent billions to create the reserve as a buffer against temporary disruptions. This crisis is the time to reap the benefit of that investment.
The choice is not, as the Administration implies, between competitive markets and price controls. It is between economic damage and minor irritation. This is an emergency; that's what lifeboats are for.

HEADLINE: In South Africa: The Nightmare Ebbs

 BODY:
The world is too absorbed by the Persian Gulf to be wholly attentive, but there's stunning news from South Africa:
An ''armed struggle'' that began 29 years ago has been suspended by Nelson Mandela's African National Congress as part of a landmark bargain with President F. W. de Klerk. And for his part, South Africa's reforming President has agreed to the phased release of some 1,500 political prisoners and to the return of more than 20,000 anti-Government exiles.
This gives substance to hopes for peace, and removes a stubborn obstacle to full-scale talks on a non-racist constitution for South Africa. 
The suspension of the armed struggle finally gives President de Klerk something to show to his own supporters. If he has gone only partway in meeting Mr. Mandela's demand for immediate release of all prisoners, at least a deadline has been set and the principle accepted. It is a compromise that surely augurs well for wider talks on South Africa's future.
Now both leaders will need all their resourcefulness to bridge deeper divergences. They are pledged to redouble efforts to curb violence in Natal, where fighting between rival black movements has cost 1,200 lives this year.
Also ahead is the daunting task of reconciling different visions in a society that is haunted by ethnic hatreds, political rivalry and a gaping inequality of income.
Mr. Mandela firmly demands a one-person-one-vote system that would empower blacks. Mr. de Klerk agrees that suffrage should be multiracial, but seeks entrenched constitutional guarantees to protect minority rights. This circle could be squared with a system of checks and balances, incorporating a bill of rights and enforced by an independent judiciary.
The African National Congress is pledged to nationalize industry and radically redistribute wealth. For his part, Mr. de Klerk says his insistence on a free market economy is non-negotiable. But Socialist economies have failed in Africa as well as in Europe.
It would make more sense for Mr. Mandela to press for more jobs, better pay and opportunity in a country where 88 percent of the wealth is controlled by only 5 percent of the people, nearly all of them white.
South Africans will decide these arguments but Americans can help promote their peaceful resolution. When full-scale negotiations begin, Congress can prudently review U.S. sanctions as conditions for easing them are met.
Against all the odds, leaders of decency and sense are moving forward, and the long nightmare appears to be moving steadily away from apocalypse and toward peace. Even in crisis elsewhere, that is news worth celebration.

HEADLINE: For Congress, One Month Left

 BODY:
Finding nothing so urgent that can't wait till September, Congress broke for its summer vacation right on schedule. The budget deficit? Manana. Curbs on campaign contributions? Clean air? Child care? Some other day. New taxes? Horrors. 
This 101st Congress returns after Labor Day, and breaks again on Oct. 5 to campaign. If it wants to be known for more than procrastination, that will be a busy month.
Nothing marks this Congress's non-accomplishment so vividly as its failure to frame a budget. Even its few accomplishments will be limited by the widening gap between spending and revenue. The admirable AIDS treatment bill offers an example. It authorizes nearly $900 million a year to deal with the epidemic as a natural disaster, with urgently needed help for places like New York City. But in the end, there's no way of knowing how much will actually be appropriated.
Budget negotiations with the White House have been under way for three months. They have gotten absolutely nowhere - and the deficit has gotten bigger. The crisis in the Middle East will only make agreement more difficult, reinforcing the case for more defense spending. And that's on top of rising costs for the savings and loan bailout, and sagging revenues from the slowdown in the nation's economic activity.
The budget negotiators now promise to get serious next month. But after five years of fudging, such promises aren't worth much. Time alone will tell. And meanwhile the House and Senate have been fattening this year's money bills with extras as if there were no problem. The House and Senate farm bills are prime examples. President Bush properly threatens a veto if the final bill is not trimmed.
On some issues that don't require Federal funds, Congress has scored impressively this year. Both the House and Senate passed civil rights legislation to undo Supreme Court decisions that have eroded job discrimination laws - but a veto is threatened. Both houses voted unanimously to require double hulls on oil tankers. But a House-Senate conference on the clean air bill has made almost no headway in resolving wide disparities in their two versions.
On issues closer to home - members' behavior and campaign financing - the record is still murky. The Senate took the rare step of denouncing a fellow member, Dave Durenberger of Minnesota, for improper financial dealings. But his egregious misconduct also warrants stripping him of seniority; his G.O.P. colleagues won't even convene a meeting to consider the question.
Meanwhile, not a word from the Senate Ethics Committee on the ''Keating Five'' Senators who pressured savings and loan regulators on behalf of a large contributor, or on Senator Alfonse D'Amato of New York, who is under investigation for questionable fund-raising and favoritism.
As for the larger question of campaign finance, there's no law yet, but the Senate has passed a strong bill and the House has at least passed some bill. That gives reason to hope that a post-vacation conference can produce meaningful reform.
There's plenty of work to do, and there won't be much time to do it.

HEADLINE: Don't Pin Housing Drop on Savings and Loans

 BODY:
To the Editor:
It came as a small surprise to see the country's housing leaders cite the savings and loan crisis as a primary reason for a looming economic recession and a continuing drop in new housing starts (front page, July 19).
The savings and loan industry is the favorite whipping boy on Capitol Hill. If there are too many unsold homes on the market, if interest rates go up, if the Federal deficit balloons, blame the savings and loans. 
It is time to stop sticking pins in the savings and loan industry. Other mortgage lenders, such as commercial banks, have cut their mortgage lending activity. Mortgage bankers have also pared their lending activity. Both have escaped unfavorable treatment in the news media.
Declining housing starts are removed from the savings and loan crisis. The slowdown in housing starts, as well as in resales, results from the public's refusal, and inability, to pay the prices. In the 1980's, Mr. and Mrs. Average American wanted to take advantage of the equity in their homes and trade up to the home of their dreams. The real estate market was quickly glutted with trade-up houses, and the price tags were too high for most people.
Instead of blaming the savings and loans for the slump in real estate, economists should look at the reasons for the high cost of housing. To a large extent, this country has gone through unprecedented prosperity coupled with runaway inflation. People were working, incomes were rising, and money was to be made in almost every market. The cost of housing, like everything else, took off.
Financial institutions did not set the prices on new housing starts. Builder-developers sent prices skyrocketing with each new development. Prospective buyers were encouraged to buy before a price increase took effect. Houses that came on the market at $200,000 quickly advanced to $250,000.
Savings and loans had nothing to do with the exorbitant price tags. Congress should direct the bulk of its criticism for the housing slump at the builders. Sooner or later, builders had to realize that the real estate bubble would burst, and the party would be over.

HEADLINE: The Catskills Trade In a Little Glitz for Much More Substance

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Talk of Sullivan County'' (news article, July 13) depicts several issues as the burning issues of the moment in Sullivan County, New York.
While the tourist economy has indeed changed dramatically, I would hardly describe the county as a depressed, withered, crumbling community ''where crack houses co-exist with Catskill resorts.'' That our bungalows have declined and the resorts have lost prominence is not the travesty you imply, but merely evidence of a changing, adapting - yes, even vital - economy that has diversified and evolved beyond the traditions of the past. 
The county's tourist economy, different though it may be, still thrives with more than one million tourists enjoying our county annually. We have also become a major second-home area in the last decade - an industry that contributes far more stability to our economy than did the tourism of the past. Our economy has also evolved into a much more diverse and productive one; roughly 4,000 new jobs were added in the last five years, despite a net loss of hotel employment, with average weekly earnings rising 40 percent during this time, ranking us third in the state.
We have our problems, but they are those of success, not failure. As the third fastest growing county in the state in population as well as wage gain, we face the problem of fast-paced growth and development, not of a withering economy. Visual quality, a focal point in your article, is just one of many more important issues the county has begun to address through various measures. A recently appointed task force is working on a master plan for the county that we hope will make greater headway into many of these issues.
Your focus on the declining segments of traditional tourism is understandable, given the historical reputation of Sullivan County for its world-class resorts - a reputation that has lost some of its luster. However, this focus fails to acknowledge what Sullivan County has become - a livable, diverse community that is still a haven for many city dwellers seeking rural relief while attracting a growing number of permanent residents who are enchanted with our bucolic countryside, saner pace of life and more affordable housing. If we have traded a little of the glitz for much more substance, perhaps the trade-off will serve us better in the long term.

HEADLINE: OBSERVER;
Someone Has to Pay

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
My plan was to wax wroth today about gasoline prices being raised at Biff's Exxon before Iraq's Wehrmacht had moved more than 10 yards into money-rich Kuwait. Luckily, while I was searching for the wax my gaze fell on a New York Times story that took the steam out of me.
This was one of those fuller-explanation stories that make The Times indispensable to people who would rather know what's going on than foam at the mouth. Being of the foamer species, I studied it with deepening gloom. 
If I read it right, it would be childish to throw a fit about Biff or accuse oil tycoons of putting razor to the motorist's throat. The only villains, it seems, are (1) psychology and (2) computers.
Precisely how these two did the dirty deed at Biff's is something I'm not ready to be examined on. Accounts of how the marketplace works its miracles have tended to numb my brain ever since I dropped out of Economics 101 on the pretext of having to attend my mother-in-law's funeral, and ended up failing Logic 102 after the professor pointed out that since I was not yet married a dead mother-in-law was a logical absurdity.
In short, I may have a finer point or two about the oil market wrong. Still, the twin messages of the Times story seemed clear enough: (1) Iraq's move created an instant psychological need for gasoline-price rises. (2) The existence of computers transmitted this psychological hunger across the country faster than a clutch of program traders can wipe out the stock market by electronically switching all their business to the $100 window at Pimlico.
The result: Biff had his ladder up against his sign before you could say, ''Saddam Hussein and King Hussein are not related.''
Naturally I figured Biff being up the ladder meant the price of gasoline was finally dropping a couple of cents per gallon in response to the excess stocks of crude oil burdening the market. I had been reading all summer about that excess crude oil and wondered when it would lead to a price drop at Biff's.
Oh sure, I knew about the refinery in Louisiana that's always out of order whenever crude-oil stocks become excessive, and I knew that this breakdown always keeps gasoline prices unnaturally high long after they would otherwise decline.
So I said to Biff up the ladder: ''Finally posting a drop in prices, I see, Biff. Guess that means they fixed that refinery down in Louisiana.''
Biff said, no, he didn't expect they'd get that refinery fixed in his lifetime, or even his grandchildren's, and he was going up to post a price increase, not a cut. ''Say it's not so, Biff.'' ''Saddam Hussein marched into Kuwait two minutes ago,'' he replied.
Not wanting Biff to think me an ignorant provincial, I rushed to the library to read up on Saddam Hussein, so didn't ask Biff why he had jacked up prices faster than instantly. Now of course I know. It was because psychology was moving faster than the speed of Superman.
I suppose Biff was sitting by his cash register in a light doze, dreaming of the bad old days when he not only had to pump gas for his customers but also had to give them road maps free instead of charging $2.50. With his mind idling like this, it would have been highly receptive to psychological transmissions from oil headquarters, where computers of course were humming furiously.
Biff has no computer, but a mere second on the hot line to Exxon Interplanetary would have sufficed for him to get a recorded message: ''Saddam Hussein has invaded Kuwait.''
Biff must have murmured, ''By George, I feel an irresistible psychological need to boost prices,'' and gone to it.
Understanding this, thanks to The Times's fuller explanation, I cannot pour bile on good old Biff or even on psychology-and-computer-driven oil tycoons without suffering the guilt that follows a bout of unfair journalism.
But surely someone must be made to pay. Fuming against Saddam Hussein would be worse than useless, for Saddam Hussein is an Arab, and few things improve the Arab day more than evidence that an Arab has made an American fume.
It's just as useless to denounce the evils of psychology and computers. I have tried it before. The only result is a flood of letters from smug know-it-alls sneering at either your ignorance of electronics or your patently childish sexual inhibitions.
Let us rage then against Henry Ford the Founder for enslaving us to these doom machines. Without them, Saddam Hussein would be just another Hussein not related to the King.

HEADLINE: Tobacco Companies Find Harlem Wary

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
For years Harlem Week - a celebration of black culture and achievement -has relied on companies like Philip Morris and Heublein Inc. to underwrite its concerts, athletic competitions and receptions.
But this year, amid protests over the heavy advertising of tobacco and alcohol in black and Hispanic communities and some threats to disrupt the festival, the organizers of Harlem Week, which began on Monday, have decided to give some of these companies a lower profile.
When promotional posters and banners go up, the names of sponsors will still be on them, but without words like ''rum,'' ''vodka'' or ''beer.'' The festival has banned for several years the advertising of cigarette brands, though it lets the parent companies like Philip Morris use their corporate names.
''We believe there's an excess proliferation of tobacco and liquor promotion in our community,'' said Lloyd Williams, president of the Uptown Chamber of Commerce, which organizes Harlem Week. 
Throughout the nation, black and Hispanic organizations, including newspapers and professional associations, that have relied on money from alcohol and tobacco companies are wrestling with an issue that pits their financial viability against what protesters say is the health of the communities they serve.
As recipients of corporate money, minorities straddle a particularly uncomfortable line. Blacks, for instance, smoke and suffer smoking-related diseases at a higher rate than whites. At the same time, tobacco companies are praised for being among the first businesses to recognize the value of supporting black organizations and events.
Some publishers of newspapers and magazines aimed at minority readers said that tobacco and alcohol companies took out advertisements when no one else would.
''I had a beer distributor that gave me advertising for six months and kept me alive,'' said Tino Duran, publisher of two Spanish-language weeklies in Texas and president of the National Association of Hispanic Publications. ''If it hadn't been for that kind of advertising, I wouldn't be in business today.''
 
A Bill in Congress
But several minority organizations have re-examined their policies, influenced by a general concern about health, work by the anti-smoking lobby, the marketing practices of some of the companies and the efforts of the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Dr. Louis W. Sullivan, who is black and has made the health of minorities a priority.
The concern about marketing has also resulted from well-publicized crusades by community leaders like the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d in Harlem and the Rev. Michael Pfleger in Chicago. At the same time, minority health-related organizations have rallied behind a bill pending in Congress that would severely restrict cigarette advertising. According to Matthew Myers, director of the Coalition on Smoking or Health, a group of 40 national organizations that endorse the bill, minority health professionals are increasingly speaking out about the costs of cigarette smoking.
''It's a frustration among those of us in the health community,'' Mr. Myers said. ''In our society today tobacco takes its greatest toll in the minority communities, and yet until recently very few members of the minority community spoke up loudly.''
Critics charge that tobacco companies have aggressively gone after black and Hispanic customers as their overall market shrinks. A major concern is the use of billboards, which these critics see as an indiscriminate medium that reaches minors.
 
Fighting With Paint
It is not the first time that such advertising has been criticized, but tobacco and alcohol companies said this was the first time the attacks had come from black and Hispanic groups.
Thirty-four percent of black adults smoke, compared with 28 percent of white adults and 27 percent of Hispanic adults, according to a 1989 study by the Simmons Market Research Bureau. Sixty-four percent of white people drink alcohol, compared with 63 percent of Hispanic people and 60 percent of black people, the bureau reported.
In a highly publicized campaign that has spread to other cities, Mr. Butts, pastor of the Abyssinian Baptist Church, and members of his congregation have been taking to the streets with long-handled rollers and white paint to cover billboards that advertise cigarettes and liquor in Harlem.
''You don't see that in the white community,'' he said. ''They don't do it anywhere else like that. It's criminal.''
But leaders like Benjamin L. Hooks, executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, have accused critics of implying that blacks are not capable of making their own choices.
The executive vice president of the National Urban League, Frank Lomax 3d, said his organization would continue accepting money from tobacco and alcohol companies because ''all corporations in America have a responsibility to help address some of the problems facing urban communities.''
 
Saturating Black Neighborhoods
Advertisers deny that they aim their messages at black and Hispanic people disproportionately, and they say the protests are isolated.
''Our experience has been that the protesters are very few in number and represent extreme elements of anti-smoking groups and are not representative of the general population that attend our events or receive advertising from us,'' said John R. Nelson, a spokesman for Philip Morris U.S.A., maker of Marlboro cigarettes and Miller beer.
But the issue has not been lost among some organizations with sponsorship ties to the companies. The National Association of Black Journalists did not have Philip Morris as a sponsor when its annual conference met in Los Angeles last week, for the first time in at least 10 years. A deeply divided board of directors decided to forgo $40,000 that it had expected to receive from the tobacco maker.
 
The Uptown Uproar
The organization's president, Thomas Morgan, a reporter for The New York Times, said the board's vote was prompted by reports earlier this year that the R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Company planned to test market Uptown, a menthol cigarette specifically aimed at black smokers. The news caused an uproar, and the company canceled the product.
The National Coalition of Hispanic Health and Human Services Organizations severed its financial ties with alcohol companies three years ago and since then has encouraged other Hispanic groups to take a similar stand.
The organizers of Harlem Week, which runs through Aug. 19, have adopted a compromise. They have continued accepting sponsorships from tobacco companies in the name of the parent company, not the cigarette brand. This year they told a dozen alcohol companies that are also sponsors that they could use the company or brand name on promotional materials but without naming the alcoholic beverage and in smaller type than ''Harlem Week,'' Mr. Williams said. For example, Mr. Williams said, ''Hennessey cognac'' could be used in the past in promotional materials, but this year only the importer's name, Schieffelin & Somerset Company, can be used.
Mr. Duran and other publishers said those who criticize alcohol and cigarette advertising should also consider economic impact.
''We're concerned about the criticism. Is this forcing us to cut back or be less likely to support minority groups? The answer is no,'' said a Heublein spokesman, John A. Shea. ''We have a longstanding commitment to the minority community.''
Companies are also responding to some of the concerns. In New York, some billboard companies like Sale Point Posters put up public service announcements to replace the alchohol and tobacco advertisements. Metropolitan Outdoor Advertising moved the advertisements away from churches, schools and playgrounds. Some advertisers announced that they would no longer advertise on billboards in any low-income neighborhood.
But Mr. Butts is not satisfied. He wants a nationwide halt of all alcohol and cigarette billboard advertising, and he is stating his case with periodic demonstrations in front of Philip Morris headquarters in Manhattan. He said he knows of sympathizers who have also vowed to monitor Harlem Week events and tear down any such open advertising if they run into it.
''The community is really upset,'' he said. ''They want it to stop.''

HEADLINE: Crime, Police And Politics;
A Game of Numbers With a Long History

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins's decision to hire 1,058 more police officers is the latest in a long string of similar pledges by recent mayors and would-be mayors of New York City, maneuvers in a numbers game that has as much to do with political appearances as with fighting crime.
Last week, the City Council proposed hiring about half that number of officers by cutting the current budget, and Mr. Dinkins said he was not sure that the city could afford to do so. On Monday, he said it not only could do so, but must.
Why? The short answer, the Mayor's own aides acknowledge, is that four children have been shot and killed by bullets intended for others in recent weeks. New Yorkers, still testing their new mayor and impatient in the face of record-high crime, demanded a visceral response. Police hiring was the lethal weapon at hand. 
''It's been the red meat of local politics for the last 10 or 12 years,'' said Raymond D. Horton, president of the Citizens Budget Commission, a watchdog group financed primarily by businesses.
 
Promises by Koch
Police officials say they will be glad to have the new recruits, but they are also among the first to warn that more officers alone will not solve the crime problem or protect sleeping children from stray bullets.
Former Mayor Edward I. Koch made the same sorts of promises on hiring, a good number of which did not come true on time, or ended up barely keeping pace with retirements in what is by far the nation's largest police force. The principal difference is that he seemed to seize the initiative with such brio that it took the mayoral campaign last year for his opponents to make much of a fuss about why all the hiring had not occurred.
So what will happen now? Not much, since the first of the officers will not become recruits at the Police Academy until October and because of the time needed for training will not be on the streets until next spring, or available for regular assignments in patrol cars until the fall of 1991.
Of course, if Mr. Dinkins had not moved to hire more officers now, the city would be that much further behind in its elusive goal of restoring the 26,000-member Police Department to its pre-fiscal crisis strength of about 31,000 officers. And Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown's strategy of ''community policing'' - with its heavy emphasis on foot patrols - requires a lot of staffing.
The city loses more than 2,000 officers a year through attrition, so it must pedal hard just to stand still. Together with the previously scheduled hiring of 3,000 that was to have produced a net gain of 1,000 officers by next summer, the new hiring is intended to make a total gain of about 2,000 in the three departments - transit, housing and the main force.
Even that would mean a relative handful of extra officers on duty in a typical precinct at any time. But when some precincts have only one or two patrol cars available on the midnight shift as they do now, every little bit helps. #2 Percent Rise in Crime Even if all the officers are hired, correlations between the number of police officers and crime are extremely tenuous. In the early 1980's, as the size of the New York force increased markedly, crime declined, but it began climbing again in late 1985, even as the force was still growing.
In the first three months of the year, the most recent period for which final statistics are available, there were 61,356 reported crimes in January, 53,355 in February and 57,453 in March. Police officials say preliminary figures for the months since then show little change, though crime has risen by about 2 percent compared with last year and murders are expected to reach an all-time high of 2,000 or more by December.
But beyond these broad trends, what forced the Mayor's hand on the hiring was alarming individual crimes and headlines that quoted Mr. Dinkins as insisting that ''this is not Dodge City'' (although he was merely answering a television reporter who had asked, ''Is this Dodge City?'').
In the face of complaints that he never did enough advance planning, Mr. Koch vowed in 1984 to have 30,600 officers by 1988, and he repeated unequivocally in April 1987 that he would meet that goal. But in February 1988 he said fiscal uncertainty meant the goal would have to be postponed, and he in fact delayed a number of police classes to save money.
 
Looking for Money
On his third day in office last January, Mr. Dinkins delayed hiring more than 1,800 rookies because of unexpected revenue shortfalls. He vowed on Monday to do everything possible to hire the 1,058 officers. It could be politically disastrous for him to renege on that pledge after having been so publicly pressured into it.
Still, it remains unclear how the new officers will be paid for, and whether they can all be hired. Mr. Dinkins will finance the cost of the officers - and increases for prosecutors, jails, legal aid and community anti-crime groups - through about $26 million in cuts from other services.
But in the fiscal year that starts next July, the cost of the officers, including their employment benefits, will rise to about $66 million while the cuts made now will translate into only about $31 million on an annual basis. The difference will have to be made up through new revenue - probably higher taxes - or further cuts.
In the meantime, there is little prospect of improvement in the local economy, and the State Financial Control Board recently warned that tax revenues in the next fiscal year are likely to be about $1 billion short of what the city will need to pay the planned cost of all its programs - and that was before the new hiring was announced.

HEADLINE: EDUCATION;
Trade Schools: Defaults And Broken Promises

SERIES: Students in Default: A Troubled Agency - Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS

 BODY:
Bonnie Rodgers says the trade school recruiters knocked on her door, left leaflets in her courtyard and even approached her outside the city welfare office, serenading her with phrases like ''financial aid'' and ''job placement.''
When she enrolled in a $2,800 course to become a nurse's assistant, she thought she was on her way out of poverty.
She wasn't. Although she made the trade school's honor roll, she still lency test, and she says her course certificate is worthless on the job market. Still on welfare, she is struggling to repay a $2,500 Federal student loan for a course that, she discovered, a public program offers free. 
 
'Bill Over My Head'
''It didn't do anything for me,'' she said. ''I've got a bill over my head and I still need an education.''
Critics of the nation's 4,000 private trade schools say experiences like Ms. Rodgers's are common. They say that many schools are more interested in harvesting financial aid dollars than in helping students, and that the schools often use dishonest recruiting techniques, admit unqualified students and provide them with inadequate teachers and equipment.
The schools are paid up front, often through Federal loans and grants signed over by low-income students. But with low-paying jobs, or no jobs at all, many students default, leaving taxpayers with the bill. Federal officials say defaults will top $2.4 billion this year, and although trade school students account for only 22 percent of the loans, they produce 44 percent of the defaults.
Defaults at trade schools, also called proprietary schools, have helped lead the nation's largest student-loan guarantor, the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, to the brink of collapse. The foundation is a nonprofit corporation that guarantees more than $9 billion in student loans, more than a third of them to proprietary school students.
The Government, which must repay 80 percent of defaulted loans to banks if the corporation collapses, is now trying to arrange a bailout.
 
Senate Hears Testimony
In February, Senate hearings produced testimony critical of virtually every aspect of the trade school industry, ranging from recruiters who promise too much to banks that do too little to collect on government-backed loans.
Texas officials have described a graduate of a truck driving institute who borrowed more than $5,000 only to learn that she could not get a state license - she had only one foot. Last year, state officials suspended a Houston trade school from the student loan program after it sent recruiting buses to other cities, signed up students at homeless shelters and helped them apply for aid.
The number of defaults, ''taken together with the scandals that have gone on in some of these trade schools, has sent out a clarion call for tighter regulations and stricter laws,'' said Representative Pat Williams, Democrat of Montana, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Post-Secondary Education.
No one knows the number of trade schools engaged in abuses. ''It's a minority,'' he said, ''but it's such a large minority that it's creating an educational crisis in this country.''
Defenders of the schools say abuses are limited. ''What you have is a handful of schools that badly abuse the program,'' said Stephen J. Blair, president of the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools. But even he estimated that about 15 percent of proprietary schools were engaging in objectionable practices.
 
Industry Cites Success
Mr. Blair said that on the whole the industry recruits qualified students and provides them with marketable skills. He said 61 percent of trade school students completed the programs, as against 43 percent of students at community colleges. He said 81 percent of graduates found jobs in their fields.
Citing studies by the trade school industry, Mr. Blair said it trains 74 percent of the nation's surgical technicians, 52 percent of its computer programmers and 33 percent of its secretaries.
About one-third of the trade school students default on loans, as against 7 percent at four-year universities. While critics say the figures reflect the inadequate programs and graduates' inability to get jobs, the schools say they are simply dealing with students from poorer backgrounds.
Last year, Lauro F. Cavazos, the Secretary of Education, called student-aid abuses ''rampant,'' a charge Mr. Blair disputes.
Complaints about abuses may rise with new welfare rules that will take effect this fall. Under the requirements of the 1988 Family Support Act, increased numbers of welfare recipients will be required to join work or training programs. That is expected to raise proprietary school enrollment, now about 1.8 million.
 
Diligence and Good Grades
Many trade school students become disillusioned and drop out, but not Ms. Rodgers. She has preserved a mound of notes, grades and honor roll certificates that showcase her diligence. A report card from one 13-week period shows her with a 96 average.
Ms. Rodgers, a 35-year-old single mother with five children, said she had been on welfare for about eight years when she decided to enroll in late 1986. Recruited by many schools, she settled on the Americo Technical Careers Institute.
The school's promise of financial aid sounded good, she said, but the words ''job placement'' sounded even better. Although the school manual stated that ''placement assistance is not to guarantee employment,'' Ms. Rodgers said that distinction was lost on her. ''When they said 'job placement,' I expected to be placed on a job,'' she said.
Ms. Rodgers, a 10th grade dropout, had to take an entrance exam, but she does not recall it's being difficult. ''I assume they accept everyone,'' she said. ''I knew people in there that couldn't do much reading.''
To pay for the $2,800 course, she said, she got $4,600 in Federal aid - a $2,100 grant and a $2,500 guaranteed loan; the aid not used for tuition was for living expenses. #66.1 Percent Default Government figures show that in the 1988 fiscal year, 66.1 percent of the loans to Americo's students were in default -1,739 loans worth almost $2.5 million.
Ms. Rodgers says many students enrolled just to get the living expenses. But her diligence is seen in pages of medical terms, like polydipsia and the integumentary system, carefully copied from a textbook. Now she says she did ''more memorizing and not as much understanding.'' Her view of her educational shortcomings seems borne out by her failure, even after a subsequent 16-week course, to pass a test for a general equivalency diploma.
But her biggest disappointment came when she wanted to turn her high-90's grades into a high-paying job. She says the school referred her to a job placement agency where she would be required to pay a fee. Unwilling to pay more money, she said she began putting in applications on her own, but found no interest.
 
Still on Welfare
Six months later, still on welfare, her first loan repayments came due, and she soon became another account number on a long list of defaults by Americo's students.
Marvin Copes, national director of education for American Educators, the company that owns Americo, said Ms. Rodgers's subsequent inability to pass a GED test does not indicate she was unprepared for the course. He said the Americo course tends to test more practical skills than does the GED test.
He said ''it is not normal'' for Americo students to be asked to pay a job placement fee, He said more than 85 percent of the school's graduates find jobs in a related field and offered to provide Ms. Rodgers with a free refresher course. ''I think the school is very sincere in its objectives,'' he said.
He would not speculate on reasons for the high default rate, but said repayment was the students' responsibility, not the school's.
Ms. Rodgers now works part time in a recreation program at a public housing project. Along with public assistance, the work brings her monthly income to about $350, she said. Out of that, she said, she has made four $50 payments on the loan, hoping to whittle it down so that someday she can re-enroll, this time in a public university.
Ms. Rodgers says her phone still rings with two types of callers, credit agencies pushing for faster loan repayment, and trade school recruiters. ''I told them I have been into that and I don't want to be involved with these schools no more,'' she said.

Is the Killer Jacket Losing Its Grip?

BYLINE: By WOODY HOCHSWENDER

 BODY:
MEN'S fashions were center stage in New York last week as leading designers showed their spring 1991 lines. The dominant message was hang loose. The antidote to the french-cuffed, pin-collared, my-suit-wants-to-eat-you-for-breakfast 1980's seems to be a roomier, slouchier, less uptight Mr. Dude.
Men's fashions don't change all that much, but they are constantly evolving. As proof, just look at yourself in a photograph from the mid-70's. (Then again, maybe you'd better not.) The current direction, with its easier, less restrictive silhouettes, recalls the boxy sack suits of the early 1960's and follows in the steps of recent women's collections. (Remember: men's wear became more feminine in the 1960's, too.) Among the feminizing touches: softer, unconstructed jackets; ''couturified'' sportswear items, like ponchos in silk and T-shirts in pure linen or spandex; all-white ensembles, and lots of pale, exotic colors like pistachio, mauve, ''mist linen'' and ''aqua mustard.'' (''Hey, Bob, throw me my pistachio jacket, will you?'') In some collections, shoulder padding has been removed, paralleling a similar reduction in women's clothing. But in others, like Bill Robinson's, suit shoulders retain an exaggerated sweep. Double-breasted jackets, once seen only in embassies, banks and speak-easies, are an accepted part of contemporary men's fashion. And there were a lot of them last week, from Isaac Mizrahi's white terry-cloth blazer to Joseph Abboud's creamy ivory tuxedo. 
Mr. Mizrahi bubbles with ideas, and his first complete collection for men was irrepressible, from its elegant hayseed looks, like seersucker overalls, to cabana sets in graphic patterns, which you may have been subjected to as a child in Miami.
Allow him to free associate: the classic men's rep tie, transformed into colorful banded rep trousers; slickers in red, yellow and white, lined in gingham check; overalls in floral paisley - to heck with the feed store. Mr. Mizrahi also showed several rajah, or Nehru, jackets, like the kind he wears himself.
These are clothes to bring out the man within the man. The timing may be right. People tend to wear more colorful clothes in times of recession, as a relief from the prevailing grayness in the economy.
Ronaldus Shamask is a designer's designer. Among those in the audience at Roseland last week for his fashion show were Geoffrey Beene, Mary McFadden, Randolph Duke and Jeffrey Banks.
Down the runway lumbered big, hunky guys with their jackets hanging loose, a couple days' stubble on their faces and Birkenstock sandals on their feet. Their trousers were held up by belts of rope. Could this be fashion? Check the prices. Brother, can you spare around $1,200?
Looking a bit like broke money managers roused from a park bench, the men wore long, loose ''JFK'' jackets, although they recalled Bobby more than Jack, with thin lapels and various button stances, usually very high, showing just a peak of necktie. Completing the look were high-waisted pleated trousers, often cropped.
Clearly, not a look to wear to the office, unless you follow the financial ticker from your beach house. But Mr. Shamask isn't really dressing men for work so much as for play. And his sportswear is crisply imaginative, from the plaid linen cardigan jackets to the crocheted vests and reversible mackintoshes.
Another designer from the slouch school is Bill Robinson. For his fashion show at Laura Belle, a discotheque on West 43d Street, Mr. Robinson sent the models out with shirts untucked, unconstructed jackets hanging loose, and either chukka boots or Converse All-Star high-top sneakers on their feet.
Among the hits were chenille sport jackets in khaki and blue, all-white beach clothes and big parkas in suede and canvas. Mr. Robinson is a terrific outerwear designer. When it comes to tailored clothing, he favors an extended shoulder that slopes and looks a little bunchy. This footballer look, especially in bold regatta-striped blazers, can be a bit theatrical.
For all the new ideas, the average man might ask, when will designers come up with a truly practical advance? A proper business suit, say, for 90-degree weather?
Alexander Julian has devoted himself to precisely that task. Mr. Julian, who works within traditional men's wear shapes but pushes the edge of the envelope when it comes to fabrics, has come up with hopsack-weave linen that is effectively half air. Whipped up into a three-button suit, the fabric is light as a feather and cool to wear. (The suit will be available next spring at about $900.) Another piece Mr. Julian takes particular pride in is a shirt of yarn-dyed Jacquard linen. The fabric, developed by the designer in Italy, is in the permanent collection of the Smithsonian Institution.
Joseph Abboud, who was declared the best men's wear designer of 1989 by the Council of Fashion Designers, appears to be all washed up. That is to say, stone-washed, sand-washed and river-washed, to name a few of the beatings his clothes go through.
Whether it's stone-washed khaki or linen trousers, a washed canvas jacket or sand-washed silk shirts, Mr. Abboud prefers clothing that has a patina of wear. He also makes excellent folk art sweaters and an extensive collection of ties, many with pale backgrounds. His look combines Mediterranean and Southwestern influences, Italian tailoring with ''broken pottery'' colors. It is handsome without being too adventurous.

HEADLINE: And There's Always Natural Gas

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Natural gas, long regarded by oil producers as the crab grass of fossil fuels, is getting new consideration because of the crisis in the Middle East.
Finding gas has always been a disappointment to drillers looking for oil; bringing natural gas to market requires expensive pipelines or other equipment, while oil can be loaded on tankers and sold anywhere on earth. As a result, huge volumes of gas have been found but left in the ground, especially in the third world.
''This is really a new business,'' said Robinson West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, a consulting firm in Washington. ''There is an enormous amount of gas, and gas reserves are located in different areas than oil reserves. Many importing countries have substantial gas reserves.'' 
Global oil reserves amount to about one trillion barrels, and gas reserves to the equivalent of about 665 billion. But the world uses five times as much oil as gas. That could change markedly if world governments believe that Saddam Hussein has created a long-term increase in the price of oil.
At C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc., a brokerage firm, Charles T. Maxwell, the vice chairman and energy strategist, pointed out that oil now meets about 37 percent of the world's energy needs, and 15 percent is from OPEC members. ''Now one guy is coming along, saying, 'I'm going to raise the price on that 15 percent.' '' he said. ''The other 85 percent isn't going to stand for it.'' Natural gas and coal producers will try to seize some of the oil market, he said.
The experience of the 1970's and 1980's was that a stiff increase in oil prices led to fuel-shifting and efficiency improvements that cut oil demand so sharply that a price war broke out among producers. This leads Mr. Maxwell and other analysts to doubt whether the current high oil prices can be sustained.
Another important feature of natural gas is that its reserves are dispersed compared with oil's. While OPEC members lay claim to about two-thirds of the world's oil reserves, they hold only about one-third of its gas.
But some oil-exporting countries, including OPEC members, are using more natural gas themselves, as are many oil-importing nations. But unlike importers, who want less dependence on oil, the exporters want gas to displace oil in their own economies and increase the volume of more valuable oil that they can export, say Mr. West and others.
Still, some natural gas exports come from OPEC members. Thomas R. Robinson, associate director for natural gas at Cambridge Energy Research Associates, a consulting firm in Cambridge, Mass., pointed out that Japan, the destination for most of the gas that is liquefied for transport, imports from Indonesia, which is an OPEC member. ''But it's not an OPEC question per se,'' he said.
Shell, Elf Aquitaine and Agit are considering a liquefied natural gas export project in Nigeria, and Exxon and Shell are considering a similar project in Venezuela, Mr. West said. Both countries are OPEC members and both are looking for more revenue.
 
Indigenous Use
A major market for natural gas may be indigenous use in the third world. The World Bank has been trying for several years to encourage third-world oil importers to use their gas reserves.
Petter Nore, a gas specialist at the bank's Natural Gas Development Unit, said that gas is usually priced in contracts that tie it to both oil and coal, so that even in a sharp run-up in oil prices, as is now occurring, the gas price is mitigated by that of the other fuel, increasing its price advantage over oil.
In addition, he said natural gas is perceived to have a greater security of supply than oil products. Part of this grows from the inflexibility of the supply: if it arrives by pipeline, it cannot be easily diverted. 75% Cost Reduction A study by the World Bank found eight oil-importing countries in which natural gas could be delivered to population centers for less than $1 per thousand cubic feet, less than a quarter of the cost for the same quantity of energy in the form of oil when oil is $28 a barrel.
Mr. Nore added, however, that the current crisis would have to persist to have an effect on many governments. ''You don't see a response in the gas situation just because Hussein does something for two months,'' he said. ''This would have to be something that you perceive to be a permanent shift.''
In the United States, natural gas has been priced in recent months at about 85 percent of the cost of oil, said Dr. Marion B. Stewart, an economist with National Economic Research Associates in White Plains. With the recent surge in oil prices, he said, ''my sense is that we have enough of a supply response on the part of gas producers that we will not see gas move up in lockstep; it will move up a good deal less.'' 500,000 Barrels a Day Consumption was declining this year because of weak economic activity, he said, and the oil price increase will add to gas's use. He expects that gas may be substituted for the use of about 500,000 barrels of oil a day. United States oil demand has lately been around 17 million barrels a day.
Some experts say the market for transportation fuel, where about 60 percent of United States oil use takes place, is particularly appropriate for natural gas. Theodore Eck, an economist at the Amoco Corporation, a large gas producer as well as an oil producer, said the consumption of 500,000 barrels of oil a day could be shifted to gas in a few years by conversion of fleet vehicles and trucks to natural gas.

HEADLINE: Five Years Needed to Clean Up Savings Fraud, U.S. Says

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Attorney General Dick Thornburgh said today that it would take the Government two to three years to secure indictments against most of the individuals it suspects of savings and loan fraud and five years to clean up most of the cases.
The Attorney General's remarks, made at a luncheon with reporters, outlined a timetable for criminal actions in savings and loan cases that roughly coincides with estimates of how long the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency overseeing the bailout, will need to seize and dispose of all the insolvent institutions and to sell their assets.
Later in the afternoon, the Justice Department announced two indictments among its top 100 cases, against former officers and borrowers of the Lamar Savings Association of Austin, Tex., and against the former chairman of the defunct Trinity Valley Savings and Loan Association of Beaumont, Tex. In the Lamar case, the Government said Stanley E. Adams Jr., the former chairman and principal stockholder, and other officers looted the institution of more than $121 million by setting up sham real estate transactions. 
In the Trinity Valley case, the former chairman, Alan Ross Rothery, a California Lawyer, was accused of embezzling $4 million from the institution from September 1985 to April 1987. Officials say he took deposits collected in the Beaumont area and lent them to real estate ventures he controlled in Los Alamitos, Calif., and then illegally diverted funds from those loans to his own use, as well as improperly receiving broker's commissions.
At the luncheon, Mr. Thornburgh said that the department had just begun addressing the 100 most significant fraud cases arising from the savings and loan debacle and that he did not expect to be able to ''redeploy some of the resources'' now devoted to savings and loan enforcement to other areas of criminal prosecution until 1995.
His comments were in line with an effort by the Bush Administration to orchestrate a low-key campaign to get out the message that one year after it began, the savings and loan bailout is working. Under Searing Criticism The Administration has come under searing criticism by Democrats for a slow start and bureaucratic squabbling that has delayed enforcement of the legislation signed by President Bush last Aug. 9.
Polls indicate that the public considers the savings and loan debacle one of the most important domestic issues as the fall elections approach and that it blames Republicans more than Democrats.
Mr. Thornburgh's remarks will be followed on Wednesday by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady's address to the National Press Club on the bailout and on Thursday by a talk by Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, to the Citizens for a Sound Economy, a Washington research group.Last week, Deputy Secretary John Robson briefed several groups on the matter.
Mr. Thornburgh, outlining results of the prosecutions so far, said the Government had brought 328 indictments and won 231 convictions so far, with prison terms in 78 percent of the cases. He said only five people had been acquitted. 234 F.B.I. Inquiries He added that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was currently examining 234 failed institutions.
''We are going to follow the evidence wherever it leads us,'' he said. The Attorney General also sought to answer some of his Congressional critics, who have contended that the department is investigating only a fraction of the 21,000 criminal referrals that regulators and others have made concerning fraud at savings and loans, banks and other financial institutions.
He said that 83 percent of those cases involved allegations of fraud totaling less than $25,000, cases that are not a top priority, and that the department received 600 referrals from one failure.
''When you get down to it, you end up with a finite universe of about 100 major S.& L. fraud cases,'' he said. ''The major focus is on these.''

HEADLINE: June Level Of Borrowing Rose Slightly

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve Board said today that consumers repaid car loans much faster than they took out new ones in June, a fresh sign of shrinking economic activity that slowed credit expansion.
Total installment debts increased by $463 million in June, barely an annual growth rate of eight-tenths of a percent, after climbing by a revised $3.65 billion, or at a 6.1 percent annual rate in May.
Loans for new cars posted the greatest change, with the total value of outstanding loans falling by $1.58 billion in June, after declining $5 million in May. 
 
Economic Slowdown Feared
Since consumers account for about two-thirds of the spending on goods and services that make up the gross national product, such a clear sign of spending caution in a critical category like cars implies a coming slowdown in total economic activity.
Similarly, the total of revolving, or credit-card, credit slowed to a gain of $1.3 billion in June, compared with May growth of $3.2 billion.
The Fed had said that total May consumer credit had grown by $3.91 billion, but revised that down to $3.65 billion.
Other categories of credit, including bank loans, grew by $827 million in June, after increasing by $353 million in May.
In its second-quarter G.N.P. report, which showed that the economy slowed to a weak 1.2 percent annual growth rate between April and June, from 1.7 percent in the first three months of 1990, the Government said consumer spending had slackened significantly.
 
Factory Orders Down
Factory orders also weakened, and the National Association of Purchasing Management said the manufacturing economy fell sharply in July after three months of growth.
The July employment report and the results of the purchasers' survey, plus weak orders for durable and non-durable goods, ''point to an economy that is caving into a full-fledged recession,'' said Allen Sinai, the chief economist for Boston Company Economic Advisors Inc.
With the additional complication from rising oil prices because of the Middle East crisis, Mr. Sinai predicted that the G.N.P. would shrink by five-tenths of a percent to 1 percent in the second half of the year.
Consumers remained heavily in debt despite slower credit growth in June. Before seasonal adjustment, total outstanding consumer installment debts swelled in June to $723 billion, from $720 billion in May and from $696 billion in June of last year.

Japan in Dilemma On Inflation Policy

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
While the powerful Japanese economy appears to be in a position to ride out the storm of higher oil prices and disrupted supplies relatively well, the country's weak link in an otherwise solid economic chain may be in the financial markets, economists and analysts say.
Their basic concern is not the strength of the Japanese economy, but the weakness of America's. Any large increases in Japanese inflation and interest rates caused by rising oil prices could force United States rates to jump to maintain the appeal of dollar investments to the Japanese. Some fear that such a jolt could help push the already staggering American economy toward recession. 
The concern over America's straitened condition has thus given Japan far less room for maneuvering, a fact that in these troubled times has added a decidedly more nervous edge to the markets here, which still like to think of the Bank of Japan, the nation's central bank, and the Ministry of Finance as steady and in control, with lots of policy options.
''Japan,'' said Kenneth Courtis, chief economist here with Deutsche Bank, ''is caught in a policy conundrum. Given this nervous environment, the markets cannot tolerate any policy slips.''
In the first two trading days of this week, Japan's stock and bond markets have sagged since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, but they have not broken. As in New York, share prices have been hit hard, falling 6.3 percent in the first two sessions. But there has not been panicked selling or serious disruptions in trading, and stocks rose 3.10 percent today as bargain hunters moved in.
Meanwhile, interest rates on the Government's benchmark 10-year bond have jumped to 8.1 percent, from 7.7 percent on Friday, a very substantial increase considered the most worrisome sign.
The Finance Minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, sought to soothe rattled nerves yesterday by saying Japan had ample stocks of oil to withstand a temporary cutback of supplies.
Since the oil shocks of the 1970's, the Japanese economy has diversified its energy sources, grown less dependent on imported oil and sharply increased industrial efficiency; the Japanese economy gets nearly three times as much output from a barrel of oil as it did in 1973. Economists agree that although Japan imports virtually all of its needed energy, in many ways it is in a far better condition to ride out a short-term sharp cut in oil supplies than other industrial countries.
Mr. Hashimoto's most important remarks concerned inflation. He sought to head off concerns that higher oil prices would accelerate inflation and prompt an increase in interest rates.
''We're not in a position where we need to change monetary policy,'' Mr. Hashimoto said. Nonetheless, the inflationary worries are at the heart of a dilemma for Japan. Inflationary pressures were growing even before oil prices shot up. The economy is in its 44th month of expansion, Japan's second-longest period of growth in postwar history, with 5 percent growth expected this year. Factories are at capacity, there is a labor shortage, the money supply is growing at a rate of more than 10 percent a year and inventories are at rock bottom - classic signs of overheating.
The fear is that the pressure on prices is growing just as policy makers are finding their means for dealing with them shrinking because of the global economic turmoil. If the Government raises interest rates to nip inflation in the bud, investors would be drawn to yen-denominated securities. Such a move could cause the dollar to drop, perhaps sharply. America would then be under pressure to raise rates to attract a continued flow of Japanese capital to cover the budget deficits. That could push the American economy toward recession.
On the other hand, should the Japanese Government hesitate too long and permit inflation to build, the yen could drop - it has tumbled sharply already this week - and prompt an outflow of capital, wrecking the shaky markets. A delicate balance must be struck.
On the positive side, the nearly 30 percent slide in the stock market in March and April, which was caused largely by higher interest rates, traders said, has already taken some of the froth out of share prices and left investors a little more sober. And institutions have been less eager to sell quickly, analysts said, because they are still sitting on mounds of cash. Given these factors, Mr. Taylor said, ''this is not a scenario for a prolonged crash.'' That is scant comfort. ''It's not a big danger signal, it's just uncertainty,'' said a senior trader at a Japanese securities house. ''In this country, we worry less about specifically what the Government is doing sometimes than whether they are moving confidently.''

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Post a Gain; Others Mixed

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The Japanese stock market made up some of yesterday's losses today, as bargain-hunters pushed the Tokyo Stock Exchange's key Nikkei index up 3.10 percent. The world's other major stock markets rose or declined slightly.
Analysts said the increases were, in part, just a natural steadying after the steep drops on Monday in response to the rise in oil prices. Several analysts said they expected world stock markets to remain volatile until there appears to be a resolution of the Middle East crisis. 
They also agreed that it would not take much to get the markets tumbling again. European and Asian markets were closed when Administration officials said that the United States was sending troops to Saudi Arabia and that the Saudis had indicated they would start pumping an additional 2 million barrels a day, partly offsetting the decline in supply resulting from the boycott of Iraq and Kuwait.
 
Oil Stocks Could Rally
One analyst, Steven H. Nagourney, chief international strategist at Shearson Lehman Brothers, suggested that the stock markets had not yet fully reflected the rise in oil prices, which means that markets over all will decline more while oil stocks could still rally.
''Right now, something fundamental has changed,'' said Sander Cseh, senior vice president at Provident Capital Management International. Referring to the sharp market declines in 1987 and 1989, he added, ''Every other time we have had a major drop in the market, there was not a major change in the economic fundamentals.''
But with the sharp rise in the price of oil, he said, ''this time there will be a change in the rate of inflation, a change in consumer spending and a change in interest rates.'' Mr. Cseh said he did not assume that the situation would be resolved quickly or that the price of oil would soon drop.
''You are going to have uncertainty for at least a month or so,'' he said.
In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225 index fell yesterday by 946.46 points, or 3.31 percent, to 27,653.07, its lowest level since Oct. 26, 1988. That brought the Nikkei's loss since the invasion of Kuwait last week to 10.4 percent. But today, the Nikkei gained 856.07 points, to 28,509.14.
Japan, which imports virtually all of its oil, has had the most negative response to the invasion and subsequent rise in oil prices, although it has lessened its dependence on oil and diversified its sources since the last oil crisis. What impact there will be has been intensified by the Government's decision on Monday to join in the international embargo against Iraq and Kuwait.
But on Wall Street, the stock market stabilized after a volatile day. At the close, the Dow Jones industrial average, which fell 93.31 points on Monday, was down only 5.70 points. And in Hong Kong, the Hang Seng index fell more than 6 percent in early trading and then rebounded to close down only three-tenths of one percent.
In Europe stock markets rallied, helped in part, dealers said, by reports that foreigners would be allowed to leave Iraq and Kuwait. In West Germany, the Frankfurt bourse's DAX index rose 29.37 points, or 1.69 percent, to 1,770.30 after falling 5.4 percent on Monday and hitting its low for the year. In Britain, which had a milder decline of 2.82 percent on Monday because its North Sea oil reserves make it less vulnerable to an oil shock, the Financial Times 100 index rose 15.6, or seven-tenths of one percent, to 2,235.80.
In both London and Frankfurt, the yields on 10-year bonds, which had risen sharply on Monday, declined a little. The yield on the German Bund was down 8 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 8.80 percent, while the yield on the British gilt slipped 2 basis points, to 11.86 percent.
In France, the blue-chip index, called the CAC-40, was up 2.14 percent, to 1,811.84, after dropping more than 5 percent on Monday. In Norway, the Oslo market rose 1.69 percent after a 5.2 percent fall on Monday.
Mr. Nagourney said he sees several more potential jolts for the markets. The most extreme is the possibility of a war that could turn the oil fields of Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia into a ''burning heap.''

HEADLINE: Tankers Scramble for New Supplies

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

 BODY:
With oil from Iraq and Kuwait under embargo and the threat of war hanging over the Middle East, oil companies are preparing to redeploy their tanker fleets to pick up oil from alternative producers. And they are already paying a price for the region's instability in the form of higher insurance rates for ships and cargo.
The major oil companies operate large fleets of tankers, and the invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent embargo have left some ships idle at sea or in ports, waiting for orders based on where oil is available for purchase.
The Chevron Feluy, a tanker owned by the San Francisco-based oil company, was heading into the Persian Gulf on Thursday when it received word that it would not be able to pick up its scheduled cargo of Iraqi crude. Ever since, the ship has been sitting outside the gulf, waiting as Chevron scrambles to find other suppliers. 
 
'A Lot of Dislocation'
''This type of situation causes a lot of dislocation,'' said Douglas C. Wolcott, the president of Chevron's shipping division. ''Some tankers are in the right place at the wrong time.''
Mr. Wolcott said that Chevron had organized internal task forces that are working on replacing Iraq and Kuwait as suppliers, and that the Chevron Feluy and other tankers would be given new orders as the company buys more oil from other countries. Together, Iraq and Kuwait exported more than four million barrels of oil a day before the embargo.
Saudi Arabia reportedly said yesterday that it would add two million barrels a day to its output.
Industry executives said that if the embargo holds and other nations, like the United Arab Emirates or Venezuela, do not join in increasing production, there would be an oversupply of tanker capacity and the cost of transporting oil would probably fall. But they said transportation costs make up only a small fraction of oil's market price and that a tanker glut would be of minimal help in keeping prices down.
The embargo ''is a major event in the oil markets, causing the oil industry to adapt as quickly as possible to find other sources as economically as possible,'' said John Lord, a spokesman for the Mobil Corporation, which has 40 tankers carrying oil around the world. ''Our tankers go where the game is. We are doing everything we can to keep our system supplied.''
The oil companies are also facing sharp increases in insurance premiums on both their tankers and their cargoes of crude. On Monday, marine underwriters at Lloyd's of London increased insurance rates for cargo on ships traveling in the Persian Gulf. The standing rate had been 0.0275 percent of the value of the cargo.
But Lloyd's is now imposing an additional premium of one-tenth of a percent of the cargo's value for ships calling at Saudi Arabian ports and five-hundredths of a percent for ships calling at other Persian Gulf nations. Rates for ships calling at Iraqi and Kuwaiti ports are being determined by negotiation, Lloyd's executives said.
Lloyd's increased premiums last week for rates on insurance for the ships themselves. Rates would undoubtedly rise dramatically in the event of an all-out war.
 
Bidding Up the Price
Chevron and other oil companies own tankers that are now on route to the United States and other destinations with oil purchased from Iraq or Kuwait before the imposition of the embargo on Thursday. That oil, which is not subject to the embargo, has risen sharply in value since the embargo because of the general tightening of oil supplies and because some refineries, which turn crude into products like gasoline, are configured to run only the grades of crude exported by Iraq and Kuwait. Most of the largest oil companies can reconfigure their refineries to process different grades.
The oil companies that need Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil for their refineries are bidding the price up sharply, creating a potential windfall for the companies transporting it.
''You can be sure that all the major oil companies are trying to sell out the crude that has the highest price and buy the lowest-priced crude for their own refineries,'' said Frederick Leuffer, an analyst at C. J. Lawrence, Morgan Grenfell Inc.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Prices of Cattle Increase; Pork and Grains Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Cattle futures prices surged yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting some apparent easing of economic worries linked to the Middle East crisis and strength in the cash cattle markets.
On other commodity markets, pork futures ended mixed, and grains and soybeans were mixed.
News from the Middle East remained a major influence in many commodity markets but signs during trading that hostilities were cooling allowed traders to focus on other factors as well. 
Live cattle futures settled .28 cent to 1.15 cents higher in Chicago, with the contract for delivery in August at 77.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .55 cent to 1.12 cents higher, with August at 89.67 cents a pound; live hogs were .95 cent lower to .05 cent higher, with August at 58.07 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .40 cent lower to .52 cent higher, with August at 51.07 cents a pound.
Charles Levitt, senior livestock analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the inflation and recession fears caused by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait had had a depressing effect on cattle prices recently because consumers would tend to bypass beef in favor of cheaper meats if the economy took a downturn.
''When you start comparing beef with chicken at the meat counters, you know which is going to get the nod,'' he said.
But cattle prices bounced back strongly yesterday as the stock and crude-oil markets steadied amid indications early in the day the Iraqi Government had assumed a less aggressive posture.
Further support stemmed from stronger packer demand for live cattle and stronger demand for feeder cattle by feedlot operators.
Paul Hare, livestock analyst with Linnco Futures Inc. in Chicago, said the live cattle market was oversold and due for a correction after falling for four straight days.
Grain and soybean futures ended narrowly mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade.
Traders also began evening up their positions ahead of tomorrow's Agriculture Department crop report, analysts said. The report, scheduled for release after tomorrow's close, will contain the Government's first official estimates of 1990 United States corn and soybean production.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher; Prices for Gold Are Mixed

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher yesterday against all leading currencies except the German mark, as traders kept a close watch on the Persian Gulf crisis and its effect on interest rates.
Gold prices were mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $384.50 an ounce, down 20 cents from Monday. Later, the Republic National Bank in New York quoted a bid for gold at $385.50 an ounce, up $1.50. 
Ronald H. Holzer, chief currency dealer at Harris Trust & Company in Chicago, attributed the dollar's rise largely to technical factors. But he said traders were also buying dollars in the belief that United States interest rates would remain stable for the short term. ''Short-term rates have not moved lower,'' he said.
In fact, interest rates in the bond markets have risen sharply in recent days on inflation fears, which stemmed from the rapid rise in oil prices after Iraq's invasion of neighboring Kuwait last week.
When interest rates decline, the value of a currency tends to follow suit as dollar-denominated investments become less attractive.
The dollar had fallen sharply on Monday against all major currencies except the Japanese yen, on worries that the Federal Reserve would push interest rates lower to prevent the country from falling into a recession.
In New York yesterday, the dollar again rose against the Japanese currency, to 150.90 yen, from 150.35 on Monday. Earlier, in Tokyo, where global trading begins, the dollar closed up at 150.60 Japanese yen, compared with 149.50 yen on Monday. It traded at 149.90 yen in London.
Against the German currency, the dollar slipped in New York to 1.5875 marks, from 1.5788.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound. The pound bought $1.8765 in London, up from $1.8725, and $1.8715 in New York, down from $1.8725.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.3370 Swiss francs, up from 1.3310; 5.3230 French francs, up from 5.2890; 1,162.25 Italian lire, up from 1,154.50, and 1.15125 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14955.
Gold rose in London to $383.25 an ounce from $382.50 late Monday. In Zurich, it rose to $383.15 an ounce from $382.50.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose by $4.94, to $383.52 an ounce.
Silver prices declined. On the Comex in New York, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $4.857 an ounce, down from $4.892 on Monday. Silver fell in London to $4.89 an ounce, from $4.91.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Editor of Financial Times To Resign at End of Year

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 7

 BODY:
Sir Geoffrey Owen, the editor of The Financial Times for the last decade, will step down at the end of this year, when he will be succeeded by the newspaper's deputy editor, Richard P. Lambert.
In April, Sir Geoffrey, who is 56 years old, will become the director of the business policy program at the London School of Economics, where he plans to focus on the competitiveness of British industry. The position ''will be mainly concerned with research into British industrial performance in the postwar period and relating it to developments in other European countries,'' Sir Geoffrey said in an interview. 
During Sir Geoffrey's tenure, the newspaper's circulation increased to 291,531, from 199,233. In the last couple of years, much of the growth has come from the United States, where circulation is now 18,816, and continental Europe, with about 60,800. In June, the paper began printing an edition in Japan, where it now sells about 4,500 copies.
Mr. Lambert, who is 45, joined The Financial Times in 1966 as a reporter and initially covered company news and wrote about personal finance. He became financial editor in 1979, was appointed New York correspondent in 1982 and was promoted to his current job in 1983.
The European circulation of The Wall Street Journal, a primary competitor of The Financial Times in Europe, is relatively small - only 11,043 in Britain and 35,221 on the continent. But Mr. Lambert said he does not take the paper lightly, especially in several countries on the continent.
While The Journal ''hasn't made a huge impact in the United Kingdom, it gives us some benchmarks,'' he said, adding that it was ''no coincidence'' that The Financial Times had increased its coverage of capital markets.
In the United States, he said, his paper's circulaton is ''very strongly biased towards the southern tip of Manhattan, and we have a high profile among a small range of readers.''
Replacing Mr. Lambert as deputy editor will be Ian Hargreaves, an alumnus of the paper who is now director of news and current affairs at the British Broadcasting Corporation.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: Advertising;
Some More Bad News For Outdoor

BYLINE: By Kim Foltz

 BODY:
The outdoor advertising industry has taken a battering lately from special-interest groups and Federal lawmakers who want to impose tough new restrictions. Now there is more bad news: Advertising revenues for the outdoor industry in the first quarter dropped 15 percent from the period last year, according to the LNA/Arbitron Multi-Media Service.
Industry executives say the prime reasons for this downturn are the country's sluggish economy and growing fears of recession. Automobile advertising, for example, which had been one of the strongest categories, fell 30.6 percent in the quarter. Spending in the top 10 categories, which account for more than half of outdoor revenues, fell 20 percent, to $128 million, from $161 million in the period the previous year. 
''It has been a tough year so far,'' said Mark Van Fossan, the chief operating officer at the Patrick Media Group, a leading outdoor company. But Mr. Van Fossan said he was confident that the situation would improve in the fall, when he expected important advertisers like auto makers to step up spending.
Analysts said that like the magazine industry, outdoor advertising had been hurt by the surprising strength of network television. During the advance sale of network prime-time advertising in June, advertisers spent a record $4.3 billion.
''Very often, out-of-home is a discretionary buy,'' said Pete Riordan, a manager at BBDO for out-of-home advertising, which uses public places like the sides of buildings, bus shelters and shopping malls. ''With television spending high and budgets tighter, outdoor advertising is bound to suffer.''
Analysts predict that the trend is likely to continue, which would probably mean a shakeout among outdoor companies, some of them already deeply in debt.
Some analysts said the industry has also been hurt, in part, by growing protests from special-interest groups that want to ban billboards for tobacco and alcohol. In New York, Chicago and Dallas, religious and community leaders have been whitewashing billboards that display ads for cigarettes, wine, beer and liquor. The protesters assert that by concentrating advertising for tobacco and alcohol in predominantly black and Hispanic neighborhoods, these advertisers are unfairly targeting minority consumers.
Bowing to pressure, cigarette and alcohol advertisers have agreed not to use billboards that are near schools or churches, where children can more readily see them.
More important, the protests have accelerated cutbacks in cigarette advertising, which had been already declining. During the last 10 years, the percentage of total outdoor advertising revenues from cigarettes dropped to just 13 percent, down from more than 40 percent in 1979. For the first quarter of this year, tobacco advertising fell 27.4 percent.
In addition, the alcohol industry has become wary, and advertising in the category dropped 1.3 percent in the first quarter.
Analysts said the traditional outdoor advertising industry was also facing stiff competition from the growing popularity of new out-of-home media like video display terminals in subway stations, shopping malls and supermarkets.
To remain competitive, the outdoor industry has been steadily improving the quality of billboards. In the past, most billboards were handpainted and the results varied widely depending on the artist's skill. Now, many billboards are produced using computer technology that produces artwork that looks as good as print ads in magazines, industry executives said. As a result, more billboards are sporting ads for cosmetics, food and fashion - categories that had not used outdoor much in the past because of the poor visual quality.
Billboards are also looking better because some agency executives, particularly in California, see them as a highly visible way to flex their creative muscles. Billboards for Nike athletic shoes, for example, have won many creative awards.
''Billboards aren't as creatively limited as they used to be,'' said Russell Booth, a group media director at Grey Advertising. ''There is a lot of dramatic work being done.''
To spark greater interest at agency creative departments, the Gannett Outdoor Group has started a creative-challenge program. At agencies in New York and Chicago, Gannett executives have offered prizes like free trips to Europe to the creators of outstanding new billboards for clients that had never used the medium.
''We want them to think of outdoor as an important part of an overall advertising strategy,'' said John Hope, a senior vice president at Gannett. ''The more good billboards creative people see, the more billboards they'll want to create.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
OIL MARKETS EASE; STOCK PRICES RISE

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

 BODY:
Oil prices fell and the stock markets in the New York and Tokyo steadied yesterday after the United States decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia and reports that the oil-rich kingdom would increase its production.
But the easing in oil markets and a leveling off in share prices seemed tentative, with the economic outlook hinging on the uncertain prospect of developments in the Middle East.
Despite a decline in the price of oil of more than $2 a barrel yesterday, to just under $26, the price remains about 50 percent higher than it was in July, with much of that increase coming after Iraq invaded Kuwait last week. The oil-price run-up has been quickly - and controversially - translated into higher fuel costs for businesses and higher gasoline prices for motorists. Higher energy prices have made it seem more likely that an already-weak economy will slip into recession. 
In the stock markets yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.26 points in New York, to 2,734.90, after falling day after day since the Iraqi invasion last week. Similarly, the Tokyo market rallied yesterday, before declining in today's trading session. In Europe, the performance was mixed, with both the Frankfurt and Paris markets falling and the London market inching ahead.
In his televised address yesterday, President Bush called on the oil industry to avoid taking advantage of political turmoil in the Persian Gulf to maximize profits.
''I'm asking the oil companies to do their fair share,'' the President said in a broadcast to the nation yesterday morning. ''They should show restraint and not abuse today's uncertainties to raise prices.''
Mr. Bush also said, ''I will explore whether we and our allies should draw down our strategic petroleum reserves.''
 
ARCO's Commitment
In response to President Bush's urging to restrain oil and gasoline price increases, the American Petroleum Institute, the industry's largest trade association, pledged its ''complete cooperation'' and ARCO, a big marketer in five Western states, said it would freeze wholesale prices for one week.
No other companies, however, gave any immediate indication that they would follow the lead of ARCO, whose foregone profits for the week were thought likely to amount to tens of millions of dollars.
''We hope the market will stabilize during this time,'' George Babikian, head of the Los Angeles-based company's refining and marketing division, said in a statement, ''but if at the end of the week our position is out of line with world market prices, we will have to recognize that fact.''
 
Telegram to Bush From Mobil
A spokesman for the Mobil Corporation said he could not comment on any pending price moves but supplied a copy of a telegram that the company's chairman, Allen E. Murray, sent to the White House after the President's plea.
''I can assure you that we will continue to show restraint in the face of escalating prices for crude oil,'' Mr. Murray stated. ''While we have raised prices, to date we have recovered only a fraction of the higher costs incurred. Please be assured that in this time of crisis Mobil will do its fair share.''
But with retail gasoline prices having already climbed by an average of more than 12 cents a gallon since Iraq's invasion of Kuwait - and twice as much in some cases - the industry was once again smarting from a public-image black eye.
 
Threat by Senator Dole
No less a friend than the Senate Republican leader, Bob Dole of Kansas, whose state ranks among the top 10 oil producers, complained of ''irresponsible and arbitrary'' price increases and said these invited Government action.
''Sometimes the oil companies never learn,'' Senator Dole declared. ''They're just asking for some kind of excess-profits or windfall-profits tax.''
Congressional Democrats, meanwhile, kept up their barrage of criticism of the oil industry, with the Senate majority leader, George J. Mitchell of Maine, insisting that Attorney General Dick Thornburgh conduct an investigation of possible conspiratorial pricing.
The episode recalled the 1962 confrontation between President John F. Kennedy and the steel industry, whose effort to raise prices an average of $6 a ton was held by the President to be ''a wholly unjustifiable and irresponsible defiance of the public interest.''
The industry capitulated and withdrew the increase within four days of Mr. Kennedy's direct, public challenge in which he spoke of ''this serious hour in our nation's history when we are confronted with grave crises in Berlin and Southeast Asia, when we are devoting our energies to economic recovery and stability, when we are asking reservists to leave their homes and families months on end and servicemen to risk their lives.''
John H. Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff, convened a meeting of Government policy makers yesterday afternoon to discuss oil prices, but no industry officials were invited, an official said. Nor did President Bush, a former oilman himself, make any private telephone calls to urge price restraint.
The President did, however, phone ARCO to express pleasure at the company's price freeze.
Another development welcomed by the Administration was a decision by Mexico to raise output by 100,000 barrels a day, a modest amount but an addition that had not been formally requested or expected. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady called the increase a gesture of good will.
The outlook for oil remains uncertain, but most analysts said prices were unlikely to fall much further soon because the embargo against Iraq and Kuwait has been effective so far.
''Right now the embargo appears to be working well,'' said Theodore R. Eck, chief economist for the Amoco Corporation. ''They are having trouble selling oil because they have lost their traditional customers. But that may not be true a month from now.''
Mr. Eck said the pipeline through Turkey appeared to be closed down, but that Saudi Arabia had been silent on the pipeline that passes through its territory to the Red Sea port of Yanbu. In addition, the Iraqi port of Basra on the Persian Gulf remained open for exports if Iraq can find buyers.
And some feel those buyers will materialize if the embargo drags on and oil supplies tighten.

HEADLINE: Around U.S., a Cautious Chorus of Support

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD

 BODY:
If President Bush had been listening, he might have been reassured by the talk the last couple of mornings around the tables at Bert & Ernie's Restaurant in Plattsburg, a town of 2,100 people in western Missouri farm country, where patrons begin filtering in at the first daylight.
''I think he's got to draw a line somewhere,'' said Bruce Wilkinson, a farmer, summing up what seemed to be a consensus about the President and the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, ''and it looks like the line has got to be at the Saudi border.''
A few lingered around the table yesterday morning and sat rapt during Mr. Bush's television address. When it was over, they continued in the same vein of support for him, though one strong voice for caution was that of the Rev. Ed McCurley.
''You people keep saying the Iraqis don't value human life,'' said Mr. McCurley of the First Christian Church. ''Well, what about us? Here we are talking about going to war over money. I say, 'Whoa.' I say it's an Arab problem. Let's leave it to the Arabs.'' 
 
A Cautious Chorus
In conversations with more than 200 people across the American continent, mostly conducted after it became known that United States troops were headed for Saudi Arabia, the voices formed a cautious chorus of support for the President. But it was a chorus whose tones were tempered by worry that the American action would damage an already fragile economy and raise energy prices sharply - and possibly cause American blood to be spilled.
In a dentist's office in Miami, a Ford plant in Georgia, an amusement park in Missouri, a gas station in Los Angeles, in deepest West Texas ranch country, the events seemed to be understood only sketchily by some people, many of whom did not seem quite sure where Kuwait is or who had invaded whom. But there was nothing vague about the unease over the American embargo of Iraqi oil and resentment at an oil industry they see as taking advantage of the turmoil to extract unfair price increases for gasoline and diesel fuel.
Standing in the parking lot at Six Flags Over Mid-America just outside St. Louis, Howard Hart of San Jose, Calif., who like thousands of other Americans is in the middle of a vacation on the road, said gasoline prices had risen 10 to 15 cents in a week.
''It's the American way,'' Mr. Hart said. ''But I'm surprised at how blatant they're being about it.''
 
'We Can't Sit By'
While the President's firm but measured response won general approval, the concern about its effects on the health of the economy came through loud and clear. And probably nowhere was this dichotomy more apparent than at the Ford Motor Company's plant in the Atlanta suburb of Hapeville, which is the final assembly plant for the Taurus and Mercury Sable models.
One worker, Gary Meadows, said he supported United States military action not just because of the Iraqi invasion but also because he thought Americans in Kuwait were threatened. ''We've sat back long enough and been humiliated,'' he said. ''We can't sit by and let them take our citizens captive.''
But the automobile workers were also keenly aware that their industry teeters on recession, and that the rising oil prices that a boycott of Iraqi oil may bring could push it over the edge. ''It's going to drive up the price of gasoline, and that's going to adversely affect us - all of the automobile industry,'' said Oliver Terrell, who has been on the job just three months. Joe Harris, on his first day in a new supervisor's job, said he supported the President's decision because ''we don't want to let the situation get out of control.'' But he, too, was worried about gasoline prices. ''I noticed they were up again today when I got gas this morning,'' he said. ''We need to have some stability.''
 
Talk of Recession
Again and again the word ''recession'' was used. ''We're already on the edge of a recession,'' said E. W. Dixon, a grain and hog grower in Plattsburg, Mo.
Thirteen hundred miles away, in Miami, Dr. Stephen J. Parr has set up a small television in his office so he can follow events when he is not drilling teeth. He backed the President's position. ''You got to be ready for the worst; otherwise the worst can happen,'' he said.
But there were skeptics, too. J. Brian King, a photo illustrator in Miami, felt that the United States should keep out of such foreign entanglements. ''I don't like it,'' he said. ''I think they should take care of their own problems. I can understand ships standing by. But troops, that I don't agree with. We should have laissez-faire. Let them work out their own problems. We have enough oil in this country to last us a while.''
At the Jewish Home for the Aged in Miami, some residents, like many other Americans, seemed caught between hatred for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and fear of United States entanglement.
''There have been so many wars, so many have been killed,'' said Katie Safier, an 81-year-old retired real estate agent from New York. ''Hussein is a dictator like Hitler. He wants to take over all the oilfields. But why should we be involved? We could get oil from Mexico.''
But for everyone who feared a prolonged bloody entanglement, there were one or two others who urged President Bush to press ahead. A few even seemed impatient at his pace.
''Harry Truman wouldn't have put up with this for a minute,'' said Maurice Shoemaker, a farmer in northwestern Missouri.
Bruce Kennedy, a turf grower, agreed. ''Sooner or later you have to do something,'' he said. ''I'd wait just long enough to get the bombs loaded. Look what happened to Qaddafi. You don't hear so much out of him now.''
 
Recalling His Own War
In Atlanta, Jesse Taylor, a Ford automobile worker, was unequivocal. ''I think they ought to go in there and level Iraq as flat as that concrete floor,'' he said. ''You're dealing with a madman.''
Possibly few have followed the events more closely than Avi Nathan, a new American citizen and immigrant from Israel who served as an artilleryman in Israel's six-day war against Egypt in 1967. He has spent the last three days in his home on the West Side of Los Angeles, glued to his television following events in the Persian Gulf and railing against the Iraqi ''pirates.''
''I'm glad what President Bush did - he had to do it,'' Mr. Nathan said, even though, as the operator of a limousine service that carries Hollywood celebrities to television appearances, he fears for what it would do to oil prices. He spends $2,000 a month on gasoline.
But nearby, Mike J. Fadlallah, the Lebanese owner of the Unocal gas station in Redondo Beach, offered sympathy for Mr. Hussein. ''He's got a country to take care of,'' he said. ''They fought with Iran for a year to protect their oil, and now with Kuwait dumping oil on the market and calling in Iraq's debt he had to act.''$ 
Resentment in Detroit
Resentment against the President's action was particularly strong among Arab Americans in the Detroit area, which has the largest concentration of Arab Americans in the United States. They number about 150,000, mostly from Lebanon, Jordan and Yemen, and the community includes many Chaldeans from Iraq, Christians who generally consider themselves Arab Americans.
''The West is just meddling,'' said Charles K. Alawan, an American-born construction worker of Lebanese descent. ''American officials don't care which Moslem kills which, as long as they kill each other. Most Americans just care if they have gas for their cars.''
Samih Kasr, a restaurateur born in Jordan, had sympathy for the Iraqi cause. ''The Kuwati people have been abusing their wealth, not cooperating with the Arab movement and their cause,'' he said, adding that the West maintained a double standard. ''We didn't hear anything about world condemnation when the U.S. invaded Grenada or Panama,'' he said.
 
No Unity in Brooklyn
But in Arab Brooklyn, there was anything but unity. At the Rashid Sales Company, which sells Arabic tapes, books, magazines and newspapers on Atlantic Avenue, customers were devouring daily newspapers from Egypt, Lebanon and Saudi Arabia. The owner, Stanley Rashid, whose father came from Lebanon, said his patrons were taking opposite sides on the conflict. ''People from the Gulf are generally supporting Iraq, while people from Egypt are against Iraq,'' he said. ''I guess it's historically been that way.''
Up the street, the Damascus Bakery did a brisk business selling pita bread, meat and spinach pies and baklava amid political debate. Outside, Abdul Sala, an immigrant from Yemen, said he thought it was a ''family problem'' that the American Government should stay out of. Mosad Muthana said he thought American involvement might have the unintended effect of pushing Arab youth into President Hussein's camp because of American support for Israel.
 
By a River Divided
Just across the East River on the Lower East Side of Manhattan, American Jews had a very different view of it all at Ratner's Deli. They invoked Nazi analogies. ''Saddam Hussein is like a Hitler, a crazy man,'' said Ahron Yohananoff, a 78-year-old retiree from Kew Gardens in Queens. His companion for tea and bagels, was Moshe Katz, a cantor. ''You have to do something and do it very fast,'' Mr. Katz said. ''If not, we'll be in trouble.''
At the next table was Benjamin Grable, a 68-year veteran of World War II, working on his lox and cream cheese on onion roll. ''I hate war with a passion,'' he said. ''But by the same token, when something becomes necessary, it becomes necessary. I would put everything in place to stop Hussein immediately.''
Two thousand miles and a cultural universe away in the small ranching and oil town of Rankin (population, 1,250) in West Texas, the subject was also Iraq at the M & N Restaurant. But there it all seemed more remote, less emotional, except insofar as the events affected oil prices. At the cash register was the owner, Linda Nicholson, who was worried about her son-in-law in the Navy. She feared he would have to serve in the Persian Gulf.
 
'Far Away and Complicated'
But otherwise, she said they had not kept abreast of developments. ''It's far away and complicated,'' she said. ''There isn't a lot of talk of it around here. Oil right now is the conversation, how high it will go and whether it will be good for business. But not about what the President should do or anything. We don't know anything about that.''
One of her customers was Dan Brown, the sheriff of Upton County, waiting for his chicken fajitas. ''I really hadn't thought about it that much,'' he said. ''I know something's happening; it's on the news. I believe you have to protect American lives and American interests.''
How about Kuwaiti and Saudi lives and interests, he was asked.
''Kuwait?'' he replied. ''I thought this was happening in Iraq.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF: U.S. MAY SEND SAUDIS A FORCE OF 50,000; IRAQ PROCLAIMS KUWAIT'S ANNEXATION;
BUSH DRAWS 'LINE'

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Thousands of elite United States troops, the vanguard of a force that senior defense officials said may reach 50,000, took up positions in Saudi Arabia today as President Bush vowed to defend the Middle Eastern kingdom and its oil reserves, the richest in the world.
The President ruled out an immediate invasion of Iraqi-occupied Kuwait and said economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations would be given time to do their work of economic strangulation, forcing President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to withdraw. But Mr. Bush and his aides made it plain that American land, sea and air forces had been committed to the Persian Gulf area for the long term.
''A line has been drawn in the sand'' against any Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia, Mr. Bush said.
 
'A Criminal Force'
With a lengthy war of nerves seemingly in prospect, President Hussein, refusing to back down, announced the annexation of Kuwait and pledged to fight what he called ''a criminal force'' assembling in the region under American leadership. 
President Bush emphasized that ''we're not at war,'' and he described the mission of American troops as defensive. But that description really applies only in a tactical sense. In strategic terms, the American troops in Saudi Arabia, backed by aircraft carriers, missiles, fighters, bombers, tanks and other weapons, together with the embargo and a de facto naval blockade of Iraqi commerce, are intended to help force President Hussein to pull back.
Disappointing the Bush Administration, Egypt and Morocco decided not to provide troops, at least for the moment, to stand alongside the Americans and give the multinational force an Arab element. Britain agreed to join the force, but France did not. Italy and Spain agreed to provide crucial access to bases on their soil for United States planes involved in the buildup.
 
Egypt Arranges Arab Talks
Senior European diplomats said the Administration still hoped that military operations in the region could be put under the United Nations flag, but that, they said, would take time and require persuasion of the Soviets and the Chinese. Either could veto any such move in the Security Council.
An emergency meeting of the Council tonight to consider the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait was adjourned until Thursday because the Moscow and Beijing representatives said they had not received instructions from their Governments on how to vote.
But both countries said they expect to support a draft resolution, submitted by the Kuwaiti Government-in-exile, that declares the annexation null and void.
Led by President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, the Arab nations arranged another summit conference for Thursday evening in Cairo, in a final attempt to find some peaceful solution. Representative Steven J. Solarz, a Brooklyn Democrat who spent an hour with Mr. Mubarak today, said the Egyptian leader hoped to put together an Arab deterrent force to which Egypt and several other Arab nations would contribute soldiers.
But some political leaders said they feared that Mr. Hussein might attack Saudi Arabia sooner rather than later. Backing Mr. Bush's action, Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, the Democrat who heads the House Armed Services Committee, issued a warning that ''there is a danger of a hot war, and the greatest danger comes in the very next few days.''
 
'An Aggressive Dictator'
''Saddam Hussein sees us coming,'' Mr. Aspin said. ''He knows more troops will be there tomorrow and still more next week. He could try to seize the oilfields before we have enough men there to stop them and then hold those oilfields hostage. That is the greatest and most immediate threat.''
Mr. Bush's tone, in only the third televised address to the nation of his Presidency, was that of a leader preparing his country for war.
He described President Hussein as ''an aggressive dictator threatening his neighbors'' and compared him with Hitler. He used emotionally charged words from the late 1930's like blitzkrieg and appeasement. And he asked that ''in the churches around the country, prayers be said.''
''Standing up for our principles is an American tradition,'' Mr. Bush said in his speech from the Oval Office this morning. ''As it has so many times before, it may take time and tremendous effort, but most of all, it will take unity of purpose. As I have witnessed throughout my life in both war and peace, America has never wavered when her purpose is driven by principle.''
 
Bush's Economic Concerns
The dispatch of American paratroopers and other forces was a historic breakthrough for United States diplomacy, in that Saudi Arabia had finally dropped its insistence on keeping American military aid concealed, and it may lead other Arab states to do the same.
In addition, analysts contended that it was first time since World War II that the United States had intervened militarily out of mainly economic concerns.
Had Syria been the target, a prominent international banker said, ''we wouldn't have sent in the troops, because they don't have all that oil.''
The President emphasized economic concern by saying he hoped other oil producers would ease the pain the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil imposed on oil consumers by increasing their own production, thus forcing elevated prices down. The Administration expects Venezuela and Saudi Arabia, among others, to do so. Mr. Bush also called on United States oil companies to avoid gouging, which they have already been accused of doing.
 
British Contribute Forces
Congressional opinion swung solidly behind the President's action.
But a number of senators and representatives, Democrats and Republicans alike, expressed anxety about the failure of most other countries to promise troops so far for the joint military effort. Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republcian majority leader, said, ''The Arab countries have got to come to the party too.''
''I hope we won't be the Lone Ranger the way we were in Vietnam,'' said Senator Alan Cranston of California, the second-ranking Senate Democrat.
The financial markets reacted to the latest developments in the crisis by sending stocks up and oil prices down - the reverse of the last few days.
British contributions to the multinational force, officials in London said, would include Tornado aircraft and several ships, but probably not any infantry units.
 
Blocking Oil From Iraq
''The multinational effort is designed to deter Hussein,'' said Douglas Hurd, the Foreign Secretary. ''If Iraq compounds this with a fresh act of aggression, it will be extremely expensive, damaging and destructive to Iraq,'' he continued - seeming to indicate that Britain was prepared to join the United States not only in deterrence but also in counterattack if needed.
Perhaps with the thought that he would need the fullest possible Congressional backing if a shooting war developed along those lines, Mr. Bush sent Congress formal notification of his action under the War Powers Act, a piece of legislation born in the aftermath of Watergate that Republican Presidents have often ignored.
American military strength in the region already includes carrier task forces in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean, with a third steaming toward the Mediterranean.
When all are on station, they will be able to block Iraqi oil shipments that might reach the Saudi port of Yanbu, that might come down the Persian Gulf and through the Gulf of Oman and that might reach Turkish ports. So far, the market for Iraqi oil appears largely to have dried up.
 
Fear of Poison Gas
Among the elements being added by United States military planners are a brigade of the 82d Airborne Division, from Fort Bragg, N.C.; a brigade of the 101st Airborne Division, equipped with helicopters, from Fort Campbell, Ky., and a brigade of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, equipped with tanks and armored personnel carriers, from Fort McPherson, Ga.
Arab and European diplomats said that eventually all of the 82d and the 101st would be sent, as well as antiaircraft and antitank missiles and some intelligence equipment. Such a deployment could involve up to 50,000 men.
One of the major fears in official Washington about the course of action on which President Bush has embarked is the Iraqi capacity for using poison gas. Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said at a briefing at the Pentagon that Soviet-made Scud surface-to-surface missiles, now in position to hit the Saudi capital of Riyadh or the country's main oilfields, consituted ''one of the principal threats directed against Saudi Arabia.'' They can be fitted with chemical warheads, and American intelligence has indicated that some of them have been so armed.
 
Fate of Detained Americans
American forces have not faced chemical weapons in the field since the trench warfare of 1918.
In total, the Iraqis are believed by American officials to have massed as many as 100,000 troops in Kuwait. They appear to be digging in and maneuvering into positions from which a ground attack could be launched, supported by tanks and missiles.
Another problem is the fate of Americans in Kuwait and Iraq. They have not been harmed yet. But there is a largely unspoken fear here that some are being held as hostages.
 
Looting by Iraqis Reported
Iraq permitted United States officials to visit 38 Americans in a Baghdad hotel today and released an American child, which some took as a mildly conciliatory signal. But the 38 were held against their will under armed guard, and there was no sign that the 3,000 or more other United States citizens trapped in the two countries would be allowed to leave.
In addition, concern for the Americans' safety was heightened by reports of widespread looting and raping of Kuwaitis by Iraqi soldiers, brought out by Europeans who have managed to reach Saudi Arabia.
A third worry is the question of what Mr. Bush will do, having pledged as publicly and as forcefully as a President can do that he would not permit the Iraqi takeover of Kuwait to survive, if he fails in his attempt to make it impossible for Mr. Hussein to hang on to the little sheikdom.
No one in the Administration was willing to say for quotation that the President had held another option in reserve, that he could still convert the American force in Saudi Arabia into an assault force and send United States bombers to hammer Baghdad. But many officials made it clear that that possibility was in the background.
''George Bush promised that this guy wouldn't end up with Kuwait,'' one of them said. '' He hasn't staked his life on that, but he may well have staked his political future on it. So in the end - six months, a year, who knows? - he may try anything.''

HEADLINE: Racketeering Is Still Found at Fulton Fish Market

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
Two years after being appointed to help drive racketeers out of the Fulton Fish Market in Manhattan, long investigated as a Mafia stronghold, a Federal administrator said yesterday that an ''atmosphere of lawlessness'' and brutality still prevailed there.
The administrator, Frank H. Wohl, said the market was in the clutches of a small number of people who dictated how fish and seafood could be unloaded from delivery trucks and who charged ''extortionate'' fees for their services.
Mr. Wohl also asserted that the strong-arm tactics of some companies at the market discouraged suppliers from sending fish to New York, driving up retail prices for consumers in the city.
''The result is a frontier atmosphere, in which the prevailing attitude is that the Fulton Fish Market is a sovereign entity where the laws of economic power and physical force, not the laws of New York City, prevail,'' Mr. Wohl said in a report filed in Federal District Court in Manhattan. 
Mr. Wohl declined to estimate how much more consumers had to pay for fish as a result of the corrupt practices. He and other experts said it was impossible to compare the price of fish in New York with prices in other cities because of such factors as market conditions, labor costs, local taxes and consumer tastes.
Mr. Wohl contended that city officials had contributed to the problem by abdicating their responsibility to regulate and police the market. He said he would soon impose rules aimed at helping suppliers and businesses to operate without intimidation. About 90 million pounds of fish and shellfish, with a retail value of about $2 billion, are sold each year at the market, the largest wholesale fish market in the country.
City officials sharply dismissed Mr. Wohl's assertions, arguing that the administrator was placing blame to disguise his failure to achieve his own court-appointed goal.
Mr. Wohl was named by a Federal judge in 1988 to monitor conditions at the market with the power to ban people from working or doing business there and to set some rules on how fish was delivered to wholesalers and sold to retailers. His appointment was considered part of a fresh strategy to drive out organized-crime factions by using civil-court procedures rather than criminal indictments.
His report was the latest statement pointing to continued racketeering at the market, with its center on South Street and the East River in lower Manhattan. Over the last 60 years, it has frequently been investigated as a bastion of organized crime.
The report said brutality was so commonplace that drivers who violated unwritten parking rules on streets near the market were beaten. Mr. Wohl, in the report, said city officials had told him that they feared for the safety of city employees and also feared attempts to corrupt police officers if the city enforced regulations more strictly.
 
'Unwritten Customs'
''The city's abdication of its management responsibilities in the market has led to the assumption of that responsibility by others, who have organized the market through unwritten customs and practices designed for their own benefit,'' Mr. Wohl said.
Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for Sally Hernandez-Pinero, the Deputy Mayor for Finance and Economic Development, said much of the report was ''old news.''
''The place has been a mess for 60 years, and in the last year and a half we have tried to straighten out the most glaring problems and get cooperation from merchants and develop rapport with them,'' Ms. Nathan said in an interview. She maintained that the city had improved sanitation, parking and traffic conditions and had increased police patrols.
Asked about Mr. Wohl's assertions that the market was dominated by racketeers, Ms. Nathan said, ''The report reflects Mr. Wohl's inability to correct the problem and he has a $1 million-a-year budget.''
Mr. Wohl said Federal courts authorized payments of about $750,000 last year for the salaries of about a dozen investigators and researchers and other expenses.
 
'Ample Authority'
Mr. Wohl, in an interview, said he had issued the report because he was at the midpoint of his four-year appointment and wanted to see ''regulatory controls'' in place before his tenure ended. He said that the city had ''ample authority'' to regulate the market and that if it failed to accept his proposals, his office would then enforce them.
In his report, Mr. Wohl said six companies or ''crews'' that he did not identify controlled the unloading of fish and seafood brought to the market by trucks.
Although the city has the authority to license and regulate the unloading, when truckers arrive at the market they are ''assigned by some unknown authority to unload their trucks,'' the report said. The truckers have no say in how their cargo is unloaded, nor do the wholesalers who receive the supplies.
Under this system, the report said, it costs just as much to transport a pound of fish 50 feet at the market as it does to transport it hundreds of miles from New England or the Gulf Coast to New York City. The unloaders charge the wholesalers $1.35 per 100-pound box and 65 cents per 60-pound box - about the same cost as delivery from Maine or Louisiana, Mr. Wohl said.
 
Physical Abuse
Truckers and wholesalers would be ''subject to physical abuse'' and ''their future activities'' in the market would be ''imperiled'' if they unloaded the supplies themselves, the report said.
The unloaders also have the power to allow fish to spoil by the order in which they deliver supplies, the report said, and drivers are extorted for extra fees to have their cargoes unloaded promptly.
Mr. Wohl said in his report that he would promulgate rules to control the unloading and the licensing of the unloaders. Trucks, he said, would be unloaded in their order of arrival at the market and a ceiling would be set on charges.
Evidence that some wholesalers defrauded fish companies for about $6 million in the last years has been turned over to local prosecutors, the report said.
Mr. Wohl said the city had no records of who was leasing municipal space at the market and whether rents were being paid.
 
Parking and Traffic
The report also accused city officials of making no attempt to control parking and traffic through the congested market on South Street, between John Street on the south and Dover Street on the north. Activity in the market, next to the South Street Seaport, is at its peak in the early morning.
Several drivers who parked their cars in the area or had driven near the market have been severely beaten and their vehicles smashed with metal hooks and pipes, the report said.
Although the report referred to racketeering activities at the market, Mr. Wohl did not specify whether any of the improper activities were controlled by Mafia families. He said organized-crime influence at the fish market would be addressed in another report.

Where the Tortoises Play, Tourists Are Limited

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRASLIN, Seychelles, Aug. 2

 BODY:
Mountainous granite islands poking out of turquoise water and slivers of coral atolls that barely peep above the horizon make up this tiny nation that hopes to impress the world with its sensitivity about the environment.
Scientists say there is much to preserve on the Seychelles' 115 islands flung over hundreds of miles of the Indian Ocean off the coast of Africa: turtles, birds, an exotic coconut tree known as coco de mer, reefs, shells, and even the fine white sand.
The Government, which practices a hybrid of socialist economics and politics, agrees. Seychelles receives more than half of its foreign exchange earnings from well-to-do tourists who jet in from Europe. Thus, keeping unsullied, palm-fringed beaches, abundant fishing and rare birdlife has become critical to the economic well-being of the 67,000 local people, known as Seychellois. 
''We've got very little else other than natural beauty,'' said Lindsay Chong Seng, a British-trained biologist who is the director of the country's tourism support services. ''If we lose it, that's it.''
 
Management Plan Drawn Up
Preserving the Seychelles will take more money and more expertise than the country can afford. Thus, with the help of the United Nations and the World Bank, the Government has drawn up a $600 million environmental management plan which it hopes donor countries will finance.
The World Bank and the United Nations are organizing a conference on behalf of the Seychelles in Paris next February where donors will be asked to make pledges.
So far, environmentalists say the Seychelles has done quite well, studiously avoiding turning what it advertises as paradise into another Hawaii, or even a facsimile of the Caribbean.
The new environmental management plan states that over 40 percent of the land area on the scattered islands is national parks and reserves. While some environmentalists believe this figure is exaggerated, they say the Seychelles compares favorably to Botswana and Tanzania, two African countries with large amounts of protected land. Recently, the Government more than doubled the cost of sand used for building as a way of discouraging further erosion of some beaches.
 
Numbers to Be Limited
''They do have a pretty good conservation record and they are quite serious about it,'' said Jim Thorsell, the senior adviser on natural heritage for the International Union for Conservation of Nature in Switzerland.
Perhaps most striking is a recently announced limitation on the number of tourists. Last year, nearly 90,000 visitors relaxed in the perpetual sunshine, a vast increase over the early 1980's when a coup attempt set tourism back.
The Government has said it will allow no more than 100,000 tourists a year, and plans to enforce this limit by allowing only 4,000 hotel beds. ''A maximum ceiling of 4,000 beds with an average length of stay of 9 to 11 days and with a 75 percent occupancy rate works out at 100,000 tourists a year,'' Mr. Chong Seng said.
New hotels cannot be built on new sites. Instead, additional hotel rooms must be built as extensions to existing hotels or on land where an old hotel has been torn down. It is an unwritten rule, only obviously violated once - at the Sheraton Hotel - that no building can be higher than a coconut tree.
 
Tortoises in Danger
But some environmental problems remain unaddressed. The Seychelles is home to four species of sea turtles, two of which are of special interest. The first is the green turtle, which was once plentiful on the northern islands of the Seychelles but whose last large wild refuge is on Aldabra, a totally protected and remote atoll 500 miles south of the main island of Mahe. The second is the hawksbill turtle, whose carapace is used for tortoise-shell boxes, trays, bangles and the like.
A study of Seychelles turtles five years ago by an American zoologist, Jeanne A. Mortimer, for the World Wildlife Fund concluded that the hawksbill turtle, which takes 25 years to mature, was ''dwindling as an exploitable resource.'' Her report suggested that the best protection for the turtle would be a complete ban on possession, purchase and sale of all hawksbill products.
But tables crammed with tortoise-shell curios at the open-air market in the center of Victoria, the Seychelles capital, are the best evidence that the capture of the hawksbill turtle continues unabated. International trade in tortoise-shell products was banned in 1977 by the Conference on the International Trade in Endangered Species, to which the Seychelles is a signatory. The ban makes it illegal for tourists to take tortoise shell home but it is a ban easily flouted because the objects are so small they can easily be hidden in luggage.
 
Law Cannot Be Enforced
Seychelles law forbids the killing of the female hawksbill, which is vital to the continuation of the species, but Mr. Chong Seng points out that the country has no means to enforce the law.
Already, some of the environmentally conscious tourists who come here are calling up Mr. Chong Seng to complain about the sale of tortoise shell here.
But the biologist's biggest worry is about the meeting in Paris next February. The turtle question, he concedes, is the big ''sore point'' in the new environmental management plan. When the Seychelles asks the holders of the purse strings for money, Mr. Chong Seng envisions them retorting, ''But what about the turtles?''

HEADLINE: Son of Former Military Ruler Goes Into Politics in Pakistan

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ISLAMABAD, Pakistan, Aug. 7

 BODY:
A son of Gen. Mohammad Zia ul-Haq, convinced that the time is right to revive the name of Pakistan's late military ruler, has set aside a career in banking and plunged into politics in anticipation of elections on Oct. 24.
In the Indian subcontinent, where political dynasties have shaped the modern history of almost every nation, 38-year-old Ijaz ul-Haq sees a certain inevitability in this. He says that after two tumultous years of Benazir Bhutto, whose Government was dismissed on Monday by the President of Pakistan, people are taking a new look at the past and a kinder view of the Zia years.
''In the subcontinent, until the literacy rate has gone above 50 percent, politics is going to revolve around personalities,'' he said in an interview on Friday, just three days before the ouster of Ms. Bhutto, in the house in Rawalpindi that his family has borrowed from friends while a new one is under construction. ''In Pakistan, the only political forces seen today are the Bhuttos, represented by the Pakistan People's Party, and the anti-Peoples'-Party force, which is represented by the Zia ul-Haq constituency,'' he said. 
 
In General Zia's Name
''If somebody is going to come forward in the next elections in the name of General Zia ul-Haq, it is going to be his son and nobody else,'' Mr. Ijaz said.
Ms. Bhutto is the daughter of the Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, who was overthrown by General Zia in 1977 and hanged in 1979. Ms. Bhutto, who had wide public sympathy when she won the elections of November 1988, was at first preoccupied with avenging the death of her father. But many Pakistanis have mixed memories of Mr. Bhutto, a populist and an autocratic leader. Ms. Bhutto, despite her Western education, soon revived some fears of this personalized style of administration, while failing to deliver on election promises to improve social and economic conditions.
The Zia name, in contrast, still holds political weight. For common people, his was no reign of terror. Portraits of General Zia are still sold in the bazaars, and his visage adorns long-haul trucks. ''My father always used to say he had the silent majority of Pakistanis with him,'' Mr. Ijaz said.
On Aug. 17, the second anniversary of General Zia's death in a mysterious plane crash that also killed the United States Ambassador, Arnold Raphel, Mr. Ijaz plans to test the potential for his own political future when he speaks at a ceremony at General Zia's tomb in Islamabad, assuming that the event is allowed under emergency rules imposed this week.
 
Bank Executive Based in Bahrain
Mr. Ijaz, who until a few months ago was a Citibank vice president for Persian Gulf nations, based in Bahrain, is touring Pakistan to rally support for the Aug. 17 commemoration. He is also organizing the party machinery for the Muslim League, which dominates the conservative opposition Islamic Democratic Alliance, Ms. Bhuto's rival for power.
Mr. Ijaz said that his new Zia ul-Haq Foundation was computerizing the electoral history of all parliamentary constituencies. In each, a committee to screen and monitor candidates will be formed. If Mr. Ijaz, who has a master's degree in business administration from Southern Illinois University, is able to succeed, he will have created the first modern political organization in Pakistan, where nominations go more often than not to powerful families or their relatives, friends or retainers.
Electoral success, however, is still a long way off. Mr. Ijaz could prove an embarrassment to the Muslim League, which already has several other potential opposition leaders in the ranks. So far, Mr. Ijaz speaks only of securing a parliamentary seat, not a ministerial job.
Another unknown factor in Mr. Ijaz's future is the military, to which the league has been closely allied. Mr. Ijaz, who was never interested in following his father into a military career, says he has not spoken with the chief of the army, Gen. Mirza Alam Beg, since the army backed Ms. Bhutto's accession to power in 1988. The army also backed her ouster on Monday.
 
Bitterness Against Government
Mr. Ijaz has accused the Bhutto Government of harrasing his mother, whose presidential pension and other privileges were withdrawn. She and a mentally handicapped 17-year-old daughter live on an army pension, plus rent from a house General Zia owned and the help of another son, a physician, who lives with them. Two other sisters live abroad, one in the United States and one in Saudi Arabia.
Mr. Ijaz is bitter about the failure of the United States and Pakistan to resolve the mystery of his father's death, saying he believes there was a conspiracy to suppress investigations beyond the initial technical report. The United States Embassy has repeatedly denied the charge. ''The cover-up of the crash started immediately after it happened,'' Mr. Ijaz said. ''The Americans, the army and the President of Pakistan are all involved.''
Mr. Ijaz, who has been collecting evidence independently, said that he suspects the involvement of the Al-Zulfikar guerrilla organization, based in Syria and headed by Ms. Bhutto's brother, Mir Murtaza. In his political campaign, Mr. Ijaz says he will dwell on a deterioration of law and order, condemn weakening support for the Afghan resistance and expose what he called the corruption of Ms. Bhutto's husband and father-in-law, comparing their record with that of his father.
''People see that this man, General Zia ul-Haq, was uncorruptible,'' his son said. ''He was a very humble man who rose from nowhere to the top ranks of the army but never brought his family into public life. When he died, people did not even know how many children he had.''

HEADLINE: Quayle Presses Peru to Take U.S. Military Aid

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LIMA, Peru, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle said today that the United States does not intend to send American soldiers to Peru to fight drug traffickers.
But he pressed the new President of Peru to accept a $36 million military aid package that could result in the use of American military trainers in this country.
''We have no plans for military operations in the war on drugs - period,'' Mr. Quayle said at a news conference after a meeting here with the Peruvian President, Alberto Fujimori. 
Mr. Quayle, the highest-ranking American official to visit Peru in more than 30 years, vigorously denied recent news reports that the United States planned to send troops to the Andes to stem coca production.
Peru is the world's largest producer of coca leaf, the raw product for cocaine.
 
'Totally False' Reports
''I've also read these false reports that somehow there are going to be military operations in the Andes and Peru,'' Mr. Quayle said. ''Totally false. I would like to eradicate, if I may, the idea of militarization of the war on drugs.''
The Vice President insisted, however, that it was important that Mr. Fujimori accept the American military aid package, which is intended to help the Peruvian Government wrest control of coca-growing areas from leftist guerrillas.
President Fujimori, who has been in office less than a month, has been non-committal about accepting American military assistance. He has instead called for additional economic aid that could be used to wean Peruvian coca leaf growers from producing the illicit crop.
Of the meeting today, Mr. Quayle said, ''We did discuss this, and I do believe it is in his interest to accept this aid.''
Although he described the session with Mr. Fujimori as ''very productive,'' the Vice President declined to characterize Mr. Fujimori's response to suggestions that Peru accept the military aid. ''He will be making an announcement on this subject, not I,'' Mr. Quayle said.
The offer of military aid has drawn criticism from lawmakers in both Peru and the United States, who question whether the use of American military advisers in Peru could lead to the introduction of American troops in this nation's war against the Shining Path, the Maoist guerrilla group that controls drug-producing areas.
The drug war has been pushed to the sidelines of public debate in Peru in President Fujimori's first weeks in office, as the Peruvian leader struggles to prevent the collapse of the nation's economy.
There have been shortages of food and oil this week in Lima, the capital, as shoppers hoard staples in anticipation of Mr. Fujimori's economic recovery plan.
The plan is expected to eliminate price controls on some food and consumer goods. That, in turn, is expected to lead to widespread price increases.
 
Economic Chaos and Violence
The value of the Peruvian currency, the inti, has been in a free fall, and inflation in Peru is now running at nearly 20 percent a day.
Newspaper headlines in Lima this morning, describe the economic situation as ''Fujishock,'' and the President himself has described the economic situation as ''the most profound crisis in the nation's republican history.''
The economy chaos has led to violence. On Tuesday, several people were wounded, one critically, when bombs went off during demonstrations in Lima by workers protesting wage levels and the threat of Government-sanctioned price increases.
The loss of the coca crop could well be another severe economic blow to the Peruvian economy, since coca cultivation contributes an estimated $1 billion a year to the nation's economy, and farmers cannot readily convert to another crop.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf; Strategy: Embargo;
U.S. Bets Its Troops Will Deter Iraq While Sanctions Do the Real Fighting

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
By sending American troops to Saudi Arabia, President Bush moved to deter an Iraqi invasion and committed the United States to a long stay in the Middle East kingdom, gambling that a steady tightening of economic pressure will force President Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait, Administration officials said today.
Mr. Bush, they said, is confident that economic sanctions approved by the United Nations, the prospect of a multinational naval blockade and the constant threat of warfare with the United States and other nations will make Mr. Hussein's position in Kuwait untenable.
The Administration calculates that the economic embargo will cut off Mr. Hussein's supplies of military spare parts and ammunition, making it impossible to sustain his long supply lines and perhaps eroding his political stature at home, officials said. The United States is gambling that in time the Iraqi leader will be forced to retreat from Kuwait. 
''The embargo is the key,'' a senior official said. But he and other officials said it will take months for such an admittedly risky strategy to play out, and they said other, more long-range questions face Mr. Bush.
 
Action Now, Answers Later
Even if Mr. Hussein retreats from Kuwait, Middle Eastern politics has fundamentally been changed. How will the United States respond? How does the presence of a significant American military force in an Arab country, a major oil supplier to the United States, change the political and military equation? How will the new divisions created by the Kuwait invasion within an already tenuous Arab unity play out over the long run?
Administration officials said the White House is still groping for answers to these questions while, for now, Mr. Bush and his senior advisers are focused on the most immediate military and political issues.
The President asserted today that his current thinking is ''not beyond'' the sending of troops to Saudi Arabia in hopes of deterring an Iraqi attack on that country, the development American planners now fear most.
 
A Waiting Game
But Administration officials acknowledged that it is not enough for the United States simply to stall Mr. Hussein in Kuwait, because Mr. Bush has vowed to drive the Iraqi leader from the emirate.
Mr. Bush referred repeatedly in his news conference and televised address today to Mr. Hussein's reputation for ruthlessness. And, although they were not willing to say so explicitly, Mr. Bush, Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, made it clear that they were prepared to expand American military activity beyond the current ''defensive positions'' in Saudi Arabia.
Public comments today by Mr. Bush, Mr. Cheney and Mr. Powell, as well as interviews with other officials, made it clear that the United States is betting heavily on the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed on Iraq. But Administration officials acknowledged that this ''waiting game'' they are playing with Mr. Hussein is full of risk, since they have no reliable way of judging his intentions.
 
Assuming U.S. Threat Is Enough
The current American strategy is based on a series of assumptions and calculations about Iraqi capabilities and intentions.
Perhaps most important, Administration officials said they believed the presence of American troops in Saudi Arabia would be enough to keep Mr. Hussein from attacking. ''He would be bound to sustain incredible losses and we think it would be obvious that he would lose,'' one official said.
That calculation could underestimate the Iraqi's taste for battle. Mr. Hussein did not hesitate to attack Iran and then fight that nation for nine years despite the huge economic and human cost of the war.
But in explaining the American reasoning, an official said: ''Iran wasn't a nuclear power with airplanes and ships and highly trained forces. All Iran had was a lot of people and it basically sustained itself by throwing bodies at him. The United States presents a much different kind of foe for him and he surely recognizes that.''
 
All Hopes on Embargo
With the assumption that the threat of an Iraqi invasion of Saudi Arabia is mitigated by sending paratroopers and fighters to Saudi Arabia, the American strategy then boils down to the embargo.
''Hussein can't maintain himself in this position for too long,'' an official said. ''If the embargo is effective, it means the loss of all his funds, it means the loss of parts for his warplanes, since the two sources were France and the Soviet Union, and they cut him off. Now he has to look for someplace else to buy parts and we'll do our best to cut off all sources.''
The official added: ''He has a food and distribution problem, although he does own Kuwait and presumably there is some capacity within the country. Further, he's not getting any of the wealth he needed so badly and you've got to figure he needed wealth badly to undertake this action in the first place. That situation should be growing worse because the oil sales are cut off.''
It is something of a political departure that Mr. Bush is relying so heavily on an embargo, since he and other Republicans have often held that embargoes cannot bend the will of nations. But Administration officials defended the strategy.
 
Why an Embargo Would Work
''The belief is that the world has changed considerably,'' one official said. ''We don't have the cold war situation, where it was difficult to enforce sanctions because of ideological competition and huge divisions in the world. This time, we've got the Soviet Union on board and virtually everyone else as well.''
The official said geography is on the American side. ''You can shut off the gulf and you've got them locked in on the Mediterranean side,'' he said. ''We've got one pipeline shut down, and we're working on the other.''
Finally, Administration officials argued that economic sanctions have failed when they were applied against relatively healthy economies, like that of South Africa. ''This time,'' the official said, ''we're dealing with a single-source economy based on oil sales that is on its knees because of the war and can be hurt very easily.''
Beyond the military issues, Administration officials are facing a complex political situation with which they have not completely come to grips.
For one thing, they are still struggling with Arab resistance, notably in Egypt, to American military involvement. Mr. Bush has to find ways to repair his once friendly relations with King Hussein of Jordan, who has supported the Iraqis in the current conflict.
Beyond that, President Hussein of Iraq has been trying to drive a wedge between the region's ordinary citizen and the oligarchies, like those in Kuwait and Saudi Arabia, which have thrived on oil profits for decades and enjoyed American support.
Administration officials said they have considered this tactic, but play down its ability to change the political map of the Middle East. ''It's the old monarchy versus the new dictatorship, and Hussein hardly has clean hands,'' a senior official said. ''This is a guy who has run his country with cruelty and if this is populism, it's a populism of blood.''

Excerpts From Bush's Statement on U.S. Defense of Saudis

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's address from the Oval Office yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times:
In the life of a nation, we're called upon to define who we are and what we believe. Sometimes the choices are not easy. As today's President, I ask for your support in the decision I've made to stand up for what's right and condemn what's wrong all in the cause of peace.
At my direction, elements of the 82d Airborne Division as well as key units of the United States Air Force are arriving today to take up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia. I took this action to assist the Saudi Arabian Government in the defense of its homeland. No one commits America's armed forces to a dangerous mission lightly. But after perhaps unparalleled international consultation and exhausting every alternative, it became necessary to take this action. 
Let me tell you why. Less than a week ago in the early morning hours of Aug. 2, Iraqi armed forces, without provocation or warning, invaded a peaceful Kuwait. Facing negligible resistance from its much smaller neighbor, Iraq's tanks stormed in blitzkrieg fashion through Kuwait in a few short hours.
With more than 100,000 troops along with tanks, artillery and surface-to-surface missiles, Iraq now occupies Kuwait.
 
Principles of U.S. Policy
This aggression came just hours after Saddam Hussein specifically assured numerous countries in the area that there would be no invasion. There is no justification whatsoever for this outrageous and brutal act of aggression.
A puppet regime imposed from the outside is unacceptable. The acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable. No one, friend or foe, should doubt our desire for peace and no one should underestimate our determination to confront aggression. Four simple principles guide our policy. First, we seek the immediate unconditional and complete withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait. Second, Kuwait's legitimate Government must be restored to replace the puppet regime. And third, my Administration, as has been the case with every President from President Roosevelt to President Reagan, is committed to the security and stability of the Persian Gulf. And fourth, I am determined to protect the lives of American citizens abroad.
Immediately after the Iraqi invasion, I ordered an embargo of all trade with Iraq, and together with many other nations announced sanctions that both froze all Iraqi assets in this country and protected Kuwait's assets.
 
Appeasement's Limits
The stakes are high. Iraq is already a rich and powerful country. It possesses the world's second-largest reserves of oil and over a million men under arms. It's the fourth-largest military in the world.
Our country now imports nearly half the oil it consumes and could face a major threat to its economic independence. Much of the world is even more dependent upon imported oil and is even more vulnerable to Iraqi threats. We succeeded in the struggle for freedom in Europe because we and our allies remained stalwart. Keeping the peace in the Middle East will require no less.
But we must recognize that Iraq may not stop using force to advance its ambitions. Iraq has massed an enormous war machine on the Saudi border capable of initiating hostilities with little or no additional preparations. Given the Iraqi Government's history of aggression against its own citizens as well as its neighbors, to assume Iraq will not attack again would be unwise and unrealistic. And therefore, after consulting with King Fahd, I sent Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney to discuss cooperative measures we could take.
 
Enforcing the Sanctions
Following those meetings, the Saudi Government requested our help. And I responded to that request by ordering U.S. air and ground forces to deploy to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
Let me be clear, the sovereign independence of Saudi Arabia is of vital interest to the United States. This decision, which I shared with the Congressional leadership, grows out of the longstanding friendship and security relationship between the United States and Saudi Arabia.
U.S. forces will work together with those of Saudi Arabia and other nations to preserve the integrity of Saudi Arabia and to deter further Iraqi aggression. Through their presence, as as well through training and exercises, these multinational forces will enhance the overall capability of Saudi armed forces to defend the kingdom.
I want to be clear about what we are doing and why.
America does not seek conflict. Nor do we seek to chart the destiny of other nations. But America will stand by her friends. The mission of our troops is wholly defensive. Hopefully, they'll not be needed long. They will not initiate hostilities but they will defend themselves, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and other friends in the Persian Gulf.
And one more thing, I'm asking the oil companies to do their fair share. They should exercise restraint and not abuse today's uncertainties to raise prices.

Excerpts From Bush's News Conference on the Iraqi Invasion of Kuwait

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's news conference today on the Iraq crisis:
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. How long will you keep American forces in Saudi Arabia, and why not use them to drive the Iraqi troops out of Kuwait?
A. Well, as you know from what I said, they're there in a defensive mode right now. And therefore, that is not the mission, to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait. We have economic sanctions that I hope will be effective to that end, and I don't know how long they'll be there. They just got there - are just getting there. 
Q. Is this an open-ended commitment? I mean, could this drag on for years?
A. Nothing is open ended. But I'm not worrying about that there at all. I'm worrying about getting them there and doing what I indicated in our speech in there is necessary -the defense of the Saudis and the trying, through concerted international means, to reverse out this aggression.
 
War With Iraq
Q. Mr. President, are we in a war? And what other nations have agreed to join our forces in defending Saudi Arabia? And I take it you also have included other gulf nations in that umbrella.
A. We're not in a war. We have sent forces to defend Saudi Arabia. Other nations - I will leave announcements about what other nations will be participating to the Saudis. But I believe Margaret Thatcher, after talking to King Fahd, has announced that forces will be going in, and then I think you'll see other such actions. But I'd much prefer to leave that to Saudi Arabia, who - indeed, it's their country.
 
Cheney's Mission
Q. But was Cheney's mission successful in rallying support with Egypt and Morocco?
A. Well, I - I, having talked to Mubarak a couple of times myself, feel that we are in very close agreement with him. Who was your other country you asked about?
Q. Morocco, Yemen.
A. Morocco - very, very supportive of the Saudis and of our overall position on the Mideast. So, they're - I was very pleased with the Cheney mission in that regard.
 
Americans in Baghdad
Q. Mr. President, there are several dozen Americans in Baghdad apparently not able to leave [inaudible] and perhaps hundreds more in Kuwait, and perhaps elsewhere in Iraq as well. In view of the extreme political sensitivity of Americans toward this whole question of hostages, why should not Saddam Hussein feel that he holds very high cards now in dealing with the United States?
A. Well, I've been encouraged that there had been - have been actually announcements, I believe, saying people were free to leave. So I'm not going to speculate or hypothecate beyond that. I want to see them out of there, obviously. But what he does, that's a bit unpredictable.
 
Iraq's Chemical Arms
Q. Mr. President, the question of chemical weapons. There are reports that the Iraqis were seen loading airplanes with chemical weapons. How concerned are you that he would use these over our troops that are there?
A. Well, I think any time you deal with somebody who has used chemical weapons on the battlefield, you are concerned about it. And I would think that he'd know that, given the way the world views the use of chemical weapons, that it would be intolerable and that it would be dealt with very, very severely. So I would hope that there would be no use of chemical weapons.
 
Shutting a Pipeline
Q. Do you know if the Saudis are going to follow the Turks' lead in shutting off an Iraqi pipeline? . . . Have you had any promises from the Saudis or any other oil-producing countries that they will increase production to make up for this shortfall?
A. Well, I'm convinced - I believe that the Venezuelans have announced a significant increase. And I expect you'd find others to follow. And what was the first part, John?
Q. Are the Saudis cutting off the pipeline to - [inaudible]?
A. That matter will be discussed, I'm sure, and I know that the Saudis are fully in accord with the action taken by the United Nations in terms of Chapter 7 sanctions. And so I - but we have no deal with them in that regard.
 
The Press and Troops
Q. Sir, it's difficult for us to get information from Saudi Arabia, one reason being the American news media were not permitted to accompany American troops into Saudi Arabia. Was that your decision or King Fahd's?
A. That decision didn't come to me. But there's plenty of reporters in Saudi Arabia right now.
Q. Well, do you think there should be a Pentagon pool, as there was for example in Panama?
A. Well, I'd have to discuss that with the Secretary of Defense. I'm glad that the matter - that that many forces could be moved with not too much advance warning, and with not too much, therefore, risk to Saudi Arabia or to these troops. Yeah?
 
How Bush Decided
Q. Mr. President, was there any one single thing that tipped your hand into deciding to send U.S. troops and aircraft into Saudi Arabia? And secondly, how supportive have the Soviets been about your decision?
A. There was no one single thing that I can think of. But when King Fahd requested such support we were prompt to respond. But I can't think of an individual specific thing. If there was one, it would perhaps be the Saudis moving south when they said they were withdrawing.
Q. You mean the Iraqis, sir?
A. I mean, the Iraqis - thank you very much, it's been a long night - moving - the Iraqis moving down to the Kuwait-Saudi border when indeed they had given their word that they were withdrawing. That heightened our concern.
 
Support From Moscow
Q. How supportive have the Soviets been to your decision, sir?
A. The Soviets have been very responsible, in my view. They have joined the United Nations on that resolution, and Jim Baker, as recently as yesterday afternoon or evening, was in touch with Shevardnadze again. And you know, I can't ask for a more favorable response than he received. Yes, Jerry.
 
Economic Pressure
Q. Mr. President, is it your intention to let economic pressure alone provide the force that drives Iraq out of Kuwait? Are you prepared to wait several months, which is how long it might take for the economic sanctions to really bite?
A. Well, we've taken this first significant step to defend Saudi Arabia. The economic sanctions should begin to bite pretty soon. There will be further steps taken to insure that they are fully effective, and then we'll wait and see where we go from there.
 
Trust and Hussein
Q. Mr. President, you've told us several times of Saddam Hussein's lies in his dealings with other leaders and with the United States on his intentions. Why do you now believe the Iraqi Government's statements that they will let Americans go if there are no - if there is no evidence of an American being let go?
A. I'm not sure I totally believe them. I hope they're telling the truth.
 
Tactics Against Iraq
Q. Mr. President, you said in your speech this morning that the puppet regime in Kuwait was unacceptable, and so was the acquisition of territory. At the same time, though, you said that the - that the deployments are wholly defensive. The question is, how do you actually expect to force Hussein to withdraw from Kuwait?
A. Economic sanctions in this instance, if fully enforced, can be very, very effective. It is a rich country in terms of oil resources. They're a poor country, in a sense, because he squandered much of the resource on military might, and there are some indications that he's already beginning to feel the pinch. And nobody can stand up forever to total economic deprivation.
 
Overtures and Intentions
Q. Mr. President, can you tell us what U.S. and Saudi forces will be up against? You mentioned surface-to-surface missiles, you've spoken previously of the chemical-warfare capability. . . . The second part of the question is, did we misread Saddam Hussein? A couple of months ago, your people were up on the - the Administration was up on the Hill deflecting a move to put sanctions on - on - on --
A. Let me - let me ask you - I'm not going to take the question on the exact military problem there because we're going to have a thorough briefing at the Pentagon - I think they're much better equipped to handle that kind of detail. On Saddam Hussein, look, we have tried very hard to see if there wasn't a way to have somewhat improved relations. There's no question about that. But - and I have no regret about having tried to have discussions that might have led to a better relationship.
But that had to stop the minute you have this - this kind of aggression. But I don't think having - having tried tentatively to have a little better relationship with a person over the last couple of years - we've still been very, very wary all along of his - of his intentions.
 
Intelligence Lapse?
Q. But did our intelligence let us down or -or did you know that what has happened -when did you get an indication of - [inaudible] - as far as moving into Kuwait and that sort of thing?
A. No, I don't - I don't feel let down by the intelligence at all. When you plan a blitzkrieg-like attack that's launched at 2 in the morning, it's pretty hard to stop, particularly when you have just been given the word of the people involved that there wouldn't be any such attack.
 
Chances of Recession
Q. Do you think the spike in oil prices which has occurred significantly at home as a result of the Persian Gulf problem could edge the economy into a recession?
A. I have not been advised of that. I hope that is not the case, and what I hope to do is see a reduction in oil prices once a - once it becomes clear that there will not be shortage. There's an overhang now of oil in the marketplace, thank God. We have a Strategic Petroleum Reserve that we can draw from. Other countries have the same - a couple of other countries have S.P.R.'s themselves.

Excerpts From News Conference by Cheney and Powell at the Pentagon

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a news conference at the Pentagon today by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and Gen. Colin L. Powell, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, as provided by the Federal News Service, a transcription agency:
 
OPENING STATEMENTS
CHENEY. I thought I would open with a brief statement about my trip this past weekend.
We arrived in Saudi Arabia on Monday; met with King Fahd Monday evening, as well as the Crown Prince and other officials. At that time, we discussed in general the intelligence that was available to us on the situation in the gulf, reviewed with them the diplomatic developments and all of the work that had been under way by the President with respect to efforts to impose economic and political sanctions on Iraq in regard to its invasion of Kuwait. We then discussed with them in some detail the military situation on the ground in the Persian Gulf region, and we also presented to the King a rundown on our military capabilities. 
Subsequent to those discussions, the King made the request for the deployment of U.S. forces to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. I conveyed that request by telephone to the President. The President authorized me to deploy those forces, and I subsequently then gave instructions for those deployments to the chairman by telephone back here in Washington, and of course, to General Schwarzkopf who was with me in Jidda, Saudi Arabia.
Subsequent to that, I had a meeting the next morning with Prince Sultan, who is the Saudi Defense Minister. We discussed in greater detail the deployments that are now under way. When I left Saudi Arabia at the direction of the President I stopped and visited, as I think's been announced, President Mubarak in Alexandria, Egypt. And then last evening, King Hassan in Rabat, Morocco.
POWELL. After the Secretary called back, orders were issued for the deployment on Monday evening, and the first element lifted off the ground - early advance party elements lifted off the ground at 7:35 yesterday morning, and the flow has continued with the major part of the flow beginning last night with the departure of the F-15's from Langley Air Force Base.
At the moment, the following forces are in the area of operations or are soon to arrive within the area of operations. Let me begin with the Persian Gulf. As you know, for a long time we have had a presence in the Persian Gulf, and that's the Joint Task Force Middle East, currently consisting of seven ships -Antietam, England, Vandergrift, Ray, Rentz, Barbey, and then the flagship, La Salle, and the Bradley is also part of the force right now. They have been there for some time and were pre-positioned and are not part of the new deployments.
Coming to the southeast, we had the arrival of the aircraft carrier Independence and its group on Monday, and it was prepared for operations on Tuesday. And you see additional forces with the Independence group -some of those are combatants and some of those are resupply ships. With respect to additional naval forces moved into the region as part of the direction given to us by the President and the Secretary, the Eisenhower battle group has now passed through the Suez Canal and has taken up a position generally where you see it in the Red Sea along with the Scott and the Ticonderoga.
As you also know and have seen on television, the Saratoga battle group as well as the battleship Wisconsin, departed East Coast ports for a normal deployment - not part of this operation, just a normal deployment. But obviously, as these ships arrive in the Mediterranean and operate in the Mediterranean, they will increase our overall naval presence in the region.
With respect to the deployment of air forces, as I mentioned F-15 model C's and D's left Langley Air Force Base last evening -during the course of the evening. They are continuing today. And the first planes havelanded in Saudi Arabia and are taking up positions at various locations within Saudi Arabia.
And finally, with respect to ground force deployments so far, the Division Ready Brigade, D.R.B. - that brigade that is always kept in the highest state of readiness in the 82d Airborne Division - left beginning at 3 this morning for duty in Saudi Arabia and will be arriving in Saudi Arabia in the course of the afternoon and evening.
That is all I'm going to say now with respect to those deployments that are under way or units that have already arrived in country. Thank you.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
Q. General, could you at least say how many men are in the Division Ready Brigade?
POWELL. No. I'm not going to give specific numbers with respect to the size of our forces in country or in the Division Ready Brigade at this time.
 
Troop Vulnerability
Q. General Powell, how vulnerable are these troops during this transition period when you're putting troops and equipment into place?
A. We thought of that, and I think they are pretty secure. Even though these aircraft and ground troops are just arriving, the Independence is in a position to provide support now, as is the Eisenhower battle group. So we have the ability to cover these movements. And, of course, the Saudi armed forces are quite capable. They have Awacs aircraft. They also have top-of-the-line fighters. So I'm reasonably sure that we can get in in good order without presenting any vulnerabilities. I think I also failed to mention the five Awacs that are also arriving just about now in Saudi Arabia.
 
Chemical Warfare
Q. What is the threat of chemical warfare on behalf of the Iraqis? Have they moved any chemical weapons down to within range of Saudi Arabia?
A. The Iraqi armed forces do have chemical weapons, artillery-delivered as well as delivered by other means. They have used them in the past. It's a threat that we're concerned with. And I treat it as a capability that is there and could be used. I am not - I don't want to heighten any concern with respect to that because the intelligence is somewhat ambiguous. But it is a capability that they have demonstrated in the past that they will use, and we understand that and we have -are preparing our forces accordingly. But I don't want to heighten tension any more over that issue.
 
Troop Training
Q. General, can you give us an estimate of how trained and ready your troops are to fight a force of a million men that's already been through an eight-year war with Iran?
A. . . . Even though there may be one million people in the Iraqi Army, it is not an army that is currently postured to come storming across any border with one million people. I am confident of our ability, when we have finished our deployments, to be able to accomplish the mission the President gave us.
 
Gas Protection
Q. Could you tell us if these troops that have already been deployed to Saudi Arabia - are they equipped with specialized gear to deal with gas warfare?
A. Yes.
Q. Could you get into some detail of exactly what kind of equipment that entails?
A. We have protective masks, we have overgarments that will protect the body from chemical contamination, and we have necessary medicines that will serve as antidotes to chemical agents.
 
Iraqi Forces
Q. General, would you give us your assessment, please, of the quality of the Iraqi forces that invaded Kuwait and their readiness, based upon their current positions, to go further into Saudi Arabia should that be the military decision?
A. Well, they conducted the Kuwaiti operation in a very professional manner. It's an army that is capable. They have had eight years of experience in war. They have the capability to invade Saudi Arabia with forces in contact and they have the ability to reinforce those forces. That's what's caused this problem that we now have. So, we treat them and view them as a capable military force. But they are not invincible and they're not 10 feet tall and we have capabilities that we are now bringing to bear, to insure that we, in concert with the armed forces of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, can deal with that threat.
 
Missile Capability
Q. On the points the President raised in his speech about the surface-to-surface missiles, could you explain the concern --
A. They have that capability.
Q. -- that the President had in mind, particular - in terms of particular weapons systems and what those are?
A. Well, those weapons systems, as we have seen demonstrated, have quite a range. And the Iraqis have shown a great deal of creativity in taking Soviet equipment they had been provided and modifying that equipment to give it even greater range. And if you look at the range arcs, that is one of the principal threats directed against Saudi Arabia. And that's why, I'm sure, the President highlighted it.
 
Deal With Saudis
Q. What was the breakthrough that King Fahd saw in your argument? . . .
CHENEY. Well, the discussion with King Fahd obviously was - I - a significant moment. He - the conversation went on for about two hours roughly, and it was, as I say - consisted initially of my presentation and that of General Schwarzkopf as we briefed on the situation in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait and Iraq and also briefed on our military capabilities.
My impression is - although obviously the King would want to speak for himself - but that it had become abundantly clear that the Iraqis had, in fact, committed an act of infamy, if you will, in their aggression against Kuwait; that, having told the Saudis and others in the region that they had no intention to invade, they did in fact invade; that the conduct of Saddam Hussein represented a qualitative shift, if you will, in sort of the rules of behavior in that part of the world.
The King indicated to me that he felt his first priority had to be the safety and security of the people of Saudi Arabia, and that based upon that, based upon the historic relationship of the United States and the Government of Saudi Arabia - specifically, he cited the meeting between his father, King Abdul Aziz, and President Roosevelt on the U.S.S. Quincy in 1945, and based upon their fundamental trust of the United States, they were prepared to ask for our assistance. And I think it was that culmination of events of the last few days - the naked aggression by Iraq as well as the historic relationship of the United States and President Bush's extensive consultations with him and commitment to provide significant forces for the defense of the kingdom, that combination of things - that led to King Fahd's decision to ask for our help.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
To Baghdad, Poison Gas Is 'Poor Man's A-Bomb'

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
Poison gas, a weapon no United States serviceman has had to confront since 1918, could make the Arabian desert virtually impassable for American ground troops in a no holds-barred war with Iraq.
Iraqi chemical weapons could cause enormous casualties among ground troops, experts agree, and could leave so much contamination on the ground that passage would be unsafe long afterward. Poison gas is known among arms makers as ''the poor man's atomic bomb.''
American troops are issued protective clothing and other gear to cope with gas attacks, and the Army's tanks and other armored vehicles have air-filtering systems. But these pose logistic and other problems, particularly in the hot climate of the Persian Gulf in summer, that could severely hamper troops in combat. 
Even in the face of inevitable American reprisals, analysts speculate, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq might be tempted to use every weapon at his disposal in the hope of quickly wounding the United States badly enough to discourage further involvement.
 
An Early Advantage
If Iraq and the United States were to go to war in the next few days, Iraqi chemical weapons, combined with a small but modern arsenal of battlefield missiles and a large armored force that includes 5,500 tanks - of which at least 500 are advanced Soviet T-72's, could give Iraq a potent edge in the opening phase. Iraq is much weaker than the United States in tactical air power and reconnaissance, but the build-up of American ground forces in the area will take time, and a quick strike by Iraq could overwhelm a large area.
Besides softening up American resistance, poison gas might be used to disrupt or disable military depots, oil pipeline stations, ports and population centers. Some forms of mustard and nerve gas are highly persistent, and contaminated soil can remain hazardous or lethal for years. Facing imminent defeat, Iraq might even use poison gas to destroy as much of the Middle East's oil-pumping capacity as possible with the object of causing economic havoc in the West until petroleum production facilities could be repaired.
Although some United States Army troops have been trained to survive the unique hardships of desert warfare, and all American soldiers have had at least superficial instruction in chemical warfare defenses, Iraq's veteran forces are far more experienced in these vital skills.
 
An Ample Stock on Hand
Col. Andrew Duncan of the British Army, a spokesman for the International Institute for Strategic Studies based in London, said in an interview that Iraq is presumed to have ample stocks of chemical weapons. Iraq manufactures both mustard gas - a major killer during World War I - and the nerve gas tabun, which was invented during the 1940's by Nazi Germany. In its recent war with Iran and fighting against Kurdish dissidents in Iraq, Baghdad mounted repeated chemical attacks, principally using canisters dropped from aircraft. Residual poison gas is still causing casualties in these areas , experts say.
The nerve gases stocked in military arsenals are colorless, volatile liquids that can be sprayed as aerosol mists, or dispersed by explosions.
Both mustard and nerve gas can attack through the skin. A droplet of liquid nerve gas the size of a pinhead can kill a person.
 
Outfitted Like an Astronaut
This means that battlefield survival in a nerve-gas environment depends on complete isolation from the lethal chemical. Fitted with full protective gear, an American soldier looks like a lunar astronaut. His face is covered by a hermetically-sealed M40 or M43 mask fitted with a communications microphone and head phones, and provided with air filtered by various absorbent chemicals.
His body is enveloped in a double-layered synthetic-fiber suit containing gas-absorbing charcoal. A gas-resistant shroud covers his head and shoulders, underneath a heavy Kevlar helmet, and he wears butyl rubber gloves and boots.
A soldier wearing this cumbersome, stifling garb must also carry a weapon, ammunition, a water canteen, a first-aid pack, and whatever other field equipment he is assigned. When he walks or runs he quickly overheats, as recent experiments at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland demonstrated.
In the Arabian desert, where midday temperatures hover around 120 degrees, sustained infantry combat in a nerve-gas environment without frequent air-conditioned rest periods is out of the question.
To cope with the problem, the Army relies on its M20 ''Collective Protection Equipment'' - a gas-tight plastic liner for a room or tent fitted with pumps that supply untainted, cool air to occupants.
 
Iraqis Experienced
Iraqi troops would face the same dangers and problems as Americans in a chemical war, but they have had years of practice in conducting chemical warfare and in fighting in a hot climate and know what to expect.
 
Nature Is an Enemy
Tanks and some other combat vehicles can be sealed against poison gas, but all protective systems are based on filtering systems that chemically remove lethal substances from the air pumped inside. The filtering chemicals used in these systems, and in gas masks, become exhausted with use, especially if the contamination is heavy, and must be changed every few hours or days, requiring reliable supplies or replacements.
Desert warfare is conducted over vast areas where nature is often as potent an adversary as a human enemy. World War II tank battles in the deserts of Egypt, Libya and Tunisia demonstrated the critical importance of supply lines covering vast distances. Allied air power was decisive in interdicting Axis supplies to North Africa from across the Mediterranean, and American air supremacy over the Arabian desert in the present confrontation could similarly hamstring Iraq's mechanized forces by stopping supplies of fuel, ammunition and food.
But it may take time for an American air umbrella to dominate the desert, and meanwhile, Iraq's powerful armored divisions, backed by the threat or use of chemical weapons, could take a heavy toll.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
NATO, Bereft of a Military Role, Redefines Itself as the West's Political Galvanizer

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Aug. 8

 BODY:
The United States briefed its NATO allies today on its decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia and encouraged them to participate in an international force being formed in response to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, NATO officials said.
Although NATO is constrained by its charter from playing a military role in a conflict outside Europe or North America unless a member state - in this case Turkey - is attacked, the United States has sought to involve the alliance to underline the West's determination to confront Baghdad.
On Monday, President Bush received NATO's Secretary General, Manfred Worner, at the White House. Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d will fly here on Friday to address NATO foreign ministers after paying a quick visit to Turkey on Thursday. ''We think NATO's political role is crucial,'' an American official said. 
Several hours before President Bush delivered his televised address announcing the troop buildup in Saudi Arabia, the United States Ambassador to NATO, William H. Taft 4th, informed the North Atlantic Council of Washington's plans and emphasized the importance of a multinational military response to the Iraqi challenge.
 
Unusual Unanimity
''We hope for as much support as possible for the force,'' an American official at NATO's headquarters here said. ''And there's more unanimity on this point than I can remember before in this house. Now we have to see who is willing to participate.''
Britain, which is already moving to reinforce its naval presence in the gulf, said today it would join the multinational force protecting Saudi Arabia. France, which has also dispatched a frigate to join two warships in the gulf, indicated that it was not yet ready to do so. Other countries had yet to respond, although Italy joined a multinational force that patrolled the gulf in 1987.
Because NATO itself is not directly involved, member countries are not required to allow American naval and air bases on their territory to be used for refueling, for massing troops or as staging posts in any gulf conflict.
Spain and Italy nonetheless said today that they had authorized the United States to make use of American bases there. Greece said last weekend it would not permit American bases in Crete to be used for staging any military action in the Middle East.
American officials said that while the multinational force would not be coordinated by the 16-nation North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO is serving as a forum for exchanging information and developing contingency plans for a possible expansion in the crisis or for a potential disruption in international oil supplies.
 
Sending a Signal
The North Atlantic Council, the organization's senior policy-making body, has already met twice, and many other committees have been meeting daily. ''Even if the United States is acting unilaterally, you should not underestimate NATO's role as an expression of political solidarity,'' the American official said.
In an example of the action behind the scenes here, the little-known NATO Wartime Oil Organization met today with the organization's Economic, Political and Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committees to analyze the political impact of an oil shortage on NATO countries and its strategic effect on the alliance itself.
A delegate from the United States Department of Energy, Romulo Diaz, urged NATO members at the meeting to work together to conserve oil, American officials said. He also briefed them on specific proposals related to strategic oil reserves that Washington will present on Thursday at a meeting of the 21-nation International Energy Agency in Paris.
Along with mobilizing agencies to handle food relief, evacuation and other potential needs in a war situation, the Senior Civil Emergency Planning Committee was preparing to mobilize civilian resources like merchant vessels, which would be used if it were necessary to move large numbers of American troops to Europe.
 
NATO Broadens Its Interests
NATO officials pointed out that while the organization was founded in 1949 to counter the Soviet threat, it has in recent months broadened its interpretation of the alliance's security interests to include regional conflicts.
Although NATO cannot yet act ''out of area,'' meaning outside Europe and North America, the officials noted that the organization had embarked on a major strategic review since the virtual collapse of the Warsaw Pact in Eastern Europe.
''The Iraq crisis is a concrete example of what we have been talking about when we refer to 'new challenges,' '' an American official said. ''That's why Washington is giving NATO a high profile in this case. It's anxious that NATO be seen to be relevant.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
A New Kind of Crisis

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
For the first time in many years, an American President has discussed a grave international crisis and the serious actions it requires of him without issuing a call to arms against Communism or raising the old, familiar cold war fears.
Perhaps as a partial result, the U.N. Security Council was able to take strong and unusual action -mandatory sanctions against Iraq, in response to its conquest of Kuwait, with the Soviet Union, China and the United States standing together in the unanimous vote.
The lack of cold war overtones also may have been partly responsible for Mr. Bush's diplomatic success in pulling Moscow, Beijing, Japan, the European Community and even some of the Middle Eastern nations into alignment with the U.S. against Iraq and its dictator, Saddam Hussein.
That it was against indisputable ''Iraqi aggression,'' not some hazy ''Red threat,'' that Mr. Bush acted also helps explain what appears to be the unusual unity of the American public and of Congress in his support. Mr. Hussein, moreover, has refused foolishly to make good his promise to pull out of Kuwait - which would have made it much harder to mobilize opposition to him. 
Even so, the President probably could not have achieved such international unity, even in the absence of divisive cold war pressures, had not the Mideast crisis concerned oil -the energy source not just for tanks and planes but for modern economies around the world.
Any threat to oil supplies and prices invokes the common and vital interest of many nations. That may have been the factor that encouraged Mr. Bush to risk his call for the ''immediate, unconditional and complete withdrawal of all Iraqi forces from Kuwait'' and the restoration of the emirate. Such a call could only be a gamble on bringing about the downfall, not just the defeat, of Saddam Hussein.
Mr. Bush described the independence of Saudi Arabia as a ''vital interest'' of this country. Sending American forces to protect that interest can leave Mr. Hussein in no doubt that an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia would mean war with the United States. At least by Western standards of reasoning - which may not apply - the Iraqi dictator seems unlikely to take up this deliberate challenge.
By the same standards, however, he seems equally unlikely to meet Mr. Bush's requirements that he pull out of Kuwait and restore its former Government to office. If, as appears likely, he invaded that country to repair an Iraqi economy badly damaged by his long war against Iran and to divert his populace from his harsh dictatorship, he might well not survive the abject surrender that Mr. Bush demands.
Some Middle Eastern nations will support the President's determination to protect Saudi Arabia, in order to stop Mr. Hussein's power grab. But even those nations may not join in his demand for a restoration of the status quo ante in Kuwait. The former Kuwaiti emirate was not well regarded among other oil-producing nations, owing to its violations of OPEC decisions; and it would be easy for endangered nations in the region to concede the conquest of Kuwait in return for Mr. Hussein's promises to leave everybody else alone.
Thus, the odds seem fairly good that Mr. Bush's dispatch of U.S. forces will deter an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia, if one ever was contemplated. But the President might well lose his gamble that Mr. Hussein will back down on Kuwait.
The forces going into Saudi Arabia, Mr. Bush insisted, are ''wholly defensive'' and have no mission ''to drive the Iraqis out of Kuwait.'' Thus, the President was careful not to threaten military action against Mr. Hussein - only to make it clear that military action by him against Saudi Arabia will be resisted. In the effort to reverse the invasion of Kuwait, Mr. Bush insisted at his news conference, his reliance was on ''economic sanctions.''
Perhaps the international need to thwart Mr. Hussein's reach for effective control of Mideast oil can make those sanctions as effective as Mr. Bush hopes. But what if they don't force an Iraqi pullout from Kuwait, to which Mr. Bush is pledged, or bring about the downfall of Saddam Hussein, for which he obviously aims?
The President was careful at his news conference neither to rule out nor to threaten ''pre-emptive strikes'' against Iraq itself (presumbly air strikes). The inference surely must be taken, however, that if sanctions don't produce the desired results, military action is next.

HEADLINE: More Babies Are Dying

 BODY:
Born in the U.S.A.: it should be a matter of pride. But for too many children, being born here constitutes bad luck. That's the substance of a sidetracked report by the White House Task Force on Infant Mortality. 
A quarter of the 40,000 infant deaths that occur in this country every year are easily preventable; so are a lot of the handicaps that afflict 100,000 newborns. The problems are primarily attributable to their mothers' lack of prenatal care.
Some officials involved in the study told a Times reporter that it was on hold because the conclusions were an inconvenient reminder of unkept Bush campaign promises. Another official says it just needs further work. Never mind. The report won't be news to health care professionals.
They've known for years that poverty and accompanying ignorance, combined with cuts in Federal programs, have slowed America's steady progress in lowering the infant mortality rate. Today, instead of going down it is being pushed up by crack, venereal disease and AIDS. By this measure, the United States ranks 20th among industrialized countries in preventing infant deaths.
America already knows how to make the rate drop again. Two years ago the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality recommended expanded Medicaid coverage and incentives to doctors to take Medicaid patients. The White House Task Force makes similar recommendations, and suggests an increase in Federal spending on prenatal care. Both panels say employers might also contribute.
The Task Force estimates that the steps it recommends would cost $480 million a year. Compare that with the lifetime medical costs for low-birthweight babies; each can run $400,000. Such costs of children now being born to crack-addicted mothers are beyond reckoning.
America can't afford not to spent more on prenatal care, not on economic grounds and not on the grounds of humanity.

HEADLINE: A Black Congressional Hope in Connecticut

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO

DATELINE: OXFORD, Conn., Aug. 7

 BODY:
Here in the Naugatuck Valley, long a bastion of the white working class, Gary Franks is an unlikely candidate for a seat in Congress. He is a black Republican.
But Mr. Franks won his party's nomination here last month after a seven-hour, nine-ballot, five-candidate convention, and he is now pitted against Toby Moffett, a liberal Democrat, in the race for the Fifth Congressional District, which is represented by John G. Rowland, the Republican gubernatorial candidate.
The contest is expected to be one of the most watched Congressional battles in the nation, and it could make Mr. Franks, a popular three-term alderman from Waterbury, Connecticut's first black Congressman. If elected, he would also become the first black Republican since 1935 to sit as a voting member in the House of Representatives. 
''The Democrats expected some small-town suburban Republican to win the nomination,'' said Mr. Franks's director of communications, Stephen R. Beaujon. ''I think Toby went to the nearest bar when he heard Gary Franks won.''
But Mr. Moffett, 46 years old, is unfazed, at least publicly, by Mr. Franks's nomination, saying that each of the Republicans vying for the nomination had different strengths and weaknesses.
After his victory, Mr. Franks, 37, received pledges of support and financing from national, local and state Republican leaders.
''One of my arguments at the convention,'' he said, ''was 'Who would do better against Toby Moffett?' ''
Mr. Moffett, a former representative, is frequently criticized for his recent move to Newtown, in the Fifth Congressional District, after living for three years in Branford, in the Third Congressional District. In his years in the House, from 1974 to 1982, he lived in Litchfield in the Sixth Congressional District. There is no residency requirement for Congressional candidates.
''Moffett is a carpetbagger,'' said Liz Hamel, a spokeswoman for the Republican Congressional Campaign Committee in Washington.
Until last fall, he worked as a television news anchor in New Britain after failing to win a Senate seat in 1982 and the Democratic gubernatorial nomination in 1986.
 
A Call for Self-Sufficiency
Mr. Franks, a fiscal conservative, has assailed Mr. Moffett as a liberal remnant of the Jimmy Carter era, which he said was partly responsible for economic policies that led to double-digit inflation and interest rates of more than 20 percent.
''The key to the American way is making people self-sufficient,'' he said. ''The worst myth out there is that you can do this through policies that tax and spend, tax and spend, tax and spend.'' Mr. Franks supports a capital gains tax cut and opposes raising Federal income-tax rates. He favors a constitutional amendment to prohibit burning the American flag and supports the death penalty for so-called drug kingpins. He supports abortion rights, and he criticizes abuses in some Federal programs like welfare, that lead to a ''spiral of government dependency.''
''He's an excellent choice to run against Toby Moffett,'' said Jack R. Goldberg, Mr. Rowland's press secretary.
 
All-State Basketball Player
The other Republicans who vied for the spot were Steve Watson of Danbury, State Senator Jamie McLaughlin of Brookfield, State Representative Alan Schlesinger of Derby and former State Representative Warren Sarasin of Beacon Falls.
Mr. Franks grew up in Waterbury, where he was senior class president and an all-state basketball player at Sacred Heart High School. His father was a mill worker who never finished the sixth grade, but all six Franks children graduated from college, and three have earned doctorates.
''I'm the only one with just one degree,'' said Mr. Franks, who graduated from Yale in 1975.
After college, Mr. Franks spent several years working for corporations in Fairfield County as an industrial and labor relations executive before starting his own real-estate firm.
As a Waterbury alderman, Mr. Franks has won praise from both Democrats and Republicans.
 
'He's His Own Man'
''He's held in high regard by all people,'' said John A. Sarlo, a Democrat and minority leader on the Board of Aldermen. ''He is going to run well.''
''He is his own man,'' Mr. Sarlo continued. ''He was for the city requiring more public notice for zoning and development, and that went against the grain of some of his party.''
Mr. Franks, expects to do well in Waterbury, which has about 15 percent of the district's registered voters and more than a third of its Democrats.
He also believes his Republican voter base in the rest of the district is strong because of its intense antipathy toward Mr. Moffett.
Moreover, Mr. Rowland's coattails are likely to help Mr. Franks, who lost a race for state comptroller in 1986 but received more votes than any other Republican on the ticket, carrying the Fifth District by 20,000 more votes than the party's gubernatorial candidate, Julie D. Belaga of Westport.
 
'It's a Targeted Race'
Some Republicans believe Mr. Franks would have faced a more difficult campaign against another Democrat, Michael Pacowta, the Mayor of Shelton, who has deep roots in the working class and conservative Naugatuck Valley. He decided not to engage in a primary against Mr. Moffett.
They note that Mr. Moffett did not carry the Fifth Congressional District in 1982 in his losing challenge for the Senate seat held by Lowell P. Weicker Jr. Mr. Moffett's campaign manager, Jay H. Marlin, is weary of the carpetbagger label and attacks on Mr. Moffett's record. ''It's a targeted race,'' Mr. Marlin said. ''No matter who was running they're going to be teeing off on Toby Moffett.''
''Now they are saying Gary Franks is the greatest thing since sliced bread,'' Mr. Marlin said, ''but it did take them seven hours and nine ballots to determine they want him as their nominee.''
 
Raising Campaign Money
The Fifth District is 1 of 29 open seats this fall. The district meanders across the middle of the western half of the state from Meriden west to Danbury. It includes such wealthy towns as Weston and Wilton, as well as Waterbury and the old blue-collar mill towns along the Naugatuck River.
Mr. Franks, who has raised about $150,000 so far, expects to raise $500,000 to $600,000 for the campaign, and the figure, according to some Democrats, may run as high as $1 million. Mr. Moffett has raised $300,000 so far and also expects to raise $500,000 to $600,000.
Neither campaign believes that Mr. Franks's race will be a significant issue. But neither can Mr. Franks rely on a large turnout of black support to carry him into Congress. Blacks make up only about 4 percent of the voters in the district, which is almost evenly divided among Democrats, Republicans and unaffiliated voters.
Currently, there are only two other black Republicans running for Congress: Former Cincinnati Mayor Ken Blackwell in Ohio, and a businessman, Al Brown, in Louisville, Ky. There are no black Republicans who are mayors of major cities, nor are there any black Republican governors. The last black Republican in the Senate was Edward Brooke of Massachusetts who left his seat in 1978.
But Mr. Franks noted that black Republicans were common, and, in some areas, before the 1932 Presidential election, outnumbered black Democrats.
''The pendulum can swing both ways,'' he said, citing recent polls that have given President Bush a moderate favorability rating among black voters. ''Right now, it's way over, but it's starting to go back.''

HEADLINE: Burmese Rebel Recalls Days of Violence

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
Every Saturday for the last month, denying himself food or drink, Min Sun Min dons one of his two suits, knots his one red polyester tie and rides the subway to the Upper East Side for an act of revolutionary defiance.
The slight, 110-pound Mr. Min Sun Min stands silently all day across the street from the Burmese Consulate holding a carefully lettered poster that reads: ''Hand over the power to the voters'' and ''Release all political prisoners.''
''I come and protest here as a representative of all Burmese people's sufferings,'' he said.
The solitary vigil by the 34-year-old dissident is as quixotic in its hope as it is in its audacity. The Government of Myanmar, formerly Burma, does not have a history of tolerating dissent either at home or abroad, scholars say. The nation's military rulers violently crushed a nationwide pro-democracy uprising that began two years ago yesterday, and despite their overwhelming defeat in recent elections, they have so far refused to hand over power. 
 
'I Wear My Best Clothes'
''The Government puts pressure on the relatives of dissidents in Burma,'' said Josef Silverstein, a professor of political science at Rutgers University, ''taking away their jobs, arresting them or brutalizing them in some way, to keep those abroad quiet.''
To groggy Upper East Side residents, who pass the silent protester on Saturday mornings on their way to Central Park or down the street to buy croissants, Mr. Min Sun Min barely warrants recognition. Even a spokesman for the consulate said he had no idea who Mr. Min Sun Min was or what he wanted.
''On this day I wear my best clothes,'' he said, standing across the street from the white, four-story consulate at 10 East 77th Street, ''because I believe that my work here is very noble, like when you go to church.''
Hanging from his neck is a sign that says, ''Peace Burma.'' Like many Burmese dissidents, Mr. Min Sun Min refuses to use the Government's new name for his homeland.
Despite his obscurity in this country, Mr. Min Sun Min was a leading opposition figure before he fled his homeland.
''He was not a nationally known figure, but he played an important role in his city,'' said Thant Myint-U, a fellow at the International Center for Development Policy who specializes in Myanmar. ''The life of both Sun Min and Yuzana Khin, another student leader, have been very difficult since they arrived here. They came to the United States with the hope that they could study about American democracy, but they haven't been able to get any financial support.''
Min Sun Min, meaning king of the sun, is a pseudonym; he has used it to protect relatives since he became a public figure.
During the Aug. 8, 1988, democratic uprising, he led protests in Bassein and ran the city's dissident newspaper, The Gong. The uprising ended in a crackdown by the police and soldiers on Sept. 18 and 19 that left an estimated 3,000 people dead.
Since his arrival, which was arranged with the help of Representatives Dana Rohrabacher; Republican of California, Bill Richardson, Democrat of New Mexico, and Steven Schiff, Republican of New Mexico, interest in the plight of political dissidents in Myanmar has waned.
 
A Tiny Basement Room
On Mr. Min Sun Min's first day in New York last January, he stepped off a bus in Times Square carrying two vinyl bags and was promptly robbed of all the money he had - $20. Life has been a lonely struggle ever since.
He has handed out fliers for Chinese restaurants, and he spent a few nights in Central Park last March scavenging for bags of bread that are left for the homeless. He now lives in a tiny basement room he shares with five Chinese immigrants in Brooklyn.
The few hundred Burmese in New York, 400 of whom are still Burmese citizens according to the consulate, shy away from Mr. Min Sun Min's protests.
''I know the other Burmese cannot join me,'' he said. ''They have too much to lose.''
 
Taught English Classes
Mr. Min Sun Min, who worked as a high school teacher, fled Myanmar after General Saw Maung's military junta took control in September 1988. The swift retribution by the military made it impossible for him to say good-bye to his wife and son, now 7 years old.
Mr. Min Sun Min made his way with other students to the remote Three Pagodas Pass, one of 12 student camps along the border with Thailand affiliated with the Democratic Alliance of Burma, a group consisting of 23 ethnic groups opposed to the junta. He was elected to represent the 500 students at the camp and he taught English.
But Mr. Min Sun Min's nine-month experience in the guerrilla war soured him on the armed struggle.
''After battles we would pick up the dead bodies of the soldiers, taking their guns and their bags,'' he said. ''I saw that the soldiers were very young, like our students, and then I saw the letters from their parents and the photographs. I felt very sad. I could not believe these young boys were my enemy. Their officers were my enemy, but not these boys. I decided that the military way was not the right way.''
 
A Series of Odd Jobs
Mr. Min Sun Min, suffering from malaria, and Ms. Yuzana Khin, were admitted to the United States by the Immigration and Naturalization Service a year ago under a special two-year humanitarian-parole program. Ms. Yuzana Khin, who lives in Washington, said she has similiar economic difficulties and trouble organizing more than two-dozen Burmese for protests outside the embassy.
Since his arrival Mr. Min Sun Min has met with student groups and is studying English at Hunter College with a scholarship from the human rights group Asia Watch. He has taken a series of odd jobs, including washing dishes and delivering food. He currently works at a Manhattan photocopying store.
When the Burmese Government refused to release jailed opposition leaders this year, as it had promised, Mr. Min Sun decided to begin his lone protest. Yesterday, the second anniversary of the uprising, he and five other Burmese along with six Americans protested for two hours outside the consulate.
Mr. Min Sun Min lives on the corner of Church Avenue and East Seventh Street near Prospect Park in Brooklyn. There are no sheets on his worn mattress. Copies of newspapers and news magazines are stacked on the floor along with a few books on nonviolent struggle and a typewriter. Mr. Min Sun Min, who published 11 short stories back home, keeps copious notes and a diary about his life in America. Over his bed is a Burmese flag.
He hopes the Burmese political situation improves soon so that he can return home.
''It's hardest at night,'' he said. ''When I go to bed I always remember the custom of saying good night to my son. And then when I close my eyes I remember his face the last day I took him to the market. He wanted me to buy him a toy, but I had no money. He looked at me so piteously and I felt so sad. I wanted so much to buy my son a toy. It is this face that I see when I close my eyes and think of home.''

HEADLINE: Council Questions Brown on Efforts to Fight Crime

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
The New York City Council aggressively questioned top Dinkins administration officials yesterday about their efforts to fight crime, with one committee chairman saying New Yorkers now know ''how the average Roman felt while Rome burned and Nero fiddled.''
The remark was made by Sheldon S. Leffler of Queens, the Public Safety Committee chairman, at a hearing in City Hall as he and his colleagues questioned Police Commissioner Lee P. Brown and Milton Mollen, the Deputy Mayor for Public Safety, about Mayor David N. Dinkins's plan to hire 1,058 more police officers by next spring.
 
'Colorful Language'
Several Council members said the city was not doing enough to fight crime, while others questioned how it could pay for the officers and whether they would really be hired. Mr. Leffler said he was considering proposing a law to require that a certain number of officers be hired each year. 
When asked later about Mr. Leffler's comment, Mr. Dinkins said, ''I suppose that's colorful language that perhaps he thinks is useful.'' But the Mayor added, ''It is not accurate to suggest that we've not been doing anything.''
Earlier, in a luncheon speech to Harlem business and political leaders, the Mayor elaborated on something he had suggested last week, that the city might have hired more police officers during its economic expansion in the early 1980's, when Edward I. Koch was in office.
''We had a boom period over the last 10 years, and yet there are some things that today we do not have that we might have had, had we expended resources at that time,'' Mr. Dinkins said in the speech. ''And now that we recognize that we don't have those things, and we want those things - like more cops - we're going to produce them in an hour and a half in a climate of an economic downturn?''
Under Mr. Koch, the city increased its police force from 22,000 in 1980 to 28,000 in 1988, when the growth stopped because of fiscal restraints. The force now stands at about 26,000.
 
To Counter Fears
At the hearing, Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey of Queens said that the city had to do more to counter fears about crime that he said threaten to drive people out of many neighborhoods and that City Hall must simply find a way to get more police officers on the streets. ''For too long in this town, the bookkeeper's ink has been thicker than the public's blood,'' he said.
Mr. Brown and Mr. Mollen faced the criticism calmly, elaborating not only on their plans for hiring but also on efforts to redeploy deskbound officers to street duties, and they pledged to do even more.
Mr. McCaffrey asked why officers guarding diplomatic buildings could not be reassigned to regular patrols and whether the state police could not assign more officers to highway duty in the city to free local highway officers.
Mr. Brown replied that the 47 officers assigned to diplomatic duty were paid for by the Federal Government and that if they were reassigned, the city would have to bear the cost. Mr. Mollen said discussions were under way with Gov. Mario M. Cuomo about how state troopers might help.

HEADLINE: Washington at Work;
Modern Cassandra With a Message That Angers but Still Wins Support

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
A basic tenet of Washington politics is that bad news doesn't sell. Jimmy Carter found that out in his now-infamous ''malaise'' speech, when he painted a picture of a country entering a moral and economic decline, a speech that many analysts say was the beginning of his political demise.
But L. William Seidman, the nation's top banking regulator and overseer of the savings and loan bailout, seems to have mastered the art of making bad news work for him.
Consider last week. On Monday, he shocked the House Banking Committee by announcing that the savings and loan bailout would need $100 billion in the coming fiscal year, far more than previously expected. 
The next day, he told the Senate Banking Committee that falling real estate values would cause so many bank failures that the pool of reserves at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, would suffer a $2 billion drain this year.
 
Bearer of Gloomy News
He repeated his gloomy message later that night on the ''MacNeil-Lehrer Newshour'' and ''Nightline.'' And then he returned to the Senate Banking Committee on Thursday to assert that fraud had played a part in almost half of all savings and loan failures.
It was a blitzkrieg of the news media, Capitol Hill and public opinion for Mr. Seidman (pronounced SEED-man), who is chairman of the F.D.I.C., which insures deposits at commercial banks. That position automatically made him chairman of the Resolution Trust Corporation, which was created last year by Congress to manage the bailout of savings and loan companies.
Members of Congress praised him for his frankness, bankers winced at the prospect that his statements might cause an erosion of public confidence in the banking system, and members of the Bush Administration fumed about this prickly, intensely independent regulator they have not been able to control.
''Seidman, the Cassandra,'' said Kenneth A. Guenther, executive vice president of the Independent Bankers Association, referring to the mythological figure with the gift of prophecy, whose prophecies of misfortune were ignored. ''I think there are a lot of people, me included, who hope he is reading the tea leaves wrong and is overly pessimistic. If he isn't, we're all in trouble.''
 
Mixed Reception in Capital
The week demonstrated the skills of this regulator, who has been warmly received by Democratic and Republican lawmakers but given the big chill in the White House.
In fact, for the last three months leading members of the Administration - particulary the White House chief of staff, John H. Sununu, and Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady - have been intensely jockeying to push him out of his job before he wants to go.
In private, White House officials complain that Mr. Seidman is not a team player, that he cannot be trusted. But his supporters say that what really disturbs the Treasury and the White House is his independence and candor. Mr. Seidman responds with a mixture of bafflement and bluntness to the not-very-subtle efforts to replace him.
''I haven't found anybody yet that thinks the Administration gained from leaking that they tried to push me out,'' he said at his summer home on Nantucket Island last week. ''The only one I truly know who has applauded that effort is Charles Keating.'' Mr. Keating is the former head of the Lincoln Savings and Loan Association, now defunct, who arranged for large campaign contributions to five Senators and then got them to intervene for him with regulators.
''I am not a lame duck, because I have not answered the question of when I am going to leave,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''I have worked very hard not to let that happen. Otherwise, I would not be able to get things done.''
 
Independence Resented
The pressure on Mr. Seidman to leave stems not from any charge of incompetence. It's just that from the start of the Bush Administration, the F.D.I.C. chairman has fought intensely to preserve the independence of the agency from control by the White House. He openly opposed the White House and the Treasury in their attempts to give the President power to dismiss the chairman before his term expires.
Beyond this - and perhaps most important - the White House has found Mr. Seidman's style especially grating. His penchant for acerbic one-liners has offended Adminstration officials. And he has repeatedly demonstrated his skill at circumventing the White House, enlisting the aid of Republicans and Democrats and shrewdly using the press to his advantage.
Privately, Administration officials say it was White House distrust that led to the one event that has personally most hurt Mr. Seidman, who considers himself a loyal Republican and friend of the President.
In early May, White House officials, stung by criticism that the savings and loan bailout was going slowly, began telling reporters that the Administration wanted to replace Mr. Seidman, that they needed their own person at the F.D.I.C., and that they would not be sorry if Mr. Seidman, a Reagan appointee, decided to leave with about a year remaining in his six-year term.
Within days, the President, saying he was not trying to push Mr. Seidman out of his position, named his successor - the Federal Reserve Board's chief banking regulator, William Taylor - placing the F.D.I.C. chairman in an odd lame-duck status.
 
Support From Republicans
Reaction was intense, overwhelmingly in Mr. Seidman's favor. Dozens of Republicans in Congress urged the President to reverse his position, arguing that Mr. Seidman's continued presence and the credibility he lent to the bailout would help their party in the fall elections.
Encouraged, Mr. Seidman was not to be pushed and has not operated as a lame duck. ''I'm fed up with these leaks from John Sununu,'' he said recently after a speech. ''I told him, 'For every leak from you, I'm going to stay another month.' ''
While at first he at first made noises that he might leave in July, Mr. Seidman has put that off for several months and is vague about his plans, again keeping the Administration off guard.
He adds that his insistence on staying until he gets the Resolution Trust Corporation ''up and running'' would not have precluded an earlier exit and says that despite the push by the White House, ''it has not been bad for me; it just made me feel that it could have been handled a little more gracefully.''
''Frankly, I did not want to leave when the R.T.C. was perceived to be a failure because of a slow start and bureaucratic infighting,'' he said. ''Also, I would add that I was not pleased with the appreciation shown my past efforts by certain members of the Administration.''
Although he professes to be puzzled by what he views as the Administration's hostility to him, his aides and even his critics acknowledge that his popularity and credibility actually soared once he became a target of the Administration.
''Bill Seidman is the Jane Pauley for American Government,'' said Representative Jim Leach, Republican of Iowa, referring to the former host of NBC's ''Today,'' whose popularity soared after she was pushed off the program.
 
Issue of Bush's Son
Compounding Mr. Seidman's high-visibility profile is a problem that few regulators before him have faced. Mr. Seidman holds the fate of a Presidential offspring in his hands.
The F.D.I.C. is preparing a $200 million negligence lawsuit against the President's son, Neil, and other former officials of the failed Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association. Not only has the President instructed his staff to keep hands off the case, but he has also promised not to intervene, which Mr. Seidman says for the most part precludes any communication between the President and the F.D.I.C. until the case is filed.
Mr. Seidman does not readily accept the analysis that he is succeeding by being the bearer of bad news. Rather he says his appeal is the product of being accurate, and that Jimmy Carter fell flat with his malaise speech because ''it wasn't true and the American people didn't think it was true either.''
''I have always felt that if you fool yourself on the facts, you'll never get to the right answer,'' he said. ''If you want to see a glorious example of that, look at the S.& L. problems.''
Mr. Seidman says he is accustomed to friendly fire. During World War II, when he was an officer on a destroyer in the Pacific, American warships mistook his vessel for a Japanese boat and opened fire. A companion destroyer was sunk, and Mr. Seidman's vessel escaped unharmed. He attributes his relaxed attitudes under pressure to this and other war experiences.
He acknowledges that these are strange and heady days for a 69-year-old former accountant, a top economic adviser in the Ford White House, a vice chairman of the Phelps Dodge Corporation and dean of the Arizona State University Business school.
 
Brush With Death at Ranch
The pressures in recent months were compounded by an accident that briefly disabled him and almost left him crippled. One morning in late June, as he mounted his horse at his ranch in Wagon Mound, N.M., the steed bolted. When the banking regulator tried to jump off, his foot caught in the stirrup and he was dragged; his pelvis was separated and he lost almost half his blood.
But despite that incident and the pressures of the bailout, Mr. Seidman says he is unfazed and still thinking about his future.
He has talked about retiring to his ranch to develop his prized herd of Corriente cattle, which are used in rodeo events and bring three times the price of meat cattle. He has also talked about growing raspberries, reading more of his favorite writer, the Western novelist Louis L'Amour, and even putting in more time carving and making mobiles, an art taught him by Alexander Calder.
One thing he will not lack for is funds. Already a millionaire, he says job offers have been piling up and agencies that specialize in arranging speaking engagements have guaranteed him almost unlimited work.
''They said that they could arrange as many speeches for me as I wanted at $20,000 a pop,'' he said as he looked out over Nantucket Harbor.

HEADLINE: Study Finds Housing Costs Keep 32% Poor

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Nearly one-third of Americans are ''shelter poor,'' spending so much of their income on housing that they cannot afford other necessities, a study released today said.
The study, by the Economic Policy Institute, an economic research organization, said 27 million households were ''unable to meet their nonshelter needs at even a minimum level of adequacy'' because of high housing costs. Those households comprise 78 million people, or 32 percent of the population, the organization said.
The study said 42 percent of those who rent their homes and 22 percent of homeowners were shelter poor in 1987, the last year of the study.
The number of households in that category increased from 18.7 million in 1970 to 26.5 million in 1987, an increase of 42 percent, the study said.
The study's author, Michael E. Stone, professor of community planning at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, used an index that assumes a family pays its rent or mortgage first, then uses what income is left to pay for basic needs like food, clothing, transportation and medical care.

HEADLINE: Congress, in Switch, Plans to Give Census Workers Jobless Benefits

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
Two months after voting to deny unemployment benefits to thousands of temporary census workers, Congress has decided to reverse itself.
With an amendment to a bill now awaiting President Bush's signature, both houses have voted to repeal an administrative provision, passed in May, that directed that census work performed after April 20 would not count toward eligibility for unemployment compensation.
The provision, adopted at a time when the Census Bureau needed additional financing from Congress to finish the 1990 count, was intended to save at least $70 million that the bureau had set aside for unemployment claims.
But the cost-cutting move, aimed at more than 250,000 enumerators hired in April to count Americans who had not returned their census forms, brought an uproar among census workers and criticism by some lawmakers, who noted that the provision had been inserted into an unrelated appropriations bill and had not been subject to committee hearings. 
 
A Retaliation in Kind
In a retaliation in kind, the repeal measure was tacked onto an unrelated trade bill that was approved by the House and the Senate last week. The Bush Administration has expressed opposition to some elements of the overall trade legislation, but whether the President will veto the measure is not yet clear.
Representative Thomas J. Downey, Democrat of Suffolk, proposed the repeal measure in conference committee negotiations, with the backing of Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who heads the Senate Finance Committee, and Representative Dan Rostenkowski, the Illinois Democrat who is chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee.
Mr. Downey, acting chairman of the House Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources, said the cutoff of unemployment benefits had particularly galled him because it had sprung from appropriations committees, whose job, he said, is to ''appropriate, not legislate.''
But he said he also had a more personal objection: in 1960, when he was 11 years old, he tagged along with his mother as she went door to door as a census taker, and ''it seemed to me to be tough work, and hazardous.''
 
Census Cutback Uncertain
Mr. Downey added: ''You just don't deny benefits to workers because one Federal agency is short of money. These workers were singled out for discriminatory action.''
It is not yet known whether census programs will be cut back if the bureau now has to find money to reimburse states for unemployment claims. The provision to rescind the unemployment benefits had originated in the Senate Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, State the Judiciary and Related Agencies, headed by Senator Ernest F. Hollings, Democrat of South Carolina.
A spokesman for Senator Hollings said he was traveling and was unavailable for comment.
Warren Kane, the subcommittee's staff director, said, ''Our members will address this matter in September, and I don't know what the response will be.'' But he added, ''We have a fixed allocation, and nobody has given us any relief in that allocation.''
 
Complaints From Census Workers
In the last month census workers swamped lawmakers with telephone calls and letters complaining about the cutoff. Several lawmakers, including Senator Patrick J. Leahy, a Vermont Democrat who said he got about 100 angry calls and letters from his state, introduced bills to repeal the provision.
Mr. Leahy and five other Senators wrote a letter to Mr. Hollings agreeing with the workers that ''their good faith employment agreements with the Census Bureau were violated.''
One major complaint was that the bureau did not notify regional offices about the change until more than a month later, and many of the temporary workers did not find out about it until they filed a claim with their local unemployment office and were told they were not eligible.
In 1980, work by temporary census employees counted toward unemployment benefits. But at that time it was the Department of Labor, not individual Federal agencies, that reimbursed states for such claims.

HEADLINE: On Tapping Oil Reserve

BYLINE: By PETER PASSELL

 BODY:
Key members of Congress, as well as many energy economists, are dismayed by the Bush Administration's reluctance to counter the last week's run-up in oil prices by selling stocks from the Government-owned Strategic Petroleum Reserve.
 
Although President
Bush said yesterday that he would ''explore whether and when we and our allies should draw down reserves,'' the Administration wants to keep the Government out of the business of managing energy prices. It prefers to use the Federal stockpile only to meet specific physical shortages, if and when they appear.
Partisan politics are apparently playing a role in the policy debate over the use of reserves, which was discussed in two Congressional committees this week. So, too, are differences of opinion on whether America should dip into its reserve without guarantees from Europe and Japan to match the effort. But there seems to be a more fundamental disagreement over how the reserve should be used and when. 
The Administration's critics contend that a hands-off policy during a crisis is itself a form of management, and that the real value of the reserve is to curb panic during the initial period of uncertainty over future prices. Jack Riggs, the staff director of the House Energy Subcommittee, argues that ''the Administration's position amounts to an invitation to the markets to increase prices.''
The Strategic Petroleum Reserve was created in 1975 in the wake of the Arab oil embargo and the subsequent explosion in oil prices. The reserve, kept in underground caverns leached from salt formations in Louisiana and Texas, now totals about 600 million barrels of crude oil. If the system worked as intended - it has never been tested under crisis conditions -a network of pumps, pipelines and coastal tankers would allow the Government to deliver up to 3.5 million barrels a day to refineries - enough to cover about 20 percent of current consumption and replace about 40 percent of current imports for about six months.
 
Motives Questioned
But the policy governing the use of reserve oil has largely been left to Presidential discretion. And in testimony before two Congressional committees this week, Energy Department officials have questioned the political motives of those seeking an early release of oil and refused to pin down the circumstances in which the reserves would be committed.
Some Congressional Democrats may indeed be eager to fix the responsibility on the White House for the 10- to 15-cent increase in gasoline prices in the last few days. And some Administration officials may indeed be maneuvering to defuse grassroots anger over higher prices, while taking credit with their friends in the oil belt. But there is some policy substance to the debate.
Administration officials are jockeying with Europe and Japan over how much of the burden of any shortfall in oil supplies will be borne by Americans. And they do not want to commit the White House before meetings with other consuming nations, scheduled for today. Frank Zarb, the chief executive of Smith Barney and a principal architect of energy policy in the Ford Administration, is sympathetic. ''You don't drain America first,'' he said.
 
Concern About Price Controls
But the core explanation for the Administration's caution seems to be a deep reluctance to tamper with private markets. Convinced that the energy price controls of the 1970's were a costly mistake and alarmed by Congressional calls to investigate oil price-gouging, Administration officials apparently fear that attempts to buffer energy inflation by selling oil would lead to ever greater involvement in setting prices. This explains why Energy Department officials testified that only physical shortages - an inability to buy oil at any price - would lead to releases from the reserve.
That position strikes Phil Sharpe, chairman of the House Energy Subcomittee, as ironic. ''We are asking the Government of Turkey to cut the Iraqi pipeline,'' he said. ''And we are asking the Governments of Saudi Arabia and Venezuela to increase production. But the Administration says our Government should not interfere with oil prices.''
If Western governments did choose to intervene, they seem well-armed for the task. Publicly held reserves represent only about three weeks of world consumption. But with privately held stocks of oil near records, Philip Verleger, an economist at the Institute for International Economics, notes, the big oil-consuming nations are in a position to get by without any imports for about five months. In fact, only about one-third of total imports would be affected by even the loss of all the oil from the Persian Gulf.
 
Need to Prevent Panic Seen
But most energy economists believe that the real value of a strategic reserve is to prevent panic, not to nurse reeling economies through a protracted oil shortage. And if history repeats itself, that would be enough.
The oil shocks of 1974-75 and 1980 were essentially inventory crises, Mr. Verleger points out. The explosions in prices and spot shortages were caused by the uncertainty over future prices and future availability of fuel, not the physical shortages. Panicky users tried to fill every tank in sight, dramatically increasing short-run demand.
Thus hesitation in drawing down Government stockpiles when the crisis looms and consumers grow edgy could sharply reduce the market bang from a reserve barrel. Daniel Yergin, the president of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, argues that early use of the reserve weapon would allow small sales to have a relatively large impact. ''Even a few hundred thousand barrels a day,'' he concludes, ''would be a great show of credibility.''
Mr. Verleger agrees: ''The great lesson from intervention in financial markets,'' he said, ''is to act quickly.''
Most energy analysts (including some within the Administration) thought the battle to make early use the official policy had already been won. An inter-agency report last winter, commissioned as part of the Congressional debate over how much oil to buy for the stockpile, concluded that the best use of the oil was to prevent speculative spikes in energy prices. But something apparently happened on the way from the forum.

HEADLINE: Japan's Oil Safety Net Faces a Test: Will It Hold?

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 8

 BODY:
For more than a decade, Room 325 has been a backwater of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry: two cluttered rows of battered gray desks where bureaucrats watched over oil stockpiles while others fought trade wars or built new industries in electronics or aerospace.
But starting last weekend, Room 325 - the ''3'' has long since fallen off the door and the words ''International Energy Policy Division'' are stenciled on a piece of paper at the entrance - became the command center of a scramble to keep the world's second-largest economy going in the absence of an eighth of its oil supply.
So far, that effort appears to be working. Though the loss of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil in recent days is more than twice as severe as the cutbacks that struck this totally import-dependent nation in the oil shocks of the 1970's, no one is panicking.
Whether it is bravado or true confidence, officials here point to Japan's 142-day stockpile of petroleum, greater than that of any other nation. And they contend that Japan's biggest security rests in its remarkable successes in increasing energy efficiency: though the Japanese economy is more than twice as large as it was during the last oil shock, its oil demands have barely grown. 
Even some outward signs of nervousness are missing. Gasoline prices at the pump may be soaring in the United States, but the Government here made it clear early on that it would not tolerate a repeat of the organized price gouging that accompanied the past oil shocks. This time, prices have barely budged.
It is not immediately clear why retail prices should rise in the United States and not in Japan. Japanese oil companies, unlike their American counterparts, say the pump price reflects the cost of crude purchased several months ago and thus it will be a while before current price jumps are felt by consumers. Also, gasoline is already roughly three times as expensive in Japan as in the United States, and is heavily taxed.
In the meantime, several major Japanese oil companies, quietly working the phones, have come up with extra supplies to help offset the losses resulting from the embargo of shipments from Iraq and Kuwait. There are reports that Japan is paying top dollar for oil on world markets, pushing the price higher.
''The Japanese bureaucracy had to move very, very quickly, and it did,'' Midori Tani, the division's deputy director and one of the few women in senior jobs at the ministry, said today as she quickly ate a sandwich at her desk between meetings. ''People are worried, but they think we can manage it, at least for a while.''
 
A Question of Time
The question is for how long. Though they differ on specifics, most economists here seem to agree that if the oil cutoff is limited to Iraq and Kuwait, the Japanese economy will probably feel only a ripple. But the possibility that keeps Japan awake at night is that fighting will spill over to Saudi Arabia. Once, 14 years ago, the Saudis provided a third of Japan's oil. Now they provide 17 percent, and the biggest Japanese-owned oilfield sits right on the edge of the Saudi-Kuwait border.
''Saudi Arabia is the one that it would be very, very hard to live without,'' said Toru Tachibana, the senior economist at the Japanese Institution of Middle Eastern Economies. ''In the longer run, the situation could be quite pessimistic.''
But Japan's support for Saudi Arabia is tempered, severely, by its fear of alienating its other suppliers in the Middle East. That was evident today, when the Government's chief spokesman, Misoji Sakamoto, refused to endorse President Bush's decision to send troops into Saudi Arabia as a deterrent to an Iraqi attack. ''The United States has made an independent decision, and Japan cannot comment on that,'' Mr. Sakamoto said.
 
Fear of Western Backlash
Such wavering support worries many Japanese officials, who fear a backlash from the West because of Japan's failure to join in the international military face-off against President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. Japanese officials say they are limited by their Constitution, written by the United States during the post-war occupation, which bans the creation or use of offensive military forces. ''We sense what is coming,'' one senior foreign ministry official said today. ''I am sure that some people will accuse us of letting someone else defend our access to oil.''
To deflect the criticism, Government officials have been scurrying to find non-military means of contributing to the effort. Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu is expected to go ahead with a long-scheduled Mideast trip next week, visiting Jordan, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Turkey and Egypt. But so far, beyond joining the embargo on Iraqi oil and trade, suspending foreign aid to Iraq and freezing Kuwait's huge assets here, Japanese officials say they have few ideas about how they can help.
''There is a lot of frustration about this situation,'' said Mr. Tachibana, who said he personally favored a much more active Japanese role in military operations in the Middle East, given Japan's enormous stake in the region. ''But my opinion,'' he added, ''is definitely in the minority in this country.''
 
A Decade of Preparation
Perhaps because Japan learned in the 1970's that it was nearly helpless to guide events in the Persian Gulf, it has spent the past decade in a concerted, if little seen, effort to try to insulate itself. In many ways, the Japanese have been preparing for the Iraq crisis - or one like it - for more than a decade.
By imposing strict goals on car makers and industry, Japan has been far more successful in producing energy-efficent cars and making steel and even textiles more efficiently than anyone imagined possible in the late 1970's. Moreover, the move to more information-intensive industries has allowed Japan to speed its transition to nuclear power, natural gas and even coal. In the last year, however, Japanese oil consumption has begun to rise again, suggesting that the message was not lasting.
Japan's biggest push toward insulating itself came from a Government-owned company with headquarters only two blocks from the trade ministry. With money from the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, it has built 10 national oil stockpiles around the country. While some are still under construction, the Iraq crisis hit when Japan's stockpile was near its all-time high.
 
Finding New Supplies
The Government corporation's other mission has been to find alternative sources of oil for Japan, mostly closer to home in Asia. So far it has enjoyed only mixed success. With oil prices so low in recent years, many exploration efforts have been passed over as unprofitable. ''We must hope the price goes up enough to facilitate exploration,'' said Kazuhiko Itano, an executive of the corporation.
Clearly, however, Japan's efforts to diversify have begun to pay off. China has become a major supplier, accounting for 7 percent of Japan's oil. So have Mexico and Malaysia. The result is that the Middle East now accounts for roughly 72 percent of Japan's oil imports; during the previous oil shocks, it was more than 80 percent.
It was that knowledge that led the Agency for Natural Resources and Energy, a sleepy operation little heard from in Japan, to advise Mr. Kaifu over the weekend that Japan could agree to the oil embargo without immediately threatening its economic future. ''It was a bit tense, though,'' said Ms. Tani, a slight woman in her mid-30's who has held several other posts in the agency, including one that put together an ill-fated petrochemical plant for Iran.
 
Looking to the Middle East
Now the search is on for additional oil, and most of it, Japan says, will have to be purchased in the Middle East. Before the embargo, the Energy Department in Washington said there was excess world capacity of four million barrels a day. Ms. Tani and her colleages are looking for it.
Some efforts to direct it to Japan have already begun. The biggest Japanese producer, the Arabian Oil Company, which has a giant complex near the former ''neutral zone'' between Kuwait and Saudi Arabi, said today that it would raise its pumping speed to 300,000 barrels a day, up from 250,000. That is still short of the plant's capacity, which is 400,000 barrels a day.
''We would like to raise it more,'' said a company official, ''but we do not want to put the Saudis in the position of exceeding their quota.'' The fear is that such increases would give Mr. Hussein a pretext for attack.

HEADLINE: Oil Drops More Than $2 a Barrel

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The price of oil dropped more than $2 a barrel yesterday, and the price of gasoline fell more than 6 cents a gallon, following reports that members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would increase their production to mitigate a feared oil shortage.
And even though President Bush's decision to send American troops to Saudi Arabia could lead to a military conflict with Iraq, traders said the decision helped lower oil prices because the American forces would give Saudi Arabia the protection it needed to pump more oil to help ease the shortage.
But no analysts were ready to say that yesterday's decline in oil and gasoline prices was the start of a new trend. Given the confrontation with Iraq, the next news bulletin from the Middle East could send prices back up again. And there is still uncertainty about whether oil production is really being increased, especially because OPEC members are leery of saying what they are doing for fear of annoying Iraq and other members. 
 
Reports of Frenzied Buying
''What I am concerned about is all these people drawing lines in the sand,'' said Theodore Eck, the chief economist for the Amoco Corporaton, referring to the strong speech by President Bush yesterday and official comments by a spokesman for President Saddam Hussein of Iraq.
In Europe, insurance rates on oil and tankers soared, and there were reports of frenzied buying of Iranian oil because of fears that war would break out in the Persian Gulf. [D18.] In addition, there has still been no public confirmation by the Saudis that they will increase production. One Saudi official said his country did not plan to either confirm or deny the reports by American officials that it would increase production as much as two million barrels a day, which would reduce the expected oil shortage from an embargo of Iraq and Kuwait by about 40 percent.
In trading yesterday, the price of West Texas Intermediate crude for delivery in September dropped $2.35, to $25.96 a barrel, on the New York Mercantile Exchange. On Monday and Tuesday, the crude oil price jumped almost $4, to more than $28 a barrel, or nearly 75 percent higher than in mid-June.
Despite the decline yesterday, some oil traders said they did not expect the price of oil to fall back to the $20-a-barrel level, where West Texas Intermediate crude was trading before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, as long as the situation in the Middle East was unresolved.
 
Much Higher Base Price
Referring to the increased production expected from Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, Peter C. Beutel, a trader at Merrill Lynch Futures, said, ''It may help shore up the supply situation, but we will still be at a much higher base'' for the price of oil.
But he said that he believed these countries would increase production and that the movement of American troops into Saudi Arabia would appear to reduce the chance of an Iraqi attack.
The wholesale price of unleaded gasoline also fell yesterday on the New York Mercantile Exchange, dropping 6.18 cents, to 76.21 cents a gallon. Taxes and the dealer markup are added on to this price at the pump.
There were no immediate indications that the drop in gasoline futures prices, however, would be passed on at the gas pump. Consumers have been angered by the sharp rise in gasoline prices since the Iraqi invasion, and many politicians are calling for investigations of the increases. #14 Cents a Gallon Some gasoline prices went up as much as 14 cents a gallon. But oil company officials say wholesale prices for gasoline have gone up as much as 20 cents a gallon since the invasion last week, so the full price has not yet been passed on.
ARCO announced yesterday that it was freezing its wholesale prices of gasoline, diesel fuel and jet fuel for a week in response to President Bush's call for restraint on price increases. A spokesman for Amoco, Mike Thompson, said he could not say what his company's response would be. But he added that any decision would have to wait until there was a definite downward trend in prices. Amoco, he said, has raised its gasoline 10 cents a gallon since the invasion.
The indication by President Bush that oil from the country's Strategic Petroleum Reserve might be used to ease the shortage from the embargo on Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil also helped send prices down yesterday, some traders said. But they also said the reserve was unlikely to be used unless the situation in the Middle East deteriorated further. #586 Million Barrels The International Energy Agency, which has the authority to get the United States and its allies to share oil in the event of a sudden shortage, is to meet in Paris today to discuss the oil shortage and the use of government oil reserves. The American reserve has 586 million barrels of oil in it. The two other big reserves are in West Germany, with about 53 million barrels, and Japan, with about 200 million barrels.
The price of oil generally moved down throughout the day in New York yesterday despite some possibly negative news. The president of OPEC, Sadek Boussena of Algeria, said in a statement that he was opposed to indivdual OPEC members deciding on their own to raise their producton levels, partly because such moves would undermine the power of OPEC to affect the oil market.
At the same time, President Carlos Andres Perez of Venezuela said that his country could raise production by 400,000 barrels to 500,000 barrels a day but that he did not want to act unilaterally without OPEC.
 
Market's General Belief
Some traders still doubt that the Saudis will raise production, although the drop in the oil prices yesterday reflected a general belief that output would be increased. There were also indications that captains of some oil tankers were leery of going into the Persian Gulf to pick up Saudi oil for fear that a war might leave them trapped there.
A Saudi official, who commented only on the condition that he not be identified, said his country's production level would rise slowly. And several oil analysts said they expected production levels to rise but that OPEC countries would prefer to avoid any formal announcements.
''I would think that any OPEC member would be careful about what they do and what they say they are doing,'' said Robert A. Hermes, president of Purvin & Gertz, a Houston consulting firm.

HEADLINE: Fed Report Says Economy Slowed Before Mideast Crisis

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
A Federal Reserve survey released today shows the economy was slumping even before the onset of the Middle East crisis that has heightened the possibility the nation will be thrown into a recession for the first time in nearly eight years.
The survey, known as the Beige Book, is a compilation of reports by the Fed's 12 regional banks of economic conditions in their parts of the country. It is released every six weeks.
''Business and banking contacts in the reserve districts generally report continued economic growth, though most noted that the pace was slow or had slackened recently,'' the regional Fed bank in Atlanta said of the survey, completed before July 27. 
 
Effect of Oil Prices
Since then, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has sent world energy markets soaring on worries of supply disruptions, and the higher prices are expected to heat up inflation. That, in turn, could choke off growth in the economy, which has expanded steadily since November 1982.
In their report, the Fed banks did not reach a consensus on the direction of prices, but several of the regional banks reported widespread increases. They also found wages rising at a fairly brisk pace of 3 percent to 5 percent annually.
Meanwhile, manufacturing activity was found to be flat in most industries. Some banks were finding good demand from abroad, however, such as strong commercial aircraft orders from overseas for the Boeing Company in the Northwest.
 
Benefits for Steel
In addition, United States carmakers stepped up production to prepare for a possible strike, so steelmakers have benefited, the report showed.
Still, the banks reported that ''with the exception of steel and commercial aircraft, backlogs and lead times were said to be working down.''
Consumers were also pulling back in many regions. Retail sales were ''soft to a little higher than a year ago,'' the banks said.
''Retailers in New York City are less optimistic about the outlook given the continuing layoffs at banks and brokerage firms, while those in St. Louis expressed similar views in light of anticipated defense cutbacks,'' the survey said.
Military contractors, including two of the largest, the General Dynamics Corporation and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, both based in St. Louis, are laying off thousands because of shrinking defense budgets.
Problems were reported obtaining bank credit for construction in many areas, the Fed report said. But the reasons for the tightness varied.
 
Need for Lower Rates
Some economists said the survey confirmed that interest rates needed to be lowered to stimulate the economy even before violence erupted in the Persian Gulf. Now, with the slowing effect that higher oil prices may have, there is more evidence that lower rates are needed, they said.
Normally, to avoid recession, the Fed would lower rates to spur the economy. But that option has been complicated because providing the stimulus of lower rates at a time of rising energy prices could overheat the economy, feeding inflation.
The Fed's chairman, Alan Greenspan, has made it clear he considers fighting inflation to be the central bank's top priority.
 
A Bleak Picture
Before the survey was released, the chief economist at the United States Chamber of Commerce, Richard Rahn, painted a bleak picture of the direction of the economy.
''We anticipate that the economy will grind to a virtual standstill during the third quarter of this year and actually contract by 1.4 percent in the fourth quarter,'' he said at a news conference, adding that it was probably too late to avoid recession, particularly with higher oil prices.
Mr. Rahn predicted ''a mild recession'' beginning at the end of this year and running into 1991. A recession is defined as two successive quarters of shrinking economic activity.

HEADLINE: Brady Wants Rate Cut, But Sees No Recession

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 8

 BODY:
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said today that oil price shocks need not topple the economy into a recession, and he called on the Federal Reserve to stimulate growth with lower interest rates.
''We are not contemplating recession,'' Mr. Brady said, replying to a question after a luncheon speech to the National Press Club here.
''Certainly the events of last week, where the price of oil has gone up, are going to impose additional hardships on the country,'' he said. ''But I don't think we should come to judgment quickly.'' 
He said both he and President Bush wanted the Federal Reserve to give an impetus to economic growth by lowering interest rates. He said strong growth was particularly important now, as the United States responds to Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
''Everybody wants lower interest rates,'' he said. ''At this point in time in the United States, economic growth is very important.''
Mr. Brady expressed confidence that Federal Reserve policy makers, who are to meet on Aug. 21, would lower rates in response to sluggish growth. The economy, as measured by the gross national product, grew at an anemic 1.5 percent annual rate in the first half of 1990.
''The fact that the country is faced with slower growth will almost certainly produce lower interest rates,'' he said.
On other topics, Mr. Brady said:
* He did not know if oil companies were taking advantage of consumers by raising gasoline prices so quickly after the invasion of Kuwait, but said, ''If people are gouging, those that are doing the gouging will hear from the President.''
* Budget-deficit negotiations with Congress may produce a different number than the $50 billion reduction goal, but reducing the deficit is more important now that the United States is trying to exert its influence in the Persian Gulf.
* The staggering cost of the savings and loan bailout ''frightens politicians into finger-pointing and blame-avoiding.''
Supporting Mr. Brady's view that economic conditions warrant a loosening of credit was a Federal Reserve report released today that showed economic growth was slackening even before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week. A July 27 survey of the Federal Reserve's 12 district banks said that ''most noted that the pace was slow or had slackened recently.''

HEADLINE: United Air Group's Bid Extended

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 8

 BODY:
United Airlines' parent company, UAL Inc., tonight gave an employee buyout group an extra two months to arrange financing for its $4.38 billion bid.
UAL's stock price rose sharply today amid widespread expectations that the board would extend the deadline. The stock rose $13.50 a share, to $114.50, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Many people said the directors had little to gain by enforcing the previously set deadline, which gave the buyout group until the close of business Thursday to come up with financing.
UAL's board said it was willing to extend the deadline because of the crisis in the Middle East.
 
New Deadline Is Oct. 9
The company said, however, that if financing was not arranged by the new deadline, Oct. 9, UAL would terminate the buyout agreement.
The directors indicated that they had doubts about the effort's chances of success.
''UAL emphasized that - especially in light of events in the Middle East, state of the financial markets and softening economy - there can be no assurance that a transaction can be completed,'' the statement said.
Enforcing the deadline could have embittered UAL employees, who have been trying to buy the airline since spring.
 
Offer of $201 a Share
The buyout group is not believed to have its financing lined up, and enforcing the deadline would also have had the effect of canceling the offer. The group has offered to pay $201 a share in cash and securities for all of UAL's common shares outstanding.
Should the offer collapse, the company's stock might well slide sharply, further alienating stockholders, who have seen the value of their shares decline sharply in recent weeks. Within the last 12 months, UAL's share price has been as high as $294.
In recent weeks three of the five banks that had originally agreed to back the deal have pulled out. These banks - Chase Manhattan, Chemical and Citibank -have indicated that they will not provide loans unless the buyout group comes up with equity, or essentially its own money, that it can put into the deal.
 
Outside Sources of Equity Money
The buyout group has been casting about for outside sources of equity money. Reports have been published, which the buyout group has declined to comment on, that it has approached suppliers like the Boeing Company and the United Technologies Corporation's Pratt & Whitney division, as well as the General Electric Credit Corporation and the GPA Group, the Irish company that owns Guinness Peat Aviation, the largest aircraft-leasing company.
Gerald Greenwald, a former vice chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, who is leading the employee group's efforts, was expected to report to the UAL board today on the status of those negotiations.
Even if Mr. Greenwald can convince the board that talks to obtain outside equity money are progressing, he must then convince them that the banks will come forward with loans. With United Airlines' having been in turmoil ever since the pilots made a bid for it by themselves in 1987, the directors are understood to be in no mood to hear about an offer with equity that might still collapse because of a lack of bank support.
''Greenwald will have to present the board with an outline that is very doable,'' said Sharon Kalin, president of Athene Coronado Management Inc., a big New York money-management firm that has a significant stake in UAL.

4 Younger Executives Move Up at Chemical

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
The Chemical Banking Corporation announced a reorganization of its top management yesterday, drawing from its own cadre of executives to name a new president and to create an office of the chairman with four younger executives.
The appointments shed little light on who will succeed Chemical's chairman, Walter V. Shipley, who is 54 years old and has no plans for early retirement. He described the new office of the chairman, which replaces a 12-member senior management committee, as a way of ''insuring management continuity by drawing upon a new generation to help provide senior leadership.'' 
Chemical's management was disrupted nine months ago when its president at the time, Thomas S. Johnson, left to accept a job as president and designated successor to the chairman at a rival, the Manufacturers Hanover Corporation.
The seventh-largest banking company in the nation, Chemical concentrated on its domestic business in recent years by purchasing banks in Texas and New Jersey and by expanding its business with consumer and middle-size corporations in the New York City area. International activities have been cut back sharply.
Members of the new office of the chairman are:
William H. Turner, 50, with responsiblity for Chemical's regional banking activities in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. His previous job of managing the banking businesses with middle-market corporations, an activity where Chemical is the leader in the New York area, was expanded to include consumer banking, real estate lending and private banking with wealthy individuals.
Marc J. Shapiro, 43, who will continue as president and chief executrive of the Texas Commerce Bancshares unit. After enduring years of hardship in the mid- and late-1980's when the weakening of the Texas economy led to greater-than-expected losses, Texas Commerce began earning a profit this year. Its position as the leading lender to businesses in Texas is expected to lift earnings - and Mr. Shapiro's stature in the Chemical organization - as the local economy continues to improve.
Edward A. O'Neal Jr., 46, the bank's most experienced executive in computer applications, who was put in charge of all technologically oriented businesses, like credit cards, and financial services like cash-management products for businesses. As head of the Chemical's consumer banking business for the last three years, Mr. O'Neal was credited with improving profitability and market share, while consolidating the branch system.
William B. Harrison Jr., 47, who will continue handling institutional banking activities worldwide. The job includes managing the company's funding and securities trading, and developing securities backed by bank loans.
Robert J. Callander, 59, the bank's former vice chairman, who was named president, the No. 2 position under Mr. Shipley. Mr. Callander will handle Chemical's outstanding loans with less-developed countries, and oversee executives in charge of managing risk and setting credit standards.

Mixed Feelings On Bank Stocks

BYLINE: By Michael Quint

 BODY:
FOR contrarian investors in bank stocks, willing to fight the downward trend in prices and steady flow of bad news, the problem in recent months has been to know just which hour is the darkest one that precedes the dawn.
Bank stocks have been in a tailspin for 10 months, and investors who thought the lows of late 1989 were attractive now find an abundance of such bargains. The Tisch family, for example, spent more than $94 million to buy a 6.6 percent Bank of Boston stake late last year at $20 a share on average. Last week, the family spent $10 million more to raise its investment to 8.9 percent, buying shares at $9.875 and $10. 
The problems of banks are industrywide and not confined to the New England area. A growing roster of delinquent real estate loans, slack loan demand as the economy weakens and a structure of heavy costs have depressed earnings this year. And if the economy slips into a recession - a growing fear among many investors - history shows that banks will suffer a substantial rise in delinquent payments and defaults on loans of all kinds.
For many of the country's best-known banks, stock prices are down nearly 50 percent from 10 months ago, despite modest gains in the last two days. Citicorp closed yesterday at $19.375, up 62.5 cents, compared with a high of $35.50 in early October 1989, while Chase Manhattan rose 62.5 cents, to $18.50, down from a 1989 high of $44.875.
Many regional banking companies that were the industry's best performers during the 1980's have also been hard hit. The stock of Banc One of Columbus, Ohio, closed at $28.625 yesterday, up $1.25, but well below its 1989 high of $37. NCNB of Charlotte, N.C., fell 12.5 cents yesterday, to $33.875, down from $55. In the West Coast banking group, Wells Fargo closed at $63.875, up $2, compared with $87.375, and BankAmerica rose 87.5 cents, to $22.75, from a 1989 high of $36.375.
In the last few days bank stocks have fallen less than the market ''as investors recognized the defensive characteristics of banks, such as their dividend yield,'' said Thomas Hanley, managing director at Salomon Brothers.
Among companies whose dividends are widely regarded as safe from cuts, Citicorp's $1.78 dividend equals a yield of 9.2 percent while the First Chicago Corporation's $2 dividend yields 8 percent.
If the threat of recession from higher oil prices causes the Federal Reserve to reduce short-term interest rates, as many economists expect, Mr. Hanley said, ''we could have a trading rally in the bank group over the short term.'' But over the next several quarters, Mr. Hanley said, the risk of loss from bad loans is great enough to remain cautious on the outlook for bank stocks.
W. Anthony Hitchler, chief investment officer at Brandywine Asset Management in Wilmington, Del., said bank stocks were so low that ''a couple of years from now you could look back at this as an incredible opportunity.''
''But for now,'' he said, ''the psychology for bank stocks is as bad for an industry as I have ever seen.''
With the downward trend in prices so well established, and ample warnings from bankers that losses on real estate loans might worsen, Mr. Hitchler said, ''the risk of client displeasure is just too great'' to begin buying. ''I want to diversify out of the mid-Atlantic and Southern regions,'' he added, ''but first I want to see some stability.''
Richard Bove, banking analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds, said the disruption of the oil market from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait could bode well for companies like the Chemical Banking Corporation, which have major operations in oil-producing states.
As bank stock prices tumbled in recent weeks, bankers and Wall Street analysts began attributing much of the decline to speculative selling by ''hedge funds.'' These privately owned funds try to protect their speculative trading positions by ''hedging'' in the futures or options markets or in stocks of companies in the same industry.
But operators of hedge funds say that blaming them for the weakness in bank stocks is a facile explanation. ''If bank managers are looking outside their companies for explanations of why their stock is down, they should take a second look,'' said Joseph L. Feshbach, general partner at Feshbach Brothers, a hedge fund operator based in Palo Alto, Calif. ''Their stocks are down for lots of good reasons, starting with the fact that their financial performance has been nothing short of disastrous.''
Mr. Feshbach said he has been an active seller of bank stocks, but asserted that ''the financial resources of hedge funds are too small relative to the market value of banks' stocks'' to explain the steep drop in bank stock prices.
Donald J. Hardy, an analyst at the Frank Russell Company, estimated that hedge funds have total assets of $20 billion or more, spread among a myriad of trading techniques and many industries. The market value of 35 large banking companies monitored by Salomon Brothers fell to as low as $74.4 billion early this week.

HEADLINE: Dow Rises 24.26 Points as Oil Prices Drop

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks advanced strongly in active trading yesterday, as oil prices turned downward following President Bush's morning address to the nation explaining the dispatch of United States troops to Saudi Arabia.
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 24.26 points, at 2,734.90, off from the day's high of 2,748.02, when it was up 37.38 points. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, meanwhile, rose 3.52 points, to 338.35.
Volume remained on the heavy pace of the past few days, ending the day at 190.4 million shares traded. 
The American Stock Exchange index closed at 340.03, virtually unchanged, while the Nasdaq index of the over-the-counter market closed up 5.65 points, at 407.73.
 
Market Stability
The President's strong stand seemed to bring stability to the market, traders noted, and that brought investors back in droves to hunt for bargain prices. Analysts said, however, that investors were still nervous, and that buying could quickly turn to selling as developments in the Middle East unfold.
Oil stocks, which had benefited from the rise in oil prices over the past few days, dropped yesterday as supply fears eased. September contracts of West Texas Intermediate crude on the New York Mercantile Exchange were down $2.35 a barrel, to $25.96.
Among the big losers were the Chevron Corporation, down 1 3/4, to close at 76 7/8; the Exxon Corporation, down 1 5/8, to close at 51 3/4; the Amoco Corporation, down 1 3/8, to 56 1/4, and Texaco Inc., down 1 7/8, to close at 62 3/4.
 
Eyes on the Treasury Refunding
Market participants also had their eyes on the Treasury's quarterly refunding taking place this week. Less-than-statisfactory results could mean higher interest rates, which would not bode well for the stock market.
A stock rally in the afternoon was interrupted following a sudden decline in bond prices, which were reacting to the poor results of the Treasury's 10-year note auction, part of the quarterly refunding. But the bonds quickly bounced back, and so did the stock market. Advances led declines by a ratio of nearly 2 to 1.
''Confidence is a big factor in the stock market,'' said Peter G. Grennan, a senior vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. ''It gives the market resiliency, which was evident today. So far the President's firm handling of the situation has been good for the market.''
 
Few Program Trades
There were few program trades in yesterday's market, according to Birinyi Associates Inc., which tracks such activity. Program trades, which are almost exclusively practiced by large institutional traders, can create rapid market fluctuations. In all there were three sell programs, one in the morning and two in the afternoon, which were related to reports of a poor Treasury auction. They occurred between 2:25 and 2:38, and during that time the Dow fell 12.62 points. The only buy program came between 3:06 and 3:11, at about the same time bond prices began coming back. At that point the Dow rose 6.18 points.
Other active stocks yesterday included Honeywell Inc., which announced its intention sell its Federal Systems Inc. unit to Bull HN Information Systems Inc., a unit of Compagnie des Machines Bull of France for an undisclosed price. Honeywell rose 1 3/4, to 98 3/8. The Eastman Kodak Company's stock rose 1 1/8, to 41 1/8, on a recommendation by Alex Henderson, a Prudential-Bache analyst, who said the stock was well insulated from swings in oil prices.
Drug stocks, a traditional institutional favorite because they are not as susceptible to market swings as other stocks, also rallied. Merck & Company rose 2 1/4, to close at 85 1/8; Eli Lilly & Company, was up 2 5/8, to close at 78 3/8; Johnson & Johonson, was up 1 7/8, to 67 1/8, and Bristol-Myers Squibb, was up 1 3/8, to 61 1/2 UAL's stock rose 13 1/2, to close at 114 1/2, on expectations that the company's board might grant the employee group seeking to buy the company a 30- to 90-day extension to help arrange its financing.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Mostly Higher On Fears Over Middle East

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar ended higher yesterday against all major currencies except the yen and the Canadian dollar, bolstered by the tensions in the Middle East.
Currency dealers said the dollar started out sharply higher, then fell back. President Bush's announcement that warplanes and combat troops backed by Navy ships were taking up defensive positions in Saudi Arabia seemed to calm the financial markets.
Nonetheless, the possibility of a conflict with Iraq pushed the dollar higher, dealers said. Those concerns, they said, outweighed any fundamental worries about economic weakness that could drive interest rates lower and make the dollar less appealing to foreign investors.
''On fears of the Middle East, the dollar was way up,'' said Robert Ryan, corporate foreign exchange manager for the Bank of New York.
 
Debate Over Safety
Some dealers in Europe, though, debated whether the dollar was the safest currency to hold right now. In fact, after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait last week, which touched off the Middle East tensions, currency dealers flocked to the German mark. The dollar had declined on worries that a rapid rise in oil prices eventually would push interest rates lower.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar fell to close at 150 Japanese yen, from 150.60 yen Tuesday. It traded at 150.15 yen in London, and at 149.90 yen in New York, down from 150.90.
The dollar was stronger against the pound compared with Tuesday. The pound traded at $1.8660 in London, down from $1.8765, and at $1.86885 in New York, down from $1.8715.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's quotes, included: 1.5920 German marks, up from 1.5875; 1.3380 Swiss francs, up from 1.3370; 5.3365 French francs, up from 5.3230; 1,165.00 Italian lire, up from 1,162.25, and 1.14785 Canadian dollars, down from 1.15125.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Slips and Copper Rises As Oil Prices Turn Down

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of gold futures fell yesterday and copper futures climbed as a downturn in oil prices prompted an abrupt change in speculation about the economy.
On other commodity markets, pork futures fell sharply and cattle extended their gains.
On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold futures settled $1.20 to $1.50 lower, with the contract for delivery in August at $383.20 an ounce, down $1.30. Silver futures finished 1.5 cents to 1.8 cents lower, with August at $4.843 an ounce. 
Copper futures ended 2 cents to 3.65 cents higher on the Commodity Exchange, with August at $1.31 a pound.
The moves reflected a shift away from the inflation and recession fears that began building late last week, when Iraq invaded Kuwait and touched off a run-up in oil prices and a plunge in stock prices worldwide.
The gold market responds quickly to inflation fears because the metal is perceived as an investment hedge against inflation. Copper is used heavily throughout the construction and manufacturing industries, so its price is especially sensitive to signs of economic expansion or recession.
 
Stocks Rally
Economic jitters eased somewhat yesterday as the price of crude oil fell and the United States stock market rebounded, partly in reaction to the movement of United States forces into Saudi Arabia to defend against Iraqi threats to oil-producing nations beyond Kuwait.
Analysts said reports that Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other major oil-producing nations would increase their output also worked to suppress crude prices.
While West Texas Intermediate crude oil futures settled 83 cents to $2.35 lower on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with the September contract at $25.96 a barrel, heating oil was 2.46 cents to 5.01 cents lower, with September at 70.13 cents a gallon, and unleaded gasoline was 2.13 cents to 3.8 cents lower, with September at 76.21 cents a gallon.
Pork futures plummeted on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting seasonal factors and a bulge in hog production.
''We've had a year of good profitability in the hog market, and we're beginning to see the results in increased slaughter,'' said Thomas Morgan, president of the Sterling Research Corporation in Arlington Heights, Ill.
Most hog contracts and some belly contracts fell their permitted daily limits of 1.5 cents and 2 cents, respectively.
Live hogs finished 1.22 to 1.5 cents lower, with August at 56.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 0.32 cent to 2 cents lower, with August at 50.75 cents a pound.
Cattle futures rose moderately, extending strong gains posted Tuesday that were linked to a better economic outlook and strong cash markets.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Stocks Fall Sharply On Worries About Mideast

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Japanese stock prices fell sharply today, wiping out all of the Tokyo market's gains from yesterday.
Japanese traders said they were still very nervous about the crisis in the Middle East.
In Tokyo today, the Nikkei index of 225 stocks dropped 893.41 points, or 3.13 percent, to close at 27,615.73, its low of the day. Much of the loss came in the late afternoon. 
The Tokyo stock market had rebound strongly yesterday after losing more than 10 percent of its value in the four previous trading days since Iraq invaded Kuwait. But today's severe drop offset yesterday's gain of 856.07 points in the Nikkei average.
 
Mixed Reactions
In other financial markets yesterday, there were mixed reactions to President Bush's announcement that American forces would go to Saudi Arabia and to rumors that the United States had bombed Iraq's capital, Baghdad.
Stocks rose yesterday on Wall Street. But in some markets, like those in West Germany and France, share prices were down sharply. The stock market in London was basically unchanged.
In New York yesterday, the Dow Jones industrial average rose 24.26 points, or 0.89 percent, to 2,734.90.
In West Germany, the Frankfurt bourse's blue chip index, the DAX, fell 46.67 points, or 2.6 percent, to 1723.63. The market, traders said, was whipped by rumors and closed before Presdent Bush made his televised speech in the United States.
The Frankfurt market, which fell 5.4 percent on Monday and rebounded 1.7 percent on Tuesday, is also troubled by the impact of the cost of the unification of the two Germanys. Many fear that this union will lead to both higher inflation and higher interest rates.
The Paris stock market also fell sharply. The blue-chip index, the CAC-40, fell 54.75 or 3.02 percent, to 1,757.09. the market is now down 10.36 percent since the invasion. Brokers were not encouraged by either Mr. Bush's speech or the early rise on Wall Street in New York.
The London stock market's leading indicator, the Financial Times 100-stock index, rose only 1.7 points, to 2,237.5.
In Norway, which is an oil producer and an expected beneficiary of higher oil prices, the stock market fell again, dropping 7.92 points, or 1.25 percent, to 623.20. Brokers said they were concerned that higher oil prices would bring a worldwide recession.

HEADLINE: Food Supply Is Vital in Embargo

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
Embargos on trade with Iraq and Kuwait have focused on oil exports, but the effect on Iraq's food imports may also prove critical.
Iraq depends on imports for 70 percent to 80 percent of its nutritional needs, and food stockpiles were unusually low even before the invasion of Kuwait last Thursday, John P. Parker, an Agriculture Department economist who studies Middle Eastern agriculture, said yesterday.
As of last Saturday, Iraq's Government stockpiles held enough wheat for two months of normal consumption, enough rice for three months, enough beans and barley for a month and less than two weeks' worth of corn, he said.
''The more I look at it, the worse it looks,'' Mr. Parker said. 
 
September Corn Harvest
Iraq has already harvested its wheat and beans this year, while its corn crop, due for harvest in September, will provide enough for another month and a half of normal consumption, or longer with rationing. Bakeries and other businesses have tiny food supplies because for years the Government has closely controlled food production and distribution, Mr. Parker said.
A drought last year in Iraq and the American Government's decision a year ago to halve guarantees on Iraqi food purchases, to $500 million, have severely hurt the country because it has been unable to buy enough additional food elsewhere, he added.
By contrast, the embargos are unlikely to hurt American farmers or businesses severely.
''I don't think there's a significant impact'' on American agriculture, said Bernard Steinweg, a senior vice president of the Continental Grain Company, an international agribusiness company based in New York. ''It's not as if we had an embargo on the Soviet Union or one of the other major customers.''
Grain markets have been quiet this week, he said, adding that a lasting increase in oil prices could push up farmers' costs and eventually raise food prices.
 
Kuwait's Food Outlook
Kuwait has enough canned goods stored to feed its population for several months, Mr. Parker said. But these will probably be needed soon, since the country imports 96 percent of its food and is subject to the embargos, he said.
Kuwait has only a ninth of Iraq's population, so its supplies of canned goods would not feed the Iraqi population for long. In 1986, Iraq had 16.1 million people, while Kuwait's population totaled 1.87 million in 1987.
Neither embargo is total. The United Nations action allows food shipments to Iraq only under ''special humanitarian circumstances,'' while the American embargo permits food shipments only if they are ''donations of articles to relieve human suffering.''
The presence of many foreigners in Iraq and Kuwait, including several thousand Americans, may make it difficult to impose a total and prolonged food embargo.
 
Canada May Ban Shipments
According to the State Department, Brazil, Australia, the 12-member European Community and the United States have banned food shipments to Iraq, and Canada may do so soon. Argentina, China, Saudi Arabia and Thailand have not made a decision on food shipments, while Turkey is continuing them on the humanitarian grounds specified by the United Nations. Together, these countries account for three-quarters of Iraqi food imports.
Saudi Arabia spent heavily in the 1970's to improve its agriculture after American discussions in 1973 of halting grain exports to the Mideast, but Iraq did not follow suit.
If the embargos prove prolonged, American farmers and car makers are likely to be among the first exporters affected, other Government and industry experts said. But shipments to Iraq and Kuwait represent a small fraction of American agricultural and motor vehicle production, so that with few exceptions, the embargos' effects are unlikely to be severe, they added. 10th-Biggest Customer Iraq was the 10th-largest foreign customer for American agricultural products last year, accounting for about $1 billion of the United States' $37.2 billion in agricultural exports, said Sally A. Klusaritz, an Agriculture Department spokeswoman. The primary purchases were of wheat, rice and feed grains, she said.
American rice growers are particularly dependent upon the Iraqi market, which accounted for nearly a fifth of the industry's $1 billion in exports last year, said James W. Willis, the vice president for foreign market development at the USA Rice Council, a Houston trade group.
But American agricultural exports to Iraq have almost stopped in recent months even without the embargo, pending Federal investigations into an Agriculture Department program that guarantees bank loans used to finance food sales to Iraq, Ms. Klusaritz said. The Iraqi Government owes $2 billion to the United States under the program, she said.
 
Car Purchases at $250 Million
Kuwait bought about $250 million in cars, trucks and vehicle parts from the United States last year, according to Commerce Department figures. The General Motors Corporation accounted for most of the sales, shipping about 10,000 cars and trucks a year, most of them Cadillacs, Buicks and GMC Suburban vans, the company said yesterday.
But with $127 billion in sales last year, G.M. is unlikely to be hurt, said Thomas F. O'Grady, the president of Integrated Automotive Resources Inc., a consulting company in Wayne, Pa. ''Really it's a drop in the bucket, although no one likes to lose $200 million a year in sales,'' he said.
Kuwait also bought about $47 million worth of used American cars and $43 million in American cigarettes last year, the Commerce Department said. The United States also exports to Kuwait and Iraq other products in much smaller quantities. According to the department, American exports to Iraq last year totaled $1.15 billion and $855 million to Kuwait.

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
The Man Wearing the Knickers

BYLINE: By Ira Berkow

 BODY:
Anyone who follows golf knows that Payne Stewart wears old-fashioned knickers, his trademark. His golf shoes, though, are less prominent. That's because they are the standard variety, with laces and cleats. They are his shoes, and it is obvious he finds no reason to put himself into anyone else's shoes.
As reported in Wednesday's Times, Stewart blasted the news media for making too much of what turned out to be incendiary remarks by Hall Thompson, the founder of the Shoal Creek Country Club near Birmingham, Ala. 
Stewart is the defending champion of the P.G.A. Championship, which begins play today for this year's title. ''I think the whole thing's been blown way out of proportion,'' said Stewart. ''That's something you guys are pretty good at, blowing things out of proportion.''
Thompson had said that there were no black members at Shoal Creek, and his club wouldn't be ''pressured'' into having any. It turned out he was wrong. When harsh focus was put on Thompson and the club, and local boycotts were threatened, and advertising television sponsors of the event withdrew, a widely respected black businessman in Birmingham was indeed hastily corraled as an honorary member.
It alleviated for the moment the rawness of the situation, and forced the PGA Tour, the Professional Golfers' Association of America, which conducts the P.G.A. Championship, and the United States Golf Association to announce that in the future the membership policies of private clubs would be a major consideration in where these guys hold their golf games.
Now, there are times when the news media blows things out of proportion, something Marla Maples and her boyfriend, for example, have come to learn. But this golf story is not one of those inflations.
Stewart added that the players were not deeply concerned by the issues brought up by the controversy. ''The players have probably made more jokes about it than anything else,'' he said.
Jack Nicklaus didn't. ''I don't think that's a joking issue,'' he said.
And Calvin Peete didn't. Earlier, he had been dismayed at the lack of support for blacks by other Tour golfers. The best black golfer on the Tour said that if some of his white colleagues were black they wouldn't be saying this. Their understanding, he said, would be deeper.
Stewart, from Springfield, Mo., has been on the Tour, in knickers and cleats, for 11 years, or since he was 22 years old. And like too many professional golfers, he has a life that obviously extends no farther than from tee to green. He has, like some other Tour players recently, said that he was a golfer and not a politician. Which means, then, that they are not citizens? ''I'm a barber,'' said the barber, ''not a politican.'' ''I'm a bank president,'' she said, ''not a politician.''
Nonsense. If you don't take a side, then you are taking a side. Edmund Burke put it tidily 200 years ago: ''The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing.''
A black man in Birmingham, Richard A. Peters, writes in a letter about discriminatory country clubs, and how their ''racist acts'' contribute to some whites' continuing to classify blacks as second-class citizens. ''And these clubs,'' he said, ''are where our dominant male society socializes. These are the people behind the people who set policy and set the tone for our communities.'' It is all of a piece. Once, Gary Player, a decent man, tried, like Stewart, to divorce sports from politics. ''I love all people,'' Player had said, ''regardless of race or religion.'' But two decades ago, he was being held up as a symbol of apartheid, the official policy of his government, even though he made numerous positive gestures, including wanting to play an exhibition with the handful of prominent black Tour players, and give the proceeds to a fund for blacks.
In the 1969 P.G.A. Championship, someone threw a soft-drink cup with ice in his face. At the United States Open, stones were hurled at him. I remember covering the 1970 Masters in Augusta, Ga., and seeing Player, whose life had been threatened, move about the course and the clubhouse circled by 10 security guards.
The closest Player came to possible racism was when someone asked his caddie where he got those nice new white golf shoes. ''They're Mr. Player's,'' said the black man. ''I'm breakin' 'em in for him.'' If that could be taken as racist in some elements of society, it was taken as de rigueur in golf.
Recently, Player, who supports the decision to investigate membership policies for future Tour events, said that one has to put himself in other ''people's shoes.''
As that black caddie did with his shoes. As he has apparently done. As Payne Stewart has not.

HEADLINE: ESSAY;
Reading Saddam's Mind

BYLINE: By William Safire; Anthony Lewis is on vacation.

 BODY:
A great leader, a new Saladin, is known for the enemies he makes. I now have the enemies I need.
First, I have every rich Arab in the world hating and fearing me. They thought they could buy me off by financing my war against the Persians. I spit on their demands for repayment. Today, Kuwait is mine; tomorrow, the Arab world. 
I do not have to fight the Arab nation; I have only to lead it. Arabs in the streets are sick of weakness and cry out for a conqueror to wreak vengeance on the sheiks, the West, the Jews.
Arab leaders? Mubarak lives in terror of Sadat's fate. Hassan knows he is the last King of Morocco. Syria has 4,000 tanks, but I show my contempt for Hafez al-Assad by moving my troops from the Syrian border toward the Saudis.
Arafat and my little Hashemite toady in Jordan have come running to me because they have more respect for military muscle than money. Fahd knows I will hang him and confiscate his wealth, so he has run to the Americans.
Ah, my new enemy, the Americans. We will see how they like sitting in the 110-degree tents in their poison-gas gear. I hold 30 times as many American hostages as the Ayatollah ever did. If America besieges us, we will see how world opinion changes when I show starving Iraqi babies on television, when I let their maddened mothers harass our 3,500 American guests.
America lost an eight-year war against an enemy a tenth of its size; Iraq won an eight-year war against an enemy triple our size. We'll see who is better prepared to bear the pain of oil blockade. If America cannot win a war in a week, it begins negotiating with itself.
I know the Americans. I have listened to the supplications of Senator Specter; I heard the silence of the White House after my gassing of the Kurds and hanging of the English reporter. I have broadcast the meeting with Senator Dole's delegation telling me how he opposed the Israeli bombing of my reactor in 1981, assuring me that the Voice of America fired the writer who insulted my secret police. Weaklings all. A month ago Bush expected me to thank him for the money, the grain, the technology. Now he is terrified at my using the Dow chemicals - financed by his Export-Import Bank -in poison gas canisters aimed at his troops occupying precious Arab soil.
I fooled the Americans and Saudis by taking Kuwait; they fooled me by agreeing to base troops near the oilfields; now it's my turn again. Let them dig in and sweat; I have the opportunity to launch the first surprise non-attack.
My Jordanian messenger has warned other Arab ''leaders'' that my followers will bring down any government that joins the Yankee force. I want the American mercenaries there alone. I want them and the Saudi royalty to get sick of each other.
Meanwhile, I can turn my attention to my most useful, unifying enemy, the Israelis. If they had not stopped my nuclear weapons plant nine years ago, I would have been able to incinerate Teheran. The same order that gassed only 5,000 Kurds at Halabja would have killed three million Persians at one blow.
How do I change this from a war between rich Arabs and poor Arabs to a glorious war of Arabs against the Zionists and their American allies? How do I force Hafez and Hosni, the disunited Arab republic, to fight by my side?
One way would be to send a tank column not against the Americans, but into my willing neighbor, Jordan, at the invitation of the little fellow I still permit to be King. That would surely bring the Israelis into my war.
Israel could no longer claim my crusade to be a war between Arabs. By moving into Jordan, which offers my tanks and artillery a straight corridor to the Israeli border, I offer the Jews no choice but to strike. Then it would be Saddam against Shamir -and Fahd would have to throw out the Americans and world opinion would swing to my side. End of sanctions.
Only one drawback with that plan: When the Israelis hit, they will hit with everything they have. If I use gas to slaughter civilians, they'll go nuclear. I don't mind taking the casualties, but they'll go after every one of the centrifuges I scattered to make enriched uranium.
Maybe the wisest move now is no move at all. My population can take starvation, and I, who began as an assassin, know how to guard against any von Stauffenberg solution. Atrocities in Kuwait will terrorize the Saudis and emirates, and Abul Abbas and threats to hostages will terrorize the West. After inflation and recession, Bush will want to bring the boys home by Election Day.
If waiting doesn't work, I can play the Israeli card.

HEADLINE: The Siege of Iraq

 BODY:
President Bush has skillfully orchestrated a two-pronged response to Iraq's occupation of tiny Kuwait. He has dispatched American military forces to prevent the Iraqi divisions from pushing on to occupy Saudi Arabia's oilfields. And he has led the worldwide economic effort to choke off Saddam Hussein's oil exports and force him to withdraw from Kuwait. 
The American troops have, from the moment of their arrival, provided a sound way to deter Iraq's military threat to Saudi Arabia. And though trade sanctions rarely work, in Iraq's case they promise ultimately to squeeze hard enough to force withdrawal from Kuwait.
Even so, that could take months. President Bush has so far won a unified commitment from Iraq's trading partners to punish its treachery. But for the siege of Iraq to succeed, they will have to remain patient, and that will require extraordinary leadership.
Iraq depends on oil exports to pay for almost everything, including over 70 percent of its food. Yet Iraq has buffer stocks that, in the case of food, could last until winter.
Given enough time, countries find ways to undermine economic sanctions. The resolve of encircling nations to maintain a siege is often no match for the resolve of the besieged. All President Hussein would need is an ally, or foreign merchants willing to violate international sanctions and their country's law. Rhodesia survived United Nations trade sanctions by turning to South Africa.
Besides, Iraq has some anti-siege weapons. For one thing, it has plenty of cheap oil. If that could be sold at deep enough discounts, there might well be shippers willing to sneak the oil onto international markets, even at the risk of seizure by governments complying with the U.N. embargo.
Another potential weapon is that Iraq might be able to manipulate the Arab world's animus toward the U.S. and Israel as well as the wealthy Kuwaitis. Playing to these entrenched emotions, Iraq will try to peel one or more of its neighbors away from the U.N. sanctions.
Finally, Saddam Hussein remains ruthless. During the grueling eight-year war with Iran, he subjected his country to endless suffering. Yet he remained firmly in control. He is not a ruler who will surrender merely to spare his countrymen unnecessary pain.
All that said, Iraq will be fighting tremendous forces. It relies solely on oil, which is very hard to slip out through the siege lines. Oil is shipped in large, expensive tankers whose movements are easily monitored. As long as oil-importing nations remain unified, shippers won't find any place to unload Iraqi oil.
Adding to Iraq's woes is the fact that, at present, its oil can be exported only through a few limited outlets, principally Saudi Arabia, Turkey and the Persian Gulf. Saudi Arabia and Turkey are committed to the embargo. And the Persian Gulf is easily blockaded.
Finally, few shippers will deal with Iraq on credit in any case; it is already drowning in debt.
Choking Iraq into submission will raise humanitarian issues. Would President Hussein hold out to the point of starving innocent Iraqis? Would the world squeeze that tight? But those questions lie far down the road. The siege of Iraq could succeed well short of such extremes.
Time will be needed to make the trade embargo work. But time will also undermine the resolve of the nations now joined to make it work. They know how to act on their outrage at Saddam Hussein's brutal aggression, and are doing so. What's unclear is whether they are angry enough and unified enough to stick to their siege guns.

HEADLINE: Ms. Messinger's Obstructionism

 BODY:
Manhattan Borough President Ruth Messinger's veto of a Columbia University plan to build on the site of the old Audubon Ballroom could hasten the decline of a deteriorating community and leave those who want to honor Malcolm X, murdered in the ballroom 25 years ago, with nothing but a building in ruins.
It also sends an irresponsible message to a frustrated business community just when New York most needs sound economic development.
Columbia has long planned to put a new biomedical research center on the Audubon site. It would be the first phase of a four-block research park in the Washington Heights neighborhood. That plan, which included a memorial to Malcolm X, drew objections from a coalition of preservationists, civil rights groups and black militants who want to save more of the ballroom and the building's terra cotta facade. 
Their opposition led the Dinkins administration to fashion a compromise that would preserve 40 percent of the ballroom and some of the facade. The local community board and several elected officials embrace that plan, and Columbia has endorsed it -as long as the university doesn't have to pay the additional $9 million.
Ms. Messinger, though, wants to save more of the building. She is entitled to her opinion. But the forum for discussing projects with citywide implications is the Board of Estimate, which was scheduled to consider the plan next Thursday. Thanks to Ms. Messinger, it may never get there. Ignoring the political process, she took advantage of an obscure state law that let her veto $8.1 million in Port Authority funds for the project. The veto effectively dooms it before any other elected official has a chance to consider it.
Worse: To make her case, Ms. Messinger misinterprets the proposed deal, and cloaks her objections in sanctimony. She argues that the city's plan is not fiscally responsible, while denying that her approach would be even more costly. Even as she complains about the cost of the compromise plan, she notes that she has up to $4 million in discretionary capital funds - but would make it available only for her version of the project.
The Dinkins plan is not perfect. City Hall still cannot say where some of the $34 million needed would come from. The proposal does, though, represent a responsible compromise.
If the Borough President's veto is actually a lobbying tactic, how does she expect a fiscally strapped city to comply with her demands? The additional cost is only one issue; planning and environmental requirements could delay the eight-year-old project by at least another year. In that case, Columbia says it will walk away.
Thus Ms. Messinger's obstructionism could well kill the project, leaving Manhattan and New York with nothing but unkept promises and an unfortunate lesson in the high cost of inflexible politicians.

HEADLINE: The Editorial Notebook;
Vietnam Again, for the First Time

BYLINE: By DAVID C. UNGER

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
Fifteen years after North Vietnamese tanks smashed into Saigon's Presidential Palace, there are still two Vietnams. The Republic of (South) Vietnam, that artificial creation of French colonialism and cold war politics, is no more. But commercial capitalism, the American presence and the Viet Cong-led insurrection pressed a distinctive subculture onto the South. The political ramifications endure. 
No American is a total stranger in Ho Chi Minh City, as Saigon is now officially known. English is widely spoken. Ordinary Vietnamese greet Americans with surprising warmth. And even for those who weren't there ''before 1975,'' as the local euphemism puts it, locales made familiar by war movies and the nightly television news are everywhere.
The first glance of my room at the old Majestic Hotel brought back memories of the opening scenes of ''Apocalypse Now,'' when Captain Willard lies in a similar hotel room contemplating his assigned mission up the Mekong River. Just a few blocks away, the former U.S. Embassy, its rooftop helipad intact, is occupied by a state petrochemical company. Nearby is the old Presidential Palace, now offering guided tours.
Two other museums present the official history of the war from the Communist side, displaying captured American aircraft, tanks and high-tech artillery pieces and recounting the atrocities committed by the U.S.-backed Southern regime.
But many old-time residents of Saigon have different memories from the pre-1975 years. There is little evident bitterness over a costly and futile war. Instead there is a kind of nostalgia for what, from today's vantage point, seem happier, more prosperous times. Those rosy recollections indict the economic failures of Communist rule. The Communist leadership itself acknowledges those failures and for four years has been encouraging market-oriented economic reform.
That has not only unleashed the strong commercial instincts of the South but has also begun to spread private economic activity northward to Hanoi, for 35 years a bastion of Marxist-Leninist orthodoxy. In a reversal of the pattern of the 1960's, today's infiltration routes run from south to north.
The irony would be more delicious if economic reform had not been coupled with a nasty political backlash. Vietnam's Communist rulers are prepared to tolerate capitalist economics. But, frightened by the example of Eastern Europe, they fear any accompanying decentralization of political power.
A wave of arrests earlier this year has chilled political discussion. A disproportionate number of those arrested appear to be Southerners, including many who were closely associated with the Communist movement before 1975.
Vietnam was isolated from the outside world for more than a decade after the war, thanks to an American-sponsored economic embargo and hostile international reaction when Hanoi invaded and occupied Cambodia. Now Vietnamese troops are back home. Western trade and investment are on the rise. Deals with Visa and MasterCard have recently been signed, although Americans are still prohibited by United States law from using such credit cards or doing business in Vietnam, or even placing phone calls to that country.
Those policies, large and small, are overripe for review, especially since the United States is now beginning a dialogue with Vietnam. The psyches of America and Vietnam are tied too closely together for lasting estrangement.

HEADLINE: CORPORATE RESPONSE TO SHOAL CREEK;
More Caution by Sponsors After Shoal Creek Furor

BYLINE: By RANDALL ROTHENBERG

 BODY:
The scandal over a country club's racially exclusionary membership policy will make corporations more cautious about paying to associate their names with athletic events, a $2 billion industry that until now has been growing explosively.
Marketing experts said that over the last six years large corporations have come to rely increasingly on sports to sell their products. Sports, in turn, have become so dependent on corporate sponsorship to stage major tournaments and events that their very survival sometimes depends on it.
The relationship between sports and corporate sponsors is far more intimate than that between conventional advertisers and television programs. Corporations frequently play host to clients at sports events, and have their names attached to tournaments, games and scoreboards. Because their relationship is so much more public, marketing and sports analysts said, both sides are open to greater pressure than ever before from groups agitating for social change. 
 
Visible Targets
''Sponsorship is more visible than traditional advertising; that's why sponsors are becoming the targets of protests,'' said Lesa Ukman, the editor of Special Events Report, a Chicago newsletter that tracks the field. ''Shoal Creek has shown that when you're dealing with sports or cultural events or music, the sponsors have real responsibility. And if they're not willing to take it, there will be problems.''
The exclusionary policy of the Shoal Creek Country Club near Birmingham, Ala., where the Professional Golfers' Association Championship began yesterday, touched off the current furor.
''I think the sensitivity level raised here will carry over into any activities we look at in the future,'' said Bill O'Neill, the public relations director for the Cadillac division of General Motors.
Corporations will spend $2 billion this year to have their names associated with athletic events, Ukman said, and perhaps three times that amount advertising and promoting their involvement. By contrast, musical and cultural events will garner $500 million in sponsorships.
In 1984, some $350 million was spent on sports and culture sponsorships. But the success of the 1984 Olympic Games in Los Angeles - the first Olympics opened widely to corporate sponsors - spurred a burst of spending. In 1985, for example, corporations spent $850 million sponsoring athletic and cultural events.
 
Golf and Stock Cars Lead the Way
Golf and stock-car racing have led the pack, with the P.G.A. and PGA Tour, and the stock-car circuit each drawing some $85 million this year from marketers eager to have their names attached to tournaments and their logos near stadiums.
Even before Shoal Creek, sports executives recognized the potential economic harm they could suffer from the effect of adverse publicity on advertisers and sponsors. The National Basketball Association moved quickly to address the problem of drug use by its players because it recognized that the issue was damaging to its image and marketability, said Stephen A. Greyser, a professor of consumer marketing at the Harvard Business School who has been a consultant to the N.B.A.
Sponsors often buy one-quarter to one-third of the advertising time on the telecasts of the sports events to which they attach their names. So without sponsors, television networks will be less likely to pay for the broadcast rights.
''I think corporate sponsors will not eagerly embrace problem properties,'' said one network executive who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ''And the rights holder who doesn't have a corporate underwriter to insure a TV broadcast's economic viability will have a harder time getting on the air.''
More than the money from broadcast rights is at stake. Increasingly, corporate sponsorship determines whether an event lives or dies. After Sunkist Growers bought its way into the name of the Fiesta Bowl in 1985, eight other corporate sponsors discovered college football, said Ukman, creating such gridiron classics as the Mobil Cotton Bowl and the John Hancock Bowl. These sponsors also pumped money into the purses, sometimes attracting better college teams and more television coverage. Sunkist, for example, increased the Sunkist Fiesta Bowl's payment to the teams from a total of $1 million in 1985 to $4 million in 1988.
Similarly, corporations contribute most of the $50 million in prize money given out at various PGA Tour, Senior PGA Tour and Ladies Professional Golf Association Tour events.
Unable to find corporate sponsors with deep pockets, some sports events have met their demise, among them the Bluebonnet Bowl, a college football game that was played in Texas for 29 years before it was canceled in 1988.
 
Tennis Controversy
There have been other controversies over sports marketing. Earlier this year, for example, Louis W. Sullivan, the Secretary of Health and Human Services, criticised the sponsorship of women's professional tennis by Virginia Slims cigarettes, made by the Philip Morris Companies. George Washington University, a site for a Virginia Slims tournament, subsequently pressed Philip Morris to name the tournament for one of its nontobacco brands. Instead, Philip Morris announced in June that it would move the tournament from the school to another site in Washington.
Threats against conventional advertisers, especially those by religious groups and conservative organizations objecting to sexual content in programs, remain a powerful force in television. But their success has been limited, mainly because it is hard to dissuade a mass audience from watching a program or buying products advertised on it.
A niche audience, which may be as large as the blue-collar men who attend and watch auto racing or as narrow as a company's own sales force, can be a much more cost-effective target for marketers. A brewer can attach its name to a stock-car race and also set up a hospitality tent at the track to entertain liquor store managers. Or it can offer the supply of free tickets it gets for sponsoring or advertising on an event to people who purchase two six-packs, driving up short-term sales in a given area.
But the intricacy and intimacy of the relationship between sponsors and sports renders corporate sponsorship easier to disrupt than the relatively passive relationship between a conventional television advertiser and the viewer, said Greyser of Harvard. Sponsors who are boycotted at the site of an event can be embarassed in front of their clients, and those boycotts can be the subject of vivid news coverage, damaging the company's image with the broader public.
Golf, especially, because of its affluent image and the opportunities it provides for hosting clients and sales people, is particularly attractive to corporations. And until Shoal Creek, the game was nearly free from the controversy, including the drug problems and salary disputes, that had engulfed baseball, basketball and football.
''People pay a premium for golf because it delivers a highly targeted audience,'' said Chip Campbell, a former sports-marketing executive at RJR Nabisco and now the president of Sports Marketing International, a subsidiary of the Burson-Marsteller public relations agency. ''Customer relations is also very important, especially at that end of the scale where you're dealing with decision-makers who spend a lot of money.''
James C. Reilly, the general manager of domestic marketing and services at I.B.M., said the decision to sponsor an event was complex.
''There are a number of gates we go through in deciding to sponsor an event,'' he said. ''Along with the obvious media considerations, will it provide a customer-hosting opportunity for our sales force? Will the event help us demonstrate I.B.M.'s technology? On the next level, will it provide dealer incentive opportunities? And are there possibilities for us to demonstrate I.B.M.'s corporate citizenship?''
The current controversy began in late June, when Hall Thompson, the founder of Shoal Creek, said his club would not be pressured into admitting black members. His comment, for which he later apologized, incited local and national civil rights organizations to plan protests at the club during the nationally televised broadcast of the P.G.A. Championship.
 
Pulling Out
The championship's major advertisers, including I.B.M., the American Honda Motor Company, Spalding Sports Worldwide and the Toyota Motor Corporation, subsequently pulled their commercials from ABC and ESPN. Delta Air Lines, which pays the P.G.A. a fee to be designated the championship's official airline, asked the organization to remove banners identifying its association from the Shoal Creek grounds, said William D. Beery, a Delta spokesman.
The Eastman Kodak Company, which pays the P.G.A. a fee to set up booths for professional photographers at many events, canceled its plans for Shoal Creek after Thompson revealed the club's policy. But when Shoal Creek reversed its rules, so did Kodak.
The P.G.A. moved quickly to redress the damage, affirming that country club membership policies would now be a factor in tournament site selection. As a result, none of the 25 corporations that paid to have hospitality tents at Shoal Creek withdrew, said Joe Steranka, a P.G.A. communications director.
Reilly said I.B.M.'s decision to move its advertising to other time slots on ABC was not difficult to make once Shoal Creek's membership policy became public. There was no pressure from groups or individuals inside or outside the company, and no corporate conclaves were convened.
''The clarity of our policy came face to face with the emerging public controversy,'' Reilly said. ''The decision was obvious.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
No Oil Emergency Yet, Energy Officials Assert

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 9

 BODY:
With oil markets still jittery today, the industrial world's senior energy officials sought to reassure the industry and investors that there were sufficient oil supplies worldwide.
Still, they emphasized the importance of becoming more prepared for emergency measures in case the situation in the Middle East deteriorated.
At a meeting of the International Energy Agency in Paris, energy officials from the United States, Japan and Europe decided that despite their embargo of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, the time had not yet come to take such urgent measures as tapping emergency oil reserves or beginning special conservation programs.
 
An Uncertain Future
Nevertheless, the officials noted that the future was very uncertain and agreed to prepare to begin using their emergency oil reserves, if necessary. 
''There is a risk that the situation could evolve into a shortfall,'' said Ulrich Engelmann, chairman of the International Energy Agency.
For now, however, the ministers said petroleum supplies remained adequate, citing the supplies of oil at sea, the high level of company- and government-controlled oil stocks and the possibility of higher oil production by several countries.
''We're not in a crisis situation,'' said John Easton, the United States Assistant Secretary of Energy.
After rising sharply following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last week, oil prices have declined in recent days on the expectation that Saudi Arabia would increase its current production of 5.4 million barrels a day by about two million barrels. That would help cushion the effects of the embargo on oil from Iraq and Kuwait, which the I.E.A. says export 4.4 million barrels a day. #50 Percent Rise in a Month West Texas Intermediate crude oil dropped 29 cents today to close at $25.67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange, about 50 percent higher than it was a month ago. In London, North Sea Brent crude oil closed at $25.05 a barrel, up 7 cents on the day.
At today's meeting in Paris, energy officials from 21 nations seemed especially concerned about calming the oil markets and preventing prices from soaring. They characterized the price increases as a response to uncertainty rather than to shortages.
''The price development is the typical speculative reaction to a political negative event,'' Mr. Engelmann said.
The International Energy Agency was formed by oil-importing nations in 1974 after Arab nations embargoed oil shipments to the United States. It helps coordinate a response to any oil-supply emergency and seeks to foster a balance in energy supply and demand, encourage conservation and promote other energy sources.
 
'Excellent Stock Situation'
In their communique, the energy officials called on oil companies to ''take advantage of their generally excellent stock situation'' and ''avoid abnormal spot market purchases.''
Several officials said the West's oil supplies could be insured and prices stabilized, at least for a time, if companies drew down some of their reserves.
''There is a common interest among the oil industry and the Government that things do not run into a panic situation,'' Mr. Engelmann said.
Officials suggested that the supply situation could remain satisfactory if other oil-producing nations, especially Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, increased their production. Many analysts expect Venezuela to raise its output to 2.4 million barrels a day from its current 1.9 million barrels.
At a British Petroleum news conference in London today, company officials said that even with a two-million-barrel-a-day drop in production caused by the Iraqi crisis, the world would have an adequate oil supply for a year if the coming winter was not severe. With a four-million barrel-a-day decline in output, however, a shortfall would be felt in October, they said.
British Petroleum's chairman, Robert Horton, estimated that the price of oil would average $22 a barrel over the next six months.
 
A Billion Barrels in Reserve
Helga Sleeg, the executive director of the International Energy Agency, said the West was in better position in this Middle Eastern crisis than it had been in previous crises because Government-controlled oil stocks were at an eight-year high. The billion barrels in emergency reserves in the industrialized world - including a 590-million-barrel reserve in the United States -are equivalent to 150 days of the industrial world's net oil imports.
Another positive factor is that many nations have reduced their dependence on oil. In France, for instance, oil has dropped to 40 percent of total energy consumption from 69 percent in 1973.
Mr. Engelmann said that by developing and tapping oil reserves and switching to other forms of energy, the industrial world stood a good chance of preventing a huge shortage.
Other Western officials are optimistic that the current crisis will be less damaging the world's economy than were the 1973 and 1979 oil shocks, which sent the West into recession.
The Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, a Paris-based group of industrialized nations, estimated that a $3-a-barrel increase in oil prices would increase inflation by five-tenths of 1 percent in the industrialized world in the first year and would reduce economic output by four-tenths of 1 percent in the first year.
But some economists said a $10-a-barrel increase - the amount that oil prices have risen over the last month - would triple those negative effects.

Iraq Puts Election Truisms To Test

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
All the uncertainty in the Persian Gulf has insured at least one thing at home: this fall's elections, which weeks ago seemed but a hodgepodge of races with little national focus, will now revolve heavily around the economy as it sags under the burden of rising oil prices.
On its face, that is bad news for President Bush and the Republicans. Few laws of politics have been proved more often than the one stated by Harold Wilson, the British Prime Minister, in 1968: ''All political history shows that the standing of a government and its ability to hold the confidence of the electorate at a general election depend on the success of its economic policy.''
Republican officials are in near panic over what may happen at the polls this fall as economic trouble stokes an already potent pox-on-politicians mood. ''I've been in politics for 30 years and this is the scariest political environment I've ever been in,'' said Ed Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee. 
But in this year's witch's brew of politics, maxims deserve a second look. The simple formula that bad economic news equals bad political news for the President's party may not capture the complexity of the modern economy or of politics.
Mr. Bush faces the most delicate political dilemma of his career. Nothing boosts the standing of a President and his party more than the firm handling of a foreign crisis. And there is nothing that hurts that standing more than a sliding economy. But the more firmly Mr. Bush stands up to the Iraqis, the more he insures higher oil prices, inflation and recession.
Assuming he handles the crisis well, which will dominate the campaigns: Foreign policy management or economic hardship? The conventional wisdom is that economics overrides almost all other issues, particularly in this post-cold-war world.
But there are dissenters. Some analysts in both parties say Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will not only boost President Bush's standing as a leader but also give him an explanation for a recession that was imminent anyway. Perhaps that will temper its political effect, since Americans, like most people, endure pain better when they are given a reason.
There is also the notion that recessions are different these days. Politicians fear them because they produce unemployed and angry voters. But what if this incipient recession does more damage, as some economists predict, to bankers and over-leveraged business executives than to working people? There will still be political fallout, but it could be quite different from the past.
To see the effect of the economy on the elections more clearly, it is necessary to ask how the economy affects voters. First, a truism must be dispensed with. Voters do not ''vote their pocketbook'' in the direct sense.
''Very few citizens are motivated to vote against the incumbent simply because they see their financial situation has deteriorated,'' said Michael S. Lewis-Beck, a professor of political science at the University of Iowa, who surveyed voters in the United States and five European countries to arrive at this conclusion.
In other words, higher gasoline prices will not, of themselves, lead to retaliation at the polls, particularly if the President explains them as a necessary price for a national goal.
What the voters respond to, says the professor, is their sense of where the economy is headed. Everything from the closing of a savings and loan to the announcement of higher unemployment can influence that. Indeed, 49 percent of Americans believe the country is in recession, according to a CBS News poll this week, and 29 percent more think it is near one.
What matters is the overall psychological effect. So it follows that factors other than hard data matter. Kirk O'Donnell, a Democratic analyst, says the 1986 and 1988 elections were influenced more by political talk about the economy than by real changes in the economy.
In 1986, he said, the Democrats persuaded voters that economic trouble was brewing and recaptured the Senate. In 1988, Republicans held onto the White House after calming economic fears, said Mr. O'Donnell, who watched from his perch as a campaign adviser to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis.
So the political effect of the 1990 recession will depend a lot on whether voters think it is George Bush's recession or Saddam Hussein's.

HEADLINE: Birmingham Journal;
Bitter Memories of Bias Accompany City's Gains

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BIRMINGHAM, Ala., Aug. 8

 BODY:
From the days of Bull Connor's police dogs and fire hoses to the present, perhaps no American city has had to wrestle with the demons of race so conspicuously as Birmingham.
So as the P.G.A. golf championship gets under way here after a dispute over the efforts to integrate the Shoal Creek Country Club just outside this city, there is an odd mix of weariness, resignation, anger and even pride.
Despite the harsh memories and emotions engendered by the dispute at Shoal Creek and other incidents this summer, this is a city that has come to accept its status as a barometer of race relations in America. Almost three decades after the racial violence of the civil rights era that made it infamous, Birmingham has probably made as much progress in race relations as any city in the country. At the same time, it sums up as painfully just how far the nation has to go. 
''When people think of that era, they think of George Wallace and freedom riders and police dogs and fire hoses in Birmingham,'' said Dr. Russ Fine, a medical school professor at the University of Alabama who is the host of a radio call-in show here. ''And I don't know if that's an image that's ever going to be purged from the fabric of the American memory. We're a symbol, and we're held to a higher standard, but maybe that's not all bad. If you're held to a higher standard, then you have a higher standard to achieve.''
In many ways, the progress in Birmingham has been striking. Birmingham, where blacks now make up about 60 percent of the city's 275,000 residents, has a black Mayor, Richard Arrington Jr., and blacks are a majority on the City Council. It has an almost painfully earnest network of interracial commissions and study groups dedicated to fostering racial harmony and a series of intiatives aimed at voluntary efforts by businesses to provide economic and job opportunties for blacks.
Chris Boehm, head of the city's interracial Community Affairs Committee, said, ''The 60's damaged our city terribly and as a result of that, when it comes to race it's just not good enough for Birmingham to be equal to other cities; we have to be better.''
For blacks like the Rev. John T. Porter of Sixth Avenue Baptist Church, who recalls indignities like interminable waits in office lobbies for the one elevator out of eight reserved for blacks, or Louis J. Willie, who can remember a town with no black police officers or firefighters and only a handful of black professionals, Birmingham has undergone a revolutionary transformation.
''This is a totally different place,'' said Mr. Willie, head of the Booker T. Washington Insurance Company, who became the first black invited to join Shoal Creek. Last week the club accepted Mr. Willie as an honorary member and began procedures to accept its first regular black member.
''Anyone who thinks nothing much has changed in Birmingham has been like Rip Van Winkle, asleep for 30 years.''
Despite the progress, Birmingham is a place that has been buffeted by one racial dispute after another in the past year, including a furor over a white talk show host's one-day ban on black callers.
To many blacks, the progress masks the evolution of a new status quo that is almost as stifling as the old one in a city where housing and public schools remain almost completely segregated, despite the end of legal segregation. A survey of 48 American cities in 1987 ranked Birmingham last in the concentration of small black businesses. A study by The Birmingham News last year found banks and savings and loans were three times as likely to make loans in white middle-income areas as in black ones.
Donald Watkins, a local lawyer who is and special counsel to Mr. Arrington, said the departure of whites, discrimination in housing and employment and continuing economic inequality provide more subtle but just as insidious barriers to black advancement as were evident in the 60's.
''A lot of the problems are the same,'' he said. ''They're much harder to deal with though because the discrimination is more sophisticated and subtle.''
For many business people and white residents, the Shoal Creek dispute has been a nightmare - an dismal realization of their fears that the world still wants to see Birmingham as it was rather than as it is. For many blacks it has been a confirmation of the vestiges of the past that still linger in a changed city.
But many people, black and white, see a measure of hypocrisy in the degree to which Birmingham and the South remain a lightning rod for racial controversy in a nation bursting at the seams with it.
''If that Howard Beach thing had happened here, we would have been slaughtered,'' said Mr. Willie, referring to the incident in New York City where a black man, being chased by a gang of white youths, was struck and killed by a car.
And for some the furor has been a reminder of how much race in America is a captive of images - of Commissioner Eugene (Bull) Connor's police dogs - and how much easier it is to confront them than contemporary problems.
Jenell Smith, a 15-year-old high school student, has a summer job working at Phillips High School in a poor neighborhood. There is not much in his life that is further away than golf at Shoal Creek, but he sees in the dispute something he sees all around him -the degree to which for blacks and whites alike, past and present still intermingle in the doleful dance of race.
''Half the people if they didn't know about the past, they wouldn't have any racial tensions, but we can't seem to get away from it,'' he said. ''As it is, it goes up and down, up and down, over and over again. It never goes away.''

U.N. Council Declares Void Iraqi Annexation of Kuwait

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The United Nations Security Council voted unanimously today to declare Iraq's formal annexation of Kuwait null and void in international law.
The decision is legally binding on all members of the organization. But Iraq's United Nations representative defended his Government's action as ending an artificial division of the Arab world created in the last century by what he called the imperialist powers. The representatives of the United States and Kuwait's government-in-exile promptly pointed out that this argument could justify further annexations of Arab countries. 
The resolution, which was supported by all 15 Council members, said the annexation ''has no legal validity and is declared null and void.''
It tells all countries and international organizations they must not recognize the annexation or take any actions ''that might be interpreted as an indirect recognition of the annexation.'' And it ''demands that Iraq rescind its actions purporting to annex Kuwait.''
 
Unanimous Condemnation
This is the third time the Security Council has condemned Baghdad's takeover of Kuwait since the invasion last week, though it is the first time the Council has unanimously done so.
But while Yemen refused to participate in the first vote last Thursday condemning the invasion and Cuba and Yemen abstained in Monday's vote imposing economic sanctions, no member opposed any of these decisions.
After the Council had voted and most members made brief speeches denouncing President Saddam Hussein's aggression for the third time in a week, Iraq's Representative, Abdul Amir al-Anbari, told the Council that ''those who live in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.''
Iraq's annexation, he said, was an attempt to end the ''splintering of the region'' caused by the colonial powers that had ''transformed the Arab nation into 22 Arab states, redrawing the map of the region.'' It was part of the reunification of his country, he said.
The United States representative, Thomas R. Pickering, and the Kuwaiti representative, Mohammed A. Abulhasan, immediately pointed out that this argument could be used to justify the takeover of other Arab countries.
 
Talk of a Second Resolution
''Where does it end?'' Ambassador Pickering said. ''Does it end in Kuwait? Does it move on to Saudi Arabia? Does it move on to Jordan?'' Council members are starting to talk informally about the possibility of a second resolution setting up a United Nations naval patrol to enforce the trade embargo against Iraq and occupied Kuwait under Article 42 of the Charter, which empowers the Council to take such military actions.
This follows announcements by the Soviet Union and France that they will not join a blockade of Iraq without United Nations authorization and a Soviet statement today that said Moscow wanted consultations in the Military Staff Committee on such a blockade.
The Military Staff Committee is a largely defunct organ comprising the Chiefs of Staff of the five permanent Security Council members. It is supposed to organize military enforcement of Council decisions, but has never been able to agree in the past.
Some Western countries say a new resolution setting up a United Nations blockade is not strictly necessary because the resolution imposing sanctions can be interpreted as giving their national navies the right to search ships suspected of infringements.
The Security Council today also set up a special committee to monitor compliance with the embargo and appointed Finland its president and Canada and Colombia its vice presidents.
Today Britain's representative, Sir Crispin Tickell, told the Council that the existing sanctions resolution justifies Britain's decision to use its warships in the gulf to ''monitor maritime traffic'' to insure compliance.
But others argued that a new resolution would establish this right more clearly and probably be a political necessity if the Soviet Union and Arab Governments were to join the effort to make the sanctions effective.
Last night Kuwait's government-in-exile convened an emergency session of the Council after Baghdad announced its annexation decision. Cuba immediately tried to give the proceedings an anti-American twist by proposing a resolution expressing concern at the buildup of foreign forces in the Gulf and calling for a halt.
But the Council's other third world members refused to support it and Cuba was forced to abandon its plan.
 
Soviet Urges 'Collective Effort'
MOSCOW, Aug. 9 (Special to The New York Times) - Distancing itself from the United States' decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia, the Soviet Union today ruled out any military action in the Persian Gulf crisis except as part of a ''collective effort'' carried out under United Nations auspices.
''The Soviet Union stands for coordinated actions within the Security Council of the United Nations,'' the Government said in a statement issued today. ''If this organization takes a decision on the use of a multinational force, the Soviet Union on this basis, will elaborate its line of conduct.''
The Soviet Union called on the United Nations Security Council to devote its full-time attention to the crisis, and for immediate consultations with the Council's military staff committee.
But, the Soviet statement said, ''at this time there is no question of taking part in a multinational force or a sea blockade outside the confines of the United Nations Security Council.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
U.S. Says Turkey Plans To Cooperate on Iraq

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Aug. 9

 BODY:
In a crucial strategic development further isolating Iraq, the United States and Turkey laid the basis today for expanded military and intelligence cooperation to counter President Saddam Hussein, a Bush Administration official said.
The tacit understanding was reached today in five hours of talks between Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, President Turgut Ozal of Turkey and other senior Turkish officials in Ankara. The Administration official declined to specify the exact form the expanded cooperation might take, but he hinted that it could almost certainly involve Turkey's granting the United States permission to use the fighter aircraft and bombers it has based in Turkey, ostensibly on NATO-related missions, for any potential war in the Persian Gulf.
The United States in recent weeks has been rotating 14-plane squadrons of F-111 fighter-bombers from bases in England to Incirlik air base in Turkey, where 5,000 American servicemen and dependents are stationed. Since the planes are supposedly on routine NATO missions, to use them against Iraqi targets, just as the United States used them to bomb Libya in 1986, would require Turkey's permission. 
''In the event that there were to be full-scale hostilities, I am quite confident that we could count upon our allies the Turks,'' the Administration official said after today's talks. ''I think it would be useful in judging Turkish moods and intentions to watch what happens with respect to what they may be doing in the next couple of weeks.''
 
Iraqi Pipeline Is Cut
Up to now the Turks have confined their response to the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait to economic sanctions - cutting off the Iraqi oil pipeline that crosses Iraqi territory and abiding by the United Nations boycott. Antagonizing Iraq by raising their stake in the conflict to a military level is not something the Turks would do lightly.
Administration officials would only speak in terms of tacit understandings because the precise extent of expanded cooperation between the two nations will depend in part on the degree to which the NATO foreign ministers at their meeting in Brussels on Friday signal their willingness to stand by Turkey if Iraq attacks it. Mr. Baker flew here for that meeting from Ankara.
''The Turks,'' the Administration official said, ''because they are strategicaly located, are exposed in the event that there is any outbreak of hostilities, and they quite appropriately want to know that if they stand up in a forthright manner that their allies will be with them if there is trouble.''
The Administration official said Mr. Baker and Mr. Ozal had also discussed how their two nations could intensify intelligence cooperation to improve gathering of data about internal developments in the tightly sealed Iraqi state, Turkey's neighbor to the east. While the official did not say so, Iraq's long and porous border with Turkey could be useful in infiltrating men, money or materiel to destabilize the regime of President Hussein.
If Turkey does add its military weight to the tightening siege of Iraq, it would mean that in case of a war with Iraq, the United States would probably have access to American military installations, air bases, warehouses and intelligence-gathering units across Turkey.
It would also leave Iraq virtually surrounded by hostile neighbors - with American, British and Saudi troops to the south, American and Turkish forces to the north, Iranian troops to the east and Syrian troops to the west. The only safe border from Iraq's point of view is with Jordan. In return for Turkey's forthright military cooperation, the official indicated that the Administration is prepared to help ease the economic burden on Turkey of virtually cutting off its ties with Baghdad.
Turkish officials told Mr. Baker that they will have to forfeit $400 million in revenues that they derived from the Iraqi oil pipeline they just closed. They will probably have to forfeit $800 million from an outstanding loan to Baghdad, and they will probably end up losing another $1.5 billion a year in sales contracts with Iraq, investments and remittances from the estimated 3,000 Turkish workers in Iraq and Kuwait.
Mr. Baker, the official said, told Mr. Ozal that Washington had won a commitment from the Emir of Kuwait, Sheik Jabar al-Ahmed al-Sabah, to compensate the Turks with an undisclosed amount of money. In addition, the official said, the Administration will push Turkey's application for membership in the European Community, support Turkey's loan requests pending before various multilateral banking institutions, support Export-Import bank loan guarantees for sales of certain heavy equipment to Turkey and possibly also increase military aid to Ankara.
 
Turkey Reacts Cautiously
ANKARA, Turkey, Aug. 9 (Special to The New York Times) - Turkey reacted cautiously to Mr. Baker's visit, saying without comment that the Secretary had ''emphasized the importance that the United States attaches to Turkey's security.''
An official statement also said President Ozal had ''expressed his content'' about President Bush's decision to send American forces ''for defensive purposes.''
In a televised address tonight, Mr. Ozal warned neighboring Iraq against even thinking of attacking Turkey.
There were reports of heavy military movement on the Iraqi side of the border, but officials in Ankara insisted that they had no firm information about unusual activity.
The Turkish Army increased its state of readiness, canceling all leaves and transfering F-16 and F-104 fighter jets to bases in southeastern Turkey that are closer to the Iraqi border. The United States has at least 14 F-111 bombers at the Incirlik air base in southern Turkey. American officials insist, however, that the planes are here for routine training and that they arrived before the gulf crisis erupted.

Excerpts From King Fahd's Speech to Saudis

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from a statement by King Fahd of Saudi Arabia today, broadcast by Saudi television and translated by the British Broadcasting Corporation:
No doubt you realize through your following up of the course of the regrettable events at the level of the Arab Gulf region during the last few days, the gravity of the situation facing the Arab nation in the shadow of the current circumstances. And you undoubtedly know that the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia had exerted all that it could in effort and attempts with the Governments of the Iraqi Republic and the state of Kuwait, for the sake of containing the dispute that has risen between the two countries.
However, with great regret, matters developed in the opposite direction to what we were endeavoring; in fact, opposite to the aspirations of the peoples of the Islamic and Arab nations, and all the peace-loving countries of the world. Painful and regrettable events have been taking place since the dawn of last Thursday, corresponding to 2d August 1990, in a way that took the whole world by surprise, when the Iraqi forces stormed the brotherly state of Kuwait in the most vile aggression known to the Arab nation in its modern history which made the brotherly people of Kuwait homeless and caused them great suffering. 
While expressing its deep displeasure at the aggression to which the state of Kuwait, a sisterly neighbor was subjected, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia declares its categorical rejection of all the measures and declarations that followed that aggression, which were rejected by all the statements issued by Arab leaderships, the Arab League, the Islamic Conference organization and the Gulf Cooperation Council, as well as all Arab and international bodies and organizations.
 
Sheik's Return Demanded
The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia reaffirms its demand that the situation must be returned to what it was before the Iraqi storming, and the return of the ruling family led by Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Emir of the state of Kuwait, and his Government. We are hoping that the emergency Arab summit which was called by the President Mohammad Hosni Mubarak of the sisterly Egypt Arab Republic would lead to results that would realize the Arab nation's hopes and bolster its march toward solidarity and unity of word.
Oh brothers, that regretful event came after Iraq's massing of huge forces on the borders of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. In front of these bitter realities and out of the eagerness of the kingdom for the safety of its territory and the protection of its vital and economic constituents, our wish to strengthen its defense potential and increase the level of training of its armed forces and out of the eagerness of the Government of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia to side with peace and non-recourse to force to solve disputes, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia expressed its wish for the participation of fraternal Arab forces and other friendly forces.
Thus the Government of the U.S.A. and the British Government took the initiative, on the basis of the relations of friendship which link the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and these states, to send air and land forces in order to back the Saudi armed forces in performing its duty to defend the homeland and the citizens against any aggression with the complete emphasis that this measure is not addressed to anybody but is only for a purely defensive aim imposed by the current circumstances faced by the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.
It is worth mentioning here that the forces which will participate in the joint training between them and the Saudi armed forces will be present temporarily in the Kingdom's territory and will leave it immediately when the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia wishes so.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
As U.S. Forces Build, a Military Stalemate Shapes Up

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
As American forces pour into Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf, there are signs that a military stalemate between Iraq and the United States is rapidly developing.
Some American military planners are reported to have expressed concern that the Iraqis might attack in the next few weeks before the American force is fully deployed. But with each passing hour the danger that a shooting war will break out becomes less acute. Military experts with long experience in the Middle East believe that if President Saddam Hussein ever entertained hopes of attacking Saudi Arabia, as he did Kuwait, his chance is now lost. At the same time, the United States is constrained to adopt a defensive stance. 
Both sides have some high cards to play, but most entail risks that are probably unacceptable. Even Iraq's immense armored force of 5,500 tanks no longer seems capable of overwhelming Saudi Arabia in a quick sweep now that American air power can be brought to bear.
Hermann F. Eilts, who has served as United States Ambassador in both Saudi Arabia and Egypt and as a deputy commandant of the Army War College, believes that although the Iraqi armored forces are well trained and eager to fight, they would soon find themselves in trouble if they were to push across the Saudi frontier.
 
Two Options for Tanks
Any attack Iraq might mount would depend primarily on its armored forces, thrusting south from occupied Kuwait. The tanks, along with armored personnel carriers, self-propelled artillery and supporting vehicles, would have two options: they could sweep along the coast of the Persian Gulf toward Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, or they could head south across the desert to the Saudi capital of Riyadh.
Mr. Eilts said the coastal route is difficult for heavy vehicles. Much of the area is soft sand covered with ''sabkha'' - a brittle crust consisting mostly of salt. Even a jeep can break through this crust, he said, and getting a vehicle moving again takes time and effort.
An inland invasion route over packed desert sand would provide surer footing for a mechanized force, but a large column of armor would have no refuge or cover from American aircraft. Mr. Eilts, chairman of the department of international relations at Boston University, added that ''the Iraqis would put up a spirited and effective fight, but American aircraft would inflict very heavy casualties on them.''
President Hussein is certainly aware of this and in the view of many Western military analysts he is unlikely to risk destruction of his most potent land force. Restraints on the U.S. The blockade by American warships announced yesterday, coupled with international sanctions, must also influence President Hussein. Iraq's only access to the sea through the Persian Gulf is a 20-mile stretch of beach, and even when Kuwait's coast is included as Iraqi territory, the distance involved could be easily dominated by the American fleet.
But United States forces are also subject to important restraints.
Even the United States blockade of Iraqi oil exports is a double-edged sword. The measure is certain to hurt the Iraqi economy but it has already reduced global oil supplies and will probably weaken the American economy. Some experts believe that the United States has unnecessarily restricted the retaliatory arsenal it might have brought to bear on Iraq.
Frank Gaffney, a former Pentagon official now at the Washington-based Center for Security Policy, believes that the Bush Administration should not have barred production of a new ''binary'' chemical-warfare weapon, for example. A binary shell, bomb or rocket contains two ingredients that are relatively harmless when kept apart but when combined create a cloud of lethal nerve gas. The United States Navy does not permit chemical weapons aboard its aircraft carriers because of the hazard of accidental exposure of the crew. But the relative safety of binary chemical warheads would make them acceptable for use on carrier-borne aircraft.
 
A Powerful Deterrent
''Any aggressor aware that United States forces possessed a credible chemical-warfare arsenal, including binary warheads, would be powerfully deterred from using chemical weapons himself,'' Mr. Gaffney said.
But most military analysts believe that if the United States were even to threaten to use poison gas or nuclear weapons, world opinion, which now strongly supports Washington, would turn against this country. ''We might gain a military chip but lose the political war,'' a Western diplomat said.
By contrast, Iraq has already lost so much international sympathy that there is little more to be jeopardized, and Baghdad, in extreme circumstances, might be tempted to use poison gas or threaten foreign hostages.
Still, Western experts with experience in Iraq regard President Hussein as ruthless and calculating, but neither impulsive nor mad. In a purely military sense, he has achieved a resounding victory by annexing Kuwait, and few observers give the United States much chance of dislodging him. This may be enough for him, some suggest.

HEADLINE: Quayle Warns Haiti to Hold Fair Election

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti, Aug. 9

 BODY:
Vice President Dan Quayle warned Haitian leaders today that the United States would cut off economic aid to this Caribbean nation if general elections scheduled for November are not free and fair.
''If you are going to have a country that is not democratic and not respectful of human rights, they are not going to be recipients of the American taxpayers' money,'' Mr. Quayle told reporters before he met today with Haiti's interim President, Ertha Pascal-Trouillot. ''I will be talking to them about that very clearly.'' 
The Vice President later spoke to a group of senior Haitian military officers and warned them bluntly of the consequences of military involvement in any effort to upset the elections.
Mr. Quayle told the officers, ''My message is: no coup, no murders, no threats, and instead, free and fair elections that will bring honor to the brave people of Haiti.'' He received only lukewarm applause.
 
In Power Since March
Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot came to power in March after Lieut. Gen. Prosper Avril, the head of what had been Haiti's military Government, fled the country.
General Avril had come to power 18 months earlier in a coup. As interim President, Mrs. Pascal-Trouillot's chief responsibility is planning for this fall's election.
The United States will supply about $60 million in aid this year to Haiti, the poorest nation in the Western Hemisphere. Mr. Quayle said today that the United States was prepared to offer $3 million to Haiti's Electoral Council to help insure a fair election.
Last month, Haiti asked the United Nations to send nearly 300 civilian officials to supervise the balloting and about 40 military officers to insure that the country's poorly disciplined armed forces maintain law and order during the campaign. The United States and other Western nations have responded enthusiastically to the Haitian request.
 
Duvalier Supporters Feared
Haitian officials also want the election monitors to keep a close watch on the activities of groups still loyal to the nation's former dictator, Jean-Claude Duvalier.
Port-au-Prince, the nation's capital, was rocked by strikes last month to protest the return from exile of two former Government officials who were linked with political violence and torture during the Duvalier regime.
Mr. Quayle is the highest-ranking American official to visit Haiti in more than 30 years, and American officials traveling with the Vice President said his presence here was intended to make clear the Bush Administration's concern for free elections.
''Haiti and Cuba are the last holdouts on democracy in this hemisphere,'' Mr. Quayle said at a news conference aboard a Government jet en route to Port-au-Prince. He said he would urge President Pascal-Trouillot to bring the independent election observers to Haiti as quickly as possible.
''One of the things that I'll be talking to President Trouillot about is trying to get observers in early,'' Mr. Quayle said. ''Time is of the essence.''

HEADLINE: Oil-Price Rise Poses a Threat For the Region

BYLINE: By RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
While the New York region is proportionally less dependent on energy than other parts of the country, the higher oil prices that have prevailed since Iraq invaded Kuwait endanger a local economy that is already among the frailest in the nation.
''No doubt about it, the New York City region is in recession right now, and this is coming at a very bad time,'' said Robert A. Dye, director of state forecasting for the WEFA group, a forecasting organization in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa.
Richard M. Kessel, executive director of the New York State Consumer Protection Board, said gasoline prices had already jumped about eight cents a gallon in the state. But this fall and winter, the cost of heating oil could be more worrisome, especially in New York State, where more than half the houses use it. Retail prices have also gone up about eight cents a gallon, and wholesale prices have soared to about 25 cents, Mr. Kessel said yesterday, shortly before several major oil companies agreed to decrease or freeze the prices that they charge retailers. 
No one predicts the kind of economic adversity produced in the region in 1973, when oil prices began a 10-fold rise and shortages resulted in sinews of cars at the pumps.
 
More Dependence on People
Then as now, the region's dense population and development patterns have led to more mass transit use than in other parts of the country. And over the last few decades many of the factories that would be hardest hit by oil prices have been closed - with a loss since the end of 1979 of 326,000 jobs -and been replaced by service industries that largely depend on people, not power.
There has also been a shift to more efficient cars and natural gas. Still, the oil-price surge comes as the region is suffering its first drop in jobs since 1982.
If oil prices remain in the range of $25 a barrel they would likely lead to a host of adversities, perhaps including a further drop in consumer spending that could drag the economy down even more, as well as higher transit and taxi fares and tolls. Utility bills might eventually rise $10 a month or more for a typical customer, according to one estimate.
The deepening weakness in the region was apparent in a report issued last week by the regional commissioner of the Federal Bureau of Labor Statistics, Samuel M. Ehrenhalt, which found that New York and northeastern New Jersey lost 13,000 jobs in the first five months of this year.
 
Limit on Inflation
One of the few bright spots, Mr. Ehrenhalt said, were consumer prices, which had shot up in the first quarter of 1990 but moderated in the second. Should oil prices stay high, inflationary pressures would resume, although Mr. Ehrenhalt said the extent of those pressures would be limited by consumer resistance.
Consumer spending in the region was drooping even before the 1987 stock market plunge that serves as a watershed for the boom of the 1980's. Based on an analysis of what happened in 1973-74, Mr. Dye said he estimated that the nearly 50 percent increase in the price of oil that has already occurred could decrease spending on durable goods like cars and appliances by 10 percent, with spending on nondurable goods like clothing dropping less.
As a result, he said, people who depend on discretionary spending, like restaurant workers, ''would feel the pinch.''
Still, the region enjoys some insulation from an energy-price jolt. In a study in 1974, the Regional Plan Association concluded that the region had 9.7 percent of the nation's population but used 6.6 percent of the its energy. Since then, more factory jobs have been lost and mass transit riders gained, although motor vehicles registration has also risen sharply and the construction boom of the last decade has added energy-gulping skyscrapers in the city and sprawl in the suburbs.
 
Rise of Natural Gas
Current estimates of regional energy use are difficult to obtain, if they exist at all, but there appears to have been not only a rise in consumption but also a significant shift to natural gas, which is cheaper, at least so far, and largely produced domestically, although not in the region.
Daniel J. Walden, director of public informaton for Consolidated Edison in New York, said that in 1970, the utility derived 57 percent of its kilowatt hours from oil, 20 percent from coal, 19 percent from natural gas and 4 percent from nuclear reactors. Now, 50 percent is from natural gas, 33 percent from oil and 17 percent from nuclear reactors.
Also, the number of the utility's customers heating homes with gas rose from 129,000 in 1970 to 144,000 in 1980 to 180,000 in 1989.
''The gas companies, including us, have become more aggressive,'' Mr. Walden said.
It is far from clear whether oil prices will stay high or go higher, and in any case the impact of energy costs on the region is complicated and subject to much debate.
For example, it might seem that higher prices at gas pumps would lead to more people riding commuter trains, subways and buses. But Mortimer L. Downey, chief financial officer of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said any ridership gains would, at least in the short run, be more than offset by higher gas and electricity prices that the agency would have to absorb to run its vehicles.
 
Role in Boom
That might contribute to the need for a fare increase, which in turn might push ridership back down.
And while some experts emphasized the region's shift to a service economy, which typically uses less energy than an industrial one, Vincent Tese, the New York State Commissioner of Economic Development, noted that right now the state's service sector was ''under stress'' while manufacturing was ''holding its own.''
James W. Hughes, professor of urban planning and policy development at Rutgers, noted that the region's boom in the last decade had coincided with a drop in energy prices. And he said that was the only positive economic force left in the region - until now.
A danger of higher energy prices, he said, was that the region would send a lot of its capital to the oil-producing parts of the country and the world, as it did during the steeper price surges of the 1970's, Then again, Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Urban Research Center at New York University, said that although higher energy costs would reinforce the local downturn, some capital might flow back if people in energy-rich areas choose to invest in the city.
Some economists also said the city might gain a competitive advantage, at least over its suburbs, if as in the 1970's higher gas prices help convince people to move closer to their downtown jobs.
But even if the city or the region somehow avoid most of the direct trauma of higher energy costs, they could still be dragged down if the national economy slides into recession because of them.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Seeking to Buy Aqueduct Track

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Aug. 9

 BODY:
New York State is exploring the sale of Aqueduct Race Track in Queens to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which would close the track and use the land to expand Kennedy International Airport, state officials said today.
Negotiations between the New York Racing Association and the authority are preliminary, and the two sides are not close to agreeing on a price, the officials said.
One official, who asked not to be identified, said the prices discussed had ranged from $100 million to $200 million for the 203-acre site in Ozone Park, across the Belt Parkway from the airport. 
The racing association was said to be interested in selling Aqueduct and using the proceeds to upgrade Belmont Race Track in Elmont, L.I. The association now operates Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga, the three major thoroughbred race tracks in New York. Belmont would be renovated to accommodate year-round racing, which is now run only at Aqueduct, under the association's plan.
 
A 'Realistic Proposition'
The Port Authority has been looking for land to expand Kennedy, and Aqueduct would be a logical place, said Vincent Tese, the state's director of economic development. The expansion might include new cargo services or warehouses, but would not involve lengthening runways, he said.
''It's a realistic proposition,'' he said. But, he added that while both sides were interested, they appeared far apart on price, partly because the Port Authority was assessing the site's potential as if it were vacant land.
''To N.Y.R.A., Aqueduct is an improved asset, while to the Port Authority it's a less than improved asset,'' Mr. Tese said.
A spokesman for the racing association, Steven Schwartz, said he would not comment on any Aqueduct negotiations, which were first reported today in The Daily News. Asked whether the association, a nonprofit corporation created by the state in 1959 to operate thoroughbred racing, would agree to sell if the Port Authority came up with a reasonable offer, he said, ''That's speculation, and we'd rather not respond to that.''
 
'Too Early to Tell'
Hugh O'Neill, the assistant executive director of the Port Authority, confirmed that his agency was interested in the site for possible expansion of cargo services and other airport operations, but he said it was ''too early to tell'' whether the site would actually be bought.
''It just hasn't gotten to the point where they have put out a firm asking price or we have put out an offer,'' Mr. O'Neill said.
Mr. Tese said a memorandum on the possible sale had been prepared for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, whose backing would be essential to a deal. The Governor, speaking to reporters in Queens today, said he would not say what he thought about the idea until he saw some specifics.
''Did anybody say there were numbers?'' Mr. Cuomo asked. ''Didn't they say there were no numbers? How could I favor a deal without numbers?''
Aside from the tracks at Aqueduct, Belmont and Saratoga, thoroughbred racing is also held at the Finger Lakes track in Canandaigua, and is to resume within a few years at Tioga Downs near Binghamton.

HEADLINE: Oil Rise Helps Soviets, Hurts East Europe

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 9

 BODY:
The sharp rise in oil prices resulting from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will give a windfall to the Soviet Union, the world's leading oil producer, but create havoc for the fragile economies of Eastern Europe, which depend heavily on imported oil.
If the prices stick, they will bring a much-needed increase in hard-currency earnings to the Soviet Union, and help Moscow's hard-pressed leaders provide more consumer goods to the restive Soviet public.
But for Hungary, Poland and other Eastern European countries, the spike in oil prices will make their road to a market economy more treacherous, aggravating their debt crises, feeding public discontent about price increases, and making times still harder for their obsolete, energy-guzzling industries.
 
'Don't Have the Money'
''An increase in oil prices could be salvation for the Soviet Union,'' said Jan Stankowsky, an expert on Eastern European trade at the Institute for Comparative Economic Studies in Vienna. ''On the other hand, the present situation could be a tragedy for the smaller Eastern European countries. They don't have the money to pay the present world market price for oil.'' 
The Soviet Union, which produces 12 million barrels of oil a day - twice as much as Saudi Arabia and a sixth of world output - exports 20 percent of it. Half goes to the West and the rest to Eastern Europe. Czechoslovakia gets 98 percent of its oil from the Soviet Union, and Poland 93 percent.
The Soviet Union earned about $20 billion in hard currency from oil exports last year - 40 percent of its hard-currency earnings.
It is not clear how large the boon to the Soviet Union will be. Kommersant, a Moscow-based business newspaper, estimated this week that the jump in oil prices from $16 a barrel before the Iraqi invasion to almost $26 a barrel could increase Soviet hard-currency revenues by $750 million by the end of the year.
But Gary N. Ross, president of consulting services at the New York-based Petroleum Industry Research Associates, said the windfall for the Russians could be even greater. Since they export 1.3 million barrels a day to the West, the price rise could mean $13 million additional a day, or almost $400 million extra a month.
 
New System in the East
For Eastern European countries the story is different, because on Jan. 1 these former Soviet satellites are to begin paying for their Soviet oil in hard currency, and with the price pegged to world market rates. This will replace the system under which Moscow allowed Soviet bloc members to buy oil at below-market prices.
''The Soviet Union was going to gain something from this, and now they are going to gain even more,'' said Joseph P. Tragert, an economist with PlanEcon, a Washington-based consulting group.
Eastern European officials say they would have had trouble buying oil at $16 a barrel, let alone at $27. ''This will be our oil shock, and we will have to absorb it 100 percent,'' said Mr. Lang, the Hungarian economist who noted that the Communist world had sought, with some success, to insulate itself from the 1970's oil shocks.
Petroleum industry experts say that despite the higher prices, the Soviet Union will not be able to increase production quickly enough to help offset the worldwide shortages of four million barrels a day caused by the international boycott of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Indeed, the Soviet Union has been struggling to prevent a further decline in production, down about 5 percent this year after dropping 3 percent last year.
 
'Seems to Be Some Unrest'
''Even if they wanted to increase production, they couldn't do so,'' said Coby van der Linde, an expert on Soviet oil at the Oxford Institute for Energy Research in Britain. ''There is a shortage of oilfield equipment. These seems to be some unrest in the oilfields. The fields are not well maintained and many are getting old.''
Oil analysts say the Soviet Union has reduced investment in the oil industry, which long absorbed 40 percent of the nation's industrial investment.
''They cannot change their investment policy within one or two weeks,'' said Ulrich Weissenburger, an expert on the Soviet economy at the German Institute for the Economy in West Berlin. ''Maybe if higher prices remain for a long period they will change their policy. But the priority of Soviet officials right now is to improve the situation in consumer goods.''
The key to future Soviet oil development, many industry officials say, is Western cooperation. Elf-Aquitaine, France's largest oil company, has agreed to explore for oil on a 13,500-square-mile site north of the Caspian Sea. Elf would obtain a percentage, now being negotiated, of any oil produced. The Chevron Corporation is talking with Soviet officials about developing a large field in western Kazakhstan.
 
Disputes Over Control
''The potential in the Soviet Union, especially in Russia, is huge,'' said Mari Buglass, a senior oil analyst with Shearson Lehman in London. But she said that Western companies were hesitant to push ahead with cooperative deals there because so much was uncertain in that country. For example, Boris Yeltsin, president of the Russian Republic, says his republic controls its own oil resources, while President Mikhail S. Gorbachev likes to think they are controlled by the nation.
''Western oil companies want to know whether they will earn their money back and whom they will be dealing with,'' said Ms. Buglass. ''That's the only thing holding Western companies back.''
Because Soviet oil output is down and because the country is desperate for hard currency, Moscow last month suddenly cut back oil shipments to Hungary and Czechoskovakia by 13 percent. It diverted some of that oil to the West. This has forced these two countries to buy oil at world market prices, with Hungary agreeing to buy about two million barrels from Algeria and Libya, using a long-closed pipeline to the Adriatic. Poland agreed to buy seven million barrels from Iraq.
 
Rise in Inflation Feared
The Soviet cutback has caused Czechoslovakia to raise gasoline prices by 50 percent and has crippled the nation's chemical industry. Jan Klacek, an economist with the Czechoslovak Academy of Sciences, estimates that buying oil at world prices would increase inflation in his nation by more than 5 percent, and he said it could cause a decline in industrial production of up to 2 percent.
''This could knock the already-weak economies of Eastern Europe into a tailspin,'' said Robert Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman, Sachs and a former Assistant Secretary of State. ''They are the biggest losers from this.''
The big question for cash-strapped Eastern European nations is where they will obtain the hard currency to buy the more expensive oil. Many economists say that because Poland and Hungary have the region's worst debt problems they will be hardest hit.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
How Hussein Miscalculated

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
The crisis in the Persian Gulf struck at a time when demand for oil was weakening and prices sagging. In fact, Saddam Hussein's decision to gobble up Kuwait was driven by his need to shore up Iraq's failing economy, undermined by the long war with Iran. So he has put his unemployed, million-man army back to work, both to grab his neighbor's oilfields and refineries and also to panic the world oil market into a steep run-up in price. The rising inflow of foreign money, he calculated, would strengthen his bid for dominance of the Arab world.
But he miscalculated. The shock of his invasion of Kuwait did kick off panic buying that sent the price of crude soaring above $28 a barrel - but only days later that panic buying stopped and prices fell back. The price of North Sea oil for September delivery fell $1.75, to $24.75 a barrel, on Wednesday. On the New York Mercantile Exchange that day West Texas crude for delivery in September dropped $2.35, to $25.96 a barrel. 
One reason for the easing of panic buying is that when Iraq invaded Kuwait last week oil inventories were high. And unlike oil crises in 1973 and 1979, motorists have not rushed into lines to ''top out'' fuel tanks. Instead, they have complained about ''price gouging'' by the oil companies. The White House called on the companies for restraint, and they are indicating they will cooperate.
Another reason why panic buying quickly exhausted itself this time was the realization that there is plenty of spare oil-production capacity, in Mexico and elsewhere in Latin America, in Africa, the North Sea and in Saudi Arabia and the gulf.
The other oil producers, however, are not rushing to expand output. Venezuela, according to Prof. M. A. Adelman of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a leading authority on the world oil market, has spare capacity of 600,000 to 700,000 barrels a day; President Carlos Andres Perez said Venezuela could increase its output by up to 500,000 a day but wanted to do it in concert with other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
Other members of OPEC could readily expand output to make up for all of the blocked Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil. Spare OPEC capacity is estimated at 3.3 million to 3.7 million barrels a day. But the Saudis and other OPEC members appear to prefer to raise output only enough to make up for part of the cut-off oil, to ''ratchet up'' oil prices to the mid $20's range. And in exchange for their cooperation, the Saudis and others are likely to seek benefits from the United States.
The United States could bring greater pressure on other oil producers by drawing down some of the 575,000 barrels in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but seems reluctant to do so. Some Administration officials have been talking of the importance of maintaining ''free markets'' and avoiding 1970's-style price controls.
To check Mr. Hussein's aggression, however, the Administration is leaning hard on its allies to cut off Iraq's oil shipments. Turkey, a NATO member, has shut the pipeline that carries oil from Iraq to the Mediterranean port of Yumurtalik. But Turkey wants to be paid $2 billion to make up for the losses it says are involved. Even without the closing of that pipeline or the one that runs through Saudi Arabia to Yanbu on the Red Sea, just a small number of United States naval vessels can seal off Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil shipments.
Indeed, Iraq's oil exports have effectively been shut off already. No tankers are loading at any of their three ports. And tanker rates have fallen sharply as owners have stopped sending ships to the gulf, following the United Nations resolution to impose sanctions against Iraq. Saddam Hussein miscalculated in underestimating the reaction against him in the U.N. and the solidifying effect of United States-Soviet cooperation with the end of the cold war. Japanese support for the oil embargo was another breakthrough.
But, except for Britain, the United States has thus far been left by its NATO allies to carry the military burden in Saudi Arabia, reducing the likelihood of a pull-back by Mr. Hussein. He has declared that Iraq cannot suffer the ''humiliation'' of a withdrawal. Nevertheless, if the Iraqi dictator cannot ship his oil out, his country's feeble economy will suffer a crushing blow and he could become a victim of his own army.
The oil shock of 1990 is shaping up as far less damaging to the West than the shocks of the 70's, and it will stay so if the United States gets the support it needs from its allies.
With the American economy growing sluggishly and world demand for oil soft, the inflationary impact is far less ominous than it was in the early or late 1970's. There is now no need for Federal Reserve monetary tightening - and good reason to avoid it, lest the economy be toppled into recession.
A deal with Congress to reduce the budget deficit, which President Bush still insists he wants, would enable the Fed to move interest rates down and keep the economy moving forward. This, as the President stresses, would also provide the United States with the additional resources it needs in this time of acute international tensions.

A Turnaround Manager To Head Jos. A. Bank

 BODY:
Timothy F. Finley, a turnaround manager, has been named president and chief executive of Jos. A. Bank Clothiers Inc., which operates 40 retail clothing stores throughout the United States and is known for its American-made men's suits.
Mr. Finley, 47, formed the Finley Group in 1985 to provide management to troubled companies. His main responsibilities at Jos. A. Bank will be to cut its debt from a leveraged buyout that was financed by Drexel Burnham Lambert in 1988. The company, based in Baltimore, went private in the buyout. 
Jos. A. Bank, which he called a ''middle-priced Brooks Brothers,'' has a substantial mail-order catalogue sales operation. It plans to expand in the Northeast, where it has stores in Stamford, Conn., and Summit, N.J., but none in New York.
Mr. Finley described himself as ''a rather unstructured, fancy-free kind of guy who's not great at running a company in the long term.''
Eight associates share the management responsibilities of the Finley Group. Mr. Finley's average stay at a company is one to two years.
Mr. Finley has been president for two years of Baddour Inc., a 200-store chain in Memphis that operates under the name Freds Super Discount Store. It had $250 million in revenues last year.
He was chief operating officer of Castleberry Foods, a family-owned canned-meat company based in Augusta, Ga., from 1986 to 1988. Mr. Finley was an executive vice president of Cannon Mills, a leading towel maker based in Kannapolis, N.C., from 1981 to 1985.

HEADLINE: Dow, Rising For 2d Day, Ends Up 24.01

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks advanced yesterday for the second consecutive session, with the Dow Jones industrial average climbing 24.01 points to 2,758.91. Favorable results of the Treasury's 30-year bond auction produced a late rally after stocks had drifted in light trading most of the day.
Investors remain cautious, and most refrained from making any sizable commitments. Uncertainty over developments in the bond market, concern over an already-weak economy and fear that news from the Middle East could again send oil prices up, cast a pall over the market most of the day. 
Late in the session prices of long-term Treasury securities rebounded strongly after the Government completed its record $32.25 billion quarterly refunding with the successful auction of $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds at an average yield of 8.87 percent, compared with 8.84 percent at the last refunding on May 11.
That provided the impetus for yesterday's rally in equities, sending the Dow up as much as 30 points late in the day. Having fallen 893.41 points yesterday, the Nikkei stock index in Tokyo continued to drop today, showing a decline of 286.18 points, or 1.04 percent, to 27,329.55, the lowest close of 1990. During today's session the index fell as low as 27,168.23, an intra-day low for the year, Volume Edges Up The ratio between advances and declines on the New York Stock Exchange was fairly close yesterday, with a slight edge to decliners. Volume for the day was 155.8 million. The S.& P. 500-stock index was up 1.59 points, to 339.94. The Nasdaq index of over-the-counter issues rose 5.25 points, to 412.98. The American Stock Exchange index rose 1.46, to 341.49 Traders yesterday were not only focused on Middle Eastern developments, but were also awaiting results of the Treasury's refunding. The long bond is the measure by which most long-term interest rates are set. And with the poor auctions of three- and 10-year notes already behind, there was apprehension over the auction.
William M. LeFevre, senior vice president of market strategy for Advest Inc. of Hartford said the ability to sell the new 30-year Treasury bond yesterday after poor results from the notes' auctions stabilized the bond market and opened the road for the Federal Reserve Bank to ease short-term maturities.
According to Birinyi Associates Inc, which tracks program trading, there were only three buy progams yesterday. They occurred between 1 P.M. and 3:07 P.M. when the Dow rose 27.97 points. That was about the time results of the Treasury's bond auction were becoming known.
While few traders were willing to risk a run in the market yesterday after what has thus far been a volatile week, many stocks drew investor interest. The stock of Continenal Airlines Holdings rose by 1 3/4, to close at 6 1/4, on news that Frank Lorenzo was stepping down as chairman and that the Scandinavian Airlines Systems would be increasing its stake in Continental to 16.8 percent.
 
Disney Advances
The Walt Disney Company , rose 1 3/4, to 109 3/4. Disney stock, like other entertainment shares, was hurt by the recent rise in oil prices, which many thought would hurt attendance at leisure activities, but oil prices have since backed off. Disney's publishing divison is starting a new magazine for children in October. CBS Inc., another entertainment stock, rose 2 3/4, to 178 3/4.
Shares of MBIA Inc., an insurer of municipal bonds, rose 7/8, to 38 7/8 after reporting higher second-quarter and six-month earnings.
Sears, Roebuck & Company saw its stock rise 7/8, to 30 1/2, after its chairman, Edward A. Brennan, reasserted control over the merchandising group this week. Market speculation is that the move may be an admission by the company that its current approach to retailing is not working.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Long-Term Securities Rebound

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury securities rebounded strongly yesterday after the Government's successful auction of $10.25 billion of 30-year bonds, the last of its record $32.25 billion quarterly refunding sales this week.
The unexpectedly good reception accorded the new benchmark long bonds contrasted sharply with the lack of investor interest in the three- and 10-year notes auctioned on Tuesday and Wednesday. The bond auction was a success, dealers said, because the recent surge in oil prices caused by the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait had sharply eroded the prices of longer-term securities, which are normally more vulnerable to inflation than shorter issues. The resultant rise in yield on the longer issues stimulated investor interest. 
But the successful distribution of the bonds to retail investors was not without cost to the Treasury. The average yield on the 8.75 percent bonds was 8.87 percent, compared with 8.84 percent at the last refunding on May 11. Still, interest rates were substantially higher a year ago, with the bonds auctioned on May 11, 1989, yielding 9.11 percent.
Given the higher yield and the 8.75 percent coupon, the new bonds in effect sold for $9,874.70 for each of the $10,000 units.
No sooner did the Treasury report the auction results at 2:30 P.M., Eastern daylight time, than prices of most Government securities moved up, led by the longer maturities. Similarly, the stock market, which had also been marking time awaiting the auction results, began to rise.
 
Late Surge in Prices
The outstanding long bonds, for example, were slightly higher in price before the auction results were announced and then began to rise sharply. Late in the session, the old benchmark long bonds, which also carry a 8.75 percent coupon, were being offered at 99 28/32, up 21/32 on the day, as the yield fell to 8.76 percent from 8.82 percent the day before.
Meanwhile, the $10.5 billion of new long notes that were auctioned Wednesday at an average yield of 8.77 percent were still trading on a when-issued basis but at a yield of 8.64 percent. The $11.5 billion in three-year notes sold Tuesday at an average yield of 8.10 percent were trading at a yield of 8.09 percent.
''The auction of the new long bonds was as good as the other two sales were terrible,'' said Ward McCarthy, partner in Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, Princeton, N. J. ''In part, the market's response to the auction was in effect a sigh of relief that the quarterly refunding sales were over, given the beating the long end of the market has taken since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait a week ago.''
A large amount of the three-year notes from Tuesday's auction and a smaller but still sizable amount of the 10-year notes sold Wednesday were still on the shelves yesterday of the dealers who absorbed the bulk of the sale.
The sales of shorter issues had been affected largely by the climate of fear caused by the Middle East crisis, dealers said, and while the climate has not changed significantly, although oil prices have eased somewhat, the higher yields on the long issue attracted buyers. Mr. McCarthy said domestic and foreign investors had placed sizable orders for the 30-year bonds.
''We can't at this time confirm the rumors about the strong Japanese interest in the long bonds,'' he continued, ''but with yields near the 9 percent level, it would not take much to attract buyers from whatever source.''
 
Lack of Retail Interest
Robert A. Brusca, chief economist at Nikko Securities International, said that ''despite the lack of retail interest in the 10-year notes at the auction, once their prices fell and yields rose in the secondary market the buyers materialized.
''But, surprisingly,'' he said, ''the usually popular three-year notes remain somewhat of a sticky issue.''
One reason for the good reception for the new long bonds, Mr. Brusca said, was that the surge in oil prices set off by the Iraqi invasion caused investors to flee earlier this week from the longer Treasury maturities. But, he said, ''when the statistics of the auction, namely, the 'tail' was broadcast, the buyers came rushing back in.''
The auction tail, the spread between the low bid, 8.86 percent, and the average, 8.87 percent, was quite normal. By contrast, the tail on the sale of the 10-year notes was 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point and the widest since May 1980.
Another sign of the success of the sale was that the Treasury only had to accept 13 percent of the low bids. Still another was that almost $26 billion in bids were received for the $10.25 billion issue.
Also yesterday, the Treasury auctioned $10 billion of 36-day cash management bills sold in units of $1 million. The bills went at an average discount rate of 7.79 percent, a basis point between the highest and lowest bids. Roughly 21 percent of the low bids were accepted.
Discount rates on Treasury bills were narrowly mixed yesterday. The rate on the 90-day bills rose 3 basis points, at 7.29 percent, and the one-year bills slipped 2 basis points, to 7.19 percent.
The Federal Reserve once again added $2.5 billion of reserves to the banking system to meet seasonal and other technical needs. Dealers said the Fed's piecemeal additions of reserves this week was probably aimed at avoiding any misinterpretation that its actions represented an easing of credit or policy change. In any event, the Federal funds rate that banks charge each other for overnight loans was a bit tight at 8 1/16 percent before and after the Fed's midday intervention.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction of new 30-year bonds:

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Mixed in the U.S., Lower Abroad; Gold Gains

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar turned in a mixed performance in United States trading yesterday after moving mostly lower in earlier dealings abroad. Gold prices gained. Interest in the dollar as a safe investment haven waned in the absence of fresh Middle East hostility, currency dealers said. 
Earlier this week, as outcry over Iraq's occupation of Kuwait intensified, investors scrambled to buy dollars. Investors typically turn to dollars in times of political and economic uncertainty.
 
Oil Prices Retreat
A retreat in oil prices from the lofty levels reached earlier this week also paved the way for an end to the dollar-buying binge. World oil transactions are conducted in dollars, and a rapid run-up in petroleum prices had increased demand for dollars. But on Thursday oil prices fell in the United States for a second straight session.
The dollar also was weighed down by concerns about the economy's health in the United States. There has been widespread speculation that the Federal Reserve will soon try to revive the faltering economy by pushing down interest rates. Lower rates would reduce returns on dollar-denominated investments and tend to curb demand for dollars.
In Tokyo, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell to 149.68 Japanese yen at the close, from 150.00 Wednesday. Later in London, it rose to 149.80. In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 149.81, down from 149.90 late Wednesday.
The dollar strengthened against the British pound in New York trading after weakening in London. A pound fetched $1.8680 late in New York, compared with $1.86885 late Wednesday. In London, the pound rose to $1.8720, from $1.8660 late Wednesday.
 
Other Late Rates in New York
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.5965 German marks, up from 1.5920; 1.3435 Swiss francs, down from 1.3380; 5.3510 French francs, down from 5.3365; 1,168.50 Italian lire, up from 1,165.00, and 1.14695 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14785.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery settled at $385.80 an ounce, up $2.60 from Wednesday's settlement. Later, the Republic National Bank of New York quoted gold at $385.60, $2.90 higher than Wednesday's late bid.
Gold rose in London to $385.25 an ounce, from $382.25 late Wednesday. In Zurich, the price rose to $385.00, up from $384.35 late Wednesday. Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold rose $1.52 an ounce to $384.17.

HEADLINE: Net Up 24.6% At Wal-Mart

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark., Aug. 9

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. reported today that it had a 24.6 percent gain in its second-quarter profit as revenue also increased by the same rate.
The fast-growing discounter, based in Bentonville, Ark., earned $272.9 million, or 24 cents a share, in the three months ended July 31, compared with $219 million, or 19 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue grew to $7.6 billion from $6.1 billion in the period.
David Glass, the company's president and chief executive, credited the company's merchandising strategy for producing the profit improvement. But he said that forecasts for the second half of the year ''are characterized by anticipated economic uncertainty.''
Wal-Mart has bucked the slowing trend in the retail industry this year and has consistently outperformed its competitors. The discounter might pass Sears, Roebuck & Company and the K Mart Corporation this year in annual sales volume, industry analysts say. Sears and K Mart are the nation's first- and second-ranking retailers, respectively.
Wal-Mart opened two new distribution centers and completed a third during the second quarter, resulting in an addition of more than three million square feet of distribution space. It also opened 18 Wal-Mart stores and 4 Sam's Wholesale Clubs.
Wal-Mart's stock rose 37.5 cents today, to $30.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF
ARAB VOTE TO SEND TROOPS TO HELP SAUDIS; BOYCOTT OF IRAQI OIL IS REPORTED NEAR 100%;
Baghdad Isolated

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Arab countries moved tonight to confront Iraq's thrust into Kuwait by voting to send troops to Saudi Arabia, with only Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization openly backing the isolated Iraqis in the crucial decision.
It was unclear tonight which Arab countries would actually send soldiers in response to a resolution pressed by Egypt and Saudi Arabia at the hastily called meeting. It calls for the Arab states to answer appeals by Saudi Arabia and other Persian Gulf states for Arab soldiers to help defend against a possible invasion by Baghdad.
When the forces would be sent was also unclear, and no numbers on troops were offered, although it was expected that Egypt would take the leading role, probably supported by Morocco.
 
Only 12 of 21 in Favor
Twelve of the 21 members of the Arab League voted in support of the seven-point resolution. 
''We have decided to respond to the request by Saudi Arabia and other gulf states to deploy Arab forces to support the armed forces there to defend its lands and its regional security against any foreign attack,'' the resolution stated. It did not specify whether the Arab troops would officially join a multinational force or stand apart.
King Hussein of Jordan, perhaps under the greatest conflicting pressures, took an equivocal position, voting to approve the resolution ''with reservations.''
In apparent anticipation of the vote, President Saddam Hussein of Iraq broadcast his point of view on the airwaves this evening as the Arab League met in a tense, closed session. He issued an emotional call for the Arab masses to rise against foreign intervention and the ''humiliation'' of Muslim shrines in Saudi Arabia.
 
Calls for 'Holy War'
Urging a ''holy war,'' President Hussein said in the statement, ''Your brothers in Iraq are determined to continue jihad without any hesitation or retreat and without any fear from the foreigner's power.'' [Excerpts, page 4.] The Arab League vote was a victory for backstage American diplomacy, intensified by Defense Secretary Dick Cheney's visits early this week with Arab leaders, to achieve what is called here an ''Arab face'' to lend legitimacy to the deployment of American troops in the Saudi kingdom.
There were large demonstrations in Jordan and Yemen today supporting Iraq and opposing the American presence. Mr. Hussein's efforts to set poor, frustrated Arabs against the rich, and invoke the specter of foreign and particularly American intervention, could have potent emotional appeal in squalid city slums and Palestinian refugee quarters.
Although Mr. Hussein's Baathist Party ideology is avowedly secular -its first Arab nationalist theorist was a Christian in Lebanon - his statement was a visceral appeal to Muslim feelings, invoking the specter of ''infidels'' defiling Islam's holiest sites in Mecca and Medina, now under the control of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia.
''O Arabs, O Muslims and faithful everywhere, this is your day to rise and defend Mecca, which is captured by the spears of the Americans and the Zionists,'' said the Iraqi President's statement, which was read by an announcer and heard on the radio throughout much of the Arab world. ''Revolt against oppression, corruption, treachery and back-stabbing.
''Keep the foreigner away from your holy shrines,'' the proclamation urged, ''so we will all stand as one to expel darkness and expose those rulers who know no sense of honor.''
''Tell the infidels there is no place for them in the lands of the Arabs after they squandered the people's rights and humiliated their dignity and honor,'' Mr. Hussein said. The wording of the Arab League resolution adopted tonight - to support Kuwait's ''efforts to liberate its land'' - raised the possibility of military action, possibly with the United States being drawn in, to reverse Iraq's takeover of its tiny, oil-rich neighbor and former ally. The measure did not make it clear whether or how the Arab force would coordinate action with the United States military.
 
Turning Point in Arab History
The emergency meeting's outcome was a kind of watershed in modern Arab history, ripping aside the slogans of Arab brotherhood that had served to veil differences. It took place in a closed session so emotionally charged that the Iraqis threw plates of food at the Kuwaitis at the official luncheon, and the Kuwaiti Foreign Minister fainted during the debate, according to reports that seeped out.
The vote essentially pitted pro-Western states, particularly those rich in oil, against the radicals. In favor were Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain, all oil states, along with Egypt, Morocco, Somalia, Lebanon, Djibouti and Iraq's longtime rival, Syria.
Sudan and Mauritania joined Jordan in voting to approve the resolution ''with reservations.'' Tunisia was the only country in the league that did not attend. Algeria and Yemen abstained, and Iraq, the P.L.O. and Libya voted against the measure.
The seven-point resolution was drawn up largely by Egypt but presented in the name of the Gulf Cooperation Council, which groups Saudi Arabia and five lesser oil states, including Kuwait. The measure repeatedly condemned Iraq for its Aug. 2 takeover of Kuwait and for what it called ''threats to gulf states'' and ''massing troops'' on Saudi Arabia's borders.
The resolution also called for the withdrawal of Iraqi troops and the restoration of the Kuwaiti Government, and endorsed the United Nations economic boycott and embargo of Iraq.
Iraq's quick response was a statement by its press agency that the Arab meeting had ''implemented America's will.''
 
A Victory for Egypt
The outcome of the meeting was a triumph for President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who sought to rally consensus by warning that the Arabs must act together or face foreign intervention over which they had no influence. Most such Arab meetings in the past have ended in a stalemate.
In an opening speech, Mr. Mubarak said, ''The options before us are clear: an Arab action to protect the higher interest of the Arab nation, preserving Iraq and Kuwait, or foreign intervention that we will have no say or control over.''
As the meeting began, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Tariq Aziz, called the proposals being circulated ''an American solution being given on Arab cover.''
Speaking for the grim-faced Iraqi delegation, Mr. Aziz told reporters: ''We're not coming here to discuss any Arab business under the threat of American forces and intimidation. If the Americans leave the region to its people, we are ready to discuss any questions.
''If you want to find an Arab solution to the problem, there should be an Arab atmosphere around you,'' he added in pointed reference to Mr. Mubarak's statements. ''No solution can be found with the Americans around you.''
 
GORBACHEV URGES SETTLEMENT
MOSCOW, Aug. 10 (Special to the New York Times) In his first public statement since the Aug. 2 invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev today called on Arab leaders to ''begin active work to settle the conflict.''
''We are doing everything possible to reverse the course of events and put out the fire in the region, which is vital to many states,'' Mr. Gorbachev wrote in a letter to President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, according to the Soviet press agency Tass.
''I believe that efforts by Arab countries could play a major role in this common cause. Perhaps it is the most preferable path to take.''
Mr. Gorbachev, who has been away from Moscow on vacation, warned that the crisis in the Persian Gulf was taking on ''an extremely dangerous and increasingly unpredictable character.'' He compared the growing momentum of the crisis to a ''stone, falling from a rocky cliff.''
The Soviet President defended Moscow's condemnation of Baghdad's actions. ''There is nothing anti-Iraqi in it,'' the letter said. ''On the contrary, we strived to help Iraq find a way out of the situation it found itself in with minimum losses.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF
ARABS VOTE TO SEND TROOPS TO HELP SAUDIS; BOYCOTT OF IRAQI OIL IS REPORTED NEAR 100%;
No Shipments Seen

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The international embargo of oil shipments from Iraq and Kuwait has choked off nearly all petroleum exports from those two countries, oil company executives and industry analysts said today.
The United Nations' economic sanctions, imposed on Baghdad on Monday for its invasion of Kuwait, have meant that no ships are showing up to be filled from the pipelines carrying crude oil from Iraq to Saudi Arabia and Turkey, oil executives in the Middle East and London said. One London oil official described the boycott as ''near 100 percent cutoff.''
 
'No Vessels' to Load
''It would appear no vessels are proceeding to ports'' in Kuwait and Iraq, said Norman Hooke, a shipping analyst at Lloyds Maritime Information Services, an arm of the Lloyds of London insurance market. 
With the embargo proving effective, other large oil exporters are rushing to increase their sales to the oil-consuming nations, especially Japan, that had been steady buyers of Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil.
In New York today, the price of the benchmark American crude-oil grade, West Texas Intermediate, closed at $26.23 a barrel, up 56 cents for the day. The price has risen 30 percent since Iraq invaded Kuwait on Aug. 2, and 50 percent since mid-July.
 
Iran Moves First
Iran has been the first producer to make up for the shortfall created by the boycott of Iraq, selling millions of barrels of oil in the last few days from floating storage tankers at sea, oil industry officials said today in telephone interviews. Other leading exporters, notably Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, have notified their Western customers that they will be increasing production and selling far more oil.
The industry officials from several companies said Iran might have sold 10 million to 26 million barrels in the last five days to Japanese and other Asian customers. Those extraordinary sales from Iran's storage tanks, ranging from two million to more than five million barrels a day, represent a doubling or trebling of Teheran's typical sales in the world market.
The added Iranian sales counter a large part of the supplies lost because of the halt in oil shipments from Kuwait and Iraq. Those two nations had been selling about four million barrels a day in the world market.
''Iran is benefiting,'' said Peter Gign, manager of the international petroleum trading desk of Shearson Lehman Brothers in London. ''And the Iranian sales have comforted refiners for the moment, and thus consumers temporarily, in this time of crisis.'' Iran's sales help to explain, in part, the drop in oil prices on world markets on Wednesday and Thursday.
 
Wartime Storage
Iran has sold oil from the estimated 30 million to 40 million barrels of stocks it had stored in tankers as a security measure during its eight-year war with Iraq, which ended in 1988.
Iran cannot sustain such sales. Oil industry analysts estimate that Teheran can increase its output of three million barrels a day by a few hundred thousand.
Yet the Iranian move is bound to put pressure on other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries that have additional production capacity, notably Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Venezuela, to produce more oil to satisfy world demand. Saudi Arabia can increase its current production by more than two million barrels a day, Venezuela by about 500,000 barrels a day, and the emirates by nearly 300,000.
American officials said that both Saudi Arabia and Venezuela had assured the United States that they would raise production to make up for the shortage. Oil industry sources said the Iranian move will insure that Middle East producers like Saudi Arabia and the emirates would want to make provisions to protect their market share in Asia and not let Iran take the whole share of Kuwait and Iraq in those markets for itself.
 
OPEC Accord Discarded
OPEC industry sources said the last agreement signed in Geneva by the cartel is no longer an obstacle, as most of its provisions had become, for all practical purposes, null and void.
Among other things, the July accord stipulated that the price of oil would be set at $21 a barrel. The actual price of OPEC oil now hovers closer to $24 a barrel, on average. The accord also said OPEC would limit its production to 22.5 million barrels a day. Without exports from Iraq and Kuwait, actual OPEC output stands at about 18 million barrels a day, far below what the world needs from OPEC.
Saudi Arabia and Venezuela have been pressuring Sadek Boussena, the president of OPEC and the oil minister of Algeria, to give them ''an OPEC umbrella,'' in the words of a senior official of the organization, that would allow them to raise their output without being criticized by members who favor higher oil prices.
Venezuela's energy ministry told the Associated Press today that it had not ordered the state-owned oil industry to raise its output, but that it could issue a new order later, ''depending on OPEC agreements.''
Yet even the added sales of Saudi Arabia and other OPEC members will not completely make up for the Kuwaiti and Iraqi production, most industry analysts said.
They expect Western countries will eventually have to tap their strategic reserves of petroleum.
Various oil experts also expect that the 21 members of the International Energy Agency based in Paris will move to use their strategic oil reserves as prices in the oil market approach the cost of pulling oil out of underground storage.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Says Its Troops in the Gulf Could Reach 100,000 in Months

BYLINE: By R.W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Pentagon officials said today that the American force mobilized to defend Saudi Arabia against possible Iraqi attack could reach 100,000 in a matter of months, and President Bush warned Baghdad not to try to ship oil through an undeclared allied naval blockade.
The White House hailed the decision of Arab nations to send troops to Saudi Arabia and to join in the worldwide economic quarantine of Iraq.
Two days ago, military officials suggested 50,000 as the upper limit for the ground force being assembled in Saudi Arabia unless fighting broke out.
With positions on both sides evidently hardening into long-term confrontation and hostility, Canada, France and Australia announced that they were sending ships to join American and British vessels in the waters of the Middle East.
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One on his way to Maine, Mr. Bush avoided using the word ''blockade,'' apparently because questions of leadership need to be worked out, as well as legal problems. But he made it clear that any Iraqi ships trying to do business as usual would be challenged. 
 
A Test of Wills
Suggesting that the United States and its allies face not so much a test of arms with President Saddam Hussein of Iraq as a test of wills, Mr. Bush said there was no sign that the Iraqis ''would be foolish enough to cross that border'' from Kuwait into Saudi Arabia. And Foreign Minister Tariq Aziz of Iraq vowed that his country would stay in Kuwait despite the economic and military pressures the rest of the world could muster against it.
 
NATO Ground Forces Expected
An American official traveling from Brussels to Washington on the plane carrying Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said some members of the NATO alliance would also send ground forces to the Persian Gulf region, in addition to ships and planes. The broad international response to American pleas for help constituted a victory for the Administration, which had feared trouble if United States troops and ships seemed alone.
There was no progress, however, on efforts by American diplomats to win Baghdad's permission for 3,500 United States citizens trapped in Iraq and Kuwait to leave. Indeed, President Hussein responded defiantly to his increasing economic isolation and military vulnerability, calling on Arabs everywhere to rise up in a holy war, overthrow the Saudi royal family and drive Western powers out of the region. His bellicose words deepened fears in Washington that he plans to use the Americans and other foreigners, all de facto hostages for more than a week, as diplomatic pawns. A majority of the members of the Arab League voted at a conference in Cairo to send troops to Saudi Arabia and to support economic sanctions. It was not immediately clear which countries would do so, although Egypt, Morocco and Syria were widely mentioned, and it was not known whether they would form part of a multinational force or stand apart as a separate Arab contingent.
''I do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent,'' Mr. Bush told Congress in a message this morning. But the seriousness with which the Administration regards the prospect of eventual combat in the Persian Gulf was underlined by its plans to send a pair of 1,000-bed hospital ships to the area in the next few days.
Mr. Baker said there were indications that Iraq was moving military units up to its border with Turkey and pouring more forces into occupied Kuwait, where there are already at least 138,000 Iraqi troops.
 
'Backed Into a Corner'
''He's backed into a corner,'' Mr. Bush said of President Hussein as he flew to his home in Kennebunkport, Me. ''He's been isolated by the rest of the world. Nobody supports him.''
He dismissed the Iraqi dictator's calls for a holy war as ''a rather frantic ploy'' that ''won't work.''
''I am pleased the way our allies are coming through,'' the President added. ''The troubling thing is that we're up against a man who is known for his brutality and irrationality and who has taken a step that, though widely condemned, has still not been reversed.''
Speaking after a closed-door session of NATO foreign ministers in Brussels where he appealed for help, Mr. Baker said: ''We all have an interest in thwarting Iraq's menacing and unlimited ambitions. If might is to make right, then the world will be plunged into a new dark age.''
In addition to the difficulty of fulfulling his pledge to force the Iraqis out of Kuwait, Mr. Bush's most pressing concerns at the moment are the fate of the trapped Americans, including 38 held in a Baghdad hotel, and the potential for Iraqi terrorism, aides said. The State Department issued a bulletin warning against possible Iraqi terrorist attacks on American installations and individuals.
 
Blockade, but No Blockade
In what amounted to a full news conference on Air Force One, the President said that sanctions were already hurting Iraq but that they could ''be tightened even more.''
Then he in effect proclaimed a blockade while saying he was not doing so, with the words, ''I would advise Iraqi ships not to go out with oil.'' Mr. Bush declared that he would say no more ''because there are a lot of things going on right now that I don't feel like commenting on.''
In Brussels, Mr. Baker said that with ships of many nations taking part, someone would have to act as ''a traffic cop'' to avoid confusion. At the United Nations, there was disagreement as to whether a blockade had been authorized under Chapter 7 of the organization's Charter when the Security Council voted on Monday to impose economic sanctions, or whether a new vote was needed.
As for the President's plans, Mr. Bush said he would not be held hostage in the White House by the current crisis - an obvious allusion to Jimmy Carter's experience as President when Iran held American hostages for 444 days, releasing the final 52 only as Ronald Reagan was being inaugurated. Mr. Bush, defending his intention to take a 25-day vacation in Kennebunkport, said, ''I think the American people want to see life go on so long as they understand that their President and his top officials are on top of a troubled situation.''
 
'Peaceful Resolution' Seen
In his letter to Congressional leaders, sent in lieu of formal notification under the disputed Vietnam-era War Powers Act, Mr. Bush said: ''I do not believe involvement in hostilities is imminent; to the contrary, it is my belief that this deployment will facilitate a peaceful resolution of the crisis.''
He also pledged that ''our armed forces will remain so long as their presence is required to contribute to the security of the region'' - a period that some experts think could last for years.
The Administration continued to avoid using the word ''hostages'' to describe the Americans trapped in the Middle East. Mr. Baker explained the hesitancy by saying, ''Nothing has been asked or demanded for their freedom, so we are not calling them hostages.'' Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said, ''We are told they are being treated decently.''
Evaluating the prospects of winning freedom for the 3,500 Americans, Mr. Bush commented: ''We're not hopeless. But as we've seen with hostage situations - and I don't think this is one - sometimes it's very difficult.''
American troop strength in the region continued to increase today, with some units being transported to the peninsula in airliners chartered from Eastern Airlines and other carriers. Considerable numbers of airplanes, including C-130 transports from Pope Air Force Base, N. C., and F-16 jet fighters from Shaw Air Force Base, S. C., arrived in the last 24 hours.
Elements of the 24th Mechanized Infantry Division, based at Fort Stewart, Ga., moved by road today to the port of Savannah, the Army announced, to be loaded aboard a troopship, the Capella, for the trip to Saudi Arabia.
The Pentagon said the hospital ship Comfort, now berthed in Baltimore, and the hospital ship Mercy, docked in Oakland, Calif., were being prepared for active duty in the Persian Gulf. Both are relatively new and can accommodate battle-related surgery in air-conditioned operating theaters.
More than 35 major United States ships, including three aircraft carriers, are already in the Persian Gulf, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea, or on the way. Britain, France and the Soviet Union already have ships there as well.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION THE GULF;
House of Saud: From Mud Fort to Oil Billions

BYLINE: By ERIC PACE

 BODY:
Once again, soldiers and weapons are astir on the enormous landscape of Saudi Arabia at the behest of a single family, the House of Saud.
It was in 1902 that a princeling of the clan, then in eclipse, led spear-carrying warriors in seizing a strategic mud fort at Riyadh.
He went on to gain sway over much of Arabia, to found the modern Saudi state with the House of Saud as its royal family.
That first ruler was known as King Ibn Saud. This week his 11th son, King Fahd, likewise head of the family and chief of the state, gave permission to President Bush to send American paratroops, armor and jets to the kingdom to protect it from Iraq. 
 
Male-Dominated and Secretive
Just how that epic decision was arrived at has not been disclosed by the family, which is as secretive as it is numerous and dominated by men: even some Western scholars, when estimating its numbers, give a figure just for the men in the family of more than 5,000.
Analysts say that giving the go-ahead to President Bush was a family decision by the House of Saud, where consultation among key members is the rule.
''They don't reveal the procedures of reaching agreement,'' said George Lenczowski, a political scientist whose latest book, ''American Presidents and the Middle East,'' came out this year (published by Duke University Press). ''They would rather present to the outside world a unified front of harmony and cooperation.''
After the King, the foremost family member is Crown Prince Abdullah, who is a half-brother of Fahd and also heads the National Guard. The third-ranking family figure is Prince Sultan, a full brother of Fahd who is Minister of Defense.
Two full brothers of the monarch, Prince Nayef and Prince Salman, are Minister of the Interior and Governor of Riyadh, respectively.
 
Family and State Interwoven
And so it goes. Professor Lenczowski, a Middle East scholar who has just retired from the University of California at Berkeley, said, ''You cannot distinguish between the House of Saud and the Saudi state; they are interwoven.''
Or, as it was once put by a Middle East analyst, William B. Quandt of the Brookings Institution, ''Saudi Arabia is a family-run business.''
Business has been good. The assets that the Saudi Government has outside Saudi Arabia - not to mention those inside its borders - are widely estimated as exceeding $100 billion.
In general, ''the boundary between the Saudi state treasury and the Saudi personal coffers is rather permeable,'' another Brookings Institute Middle East expert, Yahya Sadowski, observed yesterday.
 
Protector of the Faith
There are various reasons why the House of Saud has remained in power in Saudi Arabia, while ruling dynasties in such other Islamic lands like Libya and Iran have fallen in recent decades.
Analysts say the House of Saud dominates the Saudi armed forces and also controls the civilian government, where it relies largely on nonroyal Saudi technocrats educated in the West.
In addition, the House of Saud is seen as benefiting, in an era of resurgent and militant Islam, because it does much to promote and protect that faith. King Fahd said in 1986 that he wanted Saudis to address him not as ''Your Majesty,'' but as ''Custodian of the Two Holy Places,'' Mecca and Medina.
 
Education in Western Universities
Although it clings to tradition in many ways, and Islamic educations, entirely in Arabia, were given to many of Ibn Saud's sons, the next generation of the House of Saud has made Western education more common. Princeton is the alma mater of the Foreign Minister, Prince Saud al-Faisal, who was born in Riyadh 39 years after his grandfather, Ibn Saud, seized the mud fort.
Prof. Jon E. Mandaville, a historian at Portland State University in Oregon, observed that Emir Mubarak of Kuwait, a forebear of the exiled Kuwaiti ruler, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, gave shelter to the future King Ibn Saud and his family for a time before Ibn Saud's raid on the Riyadh fort.
But in the 1920's, 30's and 40's there were repeated, though relatively minor, armed clashes between the two families and their subjects because of boundary disputes and various grudges and rivalries. ''Relations between the Saudi royal family and the ruling family in Kuwait,'' he said, ''have been reasonably cordial for the last 20 years or so.''
Saudi Arabia languished in the days before its oil became a major factor in the global economy. It had a moment in the limelight in early 1945, when Ibn Saud met with Franklin D. Roosevelt aboard a United States Navy cruiser in the Great Bitter Lake along the route of the Suez Canal. As a courtesy, the monarch had his retainers serve Arabian coffee.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION THE GULF;
A Few More Refugees Reach the Saudi Border

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. McFADDEN

 BODY:
Braving scorching August heat and other risks of the open desert in rugged all-terrain vehicles, a trickle of Americans and other foreign nationals continued yesterday to reach the relative calm of Saudi Arabia in a series of daring escapes from war-torn Kuwait.
To do so, the refugees had to leave paved roads for the trackless wastes of the Dibdibah desert, skirt border checkpoints where Iraqi troops were turning back travelers and cross hundreds of miles of rocky, barren terrain in temperatures that soared over 120 degrees.
''Three Americans arrived just 20 minutes ago,'' said Gene Heck, the commercial attache at the American Embassy in the Saudi capital, Riyadh, about 11 P.M. In a telephone interview, he called the Americans' 350-mile trip from Kuwait City ''an extraordinary effort.''
 
Driving in Desert
''They drove through the desert in an overland vehicle,'' Mr. Heck said. ''We haven't had a chance to debrief them, but I understand they work for private companies.'' He said the refugees carried food and water, but he knew nothing else about them or their crossing. 
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq closed that country's borders and those between Kuwait and Saudi Arabia on Thursday, leaving thousands of Americans and other foreigners trapped in the war zone. Western companies advised stranded employees not to risk a desert crossing, citing the risks of getting lost or caught by Iraqi troops.
It was unclear how many refugees had crossed into Saudi Arabia, although a Reuters dispatch from Dubai in the nearby United Arab Emirates quoted travelers as saying that as many as 800 private cars driven by Kuwaitis had reached al-Khafji, six miles inside Saudi Arabia.
Communication with the embattled region remained all but impossible yesterday. A few Western reporters in the area were unable to file dispatches, and only an occasional telephone call got through on clogged circuits. Some Western governments kept in touch with their embassies by radio.
 
Resistance Is Reported
Refugees reaching Saudi Arabia were quoted by Reuters as saying that gunfire could still be heard in Kuwait City, showing that pockets of resistance fighters were still harassing Iraqi occupation forces. Other refugees from Kuwait and Iraq spoke of rape, looting and violence by the invasion troops.
The Associated Press, in a dispatch from Bahrain, in the Persian Gulf, quoted travelers as saying that some Iraqi soldiers had looted banks, taken automobiles from showrooms, stolen furniture and jewelry from shops, beaten Kuwaitis and forced their way into homes to seize food and clothing.
Other travelers were quoted as saying that Iraqi soldiers were polite, even apologetic, in asking residents for food and water, and that an eerie quiet prevailed over the capital nine days after the invasion, with Iraqi troops squatting and sleeping on nearly deserted streets.
A few companies that reached their employees said Westerners in Kuwait did not appear to be in any immediate danger, although they were not being allowed to leave, and some companies were concerned about the long-term psychological effects on their employees.
 
Supplies Were Adequate
A spokesman at the British Embassy in Kuwait City said that food and water supplies were adequate and that electricity was functioning. The Baghdad radio said all Kuwaitis had been ordered to get back to work or they would lose their jobs, but travelers said that the order had been widely ignored and that many Kuwaitis were trying to flee the country.
Westerners in Iraq appeared to be safe, according to companies that were able to communicate with employees there. ''Life is quite normal in Baghdad,'' said Nils Ingvar Lundin, a spokeman for LM Ericsson, a Swedish maker of radio and telephone equipment.
Three company employees and their dependents were in the Iraqi capital, he said, and, like other Westerners, were moving about the city freely and receiving phone calls.
Westerners in Baghdad said that people anticipating shortages as a result of an international economic embargo rushed to stock up on rice, sugar, cooking oil and other foodstuffs.
In Saudi Arabia, more squadrons of United States fighter planes arrived to bolster the buildup of American combat troops, and a steady stream of chartered and commercial flights landed at Riyadh's airport, which was packed with people trying to leave the country.
But there was no sense of panic. Western companies generally asked their employees to stay on and continue working in Saudi Arabia, though most were urging that dependents be evacuated.
While American and Saudi forces were massing near the northern border with Kuwait, the streets of Riyadh were quiet yesterday, a holy day of rest in Muslim countries.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION THE GULF;
A Million Strong? Some Experts Question Iraq's Military Strength

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES

 BODY:
Iraq, with 17 million people, boasts of having a million-strong army, but some experts in the United States and abroad who have studied Iraqi demographics and intelligence reports estimated yesterday that the number of active forces may be half that amount.
''The figure of one million soldiers includes second-line soldiers, semimilitia units,'' said Mordechai M. Ababir, an Arab specialist at Hebrew University in Israel. ''Iraq's army is made up of 400,000 to 500,000 soldiers of first-line quality, and this is about the number of people you would expect to be under arms in a country of Iraq's size.''
 
Possibly Four Armies
''There are three, possibly four Iraqi armies,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, an intelligence specialist on the Persian Gulf and an aide to Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona. 
''There is the low-grade militia, that possibly exists only on paper,'' Mr. Cordesman said. ''There is the so-called popular army that has its origins in Saddam Hussein's ruling Baath Party. There is the regular Iraqi Army of perhaps 400,000, and the elite Republican Guards and other elite forces that number about 240,000.
''The Iraqis probably have a total of 600,000 to 700,000 active troops,'' he said.
While many analysts put asterisks next to the one million figure, it should be noted that every army has a large percentage of second-line troops. The one million figure is used by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, an authority on the world's armies.
It is also worth recalling that in terms of percentage of total populace under arms, Iraq's mobilization was exceeded by all the primary combatants in World War II. The comparison is apt in view of that Iraq committed everything it had for the war against Iran, and did not significantly demobilize after the battle ended in 1988.
 
Scramble for Manpower Seen
Military analysts say that if war does break out, the Iraqis will have to scramble to find the manpower to fuel their economy and their armed forces, but they note that the Iraqis did so successfully during the eight-year war with Iran.
During the conflict with Iran, with 46 million people, the Iraqis relied on an estimated two million Egyptian guest workers - about half of whom have left since the end of the hostilities - a large infusion of women into the work force, and the conscription of boys as young as 16 and men as old as 43.
''Conscription began around 17 and often lasted to the age of 26 to 32,'' Mr. Cordesman said. ''There was no fixed term of duty. People would often be called back to the front for service.''
According to 1990 statistics, Iraq has 873,000 men between 18 and 22. Men between 23 and 32 in the country total 1,313,000. #30,000 Egyptians in Army Iraq also used some foreign mercenaries, including an estimated 30,000 Egyptians, in its army during the Iranian war. ''They had quite a number of both Sudanese and Egyptians who served in some capacity with the promise of substantial sums of money and citizenship, but we don't have an exact number on this,'' Mr. Cordesman said.
Stephen Pelletiere, a research analyst for the United States Army War College in Carlisle, Pa., said: ''In the last war, they did a phenomenal mobilization job. They mobilized some 50 divisions. When the crunch came, they got up the troops.''
Mr. Pelletiere, who just completed a study on the Iraqi military, added: ''We were impressed when we did our study that a lot of the talk we had heard about Iraqis not being loyal to the regime just didn't pan out. The last two years of the war, when you would have expected a falloff in support for the regime, it didn't work that way.''
But the heavy mobilization radically transformed Iraqi society. It gave women roles that were unheard of in other Arab countries and gave them educational opportunities that had been denied to women in the past.
 
Women Gain Education
''The war changed the whole demographics of Iraqi women,'' Mr. Cordesman said. ''Women who did not have children were usually given some work, and as the war progressed women became better educated.''
''They have an educated female population, and about 25 percent of the work force is now made up of women,'' said Phebe Marr, a senior fellow at the Institute for National Strategic Studies at the National Defense University in Washington.
An estimated 120,000 Iraqis were killed or were reported missing in action in the war with Iran, and another 230,000 Iraqis were wounded, according to statistics provided by Ms. Marr. ''This represents about 4 to 5 percent of Iraq's military-age population killed and 8 to 12 percent wounded,'' she said.

HEADLINE: Philippines Uses Foreign Assistance Well

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''In One Philippine Village, All the Forces That Rend'' (The Week in Review, July 15) states that foreign assistance to Manila is ''backlogged'' and ''unspent.'' As President Bush's special representative for the multilateral assistance initiative for the Philippines, I have given high priority to finding out how well the Philippines uses foreign assistance.
In the last month I have been in touch with the Japanese Government, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. They, with the United States, subscribed $3 billion of the $3.4 billion pledged for the first year of the initiative in Tokyo a year ago. The United States pledged $1 billion over five years. Congress has appropriated $160 million in this fiscal year, and the Administration has requested $200 million for fiscal year 1991. None of the major donors have serious problems with Philippine implementation of our assistance. 
The important project agreements negotiated by the principal donor countries with the Philippine Government in the last year have received little press attention. Leading examples are the World Bank's $390 million energy-sector loan, the Japan-World Bank-Asia Development Bank's $270 million water-supply project, the Asian Bank's $80 million fisheries-sector project and Japan's $65 million Pampanga Delta project.
On July 10 and 11, Ronald Roskens, administrator of the Agency for International Development, and I joined President Corazon C. Aquino and Jesus Estanislao, Philippine Secretary of Finance, in ceremonies to begin the South Cotabato special development project in Mindanao, to which the United States has committed $115 million. This year we are also funding feasibility studies for large development projects and private-sector investment, making grants to improve natural resources management, particularly the forests, and with the Export-Import Bank, helping to finance American exports for energy, telecommunications, transportation and construction projects.
The World Bank ranks the Philippines in the top quarter of countries that utilize their foreign assistance well.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION THE GULF;
Security Council's Rare Unity May Be Threatened Over U.S. Warships in the Gulf

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS, Aug. 10

 BODY:
The United States appears to be heading for a disagreement with the other members of the United Nations Security Council over the use of naval forces to impose a blockade on Iraq and occupied Kuwait.
Diplomats say the potential split over timing and procedure threatens the unity the Council has displayed so far in its handling of the crisis, with the Soviet Union, China and most third-world members backing America's call for trade sanctions against Iraq.
In particular, it raises the danger that United States warships in the Persian Gulf could start stopping, searching and forcibly turning back tankers and other cargo vessels suspected of trading with these countries before the rest of the world community judges such military action necessary or justified. 
 
Baker Cites Resolution
The Secretary of State, James A. Baker 3d, said at a meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in Brussels today that the Bush Administration believed the Security Council's resolution declaring a global boycott of Iraq and Iraqi-occupied Kuwait gave the United States the right to forcibly prevent other countries from trading with Iraq and Kuwait.
''It is the view of some of us,'' he said, ''that we have the legal authority necessary to institute such an embargo or blockade, provided that the request comes from the legitimate Government of Kuwait.''
Article 51 of the United Nations Charter gives all countries the right of ''individual or collective self-defense'' against an aggressor, and the Security Council affirmed Kuwait's right to invoke Article 51 in the resolution it passed last week.
But other Council members take the view that while the resolution forbids trade or other financial dealings with Iraq and Kuwait, it only allows countries to send naval vessels to the gulf to monitor ship movements and report suspected violations to the special Security Council committee on compliance.
Britain's United Nations representative, Sir Crispin Tickell, told the Council on Thursday that this is London's view, and diplomats say Canada, China, Ethiopia, Finland, Ivory Coast, Malaysia, Romania, Yemen and Zaire share Britain's basic approach.
Moscow's deputy representative, Valentin V. Lozinsky, said military measures should first be discussed by the Military Staff Committee, a moribund United Nations panel that plan enforcement of Council decisions.
The countries want the Council to adopt a new resolution calling for a naval blockade before any American, British, French or other warships patroling the waters around the Arabian Peninsula uses force to stop ships trading with these countries.
Most Council members say the time is not yet ripe for the Council to pass a resolution authorizing force in the gulf. They argue that the Council should first wait to see the results of Arab diplomacy and find out whether the embargo proves effective without such naval enforcement action.
International solidarity in adhering to the boycott is showing signs of strain. Sri Lanka has said it cannot afford to stop exporting to Iraq and Kuwait, and several countries are complaining that they cannot afford the higher oil prices the embargo is causing.

HEADLINE: Weicker Balks At Ruling Out An Income Tax

BYLINE: By NICK RAVO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Lowell P. Weicker Jr., the Republican campaigning for governor as an independent, today released a detailed proposal for dealing with Connecticut's fiscal problems but continued to refuse to say whether he would seek a state income tax.
''I'll promise this state no new taxes, if this state promises me no new problems,'' Mr. Weicker said a news conference at the State Capitol.
The issue of a state income tax is probably the most fundamental question facing all four gubernatorial candidates. The Republican nominee, Representative John G. Rowland of Waterbury, has pledged not to institute such a tax. 
The convention-endorsed Democrat, Representative Bruce A. Morrison of Hamden, has said he would call for one only if it were approved in an advisory state referendum. State Representative William J. Cibes Jr. of New London, who is challenging Mr. Morrison in a primary, favors an income tax.
 
No 'Pledges We Can't Keep'
Mr. Weicker, however, has said that he would not rule one out or call for one because, at this time, it is impossible to gauge the severity of the state's future fiscal problems. ''I'm not going to be so silly as to stand before this state and make pledges we can't keep,'' he said.
In his fiscal package, Mr. Weicker, a Greenwich resident who was defeated in 1988 in a bid for a fourth term in the Senate, said the projected $200 million deficit facing the state by the end of this fiscal year next June 30 could be eliminated through the attrition of state employees and through reducing consulting fees, computer purchases and other costs.
In addition, Mr. Weicker said that over the 1991-92 fiscal year, if the current gap between spending and revenue continued it would leave the state with an added deficit of $445 million. He proposed closing it by making further personnel cuts and other, unspecified, spending reductions. ''We will cross that bridge when we come to it,'' said Mr. Weicker's press secretary, Avice A. Meehan.
To help stimulate the economy, Mr. Weicker recommended repealing the 20 percent surcharge now levied on corporate tax returns, and the utility tax on non-manufacturing businesses. He also proposed a budget every two years instead of an annual one, an independent board of economic advisers, five-year economic forecasts and 10-year bonding packages.
 
Other Campaigns Criticize Plan
Reaction to Mr. Weicker's proposals from the other campaigns was hostile. Mr. Morrison said Mr. Weicker intended to propose a state income tax in the second year of his administration.
''He has basically said he will do it,'' said Mr. Morrison, who has proposed a freeze on state spending and hiring as well as a reorganization of state government.
Mr. Rowland has said he would reduce future budget shortfalls by making $360 million in spending reductions and reducing the number of state departments to 18 or 19 from the current 26. He would also ask state employees to contribute more to their health benefit plans and revise state workers compensation agreements.
His campaign manager, John A. Mastropietro, accused Mr. Weicker of being evasive on the income tax. ''This is the man who is allegedly not afraid to speak his mind,'' he said.
Although he would not commit himself, Mr. Weicker appeared to back away from an income tax in his proposal, which relied in some parts on the state's Commission to Study the Management of State Government, also known as the Thomas Commission.
''Connecticut is not in a recession because the state lacks an income tax, nor would the imposition of an income tax bring us out of a recession,'' the proposal states. ''The time for discussing an income tax was back five or six years ago when the state was enjoying annual budget surpluses. But in the current situation, imposing an income tax would be like pouring gasoline on a fire.''
 
'A Fuzzy Wuzzy Bear'
Apart from the income tax issue, the Republican candidate for lieutenant governor, Robert G. Jaekle of Stratford, said Mr. Weicker's proposals were vague and in some cases, like employee attrition, relied on old statistical projections.
''We've finally gotten Lowell Weicker to come out of the cave,'' he said. ''But I think what we have is a fuzzy wuzzy bear.''
Mr. Cibes's campaign manager, Jonathan Pelto, said Mr. Weicker's projection for a budget shortfall for the 1991-92 fiscal year was at least $100 million too low. He also said some of Mr. Weicker's efficiencies, like reducing computer purchases, had already been adopted.
Mr. Cibes has proposed cutting the sales tax to 5 percent from the current 8 percent, with a constitutional cap; cutting the corporate tax rate to 10 percent from the current 13.5 percent; eliminating the dividends, interest and capital gains tax; repealing several smaller business services taxes, and imposing a 4 percent to 8 percent personal income tax with a $25,000 exemption for each family.
Mr. Pelto said, ''Nothing short of comprehensive tax reform will allow Connecticut's economy to rejuvenate.''
 
Weicker Leads in Poll
In the most recent poll by the University of Connecticut's Institute for Social Inquiry, Mr. Weicker led by 37 percent of those polled, with Mr. Rowland receiving 20 percent and Mr. Morrison receiving 13 percent. The poll of 500 randomly selected state residents, which was taken between July 23 and July 30, had a margin of error of plus or minus five percentage points.
In a University of Connecticut poll of the same sized sample a month earlier, before the July party conventions, Mr. Weicker had the support of 41 percent of the respondents, compared with 11 percent for Mr. Rowland and 9 percent for Mr. Morrison.
Asked about a three-way race involving Mr. Cibes, who will face Mr. Morrison in a Democratic primary on Sept. 11, Mr. Weicker had 40 percent of those polled, Mr. Rowland 22 percent and Mr. Cibes 6 percent. In a race solely against Mr. Morrison, the party's nominee, Mr. Cibes received 9 percent of the Democratic respondents' support to Mr. Morrison's 57 percent.

HEADLINE: A Threadbare Men's Wear Industry

BYLINE: By ISADORE BARMASH

 BODY:
Sales of men's clothing, which some economists view as an unorthodox indication of the nation's economic health, are in their longest and deepest slump in a decade.
Men's wear sales fell 8 percent in dollars and 6 percent in the number of sales transactions, or ''units,'' from January through May of this year, compared with the corresponding period last year, said MRCA Information Services, a research company in Stamford, Conn.
John Tugman, vice president of the information service, suggested several reasons. ''There's definitely concern about the economy,'' he said. ''There are perhaps more attractive alternatives for disposable income, such as entertainment, electronic goods, automobiles and travel. And what's missing is a fashion imperative - there's no new look that is so hot that the wardrobe has to be changed - so that purchases represent replacement business only.'' 
 
'A Sobering Attitude'
Dan Sweeney, president of Management Horizons, a management consulting firm based in Columbus, Ohio, said the downtrend ''stems from a sobering attitude created by the disasters on Wall Street, the savings and loan debacle, the leveraged buyouts that don't work and the white-collar indictments.''
The steepest buying decline is most evident among men under 35 and those over 55, according to MRCA's sampling of 11,500 American households.
The research company found that the biggest buying lag was among consumers in the next-to-lowest income category, those making $20,000 to $35,000 a year. They have spent 17 percent less on clothes so far this year than they did in the comparable period last year.
But all income categories, from those earning less than $20,000 to those making at least $50,000 a year, bought fewer clothes, measured in both dollars and units.
''It's a zero-sum game right now,'' said John Eyler, chairman and chief executive of specialty stores at the Hartmarx Corporation of Chicago, the country's largest manufacturer and retailer of men's apparel. ''It's the first serious lag in men's wear sales in a decade, and it's actually across the board in all price lines.''
Hartmarx recently reported a loss of $55 million for the second quarter of this year, with $51 million of that reflecting the cost of closing 65 of its 263 clothing stores that were unprofitable or marginal.
In the national survey, blazers and sports coats had the biggest drop, falling 36 percent in dollars and 38 percent in unit sales. Suits were down 5 percent in dollars, though they stayed even in units.
Jeans, which often led all apparel sales in the 1980's, fell 12 percent in dollar sales and 16 percent in units from January to May.
The 1990 sales decline follows erratic sales last year. For much of that year, relatively robust sales of men's clothing offset a long famine in women's apparel. Then men's wear sales suddenly weakened.
The prolonged decline in many segments of the industry and flat sales in others have prompted some economists to speculate that men generally believe that the nation will soon be in a deep recession.
Economists, merchants and demographers have long agreed that sales of men's clothing is directly affected by men's perceptions about their job security and the prospects for their companies. The experts also say that in times of uncertainty those men who are the sole breadwinners often cut back on their clothing purchases before asking other family members to do so.
In New York, Clifford Grodd, chairman of Paul Stuart, which sells expensive clothing aimed at executives, said he recently had lunch with a prominent men's clothing maker who told him, ''It's as if something turned off the faucet all around the country.''
From his own standpoint, Mr. Grodd added: ''I think that people have become overextended and very cautious about rising prices. Our own volume is running slightly ahead, but it's not an exciting business today. But with the economy in this area as choppy as it is, the last thing we need is consumer cynicism, which hurts everything.''
At Barney's New York, which has a total of eight stores in the metropolitan area and in a few other cities, Robert Pressman, executive vice president, said: ''Business is mixed. The fashion-oriented and European clothing is doing well, but traditional styles are weak. Totally, year to date, we are a little ahead.''
This year, said Fabian Linden, executive director of the consumer research center of the Conference Board, American consumers have shown less confidence in business prospects. ''In July 1989, 18.6 percent of our consumer respondents said they expected more jobs, while 13.2 percent said they expected less. This July, the ratio shifted - 14.2 percent foresaw more jobs, but 17.9 percent saw less.''
Some more-optimistic executives say the slump will reverse itself later this year or early in 1991. ''This fall should produce a better season because of stabilized fiber prices and new colorations and fabric treatment for men's suits,'' said Mr. Eyler of Hartmarx.
''Our manufacturing bookings for spring 1991 are up, too, and our Hart Schaffner & Marx suit, which averages over $500, has held up well in sales. So we see a bottoming out of this situation soon.''

HEADLINE: Gasoline Costs: A Psychological Toll

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Motorists - which is to say, almost everyone - are howling over the recent increases in gasoline prices. But with shifts in energy use in the time since the last oil shock, the public is focusing on what is most visible, but not most damaging.
The average increase in the pump price since Iraq invaded Kuwait, 16 cents, adds less than $7 a month to the cost of operating the average car, which uses about 500 gallons of gasoline a year. If the family members taking a 100-mile trip to the beach this weekend stop to calculate the additional cost for gas and oil that has resulted from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the subsequent reactions on world markets, they will find, on average, that it is less than the price of a bottle of suntan oil, or about $1.25. 
The effect is more modest now than in 1973, when gasoline prices first spiked, because average fuel economy has increased since then by 50 percent.
But economists say a 1 percent increase in the price of crude oil can cut the gross national product by a tenth of a percent or so. In recent weeks, the price of oil has risen by more than 40 percent, implying that if the increase sticks, the economy will move firmly into recession from its current level of modest growth.
This is not a new idea. In a 1983 article in the Journal of Political Economy, James D. Hamilton, an economist, wrote that oil price rises have preceded five of the six recessions since World War II.
Nevertheless, what catches the attention of America is the price of gasoline, which becomes a sort of popular version of the Dow Jones industrial average. It is a psychological landmark that is perhaps the single most important number that comes to mind when consumers think about what it costs them to live. The current furor, for example, is over an increase in costs equivalent to $6.75 on the monthly electric or phone bill.
But it is hard to imagine that meager an increase eliciting a Presidential attempt at ''jawboning'' oil companies to do their ''fair share'' in this crisis, or a request from a half-dozen state attorneys general for a Justice Department investigation into oil price increases. Yesterday, one state, Massachusetts, even promulgated emergency regulations to prevent ''gouging.''
But gasoline is different from a utility bill, or a bill at the supermarket. ''Utility bills, or bills for Brussels sprouts, are not posted on the highway, and you don't drive by them every day,'' said an executive of a large oil company yesterday, who insisted on anonymity. Every gas station posts a price and most drivers pass several of them a day.
Around the country, the public is angry, in part because of the speed with which the events were reflected at the pump. ''I can't believe Iraq invading Kuwait has anything to do with gas that's already in the tank,'' said Roger Spratt of Davenport, Iowa, who was visiting Six Flags Over Mid-America, an amusement park outside St. Louis, this week. Way 'to Hose the Consumer'
But Mr. Spratt, like many others, did not think the increase would have any impact on him. ''It's just another way to hose the consumer,'' he said.
At the Manchester Leasing Company, a car company in St. Louis, Jo Davies, the sales manager, said gas mileage was not an issue among customers. ''They don't even bring it up,'' she said. Ms. Davies added that she was filling out the paperwork on a new Saab Turbo convertible, and that gas prices were ''not even a consideration.''
In Brighton, Mass., a Boston suburb, Tolu Odebiyi went shopping at an Acura dealership yesterday. ''The oil prices will not make a difference on what kind of car I'm going to buy, but to wake up in the morning and see the prices have skyrocketed really caught me unaware,'' he said.
At times, the public seems to think of cheap gas as a constitutional right, a phenomenon long evident to officeholders who have contemplated proposing a substantial gasoline tax.
The lure of low-priced fuel was evident in Grandview, Mo., on Thursday when a service station that offered gas at 48.9 cents a gallon as part of a radio station promotion drew a line a mile long, which started forming an hour and a half before the sale started. Eleven police officers were sent to keep order.
''Americans are most attuned to what affects their driving,'' said Gerald M. Cheske, a spokesman for the American Automobile Association ''And the motorist, in many cases, is angry. They haven't had time to settle into any thinking of what it means to me, how it affects family income.''
 
Surprisingly Modest Effect
The effect is surprisingly modest, even this month, at the height of what is known as the ''summer driving season,'' a concept that is largely a holdover from the days when the car was a pleasure vehicle. A family of four taking a driving vacation will spend $173 a day for food and lodging, according to the automobile association; the gas and oil will cost $8.40 for each 100 miles. If the price of fuel rises 15 percent, it adds $1.26 to the trip. That would add $12 to a round-trip from New York to Bangor, Me.
But the oil increase, if it persists, will have a broader effect. If a price increase of $8 or $9 a barrel sticks, the national bill will be about $50 billion a year, close to 1 percent of the gross national product.
Half of the extra payment will be exported, because half of America's oil supply is bought from abroad, according to Donald Ratajczak, director of the economic forecasting center at Georgia State University, and ''not a lot of the other half will quickly get into spending,'' he predicted. The drain will be half met by reduced savings, and the rest by reduced purchasing.
''It's not excruciating, it's not a destroyer, but it's significant,'' he said. ''If someone put in a $50 billion tax bill, there would be screaming.''
 
Airline Tickets and Food
After gasoline, the effect will be felt first in services like airline tickets, then chemical products and petroleum-based substances like plastics, used for everything from Christmas toys to sandwich bags, Dr. Ratajczak said. And then there is food, for which 6 cents of every dollar pays for the energy used in processing and marketing, not counting what is spent for fertilizers and pesticides made from oil. An increase of 1 to 2 percent in food prices is possible, he added.
But a recession, not spiraling inflation, is the likely result this time, he said. ''Jobs are lost, on the one hand, and prices are going up on the other,'' he added. ''You are looking at the boss to see if he is going to fire you. It isn't the kind of economic climate where you go demanding wages to keep up with inflation.''

HEADLINE: Dow Falls 42.33 Points, To 2,716.58

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks, still under pressure from Middle Eastern developments, ended sharply lower yesterday in moderately heavy trading as investors sold off ahead of the weekend, nearly erasing the gains of the last two days.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell by 42.33 points, or 1.53 percent, to 2,716.58. That brought its decline for the week to 93.07 points. Trading was moderate on a volume of 145.3 million shares. 
Feverish activity moved the Dow down across the 50-point level at 1:38 P.M. and to its low of 2,692.82, down 54 points, two minutes later. That brought the new ''circuit breaker'' rule on the New York Stock Exchange into play for the second time this week.
 
Program Trading Curbed
When the Dow falls more than 50 points, the rule restricts traders that use computer programs to initiate sell orders. Program traders are then not permitted to sell stock on a downtick, which is when a stock's last sale is lower than the one before.
Peter G. Grennan, a vice president of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc., noted an immediate calming effect once the circuit breaker was tripped.
Earlier in the day, news of a call by Iraq's President, Saddam Hussein, for an Arab uprising against foreign intervention in the Persian Gulf region sent jitters through investors and the markets. Oil prices were another reason for the sharp drop in the afternoon. The September spot price of West Texas Intermediate crude, traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange, rose 56 cents, to settle at $26.23 a barrel yesterday.
 
Little Effect on Market
For most of the morning stocks drifted lower as investors sold ahead of the weekend. A drop of a tenth of a percent in the July producer price index showed a weakening economy even before a coming oil-price shock. economists said, but it did little to sway the market. [Page 37.] Fears of higher oil prices, inflation, and concern over the weak American economy have not dissipated, but remain in the background, Mr. Grennan said.
The sharp selling spree, he suggested, was started by a downturn in the bond market - burdened with a large supply of paper, and traders who were hedging their investments by selling in the futures market. The bonds recovered after the futures market closed, and the stock slide ended.
''It was a Friday,'' Mr. Grennan said, ''and after the type of week we've had, I would have thought it unusual if the market had continued its rally.''
''It's very diffcult for any market to sustain any rally, if it is faced with uncertainty,'' he continued. ''Next week will be important as investors look for a trend to develop.''
Birinyi Associates Inc., which tracks program trading through certain flucuations in market activity, said there were nine program trades - eight sell and one buy, when the net decline on the Dow was 52.96 points. The eight sell programs happened between 10:05 A.M. and 1:44 P.M.
Markets do not deal well with uncertainty, even though they can accept most any economic situation from a depression to inflation, said one trader. Stock traders were not alone in selling off ahead of the weekend. Bond traders were doing the same thing, taking profits from the previous day's gains after a fairly successful auction of 30-year bonds on Thursday.
Losing stocks outnumbered gainers by 1,043 to 448. Anytime there are more than 1,000 stocks down, the losses are pretty well distributed across the board, a trader said. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 4.42 points, to 335.52, while the American Stock Exchange market-value index fell 2.17 points, or 0.64 percent, to 339.32, and the Nasdaq index fell 4.95 points, or 1.20 percent, to 408.03.
 
Increases for Gold Shares
The price of gold on the Commodity Exchange of New York jumped $11, to $397 an ounce, and with it gold stocks rose. ASA Ltd., a South African gold producer, was up 1 3/4, to 52 3/4, and Homestake Mining, a domestic gold mining company, gained 1 1/2, to 21 7/8.
Oil stocks made small gains but just about everything else was down.
The stock of American Express rose 7/8, to 27 1/2. The company said it had completed the previously announced acquisition of Shearson Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. following shareholder approval.
Schering-Plough slipped by 1/2, to 46 1/2. The company announced after the market close on Thursday that it was discontinuing its worldwide marketing of Dilevalol, a drug used for hypertension, because of evidence in isolated cases of liver toxicity.
UAL, where an employee-led buyout group continues to have financing difficulties, fell by 6 1/4, to 107 1/2.

HEADLINE: Long-Term Bond Prices Off Sharply

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds were battered yesterday as traders and investment managers sought to hedge their portfolios for the weekend.
Many used the most common hedge against price declines, selling short an equivalent amount of bond futures in Chicago. Indeed, bond prices in the cash and futures markets moved even more in tandem than usual, over a broad range.
''Aside from wanting to square their books for the weekend because of nervousness over the Mideast situation, many in the fixed-income market were concerned about the large supply of refunding issues that are still in the hands of dealers,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities Inc. 
 
Japanese Absence a Factor
The absence of Japanese investors at this week's record refunding also created some unease, Mr. Ricchiuto said, ''but everybody's primary focus today seemed to be on getting their portfolios hedged for the weekend.''
Once the Chicago Board of Trade's bond futures market, the nation's largest such market, closed at 3 P.M., Eastern daylight time, the cash market in Treasury securities, which observes no fixed hours, meandered in light dealings.
Late in the session in New York, the outstanding benchmark Treasury long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in May 2020, were being offered at 99 18/32, off 12/32, while the yield rose to 8.79 percent, up from 8.76 percent the day before and 8.55 percent a week ago.
The Chicago bond futures market was just as volatile as the cash market, with the spot September futures contract in Chicago, which is the nearest delivery month, ranging between 91 23/32 and 90 8/32, before settling at 90 28/32, down 14/32 on the day.
 
New Long Bonds at 8.77%
The $10.25 billion of new 30-year long bonds, auctioned Thursday at an average yield of 8.87 percent, traded on a when-issued basis at 99 24/32, off 12/32 on the day, for a yield of 8.77 percent. Also in when-issued trading, the $10.5 billion of 10-year notes auctioned Wednesday at an average yield of 8.77 percent traded at 100 19/ 32, down 5/32, to yield 8.66 percent, while the $11.5 billion of three-year notes sold Tuesday at an average yield of 8.10 percent were unchanged at 99 24/32, for a yield of 8.09 percent.
When-issued trading ends, in effect, when the refunding notes and bonds are ''settled,'' or paid for, by the buyers. The record refunding auctions of this week will be settled on Aug. 15.
The shorter Treasury issues were essentially unchanged or posted minor losses, largely because this maturity sector would be the most immediately and beneficially affected by any lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve. Economists belief the Fed will soon have to cut interest rates to avoid a recession later this year.
 
Reserves Added to System
Thus, the shortest coupon issue, the 8 percent notes of 1992, were unchanged at 100 3/32, for a yield of 7.94 percent.
Similarly, discount rates on Treasury bills were basically unchanged, with the 90-day bills off a basis point, or one-hundredth of a percentage point; the six-month bills were unchanged, at 7.29 percent, and the one-year bills slipped 4 basis points, to 7.15 percent.
As it has all week, the Fed added more reserves to the banking system. The latest intervention involved $1.5 billion of customer repurchase agreements. And once again the Fed's action was considered a technical response to seasonal needs rather than any policy move.
This supposition was supported by the steadiness in the Federal funds rate, which banks charge each other for temporary loans. The funds traded almost all day at 8 percent, before closing a touch easier at 7 15/16 percent.

HEADLINE: Producer Prices Show Decline of 0.1% for July

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Prices at the producer level fell by a tenth of a percent in July, the Labor Department said today in a report that economists said showed a weakening economy even before the current oil-price shock.
Last month's decline was the first drop since April in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods, which foreshadows price trends at the retail level, but economists worried that it was a sign of falling demand for goods.
The department noted that the index measured producer prices before Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, which has sent oil prices soaring and provoked warnings that inflation would be fired up as increased energy costs rippled through the economy.
 
Uncertainty on Severity
''It's fair to say we're going to see some acceleration in energy prices, but the jury's still out on just how severe that's going to be,'' said Ron Schreibman, vice president of the National Association of Wholesaler-Distributors. 
The price of United States benchmark crude oil has gone to about $26 a barrel from $21.55 on Aug. 1, before the Mideast crisis. A barrel was at about $17 in early July.
July producer prices were more restrained than economists had expected. Their forecasts had been for a rise of two-tenths of a percent, which would have matched June's rise. But prices at the producer level are expected to soar in August and September as the impact of higher energy costs hits.
During the first seven months of the year, producer prices rose at a relatively modest annual rate of 3 percent, compared with a 4.8 percent rate of increase for all of 1989.
 
Decline in 'Core Rate'
Excluding the volatile food and energy components, producer prices still fell a tenth of a percent in July after a six-tenths rise in June. This is the ''core rate'' of inflation that is sometimes cited as a more reliable indicator of producer price trends.
It was the first decline in a year for the core rate, but that was not seen positively by some economists. Richard Rahn, chief economist for the United States Chamber of Commerce, said it was ''a clear sign of weakening demand'' for goods. That impression is bolstered by lower factory orders, declining consumer demand, higher unemployment and more unsold goods, he added.
''The economy is virtually dead in its tracks,'' said Mr. Rahn, who expects a recession by the year's end.
After the release of the report, Government bonds rose moderately, but they later fell, and the stock market was sharply lower as the Dow Jones industrial average ended with a drop of 42.33 points, to 2,716.58. Traders said the markets were more affected, however, by Mideast uncertainty than by the price report, which has largely been superseded by recent oil price rises.
The price report showed that energy prices in July fell five-tenths of a percent after a nine-tenths drop in June. Gasoline prices were down 5.3 percent after a slight four-tenths rise in June. Crude petroleum prices fell 4 percent last month after an 11.9 percent June drop.
Crude oil prices were 23 percent lower in July than they were a year earlier, while gasoline prices at the producer level were 1.3 percent lower. Wholesalers pushed gasoline prices up strongly in the days after Iraq's invasion, and prices at the pump have risen more than 15 cents a gallon on average.
Consumer food prices were unchanged in July, after a drop of four-tenths of a percent in June. Tobacco and automobile prices fell, but prescription drugs cost more.
Speculation has grown that the Federal Reserve Board might be forced to lower interest rates to stimulate the economy, although a Fed governor, John P. LaWare, said on Thursday that it was too early to say how hard the economy would be hit by the higher energy costs.
Mitsubishi Bank economists estimate that each $1 rise in crude oil prices translates into a 4 percent increase in wholesale gasoline prices and a 2 percent rise in prices consumers pay at the pump. That, in turn, increases producer prices aboout two-tenths of a percent a month.
The various changes in producer prices put the July index for all finished goods, not seasonally adjusted, at 118, which means that a hypothetical selection of goods that cost $100 in 1982 cost $118 last month, up from $114.10 a year earlier.
In two companion reports covering earlier production stages, prices for intermediate goods were unchanged, while prices for crude goods rose six-tenths of a percent. Examples of the types of products in each of the three processing stages would be clothing for finished goods, cloth for intermediate and cotton for crude.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Gold Highest Since March As Fears on Mideast Rise

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of gold futures reached their highest levels in nearly five months yesterday as fiery rhetoric from President Saddam Hussein of Iraq reignited fears that a Middle East war would wreak economic havoc on the West.
In other markets, soybeans rallied strongly while wheat futures plunged.
Gold futures settled $11.10 to $12 higher on the Commodity Exchange in New York, with the contract for delivery in August at $396.90 an ounce, the highest spot-month settlement since March 19. 
Silver futures settled 11.1 cents to 12.7 cents higher, with August at $4.969 an ounce.
The gold market surged after President Hussein, in an outburst of fury against Western efforts to devastate his economy and hem in his army, called on Arabs everywhere to wage ''holy war'' against enemies of Islam.
Hours after the Hussein statement, a majority of the Arab League nations agreed to dispatch an Arab force to defend Saudi Arabia and approved economic sanctions against Iraq.
The developments set off a run-up in oil futures - West Texas Intermediate crude settled 56 cents higher, to $26.23 a barrel, for September delivery - and a decline of 42.33 points in the Dow Jones industrial average. Both moves supported the gold market, which tends to attract investors during times of inflation and economic and political uncertainty.
''Gold is getting helped twice, once by the political instability in the Middle East and once by the price of crude oil,'' said Jim Paul, chief commodities analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc.
Gold has gained momentum since tumbling below $345 an ounce in June. Mr. Paul said the chart patterns, on which many large institutional investors and commodity funds make their trading decisions, indicate that the precious metals are likely to move higher.
But, he cautioned, ''We're not trading gold and silver; we're trading political events in the Middle East,and we don't know what's happening next.''
Soybean futures ended sharply higher, but below the day's highs, on the Chicago Board of Trade after the Agriculture Department issued a harvest estimate that was lower than expected. The market dropped from its highs on spillover selling from the grain pits, where a large sell order for wheat caused a plunge late in the session.
Analysts said the strength in soybeans was mainly a reaction to Thursday's Agriculture Department report. The Government projected a soybean harvest of 1.84 billion bushels, about 20 million less than expected. The estimate for the corn harvest - 7.85 billion bushels - was about 70 million less than expected.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Off in Light Trading; Economy and Rates Cited

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar finished lower against most major currencies yesterday despite the possibility of an escalation of Middle East hostilities that could disrupt oil flows from that region and damage economies.
Analysts said weakness in the United States economy and the prospect of lower American interest rates weighed on the dollar. Trading was described as light. 
As Arab leaders gathered for a meeting yesterday in Cairo, the President of Iraq, Saddam Hussein, called on Arabs everywhere to attack Western forces in the region, overthrow the Saudi royal family and take back the Moslem holy sites in Saudi Arabia.
But a majority of the Arab League nations at the meeting later agreed to send troops to protect Saudi Arabia from Iraq, approved economic sanctions against Baghdad and condemned the invasion of Kuwait.
In New York trading, the dollar fell against every major currency except the Japanese yen and the Canadian dollar after turning in a mixed performance on foreign exchange markets overseas.
''We saw dollar weakness at the close of the European session, and it carried over to New York,'' said Marc Chandler, a currency markets analyst at MMS International in Chicago. He added that the dollar was suffering because of the weakness in the United States economy, the likelihood of rising inflation and chances that American interest rates will fall while rates in Germany may rise.
He said the dollar would probably be even lower were it not for the Persian Gulf situation. Some investors turn to the dollar during strife on the theory that it offers more security than other currencies. ''The danger for the dollar now is for a protracted and costly United States involvement, he added.
The dollar rose to 150.40 yen in New York from 149.81 yen late Thursday. In Tokyo, the dollar edged up 0.07 yen, to 149.75 yen. The dollar was quoted at 150.20 yen in London.
But the dollar fell against the British pound. In New York, the pound rose to $1.8735 from $1.8680 late Thursday. In London, the pound rose to $1.8730 from $1.8720 late Thursday.
Against the German currency, the dollar fell to 1.5895 marks, from 1.5965.
Dollar rates in New York, compared with late rates Thursday, included: 1.3375 Swiss francs, down from 1.3435; 1,165.00 Italian lire, down from 1,168.50; 5.3325 French francs, down from 5.3510, and 1.14705 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14695.

Environmental Doubts on 'Green' Ads

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER

 BODY:
As big manufacturers start to pay environmental groups to help promote products like toilet paper and beer, the new marketing strategy is dividing environmental advocates.
Some groups say they have rejected lucrative offers and criticize others for lending their names to products that cannot be recycled or to alcoholic beverages. Other advocates say they fear that environmental endorsements may make consumers lose respect for the movement.
Sears and Coca-Cola are among the companies that pay a fee or a percentage of sales to environmental groups whose names they can then use in promotions and advertising. Among the products that have marketing arrangements with environmental groups are Minute Maid juices, Tanqueray gin and Canon copiers. 
''You hope the consumer takes away a little better feeling about your brand name and product,'' said Dan A. Schafer, a spokesman for Minute Maid, which is owned by Coca-Cola.
Coca-Cola is running a promotion with the National Parks and Conservation Association, a private group in Washington. In it, buyers of unrefrigerated Minute Maid juices can help pay for the planting of trees in Redwood National Park in California. The cost to the consumer for each tree is 75 cents, which the company matches; it has also paid $10,000 to the association, Mr. Schafer said.
The new marketing efforts probably will not raise product prices. But several environmental advocates said they may further antagonize consumers who feel they have been misled by false claims about product biodegradability.
''We'll lose our credibility if everything in the marketplace has the imprimatur of an environmental group,'' said John Bell, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth in Washington. Rosemary Carroll, the director of development for the Sierra Club in San Francisco, said: ''There is a lot of schlock out there right now. We've been approached by manufacturers of tampons, toilet paper and automotive parts, and we are not in the position to evaluate whether they are environmentally sensitive or not.''
Friends of the Earth recently passed up $25,000 from Marla Maples as part of a deal in which the group's name would be used in promoting No Excuses jeans, for which Ms. Maples serves as a spokeswoman. Michael Clark, the group's president, said the offer was not accepted because the group did not have enough time to assess the manufacturer's environmental record.
''We are getting at least one offer like this every week,'' he said. Ms. Maples's money is now expected to go to the Better World Society, a nonprofit group in Washington that produces and acquires documentary television programs on, among other things, environmental issues.
Previously, marketing that drew on environmental concerns was limited to companies closely identified with natural products or the outdoors: Ben & Jerry's Homemade Inc., Patagonia Inc. and the Body Shop, to name a few. Typically, such companies donate part of their profits - from 1 to 10 percent of pretax profits - to environmental causes.
 
'Companies Can Help'
 But big consumer companies have entered the arena, driven by the so-called ''green'' marketing movement. ''We believe that consumers are becoming more sensitive to the fact companies can help the environment,'' said Richard Knudson, vice president of marketing for Moosehead Breweries of Canada.
The company has announced that, upon a consumer's request, it will give $1 to the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation for every six-pack of its beer purchased. It has guaranteed the group at least $100,000. The foundation was set up by Congress in 1984 to funnel private donations to the Federal Fish and Wildlife Service. The Government will match the Moosehead donations.
Some groups, like the Sierra Club, are developing guidelines on the kinds of products they would promote. Others, like the Environmental Defense Fund in New York, have decided to steer clear of the arrangements. ''We have to be an independent force, free to criticize who we want,'' said Fred Krupp, the fund's executive director.
Many environmental leaders say they do not object to such marketing arrangements, because they can help raise money for, and awareness about, an important cause. But some said they were concerned that groups might sell their name too cheaply or to the wrong company.
''Most environmental groups don't have the resources to investigate whether the company they are endorsing has a track record they can be comfortable with,'' said Alice Tepper Marlin, the executive director of the Council on Economic Priorities. Her New York City group rates the environmental records of consumer product companies.
Some promotions are already under attack. Several environmental leaders criticized the arrangement between Minute Maid and the National Parks and Conservation Association because the juice packages cannot be recycled.
''Rather than addressing the waste they are creating, they are trying to put a good face on it by saying they are going to plant trees,'' said Ruth Caplan, who heads the Environmental Action Fund in Washington.
Mr. Schafer, the Minute Maid spokesman, responded that the packaging compared favorably with other containers. Elliot Gruber, the association's director of development, said, ''We have expressed our concern, but they won't change it.''
Promotion of alcoholic beverages is another sensitive issue for some environmental advocates. The National Parks and Conservation Association recently ran a promotion with Tanqueray gin, offering buyers of the gin a chance to win a trip to a national park. The company made a donation to the association, but Mr. Gruber would not say how much it was.
Spokesmen for several groups - including American Rivers, Friends of the Earth and the Environmental Action Fund - said they would not take part in promotions with companies that produced alcoholic beverages or tobacco.
But other groups said they saw nothing wrong with joining with alcohol producers. ''I don't think our promotion is going to make people who don't buy beer buy beer,'' said Charles Collins, executive director of the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, which is involved in the Moosehead campaign. ''We feel the promotion is being done in a responsible manner, and it is giving us a chance to reach a broad audience that we have not reached before.''
Ultimately, however, environmentalists say their biggest fear is a loss of credibility. With many shoppers already confused by a recent wave of false or misleading environmental claims by manufacturers, the growing promotion of products by environmentalists may quickly come back to haunt them.
''A lot of companies are saying the environment is hot now and see it as a way of increasing their sales,'' Mr. Gruber said. ''Their concern is the bottom line, and it is up to us to somehow walk the fence and say we want to have more money and still retain our credibility.''

HEADLINE: SPORTS PEOPLE: HOCKEY;
Cancellation Canceled

 BODY:
Soviet hockey authorities, who were outraged when a top Soviet player, Sergei Fedorov, left their national team at the Goodwill Games in Seattle on July 21 to sign a contract with the Detroit Red Wings, have decided not to cancel a series of exhibition games with National Hockey League teams.
Officials of the Soviet Hockey Federation announced Sunday in Seattle that they would cancel two exhibition tours, one by the Montreal Canadiens and the Minnesota North Stars, who are scheduled to visit the Soviet Union next month, and one by three Soviet teams, which are scheduled to visit the 21 N.H.L. cities in December and January. The officials said the Red Wings' signing of Fedorov, 20 years old, violated the Soviet labor code and agreements between the Soviet Union and the N.H.L.
But as Tass, the Soviet press agency, made clear yesterday, the authorities simply had second thoughts about taking a punitive action against the N.H.L. that might punish the cash-starved Soviet economy. Some estimates suggest the economy could lose $1 million in hard currency if the tours were canceled.
Instead, the Soviet authorities have hit on a less disruptive way to protest the Red Wings' action: a lawsuit.
Tass said the Soviet federation was looking for ''experienced North American lawyers'' to assist in the litigation in an international or North American court. (AP)

HEADLINE: Wooed, Wined and Overworked, Wall St. Lawyers Meet Pink Slips

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
They were the legal profession's gilded generation, an army of lawyers without limits. As law students, they were wined and dined and wooed by the most prestigious law firms in New York. Once hired, they began settling into a frantic but fantastically lucrative life. It was a life of glamour, prestige and, they assumed, stability.
Now, only a few years later, dozens of these lawyers have had a crash course in the realities of modern Wall Street practice. For the first time in their lives - lives of success atop success - they find themselves in an unusual position. They have been fired.
As the sour corporate climate reaches large law firms in New York and to a lesser degree cities like Los Angeles and Chicago, a bubble has burst. With business down, particularly in corporate work, real estate, and mergers and acquisitions, several of the most famous law firms have dismissed substantial numbers of lawyers, particularly those in the early years of their careers. 
The ax fell disproportionately on women - a reflection of their continuing marginal status at some firms, despite record raw numbers. In others, it fell on those brought in laterally from other firms rather than home-grown products. In still more, it fell more capriciously - on those who had the wrong mentor, an absentee mentor, or no mentor at all.
On the spectrum of hardship cases, the plight of 25-year-olds making $85,000 a year, most with skills more than sufficient to find work elsewhere, is admittedly not the saddest. There is no constitutional right to foreign cars or second mortgages. But many still carry large debts from law school. Moreover, there is the shock of dismissals in a world unfamiliar with them, as well as what the lawyers involved contend is the disingenuous way in which they were handled.
Elite law firms have always fancied themselves paternalistic places, where loyalty mattered more than the bottom line. While only a handful of associates were eventually promoted to partner, all but the most inept could remain, often for years, until something else came along. And when they left, they left quietly, with their reputations and their dignity intact.
Now, young lawyers are discovering that the marketplace works both ways.
''I never expected to stay forever, but I didn't expect to get booted out the door,'' said an associate formerly at Cahill, Gordon & Reindel, one of 24 dismissed earlier this year shortly before the firm's main client, Drexel Burnham Lambert, went bankrupt.
The firms involved do not deny that many of their lawyers have been asked to leave. But they have proven more willing to let go of lawyers than of the myth of gentility they have long cherished. Straining to preserve what remains of that image, they insist the dismissals are based on merit rather than on reduced earnings.
A representative comment came earlier this year from Roger Meltzer, a partner at Cahill Gordon and the firm's spokesman. ''The quote, layoffs, were not related to any financial problems at the firm; they were related strictly to the merits,'' he told Manhattan Lawyer magazine, a trade publication.
Mr. Meltzer declined to be interviewed for this article.
 
Feeling Blamed and Betrayed
The layoffs have left many of the young lawyers feeling betrayed by institutions which, they charge, courted them, exploited their loyalty, and worked them incessantly, only to dump them when times got tough and to blame them for poor performances. That, in turn, leaves some feeling chagrined over their own naivete.
''A lot of young people think they can go to a good law school and get a degree which will guarantee them stability and interesting work for the rest of their lives,'' said Lesley M. Friedman of Special Counsel Inc., a legal temporary service which has helped place some of the dismissed lawyers.
One of the more than 20 lawyers dismissed this year by Fried, Frank, Harris, Shriver & Jacobson agreed. ''Maybe I was deceiving myself,'' he said. ''They'd always portrayed themselves as something other than the factory I guess they are.''
''I feel like an idiot, I really do,'' said another lawyer, one of 10 dismissed by Rosenman & Colin. ''When it comes down to money they'll just turn around and stab you in the back. Everyone is saying I'll get over it, but it's something I don't think I'll ever get over. I really felt that I was a good lawyer.''
Like almost all of those interviewed, these lawyers spoke on the condition that they not be identified. Those still working at their firms as they look for other jobs fear antagonizing the very people who have dismissed them, on whom they must still rely for references. Others, who have left, fear being branded second-rate.
''Egos have a lot to do with this industry,'' said one former associate at Rosenman & Colin. ''Even if the layoffs were economic, no one wants someone else's rejects.''
Given the secrecy surrounding the dismissals, no one knows the exact number of lawyers affected by the cutbacks. But industry experts agree that the numbers of those dismissed in the last six months far exceed normal attrition, and that at some firms most affected by the economic downturn a purge of sorts is under way. Other firms involved include Milbank, Tweed, Hadley & McCloy and Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, each of which has dismissed 22; and Shea & Gould, which has told at least 20 to leave.
The dismissals have created a climate of fear in large firms, a feeling not confined to those directly affected. It has spread to summer associates who expect to receive far fewer offers of permanent employment this year. It exists, too, among lawyers who survived the last round of dismissals but fear the next, which many expect to come sometime after Labor Day.
''Nobody feels secure,'' said an associate dismissed by Rosenman & Colin. ''Everyone's walking around on eggshells.''
But to the lawyers involved, what seems to matter more than the dismissals themselves is how they were done. Almost without exception, they said their firms initially assured them that they would ride out the tough times and not dismiss anyone.
Then, once the dismissals began, the firms chose to malign those they were jettisoning rather than acknowledge their own problems.
Merit was the only issue, contended Arthur Fleischer Jr. of Fried Frank.
''People who are not functioning as their peers are, are told that it doesn't make a lot of sense for them to stay here,'' he said. ''That goes back to time immemorial.'' He dismissed as nonsense the suggestion that anyone had been dismissed for economic reasons.
''I know most of the people who were let go, and most of them got great reviews,'' one recently dismissed Fried Frank lawyer countered. ''Don't give me this garbage that they were scum.''
''Even though they're fooling no one, it's easier to say 'These people weren't cutting the mustard' than to say 'We're not cutting the mustard,' '' an associate dismissed by Shea & Gould said.
That the partners at top firms continue to earn spectacular piles of money adds to the resentment. Last year, according to The American Lawyer, the average profit per partner at Cahill Gordon was $1.515 million - the highest of any law firm.
At other firms as well, the cutbacks are incongruously juxtaposed with signs of the record prosperity they recently enjoyed. Shea & Gould, for instance, just moved into lavish new offices in the Exxon building; partners there continue to enjoy catered lunches costing thousands of dollars a week.
 
Few Firms Admit Layoffs
Even so, the firm has just laid off its only black associate, a woman who had been elected by her colleagues only a few weeks earlier to a committee set up to discuss problems of younger lawyers. Others were dismissed within months of their arrival; one was told, ''You have about as much chance of making partner as you have of growing feathers.'' Still more have been dismissed in the last few weeks, when hiring everywhere is slow.
One Shea & Gould lawyer, Charles J. Spinelli, was let go while his wife was four months pregnant. ''I did not inform my wife for three months for fear that she would have a miscarriage; she had had one the year before,'' said Mr. Spinelli, who recently opened up his own office on Staten Island. ''It was agonizing.''
Leon Gold, a member of Shea & Gould's executive committee, did not return phone calls. Nor did partners at Milbank Tweed.
In any case, terms like dismissed and layoffs remain stricken from the lexicon at many of these law firms. Laura Colangelo, a legal recruiter in New York, explained why. ''Nobody is ever going to admit there've been any layoffs,'' she said. ''That means business is down.''
In fact, at least one managing partner, Robert Hodes of Willkie, Farr & Gallagher, acknowledged that some of those discharged at his firm were for economic reasons, and that they understood that this was so. ''There was no way not to be candid,'' he said. ''These are very smart people.''
Those dismissed include graduates of the top law schools, among them Harvard, Columbia, New York University, and the Universities of Michigan and Chicago. But more are from less prestigious law schools, including Fordham, New York Law School, Brooklyn and Cardozo, from which top firms first began hiring during the prosperous 1980's. That may signal a return to the elitism of an earlier age, and further complicates some job searches.
''I've never seen a marketplace this bad,'' said a former Fried Frank lawyer. ''A lot of firms say they're looking, but it's window dressing. What they're looking for are Harvard grads who walk on water. And if they have billable hours, that's nice, too.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Mirage of Arab Unity

BYLINE: By JOHN KIFNER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAIRO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The political map of the Arab world has been remade, or perhaps erased, overnight.
The vote of the Arab summit meeting on Friday night to send a symbolic force to join American troops deployed in Saudi Arabia after Iraq's takeover of Kuwait shattered the myth of Arab unity that has cloaked differences for decades. It is as if someone threw all the pieces of a game up in the air.
''This is the end of the Arab world as we and they have known it,'' said Judith Kipper, a Middle East analyst at the Brookings Institution. 
 
Arab World in Turmoil
''The Arabs basically are confronted with themselves,'' she said. ''Two myths went out the window: their capacity to protect themselves and pan-Arabism. It's a tremendous identity crisis.''
The swift unfolding of previously unthinkable events in the nine days since President Saddam Hussein of Iraq gobbled up his wealthy but weak neighbor and former ally have left the Arab world in turmoil.
Egypt, only recently emerging from a decade of isolation brought on by its peace treaty with Israel, has again become a center of the Arab world with President Hosni Mubarak's handling of the crisis. Iraq, the most powerful single player, supported for years by other Arabs as their protector from Iran, is suddenly a pariah, an isolated renegade.
 
Troops Leave for Saudi Arabia
The first several hundred Egyptian paratroopers and desert-trained commandos left here today for Saudi Arabia in a cosmetic, but politically important, deployment to put an Arab face on the American 82d Airborne Division's presence there. Arrangements were being made today for Moroccan and Syrian troops to join them.
But as a military and economic noose tightens around him, Mr. Hussein has launched an emotional appeal to frustrated, impoverished and discontented Arabs, invoking resentment not only of foreigners but of oil-rich hereditary rulers and the alleged ''defiling'' of Muslim shrines that could well threaten shaky Arab governments.
Elsewhere in the Arab world, Mr. Hussein found support in the streets. In Sana, the capital of Yemen, 10,000 demonstrators screaming, ''Fahd, atheist priest, Saddam lives and you must die!'' marched today on the Saudi and American Embassies. The crowd, which was protesting the Saudi King's invitation to American forces, threw rocks and worn-out shoes, an Arab insult.
Thousands rallied in support of Mr. Hussein in the biggest demonstration in Mauritania in years, and Palestinians demonstrated in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. In Algeria, Tunisia and Jordan, support groups were raising volunteers to aid Iraq.
But in the first, morning-after sorting out, Mr. Mubarak appeared to be emerging as an immediate winner.
 
Historic Turning Point
''This will be one of those great markers in history, one of those events that indicates how disputes here will be resolved for the next 50 years,'' a senior Western diplomat said today. ''It puts the United States and this region in a new relationship that will be very important for its economic well-being for a long way down the road.
''This sequence of events has reminded the United States of the importance of the relationship with Egypt that it has nurtured now for 11 years,'' he added. ''It has really paid off in terms of American interest in the past few days.''
The senior diplomat went on to praise Mr. Mubarak's handling of the immediate situation and Egypt's return to influence in the Arab world, saying: ''This is long-term, a careful tending of garden. The Egyptians show a tremendous consistency. They move in a straight line.
 
Mobilizing Arab Countries
''He has moved with great, great care to mobilize the Arab countries, first with the Arab League resolution, then with the Arab summit. The Arab leaders are now traveling to Cairo, not to Baghdad.
''If all this plays out right, if gradually the noose tightens around Iraq and the goal of its withdrawal from Kuwait is achieved, if all that happens, Egypt is going to come out in a strong position,'' he continued. ''It will not be the strong postion of Egypt of 20 years ago based on military power, but based on conviction and persuasion.''
If Mr. Mubarak seemed an immediate winner, Yasir Arafat, the Palestine Liberation Organization leader, appeared to be a first-round loser.
Frustrated with the lack of progress toward peace talks with Israel despite the pressure of more than two years of violent protests in the Israeli-occupied territories, Mr. Arafat had moved closer to Iraq in recent months believing the center of gravity in the Arab world was drifting toward Baghdad.
But by casting his lot with Iraq, Mr. Arafat has strained relations with Egypt, his main go-between with the United States in attempting to reach some kind of settlement with Israel. Perhaps even more important, he has alienated Saudi Arabia, his major bankroller.
Mr. Arafat's own Palestinian constituency is split, mirroring the dvisions between haves and have-nots in the Arab world. While frustrated Palestinians in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jordan have been demonstrating in praise of Mr. Hussein, seeing him as a tough leader who threatens Israel, wealthy Palestinian expatriates in the gulf region, who regularly pay a six percent income tax to the P.L.O., have accused Mr. Hussein of destroyed their livelihoods.
 
Jordan's Difficult Position
King Hussein of Jordan is also in a difficult position. A longtime backer of Saddam Hussein, he wound up in an equivocal category at the summit, voting approval of the resolution ''with reservations.'' The King is caught among a number of pressures, not the least of which is a strong current of public opinion in Jordan supporting Iraq, much of it from Jordanians and Palestinians who worked in Kuwait and resent the way they were treated there.
President Saddam Hussein's portrayal of wealthy rulers as corrupt and subservient to the West could strike a responsive chord in Jordan, some analysts believe.
''To me, the gut issue is the regimes versus the people, because none of the Arab regimes represent their people, and this is why there is such cheering in the streets'' for President Hussein, Ms. Kipper, the Brookings expert, said in a telephone interview.
Mr. Hussein has the wherewithal to foment protests through outposts of his own Baath Party and through payments to other political organizations that are emerging as the Arab world edges toward a more open politics, particularly in the North African countries, diplomats and other experts said.
But in view of Iraq's own human rights record, regarded by Amnesty International and other watchdog organizations as one of the world's worst, a number found Mr. Hussein's appeal ironic.
''It is Saddam as the avenger of past slights, appealing to everyone who was mistreated in Kuwait, everybody in the refugee camps,'' said Fouad Ajami, a Lebanese-born Middle East expert at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies. ''They will be disabused of this. He is a man without scruples, a killer and a murderer on a vast scale. This is pan-Arabism with a bayonet, chemical weapons and a whip for all those who will not submit.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
U.S. Gulf Policy: Vague 'Vital Interest'

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
In his statement to the nation on Wednesday explaining the decision to send American troops to the Arabian Peninsula, President Bush said that the defense of Saudi Arabia was of ''vital interest'' to the United States. But Mr. Bush and his top aides have not clearly defined just how the Iraqi invasion and annexation of Kuwait touches the lives of Americans or affects their future.
For many Americans, the connection is not clear. Beyond the quick jump in gasoline prices, many people seem to share the view of Katie Safier of Miami, who mused in an interview: ''Why should we be involved? We could get oil from Mexico.''
One reason Bush Administration officials have not clearly articulated what is at stake is that the real political and economic interests involved are not quite so lofty as some of the broad principles used by the President to explain the operation. 
 
Freedom Is Not the Issue
The United States has not sent troops to the Saudi desert to preserve democratic principles. The Saudi monarchy is a feudal regime that does not even allow women to drive cars. Surely it is not American policy to make the world safe for feudalism. This is about money, about protecting governments loyal to America and punishing those that are not and about who will set the price of oil.
The failure to spell out the American stakes and justify them is also due to the inarticulate way the President and his advisers try to explain foreign policy to the American people.
In addition, President Bush, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and other top officials live in a rarefied world of foreign policy discussions with a set of assumptions about the pivotal importance of the Persian Gulf - to such a degree that it does not always occur to officials to spell out what is at stake.
 
A Vital Interest Since 1949
As Mr. Baker told his NATO allies on Friday, without much elaboration: ''Since 1949, every American President has said that the gulf is a vital U.S. and Western interest.''
Why? To listen to American officials speaking privately, these interests can be divided into three broad categories, each of which is worthy of scrutiny.
One is the price of oil. Another is who controls the oil. The third is the need to uphold the integrity of national boundaries so that predatory regional powers will not simply begin devouring their neighbors.
The oil price argument goes as follows: If Iraq is able to get away with annexing Kuwait, it will control 20 percent of the world's oil reserves. If, in turn, it could also intimidate Saudi Arabia, the Iraqis would have influence over 45 percent of the world's oil reserves.
This would be bad for the United States, so the argument goes, because President Saddam Hussein would then be able to dominate pricing by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries.
 
In 1970's, No Reprisal for Saudis
But the United States did not threaten Saudi Arabia in the early 1970's when Riyadh totally dominated OPEC oil pricing and even used an oil boycott to try to force Washington to change its policies toward Israel.
Why is the United States' reaction different when Iraq is doing the dominating?
The answer, officials say, is that President Saddam Hussein of Iraq wants oil prices to rise more quickly than Saudi Arabia does.
At the OPEC meeting last month, before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, President Hussein was pressing his OPEC colleagues to increase prices from around $15 a barrel to $25.
The other OPEC producers, including Saudi Arabia, shared his desire for a higher price, but they wanted a price of only $21 a barrel so as not to stimulate alternative energy production by the West. #5 Cents a Gallon More The difference for Americans between $21 a barrel and $25 a barrel is about 5 cents a gallon at the gasoline station pump.
In other words, by the price argument, one reason that the Bush Administration is sending 100,000 soldiers to Saudi Arabia is for the sake of 5 cents a gallon less. Some people say that in some ways it would actually be in the American interest to have higher oil prices, to rekindle research and development of alternative energy sources.
Such research was on its way to making the United States more independent of foreign oil before the Reagan and Bush Administrations abandoned support for the projects.
But officials argue that there is a lot more at stake than a 5 cent increase at the pump. President Hussein, they say, was only asking for $25 a barrel because he did not then dominate OPEC enough to seek more.
Oil is the single most important commodity in the industrial world, and its assured supply at reasonable prices is considered essential for economic growth - not just in the United States but also in Western Europe, Japan and the world at large.
If the Iraqi leader could, directly or indirectly, control 40 percent of the world's oil reserves, they go on, who knows what price he would demand -$40 a barrel? Maybe $50 a barrel?
Such an increase would almost surely tip all Western economies into recession. But it is not at all clear that Mr. Hussein would have any more interest in raising oil prices to $50 a barrel than Saudi Arabia did when it dominated OPEC.
The Iraqis understand the world oil market as well as the Saudis. That means understanding that if prices are pushed too high too fast, the West will find alternative energy sources, which will sooner or later drive the price of oil way down.
 
Saudis More Responsive
The second category is control of the oil. It is in the American interest, so the argument goes, that control of oil be divided among many states. But to the extent that it is not, Washington would like control to be in Saudi hands.
The reason is that, unlike Iraq, Saudi Arabia's leaders have historically been more responsive to American interests and staunchly anti-Soviet. President Bush cannot say that out loud, though, because it would embarrass the Saudi monarchy.
The United States is not sending troops to the gulf simply to help Saudi Arabia resist aggression. It is sending troops to support the OPEC country that is more likely to cater to Washington's interests.
In the past, when the United States was confronting the Soviet Union and competing for influence with Moscow in the Middle East, the stake in whose allies controlled what oil reserves had a military and strategic dimension. But today, with the Soviet Union cooperating in this crisis, that argument has lost much of its urgency.
The third and final vital interest at stake, Administration officials say, is the stability of the post-cold war world. If President Hussein gets away with taking over Kuwait by force, then other regional powers might be tempted to use similar means to advance their interests in their corners of the world.
That, officials say, means that is essential for future world stability that the United States and Soviet Union stand together and give a clear signal that such action will not be tolerated. The sovereignty of nations must be upheld.
As Secretary of State Baker said in a speech to NATO this week, ''If might is to make right, then the world will be plunged into a new dark age.''
 
U.S. Violates the Credo
Yet, the Administration has not always acted on that credo in other areas of the world. During its first 18 months in office it supported a policy in Cambodia that would eventually have involved bringing the Khmer Rouge guerrillas back into the ruling coalition.
The Khmer Rouge are held responsible for the deaths of more than a million Cambodians during their reign of terror in the 1970's. Although American policy has now been altered, might-makes-right was considered acceptable for Cambodia because it served the American strategic interest of countering the influence of the pro-Soviet Vietnamese Government.
In other words, both the might-makes-right arguments and those of national sovereignty are really, at best, more palatable ways of saying that the United States interest in preserving the status quo and stability in the Persian Gulf in primarily economic.
At root, then, the vital interests to which President Bush referred are both genuine and significant, given America's current dependence on foreign oil. Laid bare, American policy in the gulf comes down to this: troops have been sent to retain control of oil in the hands of a pro-American Saudi Arabia, so prices will remain low.
As an editorial cartoon in The Boston Globe on Thursday suggested, the interest at stake may be, in short, to make the world safe for gas guzzlers. The cartoon shows President Bush in the Oval Office addressing the American people. He says: ''Fellow Americans, I have sent our troops to the Middle East. . . . They are there to defend the security . . . the value . . . the principle we hold dear - 18 miles per gallon.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
ARAB TROOPS JOIN SAUDI FORCE; BUSH SAYS HE HOPES THE IRAQIS 'DO SOMETHING' ABOUT HUSSEIN

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 11

 BODY:
As Egyptian and Moroccan troops began landing in Saudi Arabia to guard against the threat of an Iraqi invasion, President Bush made it plain today that it would please him if President Saddam Hussein of Iraq were to be overthrown.
Egypt and Morocco planned to send about 5,000 troops each to Saudi Arabia, probably with artillery and armored support, according to diplomats here.
Syrian officials said Damascus would also take part in the joint effort, which was approved on Friday at an Arab meeting in Cairo, possibly by sending troops to one of the tiny emirates at the mouth of the Persian Gulf that have been worried that they, too, might be invaded by Iraq.
 
Gunfire Reported on Saudi Soil
In the first word of gunfire on Saudi territory, diplomats in Riyadh reported that Saudi antiaircraft batteries had shot at two Iraqi reconnaissance planes near the Kuwaiti-Saudi border, The Associated Press said. An unidentified Saudi official quoted by the news agency disputed their accounts. The envoys said the Saudis fired about 10 rounds near but not at the planes, which then turned back without crossing the border. 
Answering reporters' questions at his vacation home in Kennebunkport, Me., this afternoon, President Bush said the United States could not take any active part in ousting the Iraqi dictator. But he said, ''Whatever it takes to have our objectives met is what should take place.''
He said he expected President Hussein to respect the borders of Iraq's neighbors, adding: ''If that means Saddam Hussein changes his spots, so be it. If he doesn't, I hope the Iraqi people do something about it.'' [Excerpts from Mr. Bush's remarks, page 12.] Doubts on Peaceful Solution Mr. Bush also declared more bluntly than before that he and other leaders intended to use naval force to prevent Iraq from exporting oil.
''I think things are moving in the right direction,'' President Bush said as forces from a dozen countries converged on Saudi Arabia to join the multinational defense effort. But he suggested, without elaboration, that he thought that there was still room for a diplomatic solution to the crisis.
In Cairo, President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt expressed a markedly different view. Asked about the chances of a peaceful solution, which he had spent the last week seeking, he replied, ''I want to tell you honestly, and note that I am always optimistic, there is no hope of that.'' #10-Year-Old Reaches Jordan More than 5,000 American troops are believed to be in Saudi Arabia, and the total is expected to reach 100,000 in the next month or two, although United States officials have refused to supply any official figures.
As the Arab troops arrived at Hafr al Baten, a Saudi air base near Dhahran, a group of 11 Americans, including Penelope Nabokov, a 10-year-old California girl trapped in Kuwait while traveling alone, reached Jordan after a grueling 660-mile bus journey across Iraq. The 10 other members of the party were diplomats and their families.
 
More Foreigners Escape
Five West Germans and 21 Britons also escaped from Iraq or Kuwait, whose borders were sealed for all but diplomats by Baghdad on Thursday. And an estimated 32 foreigners, mostly Americans and Britons, reportedly arrived in Bahrain today after escaping from Kuwait and traveling across the desert with the help of Bedouin guides.
But there was no success in persuading the Government of President Hussein to permit the departure of 3,500 other Americans still trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, which Iraq annexed this week.
Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, said the United States Embassy in Baghdad ''is in contact almost hourly'' with Iraqi officials to try to insure the Americans' safety.
''We're hopeful that we will be able to resolve the situation,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said. ''So far as we know, no American has been mistreated as yet.''
The American buildup in Saudi Arabia, also centered on Hafr al-Baten, continued with the arrival of more units of the 82d Airborne Division and more C-130 transport planes from Pope Air Force Base, N.C., and F-16 fighters from Shaw Air Froce Base, S.C., the Pentagon said.
Military officers said the aircraft carrier John F. Kennedy would set sail from Norfolk, Va., for the Middle East next week. Its arrival there would give the United States four carriers in the region, unless one of them is sent back to its home port.
King Hussein of Jordan said today that he was not sending Jordanian forces to protect Saudi Arabia unless the United States and other non-Arab nations pulled out, Reuters reported.
In an interview with Cable News Network, the King said that Jordan had ''made it clear to Saudi Arabia'' that ''if they wanted our forces as part of a uniquely Arab force, we certainly would send all the units we could.''
Taking precautions against the possibility that Iraq might try to open a second front by attacking to the north, Turkey moved squadrons of F-4 and F-16 warplanes to several bases near the Iraqi border, newspaper reports in Ankara said. The Italian Defense Minister, Virginio Rognoni, reported Iraqi troop movements near the 200-mile frontier with Turkey.
 
Iraqi Oil Shipments Stifled
Tension between the two countries is high because Turkey, in adherence to United Nations sanctions, has in effect closed the pipelines running from Iraq across its territory to the Mediterranean port of Yumurtalik.
Mr. Rognoni also said Baghdad was massing chemical weapons near the Saudi border. Iraqi diplomats have said publicly in recent days that Iraq would use poison gas if it was attacked.
The White House confirmed that shipments of Iraqi oil through Saudi Arabia and Turkey had been completely cut off. And Mr. Fitzwater said the economic embargo, on which the President is counting to persuade Mr. Hussein to pull his forces out of Kuwait, ''appears to be having a considerable effect.''
Mr. Bush said only one small tanker had been loaded with Iraqi oil since shortly after Iraq invaded neighboring Kuwait before dawn on Aug. 2.
 
Searching Ships for Oil
Although he again avoided the word blockade, the President said the United States and its allies were prepared to stop and search tankers if necessary to insure that no Iraqi oil passed through the Strait of Hormuz, which is Iraq's only outlet to the sea.
Despite dispute on the point at the United Nations, he said the United States, in his view, already had authority from the international organization to halt Iraqi ships.
He said that while he had made ''a decision in principle that exports from Iraq will not get into the market,'' he did not want to use the word blockade because that might disturb other countries who were backing sanctions but whose view of what the United Nations Security Council had authorized might differ from that of the United States.
Intelligence officials said Iraq's economic plight has already reached the point that Baghdad sent Issam Abdul-Rahim al-Chalabi, its Oil Minister, to Syria this week to try to persuade officials there to reopen a pipeline to the Syrian port of Banias that Syria closed during the Iran-Iraq war. Syria and Iraq have been bitter enemies for a number of years, and the mission reportedly failed.
There were indications that Baghdad was preparing for a long economic siege. The Government warned that selling food on the black market would be considered a criminal act of sabotage, punishable by death.
Mr. Bush met today with top foreign-policy aides, including Mr. Baker, the national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and Robert Gates, Mr. Scowcroft's deputy.
 
SYRIA TO SEND TROOPS TO GULF
BEIRUT, Lebanon, Aug. 11 (Special to The New York Times) - Syria, seeing an opportunity to topple President Hussein of Iraq, plans to send troops to the Persian Gulf as part of the force approved in Cairo by an Arab summit conference, people close to the Syrian Government said here today.
They also said that Damascus in addition served notice that it would not come to Iraq's assistance if it is attacked by Israel.
The Syrian military deployment, according to the report from people who did not want to be further identified, will probably be in the United Arab Emirates, one of the tiny states that overlook the gulf and that Baghdad had threatened.

HEADLINE: For Emigre Scientists, Job Hunting Is Difficult

BYLINE: By MARVINE HOWE

 BODY:
While American universities and corporations worry about a future shortfall of research scientists and engineers, Victor Vigdorchik, a theoretical physicist and mathematician from the Ukraine, works as a home attendant in Brooklyn.
Joseph Pilmenstein, who was a senior research chemist in Moscow, spends his time in Jersey City scanning classified advertisements in newspapers and chemical magazines.
Mr. Vigdorchik has sent out 300 resumes in the last two years, to no avail. After 100 rejections, Mr. Pilmenstein is ready to settle for any kind of work. He has removed his Ph.D. in chemistry from his resume. 
Mr. Vigdorchik, Mr. Pilmenstein and thousands of other recent emigres from the Soviet Union who are trained in the sciences have found it impossible to find work in their fields. They are keeping books, driving taxis and working as doormen and guards. Some, like Mr. Pilmenstein, are living on welfare.
 
For the Stars, an Easier Time
Unlike these emigres, the stars of Soviet science are in great demand as visiting scholars at American universities. Some have recently accepted tenured positions: Nikolai Reshetikin, a mathematical physicist, is at Harvard University, and Aleksandr Migdal, a theoretical physicist, is at Princeton University.
''In general, the quality of Soviet work and education is highest in the theoretical area, including mathematics, and many of the stars are in those areas,'' Gerson Sher, director of the United States-Soviet department at the National Science Foundation, said. The Soviets ''are not likely to be so strong'' in fields relying on equipment or experimental research, he said.
The reasons given for the plight of the refugees are legion.
Soviet emigre scientists say the principal obstacles are lack of contacts and American job experience. Some add age or the language barrier, and many say they simply do not know where to look for jobs or how to present themselves at interviews.
 
It Helps to be Well Known
American corporate employers and academicians talk of other handicaps: overqualification or underqualification, unfamiliarity with American standards and the technological gap.
Many universities and corporations are restricting hiring because of the general economic downturn.
''Academic institutions are extremely loath to hire scientists who are not sufficiently famous or sufficiently young,'' said Joel Lebowitz, a professor of mathematics and physics at Rutgers University. He said this specifically affects Soviet scientists, who are generally between the ages of 40 and 65.
Gerald Lieberman, a research professor at Stanford University, said that Stanford and other leading research universities tend to hire well-known names or scientists younger than 35. Stanford has made offers to several distinguished Soviet physicists and mathematicians in the last year.
 
How to Market Themselves
Some leading corporations like Hewlett-Packard Company have imposed hiring controls in the last year and are not actively recruiting new people, said Michele Drake, manager of personnel communications at its Palo Alto, Calif., headquarters.
Arno Penzias, vice president of research at American Telephone and Telegraph Bell Laboratories in Murray Hill, N.J., said that much of the thrust today is in modern technology, ''which is not widely shared by recent Soviet immigrants.''
No one can say how many Soviet refugees with Ph.D.-level degrees in science or engineering are unemployed. The New York Association for New Americans, a resettlement agency, estimates that the 40,000 Soviet Jewish immigrants who arrived last year included 400 Ph.D.-level scientists and 6,000 engineers. Most of them are still seeking jobs in their specialties.
Some experts said that more Soviet scientists would be able to find work if they knew how to market themselves.
 
Learning About Resumes
''They know their subject, but they don't know how to compete in the American system,'' said Rafael Rich, former head of research in a Moscow petrochemical refinery. He now heads the science division of Bnai Zion, a fraternal organization in New York City.
Many Soviet applicants are generalists rather than specialists, Dr. Rich said. Others push their own ideas or talk about family troubles and are not familiar with the needs of the company.
Dr. Rich, who came here in 1979 with a postdoctoral degree in mechanical engineering, passed the American professional engineering examination. He began as a designer at Dupont, rising to senior scientist at the American Standards Testing Bureau in New York.
Now he spends most of his time teaching newly arrived Soviet scientists about resumes, interviews and references. Job-seekers are urged to send reports on their work to recognized authorities so the results will be published and distributed to research and development companies, testing laboratories and universities.
 
Success Stories
Since January, Bnai Zion has helped find jobs for 30 Soviet scientists, but has files on another 350 looking for work. Success stories include: Mark V. Kigel, who was promoted to environmental program manager for Environics of Cranford, N.J.; Igor Klimov, whose patent for an apparatus for the treatment of limbs has interested a California manufacturer, and Sophia Gruzglina, who has obtained a $7,300 grant from the National Science Foundation for her project on compacting powdered materials.
But most of the Soviet newcomers have not found work in their specialties, like Mr. Vigdorchik and Mr. Pilmenstein. Both men are Jewish and left the Soviet Union so their children could live in a freer society.
When Mr. Pilmenstein arrived here a year ago, he said, he believed he would have no trouble finding a job as a chemist because his background, skills and English were good. He scratched his Ph.D. off his resume ''because they may think I'm asking for a high-level job.'' He said he has no regrets because his two children are happy and ''feel this is their country.''
Mr. Vigdorchik and his wife, Lyudmila, a high school mathematics teacher, received permission in 1988 to emigrate with their 19-year-old son, Lev.
 
Advertising for Taxi Drivers
Arriving in the United States, Mr. Vigdorchik found that almost all the job offers in the local Russian newspaper were for taxi drivers, home attendants or manicurists. He is taking a course in computer programming to update his skills. Meanwhile, he and his wife consider themselves lucky to have full-time jobs as home attendants.
''This means Lev can start premedical studies at New York University next year,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Port Authority Plans Outlined

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
The new director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey said last week that he would keep the Authority's $6-billion plans to renovate bridges, tunnels, airports, marine terminals and the PATH system moving forward.
In particular, he said that a people-mover system at Kennedy International Airport would be built.
But Stanley Brezenoff, the 52-year-old former First Deputy Mayor under the Koch administration, said the region's economic problems and competition from other cities posed hurdles for the agency he was named to head last Thursday, and he left open the possibility that the agency would again ask for increases in bridge and tunnel tolls. 
Mr. Brezenoff succeeds Stephen Berger in the $170,000-a-year job as head of a self-supporting public agency that administers the three New York area airports, six bridges and tunnels, the 14-mile PATH system, the World Trade Center, several industrial parks and ports in Newark, Elizabeth, N.J., and Brooklyn.
''Both sides of the Hudson are seeing declining business activity and employment, and there's strong competition from other Eastern seaboard ports,'' he said Friday at a news conference at the World Trade Center. ''A lot of other regions are making big investments in their ports and airports, and the Los Angeles area has moved ahead of New York as a port.'' These factors make it imperative that ''we advance the capital program so the region's competitiveness is enhanced,'' he added.
But because of uncertainties about revenues, he said, there might be a reduction in capital spending this year. The capital program includes $1 billion to renovate PATH stations and tracks and buy new rail cars and $500 million for repairs to the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the George Washington and Staten Island bridges.
Acknowledging that toll increases ''are never pleasant,'' Mr. Brezenoff said that they were only one of several ways to raise money.
Mr. Brezenoff said that traffic jams at Hudson River bridges and tunnels are ''not easy problems to deal with,'' and called for increased support for trans-Hudson mass transit. He also said that creating public-transportation links to the area's three airports was a priority.

HEADLINE: Arab Crisis, as Seen From Carolina

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GREENSBORO, N.C., Aug. 10

 BODY:
As members of the Civitan Club bowed their heads in prayer, a minister reminded them of their good fortune ''in this time of crisis'' to have Representative Howard Coble as their luncheon speaker.
''We pray for him, his wisdom, his judgment and his honesty,'' the minister, Jim Hull declared. And after the invocation, it seemed only fitting that the members, many of them veterans of World War II, would spring from their seats and break into a chorus of ''America the Beautiful.''
The Sixth Congressional District, in the green and hilly midsection of North Carolina's textile country, is a world away from the Persian Gulf, where Iraq has invaded Kuwait and thousands of American troops stand poised. But the talk here is of war. So with their thoughts and their prayers, people turned to their closest link to Government, Congressman Coble. 
Mr. Coble, a backslapping, cigar-puffing conservative Republican who is running for a fourth term, responded with relish, seizing on the public ill will toward President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. ''I think he's meaner than a rattlesnake,'' the 59-year-old Congressman said. ''I think he's a congenital liar.''
 
His Best Source: 'Nightline'
Although members of the civic club prayed for Mr. Coble's wisdom in handling the crisis, the Congressman confessed that he had no role in planning military strategy. His best source of information was ''Nightline,'' he said, and his only briefing from the Administration came a day after the United States sent troops to Saudi Arabia.
''That was a secret meeting,'' he said, ''but most of what I learned at that meeting has since been disseminated and is known to probably all of you in this room.''
Kermit Stubbins, a club member who does accounting work for a car dealership, put it more bluntly. ''I don't think he can do anything,'' he said of the Congressman. ''I don't think he has any say-so.''
Mr. Coble, a lawyer by training, cultivates a country-bumpkin image. (That package of Beech-Nut chewing tobacco on his dashboard is ''for effect,'' an aide says.) So on a tour of the district on Friday, rather than talk about nuances of military and economic strategy, the Congressman confined himself to verbal fusillades at Mr. Hussein (''that S.O.B.'') and unscrupulous service-station operators (''price gougers'').
 
'Have to Play It Hourly'
With a large framed picture of a smiling George Bush as a backdrop, Mr. Coble leaned back at his desk in his Greensboro office and offered this assessment: ''Given the scenario and the cards that were laid on the table, I think the President did about everything he could do.''
As for how many troops the United States should commit to the gulf and whether they should engage in all-out combat, Mr. Coble called that a ''real difficult question.''
''I guess we're just going to have to play it hourly,'' he said.
Mr. Coble is no different from many colleagues returning home for their monthlong recess, who know little more than their constituents about the crisis in the Persian Gulf. While some Democrats say Mr. Bush should make his intentions clearer, no member wants to go on record opposing his initial response.
''I think the President has strong support now and I think that will continue,'' the House Speaker, Thomas S. Foley of Washington, said in an interview. He added that opposition would mount only ''if Congress were to see a lack of support in other countries or a weakening of resolve.''
Helen Allegrone, a political novice who is Mr. Coble's Democratic challenger in the November election, has questioned sending troops to the gulf, but that position does not seem to play well here.
 
'A Mother's Tear'
As Mr. Coble walked up Market Street, the main drag in downtown Greensboro, no one had a bad word for the Administration's actions.
''I'm worried about what's going on across the water,'' said A. R. Wood, a Greensboro police officer making the rounds. ''We have no choice. We've got to do it.''
Fred H. Gregory was one of a handful of constituents who was moved to call Mr. Coble's office about the situation in the gulf. He said he told Mr. Coble's staff that Congress ''should not pussyfoot around'' and should declare war on Iraq. ''I'm not a jingoistic type,'' said Mr. Gregory, a retired Federal investigator. ''But let's go in there and take Hussein out. The world's going to be a lot better off.''
Mr. Coble said he offered ''some words of optimism and encouragement'' to a mother worried that her 23-year-old son would be sent to war. ''I can relate to that,'' he said he told her, ''because when I went to the military during the Korean conflict, I remember my most sad memory of my departure was seeing my mama cry at the bus station right across the street here. I'll never forget that. That was a mother's tear.''
Mr. Coble, who served in the Coast Guard, conceded that he ''never did dodge any Korean lead.'' But he added, ''The fact is, I was going off to war as far as my mama thought.''

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Sanctions on Iraq Appear Effective as Neighbors Block Trade

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
The United Nations embargo on trade with Iraq and Kuwait appears to be throttling shipments of food, military spare parts and other essential goods into the area.
All of Iraq's neighbors have largely closed their borders to trade, a State Department official who insisted that he not be identified said yesterday. But he added that it was unclear whether Jordan, on Iraq's western flank, would forbid food shipments on the truck route from Aqaba on the Red Sea through the Jordanian capital, Amman, to Baghdad. Reuters reported yesterday that trucks loaded with goods had left Amman on the road to Baghdad. 
Moves by United States and its allies to mount a naval blockade have prompted a reduction in Iraqi exports of crude oil to no more than a dribble, shipping and oil industry officials say. Oil exports are Baghdad's main source of money to buy food and weapons.
 
Dependent on Imported Food
Iraq, which has about 17 million people, relies on imports for three-quarters of its food, spending about $2 billion a year. While some rural areas are self-sufficient, the populations of Iraq's two major cities, Baghdad and Basra, depend almost entirely upon imported food.
The United Nations plans to let food shipments to Iraq and Kutwait continue at ''humanitarian'' levels to prevent famine.
Western diplomats said they did not intend to use what they call the ''food weapon'' to starve Iraq, but American officials want a reduction of food to minimum humanitarian levels. ''It can't be business as usual,'' a diplomat said.
Yahya Sadwowski, an expert on Iraq at the Brookings Institution in Washington, suggested that the embargo might stir up popular discontent in Iraq.
''Iraqis have got used to eating a lot of imported meat and rice in recent years,'' he said. ''The major suppliers could force them to switch back to traditional barley, which would be unpopular.''
The Baghdad Government said yesterday that it would sentence to death any ''profiteering merchants'' who hoarded food, Reuters reported. A communique read on Baghdad television said any act of hoarding or monopoly would be considered ''an act of sabotage affecting national security,'' the news agency said. The sentence for hoarding had been 10 to 15 years in prison.
 
Low Stockpiles
Iraq had low stores of food before its invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2, and now has little oil money or access to international markets to replenish its supplies. As of July 25, the Iraqi Government held enough wheat for two months of normal consumption, enough rice for three months, enough beans and barley for a month and less than two weeks' worth of corn, said John P. Parker, an Agriculture Department economist who studies Middle Eastern food supplies.
 
Limited Warehouse Space
An American grain industry executive who asked not to be identified said Iraq's warehouse capacity appeared to be limited, noting that the country needed small, regular shipments of grain because it could not store larger quantities.
Mr. Sadwowski said Iraq had little chance of expanding its agricultural output significantly because of rising salt levels in fertile areas.
The critical economic issue is whether commercial Western oil supplies outlast Iraqi food supplies, said Philip K. Verleger Jr., an economist who studies energy issues at the Institute for International Economics in Washington.
The use of Western governments' strategic petroleum reserves, which the countries have resisted thus far, would extend the period in which they could do without Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, he said. Other oil-producing countries have signaled their willingness to increase output, although such increased production has not yet been seen. But even that extra flow of crude oil would be less than the production of Iraq and Kuwait it is intended to replace.
 
Imported Machinery Needed
''The pinch is going to come in three or four months,'' Mr. Verleger said. ''It looks like Saddam Hussein has decided to sit down for the long term.''
Despite efforts to make itself more self-sufficient, Iraq's industrial economy is also heavily dependent on imported machinery, and its war machine mainly relies on Soviet and French weaponry. Both the Soviet Union and France have pledged to cut off shipments to Iraq.
Jordan, which has been less critical of the occupation of Kuwait than three other neighbors of Iraq - Saudi Arabia, Syria and Turkey - has officially joined the embargo, completing the cordon. The Iraqi border with Iran remains tense and heavily militarized since an eight-year war between the two countries ended less than two years ago.
During the Iran-Iraq war, the 700-mile highway from Aqaba, Jordan, to Baghdad was improved, and convoys of trucks carried tons of needed supplies to Iraq, said Marvin Zonis, a professor at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business who studies Middle Eastern politics and business. But even if each truck could carry 36 metric tons of food, which is roughly the weight limit on American interstate highways, supplying Iraq with wheat alone could require about 9,000 shipments a month.
 
'Logistical Nightmare'
Kuwait is even more dependent on imports, bringing in 96 percent of its food, and from Jordan it is 500 miles beyond Baghdad. ''It's a logistical nightmare,'' said Thomas J. Donohue, the president and chief executive of the American Trucking Associations, a trade group based in Alexandria, Va.
''Saddam Hussein undoubtedly believed that sanctions could not inflict substantial costs on him,'' said Kenneth A. Oye, an associate professor of political science at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who studies international bargaining. ''I do believe these sanctions can inflict such costs.''
Syria has allowed no commerce across its border with Iraq since 1982, when it accused Iraq of having supplied weapons to an uprising in the city of Hama that left 6,000 people dead.
Turkey, the main supplier to Iraq of consumer products ranging from washing machines to tires and batteries, has stopped virtually all trade since Wednesday, said Daryal Batibay, the charge d'affaires of the Turkish Embassy in Washington. Food shipments have virtually stopped, although Turkey has claimed the right to resume them on a limited basis for humanitarian reasons, he said.
Turkey has reserved the right to send shipments of food for humanitarian reasons, in part because 30,000 Turkish construction workers are still in Iraq, he said, adding, ''It's a flexibility we wanted to keep.''
 
Food as a Weapon
The use of food as a weapon against Arab oil producers first received serious discussion in the United States in 1973, and prompted Saudi Arabia to subsidize its agriculture so heavily that it has even exported small quantities of wheat in recent years. But Iraq's agrarian investments were much more modest.
With the exception of a single highway in one low-lying area, the Turkish border with Iraq is a large mountainous region with peaks up to 11,000 feet high and virtually no roads. Smuggling has not been a serious problem along this frontier, Mr. Batibay said.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Poll on Troop Move Shows Support (and Anxiety)

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
Americans rallied around President Bush after he ordered military forces to the Persian Gulf, but the public's support is tempered by an undercurrent of anxiety and skepticism of the sort that has hampered American efforts to project power in the world since Vietnam, according to a poll by The New York Times.
Americans who expected a long war, for example, were far less likely to support sending troops than were those who thought a long war unlikely.
In general, the public was divided over whether the United States would end up fighting Iraq. Half expected a bloodless resolution to the confrontation, but a third said they expected fighting. The rest said they did not know what to expect. 
Showing the same support that the population typically has of presidents at the start of past foreign crises, 74 percent of Americans said they approved of the way Mr. Bush was dealing with Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
 
Contrasting Historical Views
But reservations were close to the surface among the 670 people interviewed by telephone on Thursday and Friday. While 6 out of 10 accepted Mr. Bush's comparison of President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to Hitler, 4 out of 10, in answering a separate question, said they agreed with a different historical parallel: that getting involved in the Middle East is a lot like getting involved in Vietnam in the 1960's.
Americans conceded in the Times poll, which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points, that they had known little about Iraq and Kuwait just two weeks ago. Only a quarter of those surveyed correctly identified the government of Saudi Arabia as a monarchy.
Celinda Lake, a Democratic poll taker, said that as recently as last Monday people she interviewed were having trouble grasping that the confrontation was with Iraq, not Iran.
It has become axiomatic, particularly since America's failure in Vietnam, that the outcome military efforts is heavily dependent on the reaction of the public.
The movement of United States troops to Saudi Arabia, America's first important post-cold war military action outside the hemisphere, will be a test of President Bush's ability to hold the support of a public that has been turning increasingly homeward since the collapse of Communism. Indeed, before Iraqi tanks rolled into Kuwait 10 days ago, some political analysts had even begun using terms like ''neo isolationist'' to describe emerging American attitudes.
 
General Fear of Entanglements
Given the public's lack of knowledge about the details of the conflict, the poll's findings suggest that the uneasiness is more an expression of general fear of foreign entanglements than of opposition to the specific actions in the Persian Gulf.
Support for the American intervention was strongest among the best educated, those with the highest incomes and those who had been following the news from the area most closely. It was weakest among women, blacks, those with lower incomes and less education, and those paying least attention.
A similiar pattern has been noted by historians studying the early stages of the Vietnam War. The well-educated and well-informed tended to support President Lyndon B. Johnson's initial commitments, while the less-educated and less-informed, many more of whom were being called upon to fight, tended to be more opposed. It was only later, when opinion leaders became divided, that a sense of disunity enveloped the nation.
Politicians around the country last week were already noticing the double edge of public opinion about the Persian Gulf.
''It is not a clear message,'' said Senator Paul Simon, Democrat of Illinois. ''The majority say, 'Let's stand up to this guy,' '' referring to the Mr. Hussein.
Mr. Simon, who is campaigning for re-election, said he shares this view, but added: ''There is a second wave of public opinion which says, 'Don't let American troops get involved there.' There are two different threads of public opinion. Vietnam is still a part of our heritage. There are those who say, 'Let's not get involved.' ''
 
A Consistent Apprehension
Through a series of questions, a remarkably consistent 4 out of 10 Americans in the poll expressed reservations about the American intervention.
Even though President Bush emphasized that he had exhausted other options, 4 in 10 Americans said he was too quick to send troops.
Even though Mr. Bush addressed the nation and held a news conference on Wednesday, the day before the survey began, 4 in 10 also said he had not clearly explained why United States troops were sent.
And even though the President said the nation's vital interests were at stake, 4 in 10 again said that American intervention just helped to protect the profits of the big oil companies.
Different people expressed different reservations, so all told, two thirds of those surveyed agreed with at least one of those negative sentiments.
 
Support for the President
But Americans are not translating this undercurrent of concern into overall disapproval. Political scientists have long noted a ''rally-round-the-flag'' phenomenon, in which trouble overseas, from the Cuban missle crisis to the invasion of Panama, is followed by a temporary jump in a President's standing.
In keeping with that, President Bush's action in the Persian Gulf appears to have reversed a slide in his approval ratings that had been under way for a number of weeks and was being accelerated by increasing public awareness of economic deterioration.
In the latest poll, 72 percent said they approved of how Mr. Bush was handling his job and 19 percent said they disapproved.
Mr. Bush's approval rating was up from 60 percent in a Gallup Poll conducted July 19-22, after Mr. Bush abandoned his ''no new taxes'' pledge.
The jump in Mr. Bush's approval was measurable even in the course of the week. A poll by CBS News on Tuesday and Wednesday, just as he announced American military intervention, found 66 percent approved the way he was handling the Presidency and 22 percent disapproved.
 
Political Implications
The number of Americans who say they were paying close attention to the Persian Gulf situation has, not surprisingly, increased sharply in the past week, from 18 percent in a Gallup Poll last weekend, shortly after the Iraqi invasion, to 28 percent in the CBS News poll at midweek, to 37 percent by the end of the week in the New York Times Poll.
Since those who said they paid more attention tended to be the most supportive of American involvement, the increasing number of Amerians now following the developments will provide Mr. Bush with a chance to consolidate support in the days ahead.
On an issue related to the Persian Gulf crisis there was widespread agreement in the poll. Seven out of ten Americans said the upsurge in oil prices came because the oil companies were basically greedy.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Japanese Discord on Iraq Raises Doubts About Premier's Trip

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
The crisis in the Persian Gulf has stirred unusual discord in Japan over how boldly to assert its leadership in denouncing Iraq and seeking oil supplies from other countries in the region, Government officials say.
The disagreements, which have leaked into the open in recent days, are raising doubts about whether Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu will be able to leave on Wednesday for his long-scheduled tour of the Middle East, including Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt.
The trip was planned months ago, and Mr. Kaifu and other officials said on Friday that he intends to go ahead. But officials also acknowledged that many colleagues, particularly in the governing Liberal Democratic Party, who fear the trip could turn into a debacle had pressed him to cancel it. 
The main concern is that by going to the region now, Mr. Kaifu might alienate Iraq and annoy other oil-producing countries by seeming to press them to pump more oil. Some aides were described as fearful that the Prime Minister would lose popularity at home by behaving like a supplicant.
 
Role in Guarding the Oil Flow
On the other hand, others say they fear that a last-minute cancellation would weaken Japan's image and undercut the arguments of officials that Tokyo was beginning to assert political leadership commensurate with its status as an economic superpower.
The Japanese position illustrates the special difficulties of the country that depends more than any other on oil from the Middle East, but which remains mired in longtime debates about whether it can afford to stir animosities by pursuing its economic interests boldly around the world.
Japan has traditionally acted cautiously in the Middle East, letting the United States and others take the lead in protecting the flow of oil. Its behavior has drawn criticism that Japan was getting a free ride while others were willing to take action.
After Iraq invaded Kuwait last week, Japan initially responded that it would boycott Iraqi oil after the United Nations Security Council acted. Then three days later, when it became apparent that the Security Council would act, Japan said it would indeed halt all purchases from Iraq and Kuwait.
The action cut off an eighth of Japan's oil supplies and sent the Tokyo stock market skidding.
 
'Weakest Link in the Chain'
''In terms of everyone's oil dependence, Japan is the weakest link in the chain,'' said Kazuo Nukuzawa, managing director of Keidanren, Japan's largest industrial trade association. ''So it cannot be helped that we took a long time to act. It looks like hesitation, but I would call it prudence.''
An American official said that Japan should not be criticized for its initial hesitation on sanctions against Iraq. ''We were impressed,'' he said. ''If you look at past crises, the Japanese response was really unprecedented in terms of comprehensiveness and speed.''
But there was another set of mixed signals on the question of the American decision to send troops to Saudi Arabia to protect against a further Iraqi incursion.
 
Discord Over Kaifu Trip
Initially, Japan declined to support the American action. On Wednesday, the Government's chief spokesman, Misoji Sakamoto, said of President Bush's action, ''The United States has made an independent decision and Japan cannot comment on that.''
But on Friday Foreign Ministry officials, when asked, said that Japan supported the American move wholeheartedly.
The initial wavering was explained as in line with Japan's resistance to endorsing the use of force. But critics say Japan is still trying to benefit from American actions but be free of the controversy surrounding them.
The disagreement over Mr. Kaifu's trip came into the open when Kabun Muto, the Minister for International Trade and Industry, said earlier this week that Prime Minister Kaifu would press Saudi Arabia and other oil-producing countries to make up for the losses of oil from Iraq.
 
Premier Seeks to Go Ahead
His comments were subsequently dismissed by Foreign Ministry officials, who said that Mr. Kaifu would not necessarily say any such thing, since such a move by the Saudis might provoke an Iraqi invasion.
Mr. Kaifu's trip is to begin on Aug. 15 and to take him to Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Oman, Jordan and Egypt, the first visit by a Japanese leader to the Middle East in 12 years.
According to some news reports, Mr. Kaifu was the one person in the Government most insistent on going forward with the trip. He was said to be supported by the Foreign Ministry, which has long advocated a more bold approach by Japan in foreign policy.

HEADLINE: CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF;
Allies Reminded of Need for U.S. Shield

BYLINE: By ALAN RIDING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BRUSSELS, Aug. 10

 BODY:
Just as Washington was preparing to lower its profile in Europe in the new post-cold war era, the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait has abruptly reminded Western Europe that it still looks to the United States to defend its vital security interests.
Even though Western Europe has at least as much at stake in the Persian Gulf as the United States, it has waited for the Bush Administration to define the West's response to the crisis. It has then closed ranks behind Washington, albeit allowing the United States to assume the main risks and responsibilities.
As a result, the terms of the trans-Atlantic relationship, which had been slowly adjusting to the collapse of the Warsaw Pact, have once again changed. Experts now expect less questioning of Washington's leadership, a more cautious approach to future military cuts and new demands for the modernization of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. 
''The Iraqi crisis has been a sobering experience,'' a European official at NATO said. ''It has demonstrated the limits of European power, and it has shown that only the United States can play the role of global policeman.''
 
NATO as Political Forum
In this case, the United States has taken the lead because NATO is prohibited by its charter from operating militarily outside Europe and North America. But Washington has pointedly emphasized NATO's continued relevance by using it as a forum for political consultations.
On Friday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d went out of his way to brief NATO Foreign Ministers on the results of his trip to Turkey on Thursday and on United States plans for forcing Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait. Much as it did routinely during the cold war, the alliance then pledged support for Washington's strategy.
In recent months, the premise of debate at the Brussels headquarters of NATO and the 12-nation European Community has been that as the demise of communism gives shape to a new Europe, the United States would inevitably play a less-dominant security role than it has here over the last 45 years.
Preparations were already under way for the withdrawal of some American troops from Germany, while the idea that Europe should assume greater responsibility for its own defense was gaining ground. At the same time, economic strength was feeding the European Community's confidence to act independently on the world stage.
 
A New Role Is Sought
Having lost its main reason for existence with the waning of the Soviet threat, NATO was also busily trying to define a new role for itself. Some nations, notably France, even favored switching the political focus away from the 16-nation NATO to the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, where Washington's influence would be smaller.
But now, overnight, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait has exposed Western Europe's inability or reluctance to project its power much beyond its own borders. And having long needed Washington to protect it from the Soviet Union, it now counts on the United States to tame a dictator who consolidated his power thanks in part to European armaments and credits.
''Only the Americans can mount a swift military response to a challenge of this sort outside the NATO area,'' The Independent, a British newspaper, said in an editorial Friday. ''Europe simply has to decide whether to tag along, although its interests are just as threatened as those of the United States. Its defense remains in American hands.''
One NATO member, Turkey, shares a border with Iraq, and if it is attacked, NATO is committed to coming to its defense.
 
Dependent on Oil Imports
With most Western European countries heavily dependent on oil imports from the Middle East, escalation of the crisis would cause havoc to their economies. Until last week, for instance, Denmark obtained 54 percent of its oil from Kuwait.
Washington has nonetheless seen its allies follow its lead. Britain has joined the United States-led multinational force protecting Saudi Arabia. France, stressing that it is acting independently and not as part of the multinational force, has sent an aircraft carrier and five warships to the Persian Gulf, while Canada and Australia have announced they too will send naval vessels to the zone. Spain, the Netherlands and Belgium are reportedly considering doing likewise.
Even with no end to the Iraqi crisis in sight, NATO and European Community officials said it had already provided several lessons, not least that regional conflicts may be more likely now that a Soviet Union bent on improving relations with the West has lost influence over such former clients as Iraq.
NATO officials also said Iraq's aggression was certain to affect the current debate about military cuts and the so-called ''peace dividend'' in Washington and many Western European capitals. ''A lot of people who were warning against rapid disarmament must be very happy this has happened,'' an official said.
 
New Doubts Are Raised
For the European Community, which was considering developing a ''security dimension'' outside NATO as part of its moves toward economic and political union, the crisis has raised fresh doubts about the viability of a new military organization that excludes the United States.
The Western European Union, a security body comprising nine European NATO members, has so far ignored the Iraqi conflict, although it is to meet in Paris later this month. In 1987, it coordinated warships from several European countries that were sent to protect oil tankers in the Persian Gulf.
But it is not viewed as an alternative to NATO. A European official said Europe would need ''time, hardware and organization'' to build a integrated military structure. ''This would affect the American stake in Europe,'' he said, ''and I don't think anyone wants to see the Americans leaving now.''
The United States, in contrast, makes no secret of its view that Europe should contribute more to its own defense. ''The irony is that we keep telling the Europeans that we don't want to act alone,'' an American official said. ''We'd be happy if they did more. We would prefer it to be done through NATO, but we're not holding them back.''
 
France Prefers to Act Alone
At the last NATO summit meeting, in London in June, the United States urged its allies to consider not only a new political role for the alliance, but also new rules to enable it to address ''out of area'' conflicts that affect the security of member states.
Already, the crisis has had telling effects on the trans-Atlantic relationship. France, for instance, has confirmed that it prefers to act alone rather than bow publicly to Washington's leadership. West Germany, the dominant European power, has also shown itself reluctant to become involved in extra-regional conflicts.
On the other hand, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who has been visibly distressed to see Washington using Bonn as its main European interlocutor over the last year, has jumped at the chance of demonstrating that Britain remains the most steadfast ally of the United States.
By chance, she was in the United States at the time of the Iraqi invasion. Twice in four days, she could be seen ''co-managing'' the crisis with President Bush. And when she returned to London Tuesday, she immediately gave orders for Britain to join the United States in the multinational force defending Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: One Sign of Our Times: World's Refugee Flood

BYLINE: By HENRY KAMM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA

 BODY:
Fifteen million men, women and children are biding their time outside their countries, often in great deprivation, internationally recognized as refugees.
Officials concerned with the problems of uprooted people believe these refugees to be only part of one of the overriding problems of this age.
Thorvald Stoltenberg, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, sees those who have been granted refugee status as the formally acknowledged segment of a worldwide mass movement of the deprived toward more prosperous regions.
Official and nonofficial specialists the world over share his perception.
 
Asylum Requests Grow Swiftly
Increasingly, such newcomers seek the protection of refugee status to legitimize their stay, despite efforts by governments to limit asylum requests. 
Applications to Europe, the United States and Canada, the traditional asylum-granting regions, have risen from 25,000 in 1973 to 600,000 this year, according to estimates. That does not include migrants living short of legality in parts of the world.
The situation now is similar in ways to the great refugee upheavals of World War II. John A. Scanlan, an Indiana University Law School professor who is an authority on the subject, said that a State Department report in June 1945 estimated the total of refugees at 33 million to 43 million. He said that by the end of 1948, the total had dropped more than half, to somewhere between 16 million and 18 million.
In recent years, countries have used various measures to thwart applications for asylum, like the United States policy of turning back Haitian boat people while they are still at sea.
Roger P. Winter, director of the United States Committee for Refugees, said in an interview in Washington that of 22,000 Haitians intercepted by the Coast Guard since 1981, only 6 had been allowed to proceed to port.
Officials of the High Commissioner's agency said that immigration officials in Western Europe often search airliners before allowing passengers to get off, and turn back potential asylum seekers before they can apply. Sometimes, the officials go to countries likely to produce refugees and sit next to airline employees at check-in counters to deny boarding passes to people suspected of wanting asylum. Who Is a True Refugee? The stream of migrants is blurring established definitions of who is a refugee and casts suspicion over the motives of those who claim asylum to escape violence or persecution in their own countries.
Mr. Stoltenberg said such suspiciousness was wrong because morally the motivation of people fleeing poverty was equally valid.
''The problem is poverty,'' said Mr. Stoltenberg, who is 59 years old and a former Minister of Defense and Foreign Affair in Norway as well as a longtime leader of the Labor Party. ''The majority of the world live in deep poverty.
''People will say: 'Why should this happen now? After all, we have had poverty since historic times.' They forget that we have had two revolutions.
''First, there is the information revolution. People now, even if they are very poor, know how people live in other parts of the world.
''The other is the transport revolution. It is much easier than before to be transported over long distances. We cannot hide away anymore. You can't hide away from the world.''
 
Boat People Symbolize Plight
Throughout a 90-minute interview at his agency's headquarters, the High Commissioner singled out the controversy over the plight of Vietnamese boat people in Hong Kong as characterizing the complexities of the problem.
It encapsulates the grave questions posed by the mass movements, and illustrates the divisions provoked among those who receive appeals for asylum and the dilemma confronted by those who are entrusted with the care of the uprooted.
''The Hong Kong situation is a symbol of what might face us all over the world,'' Mr. Stoltenberg said.
About 55,000 Vietnamese are confined in camps intentionally kept at minimum survival level by the British colonial authorities to deter further arrivals. ''People are living on shelves,'' said the High Commissioner.
In a screening started by Britain in 1988, which broke its 13-year pattern of automatically granting refugee status to fleeing Vietnamese, most boat people have been labeled ''economic migrants,'' meaning they fled not persecution but poverty.
 
Forcible Repatriation
Under an agreement reached by all concerned countries under the High Commissioner's auspices last year, those ''screened out'' are to be returned to Vietnam.
That assent by the organization charged with being the advocate for refugees has provoked internal debate in the agency and nongovernmental refugee organizations. If voluntary returns do not resolve the problem, forcible repatriation, for which no date was set, was implictly agreed to.
About 4,000 Vietnamese have gone back of their free will and 51 were deported in November. Forced returns were then suspended because Vietnam and the United States, in rare agreement, raised strenuous objections.
The issue has led to intense controversy, as Britain and the Southeast Asian nations that are the refugee boats' first ports of call demand forced return.
Malaysia, Thailand and other countries of ''first asylum'' have pushed most new refugee boats back out to sea. They and Britain demand that the United States either accept for asylum all Vietnamese refugees or drop its opposition to forcible return.
 
Political Refugees Favored
''The usual principle is that those who are political refugees get asylum, those who are not have to go back,'' the High Commissioner said.
Outlining the controversy over whether that should apply in Hong Kong, he continued: ''I try to get consensus, because if I don't manage that, the alternative is rather gloomy. It will be breakdown of 'first asylum,' and it would mean drowning of tens, hundreds, maybe more people.''
The High Commissioner said that his organization was formally responsible only for those who are granted refugee status. ''But at the same time, I do fully respect those who flee their countries because of poverty, because it may be more dangerous to go back to poverty than to political persecution,'' he said.
Nonetheless, he said, to safeguard the possibility of finding asylum for refugees, repatriation is necessary. He said his office monitored the safety of those who had returned and provided economic assistance to the communities from which they had come to stimulate people not to leave.
 
'Psychologically Filled Up'
That is outside his agency's formal mandate, he said, but if there is no repatriation of migrants declared illegal, the world's readiness to grant asylum to recognized political refugees would break down. He said potential asylum countries were not necessarily ''physically filled up but psychologically filled up.''
Refugee officials and representatives of nongovernmental organizations devoted to the problem agree with the High Commissioner's view that the sense of being ''filled up'' has led to increasing restriction on the part of Western Governments. ''Most governments feel they are on the verge of losing control,'' Mr. Stoltenberg said. ''I definitely fear a Fortress Europe.'' Dennis McNamara, until recently deputy director of the High Commissioner's International Protection Division, wrote in an article soon to be published in Refugees, the agency's monthly, that in seeking to limit the flow of potential asylum-seekers, Governments have introduced measures that ''often ignore the crucial distinction between refugees or asylum-seekers and ordinary migrants'' and endanger the principle of refugee protection.
He listed strict advance visa requirements and heavy penalties for airlines that transport people without evidence of approved entry at their destinations. As an example, Mr. McNamara said such practices had greatly curtailed the movement to Europe of Tamils seeking refuge from the civil war in Sri Lanka.
 
Aftermath of World War II
Emphasizing that the number of present and potential uprooted people far exceeded the 15 million under his care, the High Commissioner said that even the 15 million for the most part no longer fit the definition on which his organization's mandate, dating to 1951 and expanded in 1967, is based.
It was intended to fit the refugees of the aftermath of World War II and the subsequent takeover of Eastern and Central Europe by the Soviet Union.
''In 1951, there was a limited group of people that needed to be helped, and they all came from the same environment,'' he said, noting their largely European background that fitted them readily into Western countries of asylum. ''It was relatively easy to be nice and kind. Today, it is a global issue.''
Much of the emphasis in the High Commissioner's tasks has shifted to assuring temporary asylum and feeding and housing vast groups more than protecting individual rights and helping refugees to find resettlement.
''There are millions outside their countries without prospect, hope or desire for a resettlement,'' said Court Robinson of the United States committee. ''They are offered no prospect of resettlement and none of going home.''
The biggest group, even allowing for what is believed to be inflated numbers, consists of 3.2 million Afghans in Pakistan and 2.3 million in Iran. #4.4 Million African Refugees Civil strife has produced 4.4 million refugees in Africa. The largest single group is 820,000 from Mozambique who have found asylum in Malawi, one of the world's poorest nations.
Mr. Stoltenberg said the Horn of Africa, which he considers the most intractable problem region, showed ''the trends of our time.'' He said, ''We don't have wars between states any longer, but we have 38 wars within states.''
As a result, 685,000 Ethiopians are reported to have taken refuge in Sudan, 384,000 Sudanese and 324,000 Somalians in Ethiopia, and 600,000 Ethiopians in Somalia. Most of those figures are widely held to be exaggerated.
About a million refugees have been resettled in the United States, 447,000 in Canada and 822,000 in Europe. Those statistics do not include people who have become citizens of their new countries or asylum-seekers. In Latin America, 1.2 million have been resettled.
''I am convinced that we will have a future with much more movement of people,'' the High Commissioner said. ''There is no doubt. That is a part of the future that we have shaped. My worry is that we will not be able to cope with those who flee from poverty.''

Back to Class To Study Japan And Its Language

DATELINE: HANOVER, N.H.

 BODY:
Although a Dartmouth College student might spend years preparing for a Wall Street career, a group of executives is reversing the process, going from the board room to the classroom.
Executives are trading their briefcases and suits for backpacks and T-shirts for what the college says is the only Japanese language and culture program in the United States.
From early morning until midnight in the new program, executives from I.B.M., Sears, Corning and other companies are split into small groups. There are nine instructors for the eight executives. 
In one room several executives learned to give directions by moving plastic people from the United States Embassy to the post office on a three-dimensional map of Tokyo. Then they sang the Japanese words for body parts, to the tunes of familiar songs. $5,600 for 12 Days Students in another room learned to tell time. When an executive mistook 1 o'clock for 2 o'clock, a colleague said, ''I made the meeting and you missed it!''
The 12-day program, which costs $5,600 a person, combines language skills with cultural and historical background. ''Words are only half the language,'' said John Rassias, director of Language Outreach here and creator of an instructional method that puts the student at center stage and requires the use of language in real-life scenarios.
To be successful overseas, people should be sensitive to cultural values, Mr. Rassias said, adding, ''The minute you understand the culture the language is no longer alien.''
Business deals can fall through because no one has made an effort to become familiar with customs and cultural values, he added. ''When you're in the board room,'' Mr. Rassias said, ''you have to play their game.''
An executive can add to his productivity by understanding the perspectives of others, said Dick Ver Eecke, an I.B.M. executive who lives in Tokyo. Mr. Ver Eecke said his Japanese counterparts would appreciate his efforts to learn their language.
The participants fall essentially into three levels of experience, according to Gary Garrabrant, a vice president of Bankers Trust Company. ''There are the people who already live in Japan, the people who are moving there and the commuters,'' he said, adding that he commutes there two to four times a year.
Extensive readings and lectures on interpersonal relations and advertising are included in the program.
The executive director of the Dartmouth Institute, Jan Bent, was a primary force behind the creation of the program, which the institute co-sponsors. She said the program is the only one of its kind in the nation.
The institute runs educational and cultural programs for alumni and business executives. This is the first time in its 19-year history that it has worked in conjunction with Mr. Rassias and his language outreach program.
Ms. Bent said she expected companies to realize that Dartmouth has ''something that will certainly benefit their bottom line.''

Black Students Learn How to Be Entrepreneurs

DATELINE: ST. LOUIS

 BODY:
Until this summer, said Kory T. Morrow, a 16-year-old high school student here, he never even considered opening his own business. But with the guidance of the Minority Youth Entrepreneurship Program at the John M. Olin School of Business at Washington University in St. Louis, he and four other youths wrote detailed plans to open a mail-order software company.
Using skills learned in the eight-week program, Mr. Morrow's five-member team evaluated potential markets, calculated financial projections and laid plans for operations and management.
''The accounting was hard at first, but we finally got it,'' he said. 
The result is a business plan so solid that the program's judges gave it first place and, for the first time in the program's history, recommended that the students try to find financing and put it into operation.
 
Beat 7 Other Plans
The plan envisioned ways to sell software using basketball, wrestling and airplane-shooting games to teach mathematics that was written by Robert L. Hines, 17, one of the students in Mr. Morrow's group. It beat plans from seven other groups to develop an environmentally safe insect spray, publish a newspaper for blacks in St. Louis, form a custom-bathroom-building company, open an art gallery and start other companies.
Each member of the winning team received a four-year $500-a-year scholarship from the Urban League of St. Louis.
Maurice Wallace, the program's director, said some of the black entrepreneurs who made presentations during the program might be able to help raise capital for the students.
The Minority Youth Entrepreneurship Program was founded in 1987 after several black St. Louis businessmen discussed how limited opportunities were for blacks in the United States economy and how few black role models there were.
 
Black Entrepreneurs Speak
''These young African-American men and women don't have a real exposure to entrepreneurs in real life, so they don't have expectations to become an entrepreneur,'' said Ronald Thompson, the owner of St. Louis-based General Railroad Equipment and Service, one of the program's founders.
The program is free and is open to black students who have completed their junior years of high school. Forty participants are selected on the basis of essays, interviews and high school transcripts.
During the first half of the eight-week program, Olin professors teach a courses in accounting, management strategies and other topics, Mr. Thompson said.
The academic objective is ''to give them enough to think like successful entrepreneurs,'' said James Little, an associate professor of economics and finance.
The second month features talks by successful minority entrepreneurs from all over the nation. ''Most people seem to think 'Well, I'll go through college and then work for someone,' '' said Clarence Rogers, a student in last year's program. ''We see men like Ron Thompson succeed at what they do. It's very inspirational.''
 
Field Trips to Offices
''Most of all, I learned how the business world operates, how the real world is,'' said Mr. Morrow, who attends the Academy of Math and Science, a magnet high school here.
Mr. Thompson said students are also tutored in writing, oral presentation and study skills, and taught to run spreadsheets, word-processing software and data-base programs on computers. They also make field trips to offices and factories.
From the second week on, groups of five students work on plans for mock companies, preparing analyses of potential markets, financial projections, and operations and management plans.
''The academics really came to bear in the business plans,'' said Mr. Rogers, who will be a freshman at Washington University this fall.
Girard Hankins, president of Gateway National Bank and a speaker at this year's program, said: ''The future of the race in this country is if we can get a better understanding of what makes business tick.''

Improving Ties With the Nations Of the Pacific Rim

DATELINE: BERKELEY, Calif.

 BODY:
When Robert McCann, a graduate student, traveled to Thailand in June to begin studying that country's language, he joined a growing number of students from the University of California system. Their academic interests lie in helping California tighten its cultural and economic ties with Pacific Rim countries.
In the 1990-91 academic year, 458 students will study in 13 countries, according to the university's Education Abroad Program. That is more than five times as many students as in 1982-83, when a total of 86 participated in six countries. 
Increased trade and cultural integration between California and Pacific Rim countries led the State Legislature in the early 80's to direct the program to focus on the region, said Theony Condos, special assistant for international education in the office of David P. Gardner, president of the nine campuses of the University of California.
''If California is going to be competitive on the world market, we have to be graduating more and more students who are familiar with the languages and cultures of the Pacific region,'' Ms. Condos said.
 
More Nations
At the same time, the university recognizes the educational opportunities that the region has to offer. ''It's been neglected in terms of intellectual exchange,'' said John Marcum, director of the Education Abroad Program for the nine campuses.
''We have traditionally tended to go to Europe,'' Mr. Marcum said. ''We tend to go where it's easy to go - in terms of language, in terms of culture.''
Canada, Costa Rica, Indonesia, Korea, New Zealand, Taiwan and Thailand have all been added to the program since 1982. Increased numbers of students are studying in Australia, China, Japan, Mexico and Hong Kong.
Mr. McCann, a second-year graduate student in the teaching of English as a second language program at the University of California at Los Angeles, went to Thailand because he is considering working there after he graduates.
''It's going to be tied in with my career,'' said Mr. McCann, who is from Glastonbury, Conn. ''I need to learn Thai in a more intensive manner.''
 
'A Linguistic Barrier'
In an effort to increase students' interest in the Pacific Rim, the university offers scholarships of up to $1,500 a year - not based on financial need -to those bound for the region. The amount of each award is determined by the cost to study in the student's chosen country, university officials said. (Australia and New Zealand are excluded from scholarships because the demand to study in those countries is usually high without offering an incentive, Mr. Marcum said.) The program offers some opportunities for specialized study. In Japan, for example, students can take classes in economics and engineering. But most students studying in Pacific Rim countries focus on the basics - the country's language and culture, Mr. Marcum said.
''There's an enormous barrier - a linguistic barrier,'' Mr. Marcum said. ''As long as the pool of students with real language competency is small, we will have to focus a lot of the study on language.''
Although some Pacific Rim languages are more widely used than others, the program tries to provide a geographical and cultural range of countries for students to choose from, Mr. Marcum said.
Thailand is ''an up-and-coming country in terms of economics,'' Mr. Marcum said, with Mr. McCann in agreement. Since Mr. McCann exports cosmetics to Korea to put himself through school, he said that in addition to intensive language study, he wants to find a Thai business partner.

HEADLINE: TV VIEW;
More Than Spotted Owls Is Endangered

BYLINE: By Walter Goodman

 BODY:
''Ancient forests: Rage Over Trees,'' a National Audubon Society special, tonight at 8 on the Public Broadcasting Service, was shown on the Turner Broadcasting cable system last September - and therein lies a tale. About three weeks before the original presentation of the hourlong documentary on the controversy over logging in the Pacific Northwest, the Stroh Brewing Company, which had planned to give $600,000 toward the Audubon series, withdrew its support.
Environmentalists accused Stroh of backing off because of a threatened boycott of its beer by loggers who want to cut down some old-growth forests, home to 800-year-old trees as well as to the northern spotted owl and other wildlife. Officials of the Audubon Society, one group that wants the owl protected as an endangered species, said they had turned down changes requested by Stroh that would have made the documentary more favorable to the timber industry. Stroh officials said that their decision was a cost-cutting measure that had nothing to do with the talks the company had had with timber cutters. 
Tonight, by courtesy of General Electric, which is now supporting the Audubon series, viewers can see a slightly updated version of the program that caused the commotion. The environment is a favorite subject of public television, and in accord with prevailing sentiment, ''Ancient Forests'' comes down in favor of the big old trees and the creatures who make their homes among them. The annoyance of companies that are in the business of chopping down trees is unsurprising.
But unlike many television treatments of environmental issues that are too suffused in righteousness to attend to the other side, this documentary makes more than a gesture at giving the timber interests a hearing. Most astonishingly, the businessmen are just as clean-cut looking and plausible-sounding as the environmentalists. The difficulty is that after listening to both sides, particularly in an al fresco debate, the audience may be hard put to say whose case is closer to reality.
Industry spokesmen report that the United States has enough of the old trees to last forever. Environmentalists retort that at the present rate of cutting, they will be gone in a decade: ''The mill capacity outpaces the forest capacity,'' says one. ''They just chew it up as fast as they can.'' Industry spokesmen say that wildlife does not thrive in the old forests; environmentalists say it does. Industry spokesmen say that the spotted owl can survive in other habitats; environmentalists contend otherwise. The owner of a mill says that a halt to ''harvesting'' the old trees would eliminate 60,000 jobs, a death knell to many communities and to ''the soul of Oregon.'' Referring to the political power of the timber industry, an environmentalist says that America's future is being sold for today's dollar.
Two experts support the environmentalist case, but they do it in a somewhat lyrical fashion. What is wanting here are directly delivered facts and figures. Is there no relatively objective estimate on the extent and value of the old-growth forests? Can newly planted trees make up for those that are taken away? Isn't there an economist not employed by the timber industry who can estimate how many jobs would be lost if the cutting down of the old trees was stopped, and how some of the jobs might be replaced? Are there no uncommitted experts who can say whether the spotted owl and other species can get along elsewhere -and, if not, why it matters? (Rodent-rights activists may be upset by a scene in which owl-rights people use a mouse as bait.) Laying out the conflicting positions as this program does is assuredly useful, but more useful still would be an outside assessment of the claims and the charges. Unsurprisingly, both sides issue pronouncements to suit their predilections; the arguments are presented but they are not joined.
The producers make their case visually, with pictures from the air of sections near Opal Creek in the state of Washington that have been opened to loggers; they are not pretty. By contrast, the camera captures the cathedral-like peace of the yet-untouched trees; a lovely swimming hole; a heaven for backpackers, where, says Paul Newman, the narrator, ''solitude can be found.'' And it concludes with a camp-out and one of the environmentalists telling his children, by firelight, of the glories of the old forest. The background music gets inspirational whenever the camera catches a sun-dappled spot. The pictures are seductive; the issue becomes cast in esthetic terms.
At the start, Mr. Newman says that the dispute over the trees goes to ''the heart of society's values''; at the end, he urges viewers ''to let Congress know what you want done with them.'' An unexceptionable suggestion, which could be followed more responsibly if ''Ancient Forests'' - and television in general - reported on the issues with more facts and less atmosphere.
As for a company's withdrawing its support from a controversial program, that is a built-in hazard of the way public broadcasting is financed. Any company, be it Stroh Beer or General Electric, that attaches its name to a program or a series obviously does so with its own interests in mind, and controversy is rarely among them.
Whatever the shortcomings of ''Ancient Forests,'' its re-appearance is welcome, and General Electric's support for the Audubon series is all the more commendable given the circumstances. But to the extent that public television remains dependent on the kindness of corporations, controversy will continue to be an endangered species.

Putting Prokofiev and Mozart in the Same Basket

BYLINE: By Donal Henahan

 BODY:
About all Prokofiev's ''War and Peace'' and Mozart's ''Cosi fan tutte'' have in common, it might be plausibly argued, is that both play in two long acts. Forget for the moment that Mozart sustains lengths more skillfully than anybody, let alone Prokofiev. Such gross differences are easy to point out. However, it is similarity that interests me today, not difference. While they may not jump out, some underlying resemblances can be discerned between the two operas. One close thematic relationship, which may be no news to you, struck me recently when I attended performances of these seemingly unrelated works within a few days of one another: ''War and Peace'' at the Seattle Opera and ''Cosi'' at the Santa Fe Opera.
''War and Peace'' is faithful, though certainly not entirely true, to the Tolstoy original in its willingness to sprawl almost out of control in hopes of achieving an effect of Homeric sweep and grandeur. The epic scale, after all, is what most of us think of first when ''War and Peace'' is mentioned. The opera follows the novel fairly closely in chronology and sketches the historical picture with economy and skill. Like Tolstoy, Prokofiev even gives one the impression that he is reluctant or unable to end the story, that sequels may be necessary. But he must have known that his work, no matter how cleverly constructed, would seem episodic and choppy in comparison with the revered original. 
The opera has its affecting scenes, but they are only half-realized tableaux, pictures that remind the listener of ''War and Peace'' but rarely more. Musically, interest tails off in the second half, not only because the confusions of young love are intrinsically more interesting than stage warfare. It is as if Prokofiev's concerns in Act II turned so sharply to the challenge of making Soviet propaganda that there was not much room for following Tolstoy's scheme of weaving together the stories of individuals struggling to survive as society disintegrated around them.
In any event, the 13 truncated scenes of his opera cannot and do not suggest the incredibly detailed fleshing out of even the most minor characters that is Tolstoy's constant compulsion. How could it? Although in the Seattle Opera's stirring production, 64 characters were named in the program, there was time during the nearly four-hour production to bring only a handful of them to anything like life. Even the principal characters had to make do with identity cards writen in shorthand, like the passing allusions to Prince Andrei's freemasonry or Napoleon's frontline gourmandizing.
Prokofiev's greatest impulse in this work seems to have been to dramatize, not so much Tolstoy's ''War and Peace,'' but the historic parallels between the Russian defeat of Napoleon in 1812 and the Soviet defense of Leningrad during World War II. That being so, it is ironic that he comes closest to writing great opera in the peaceful first act, when the webs of romantic love and lust in upper-class Russian society are being spun around Natasha and her admirers: Prince Andrei, Pierre and the ineffable thug Anatole. It is here, especially in the scenes seemingly modeled on Tchaikovsky's ''Eugene Onegin,'' that the opera most closely resembles not only Tolstoy but the Mozart who found so much hidden substance and humanity in the libretto that da Ponte furnished him.
It is easy to observe that the canvas Mozart chose to work on in ''Cosi'' is anything but epic in scope. In form, a simple-minded farce, it would be swallowed without leaving a trace in one of Tolstoy's chapters. But the affection and understanding that his music shows for the four lovers in his comedy are recognizably Tolstoyan. The cumulative power of the music - Fiordiligi's self-analyzing arias in particular - can be at least as psychologically complex in effect as the piling on of realistic details that brings Tolstoy's characters to life, great and small. When the deserter Platon Karatayev meets the half-starved Andrei on the battlefield he offers the prince a baked potato. ''Food'' or even ''potato'' are too abstract for Tolstoy; it must be a baked potato.
Although widely separated by time, space and artistic temperament, the creators of Fiordiligi and Natasha share a willingness to overlook human weakness. Everything is understood, therefore forgiven. Both composer and novelist have the gift of arousing our compassion for fallible man - but most particularly the fallible woman. Tolstoy and Mozart vibrate in sympathy with those poor outcasts, doomed by personality and circumstances to betray not only others but themselves. Tolstoy did not exhaust the theme of womanly moral crisis in ''War and Peace''; infidelity and betrayal loom even larger in ''Anna Karenina.'' Nor did the composer in ''Cosi.'' He obsessed on the subject in ''The Abduction From the Seraglio,'' ''The Marriage of Figaro'' and ''Don Giovanni.'' Tolstoy's sympathy for sexually and socially battered women amounts almost to a guiding principle.
Ponder all you wish on the grand political and social tapestry of ''War and Peace,'' what gives both the novel and the opera their flavor of truth are the smaller pictures. Think of a peace-loving Andrei cleaning his spectacles on the battlefield. Or the infatuated Natasha flirting with Anatole, unaware that he means to kidnap and rape her. Think what Mozart and da Ponte might make out of that latter misreading of the male animal. Come to think of it, they did deal with that tragicomedy of misunderstanding. They called it ''Don Giovanni.''

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer;
Iraq's Lunge, the Markets' Plunge

 BODY:
It was a rout.
Outside of precious metals, not a sector of stocks around the world dodged the fallout from the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait and the standoff between Saddam Hussein and most of the rest of the world.
And only one country's market, gold-rich South Africa's, managed to eke out a gain last week, albeit only four-tenths of 1 percent, according to the Financial Times World Indicies of 24 countries. Using local indexes, which include more stocks, even South Africa fell nine-tenths of 1 percent, despite a 9 percent rise in gold stocks. 
Even oil, once people began to take a closer look at the makeup of some of the oil companies, was weaker than might be expected. In the Financial Times Indicies, the oil sector declined four-tenths of 1 percent, after oil prices retreated and investors had second thoughts. ''Some people had jumped in willy-nilly,'' said David A. Robbins of UBS Securities in New York.
The performance of the oil sector didn't look so bad in comparison. According to the Financial Times Indicies, heavy engineering and shipbuilding fell 12.5 percent; autos dropped 10.7 percent; chemicals 10.0 percent; real estate 8.6 percent; media 7.7 percent, and beverages 5.6 percent. Precious metals, because of the flight of investors to gold, rose 1.24 percent. Many oil stocks surged on Aug. 2, the day of the invasion. France's Total jumped 2.4 percent; Elf Aquitane rose 3.3 percent; Belgium's Petrofina was up 3.6 percent.
But fairly quickly these stocks were dropped as it became clear that certain oil companies would be hurt as well as helped by the oil price rise. Some companies are not major producers and buy oil on the open market. Others derive a major portion of earnings from other lines of business. About a quarter of Elf's earnings are from chemicals, and about three-quarters of Total's are from oil-based products, like paint.
By week's end, Elf had dropped 2.7 percent from its invasion peak to 629 francs while Total fell 3.6 percent to 699 francs, wiping out, respectively, some or all of the gain since oil prices started rising before July's meeting of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. Petrofina, which gets 19 percent of its earnings from chemicals and buys most of its crude oil on the open market, dropped 4.9 percent.
''They're not pure plays in the oil industry,'' said Didier P. Bodart, an analyst at Cresvale International.
The oil stocks that performed well, like British Petroleum, together with gold stocks, softened the Iraqi blow in a few markets. Australia's All Ordinaries index slipped just 1.1 percent, while Canada's Toronto Stock Exchange index lost just 2.9 percent.
The hardest-hit markets were Singapore, whose Strait Times Index fell 13.74 percent, Japan, where the Nikkei 225 dropped 11.38 percent, and Honk Kong, whose Heng Seng index fell 11.23 percent. Austria was down 10.3 percent and the declines in Spain, the Netherlands, France and Italy were in the 9 percent range.
While the Dow Jones industrial average dropped 182.68 points since Aug. 1, the day before the Iraqi invasion, it fared better than most world markets,based on local indexes. It fell 6.3 percent.
The markets can expect another difficult week, even if the gulf crisis doesn't escalate. Robin West, president of the Petroleum Finance Company, said in that case, the price of oil would fall further as the fundamentals took over. These include the promise of increased production from Saudi Arabia, Venezuela and other OPEC members to offset much of the the expected 4.5 miillion barrel-a-shortage from the embarago. ''There is a lot of crude in the world,'' said Mr. West, ''and this ought to supersede the psychology of the market.''
Even with stable oil prices - West Texas Intermediate closed at $26.23 Friday - or even lower prices, the fear of inflation and lower economic growth worldwide would cloud stock markets. And a standoff in the Middle East will leave many investors leery, even though the number of bargains out there should mushroom. Cash may be the way these days when one news bulletin can kill a ''sure thing.''

HEADLINE: Dancing Past the Recession

BYLINE: By JOEL KURTZMAN

 BODY:
The nation, it seems fair to say, has never been in quite the same kind of economic bind it is in now.
With the winds of desert war threatening, with powerful forces of inflation set in motion, recession imminent or already here, with a savings and loan scandal and strains on the banking community, with a continuing decline in the industrial base and several consecutive years of Federal budget deficits far higher than ever before, negative factors seem to have converged in an extraordinary and ominous fashion.
So the good times are over. The economic life of the United States of American is terminally diseased. Let us now praise famous men, and throw in the towel. Right? Wrong. 
A close look at the forces behind these forces, and an extensive series of interviews with government and private economic experts, suggests other outcomes, other options, that are convincing and much less pessimistic. Serious problems lie ahead, yes. But the tools now exist - and more can be forged - to tackle them.
This is so largely because of the experience gained by government and new strategies adopted by business over the decade since the economic troubles of the 1970's and early 80's and the stock market collapse of Oct. 19, 1987, that make the economy less vulnerable to shock - from escalating oil prices, for example - than might be be expected.
This experience suggests that business would be well advised now to intensify its efforts at efficiency, to continue trimming, to cut plans that might seem extravagant or risky, to stay lean, poised and ready to pounce when the economy rebounds. And the Federal Government would be similarly instructed to continue its current deficit-cutting policy, with some careful modifications: warily ease interest rates downward to help the economy, but raise them again if inflation indeed becomes a serious problem. There are many new weapons in the nation's 1990 economic arsenal:
* American corporations have been making real efforts to diversify their sources of energy.
* Businesses have been pursuing cost-cutting strategies as well, making themselves leaner, reducing staff and inventories.
* Many corporations are much more global than they were in the 70's, enabling them to recoup domestic losses from stronger markets overseas.
* The Federal Government and business have learned valuable lessons in how to manage crises from their experience in the oil crises of the 70's, and from the collapse of the stock market in 1987.
* The United States is now in possession of a strategic oil reserve capable of offsetting disruptions in flow of oil from Iraq and Kuwait for at least 800 days.
* Other oil producers, like Venezuela, Mexico and Saudi Arabia, can bring on new production to offset losses from an embargo of Iraq.
* Inflation, though potentially strong, has not escaped Federal Reserve control.
* The Western industrialized nations are united in pursuit of a solution to the oil crisis.
* Higher oil prices are likely to spur efforts to develop synthetic fuels and to explore for oil domestically.
The economic news was gloomy enough even before Iraq seized Kuwait's oil fields and drove up prices on the spot market by 50 percent. (The sorting out of what the impact of the increase will be on various economic sectors has already begun. Page 4.) For the last six quarters, economic growth has limped along at less than 2 percent and falling, prompting several economists to say the country is now in a recession, though a recession is officially defined as two consecutive quarters of contraction, or below-zero growth. The June figures for unemployment showed a sharp jump from 5.2 percent to 5.5 percent, reflecting a loss of more than 430,000 jobs. Slowing economic activity also prompted Richard G. Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, to revise upward his estimate of the size of the Federal budget deficit, from $100 billion to $161 billion. This revision came just as Congress and the Administration were locked in debate over how best to cut the deficit and bring it into compliance with the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction targets.
The fact that the nation is better equipped to meet crises than it once was does not mean that a big increase in oil prices over a sustained period would not hurt. It would. ''An $8 permanent increase in the price of oil, in year one, reduces economic growth by .2 to .3 percentage points,'' said Allen Sinai, chief economist at the Boston Company. And spot-oil prices are now $10 higher than before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. With every dollar increase in the price of oil, $6 billion is taken from consumers.
And a rise in oil prices can, indeed, reverberate, because oil is such a pervasive part of the economy. The prices for oil-based chemicals and plastics rise in direct reaction, for instance, along with home heating fuel. ''For each 10 to 15 percent increase in the price of oil, consumer prices rise by a full percentage point.'' said Francis Schott, chief economist of the Equitable Life Assurance Society.
With the inflation rate before the Iraqi invasion hovering at 5 percent to 6 percent in July, the current 50 percent hike in the price of oil - if it were to remain - could bring inflation back to double-digit levels. An economy stagnant and beset by inflation would lay the foundation for a ''a replay of the 1974-79 period when we suffered with stagflation. This is deja vu,'' Mr. Schott said.
 
Stronger Strategies
It fact, these times are not really deja vu all over again, as Yogi Berra might put it. The American economy and American business have significantly changed. The strategies available for them to pull out of a slump, even at a time of climbing prices, are stronger and sharper.
Most experts agree that, for one thing, the nation's businesses, subjected to a decade and a half of intense competition from abroad and uncertain economic conditions at home, have become much more efficient.
Pat Choate, chief economist at TRW Inc., said American companies have become ''much leaner and much meaner than they were in the 1970's.'' Victor H. Palmieri, an expert in turning around troubled companies, agrees, and points to Kodak, Xerox, Control Data, Navistar, Midway Airlines in Chicago and Equitable as among the leaders in trimming their operations.
One key tactic for surviving economic peril is outsourcing, the practice of buying parts or materials from others when it is cheaper than producing them. There was a time when the quintessential American corporation thought it had to create every part of every product it sold. Now because of outsourcing, Mr. Choate said, company inventories are, in general, smaller than ever, and as a result, overhead is lower.
In manufacturing and retailing, just-in-time ordering - taking delivery on parts only when needed - is another strategy. Many of the nation's largest manufacturers and retailers, already anticipating a slow year before the Middle East oil crisis, have also kept stockroom supplies low. ''Our strategy has been to order less and reorder if we need to,'' said Ira Silver, chief economist at the J. C. Penney Company. ''We order closer to the season and are keeping less inventory; the industry as a whole is doing this. And our new stores are now more energy-efficient.'' Retailers are affected by the price of oil, ''because it takes money out of the consumer's pocket. But unless there's a real big oil shock and we go into a deep recession, we're in pretty good shape.''
In their efforts at greater efficiency, companies have jettisoned layers of middle management, reduced the number of production workers and cut down the time it takes to bring new products to market. As a result, they are better positioned to deal with the upsets of a recession and able to design new products more quickly to suit the times. ''It is the smaller companies, the ones that are holding all the big companies' inventories, that will be hurt,'' said Mr. Choate.
On the other hand, some small companies, too, are navigating better through rough economic waters, and have developed more flexibility. ''Our strategy began two years ago when we started to fire almost all of our 42 employees and make them outside contractors,'' said Stephen Meyers, a partner in American Communications Technology, a telephone installation and consulting firm in New York. ''By making them outside contractors we pay them more but only when we need them. We got rid of all our vehicles and pushed down our debt. Overhead is down.''
The corporations to be among the hardest hit in the event of a deep recession are those that have incurred large levels of indebtedness and that are short of cash. Overextension on ''junk bonds,'' for example, was another lesson for some in the 80's, if a late one. ''Companies that have gotten their debt down and still have the capacity to borrow - they'll do fine - companies like Ford, General Electric and American Express.'' said Mr. Choate.
And the major companies, remembering the seesawing of oil in the 70's and early 80's, now fully understand their need to keep their energy consumption as low as possible and diversify fuels. They are using a much wider range of fuels, like natural gas, coal and electricity than they did in the 70's. As a result, each unit of economic output now requires less oil input than it did.
 
Fuel Flexibility
John Deere Inc., the big maker of farm machinery and other heavy equipment in Peoria, Ill., has developed what it calls a ''fuel flexibility plan.'' Rather than relying exclusively on any one form of energy, it uses utility-provided electricity to power its machine tools, natural gas in its foundry and generates it some power of its own by burning coal. The Whirlpool Corporation of Benton Harbor, Mich., a maker of washing machines and dishwashers, has also diversified; It has, for example, stopped making its washtubs out of porcelain-enamel, which must be baked, and has substituted plastics which, though made from oil, require less energy to produce.
Peter Schwartz, president of Global Business Network, a business strategy consulting firm in Berkeley, Calif., and formerly head of planning at Royal Dutch Shell in London, said that if the nation does see extended oil-price hikes, it will mean an even bigger trade deficit than the one it has now. That means the country will have try harder to export more. And companies with strong export strategies will benefit. Again, Deere, is one. Globally, ''it is very possible to experience a recession in the U.S. and still experience strong export demands,'' said Robert Combs, the company's spokesman.
Despite all these measures, times ahead will not be easy and companies will probably find their markets shrinking at least for the short term. ''For the next six months, customers will be in short supply and finding them will be expensive. The companies that will do the best will be those that are able to hold onto their customers by giving them high-quality service,'' Mr. Schwartz said. Can the Federal Government help? Even though burdened by a problem of its own that it did not have in the 70's and the recession of 1982 - that is, a $100 billion-plus annual budget deficit - the Government should not be regarded as powerless in this economy.
So far, there is no call for a major overhaul by the Administration, Congress or the Federal Reserve of the policies that had been put in place before the Iraqi invasion.
Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisers, said the basic goal remains the same: cutting heavily into the Federal deficit over the next five years. ''We still believe that a growth-oriented, credible, enforcible, multiyear deficit reduction package is economically desirable. Our target hasn't changed. It's still around $500 billion over five years. Recent events underscore the importance of a growth-oriented deficit reduction package,'' Mr. Boskin said.
 
Finding the Right Mix
But there are calls for fine tuning. Lawrence Summers, an economist at Harvard University, said, ''The right mix of policies, before the oil shock, is still the right advice after.'' But he adds: ''Twist the mix toward less expansion on the fiscal side and more on the monetary side. If the energy prices stick, it means it's just not time for a big increase in energy taxes or imported oil fees.'' Lee H. Hamilton, a Democrat of Indiana and the chairman of the Joint Economic Committee of Congress, said the Government must keep trying to cut the deficit - but push some of those cuts into the future.
The Government has two basic methods for fighting a recession: fiscal measures - increasing spending, which directly stimulates demand to promote growth - or monetary measures - lowering interest rates, which increases investment and consumer spending.
Fiscal measures are inhibited by the Gramm-Rudman Act, which effectively limits increased spending by mandating cuts in budget deficits. But Gramm-Rudman has a built-in waiver. Norman Ornstein, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, points out that ''if there are two quarters of less than 1 percent real growth, or if there is negative growth for a certain amount of time, the waiver goes into effect,'' giving Congress the power to spend more to stimulate the economy. President Bush offered to raise taxes recently, according to Mr. Ornstein, because he saw a recession coming: ''Bush took a real chance by reneging on his 'read my lips' pledge on taxes. He did it because there were enough signs in advance that we were nearing a recession, and he wanted to be ready.''
But the trouble with using government spending or high deficits to stay out of a recession, as Ronald Reagan did, is that the eventually the piper, or someone, somewhere, must be paid. Many argue that this, in part, is what is going on now.
The advantage of monetary policy is that it promotes investment, and growth, without adding to government spending. The disadvantage, is that, at least in the short run, it can breed the inflation the country is trying to avoid, depress the value of the dollar and discourage foreign investment.
Economists studying the results of previous efforts to shorten recessions tend to agree that lower interest rates, combined with a reduction in the size of the Federal budget, is the proper medicine for treating an economy suffering from both slow or negative growth and sharp inflation. And, they say, the current special conditions do not preclude these tools.
In the 70's, Federal spending was high but, at the same time, the Fed's policy was to keep money tight. Paul A. Samuelson, a Nobel laureate in economics who teaches at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology, said: ''We now know this was wrong. There was nothing sillier than President Ford wearing his WIN [whip inflation now] button at the economic summit just as the nation was entering a real tailspin of a recession.''
What seems needed is a judicious dose of the traditional medicine. The task of the Federal Reserve ''is to ease monetary policy warily,'' Mr. Samuelson said, ''ease interest rates, and then take in the slack later.'' The idea is that the lowered rates will stimulate the economy, but once inflation becomes a real problem, they can be raised again.
 
BREAKING THE ARAB OIL HABIT
If timing is everything, Saddam Hussein's decision to invade Kuwait and seize its oil fields couldn't have come at a worse moment - for him. ''Oil stocks, both private and public, are at all-time highs,'' said Philip K. Verleger, a visiting fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. ''You invade when stocks are low, not when they are so high.''
Mr. Verleger said the world has ''99 days of supply on hand in tanks and in storage; 70 days of that are in private hands and 29 days are held by governments.
Three-quarters of public supplies are held by the United States in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve - 600 million barrels. ''We have an agreement to share that oil with the other industrialized nations if need be, except for France,'' said Mr. Verleger.
Total oil capacity produced by Iraq and Kuwait is 4.5 million barrels a day, about 20 percent of the world's supply - which, Dale Jorgenson, a Harvard University energy economist said, can be made up by Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Indonesia, Nigeria, Mexico, Norway, Britain and the Soviet Union.
Prices went up after the invasion but, Mr. Jorgenson said, ''once the military situation stabilizes in a few days, the precautionary demand to increase inventories would be reversed and a lot of people, seeing high spot prices, will unload.'' The price outlook? ''Hard to predict, but I would say it would fall into a broad range somewhere between $14 and $24 a barrel - about where it was before the invasion.''
And the nation is less dependent to begin with than it was. As Michael J. Boskin, the President's economic adviser, pointed out: ''We use one-third less energy for every dollar'' of gross national product than in the 70's.
 
IN POSITION FOR THE CRISIS
Back in the dark days of the 1982 recession, with oil prices collapsing, John J. Murphy, the new president of Dresser Industries Inc., in Dallas, decided it was time to refocus on energy, even though there was no market for it at the time. ''We sold an insurance company, a fire hydrant company, a leasing company,'' said Mr. Murphy, now chief executive.
Since then, Dresser has concentrated on making products used in drilling, refining, transporting and mining as well as heavy equipment and industrial tools. ''Drilling activity in the U.S. dropped from 4,500 rigs in 1980 to a little over 1,000 at the beginning of 1990,'' Mr. Murphy said. Now, with oil prices rising after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait,there is likely to be an increase in exploration. Energy analysts say Mexico and Saudi Arabia, which have pledged to increase production, cannot sustain increases without substantial new investment.
The company seems to be in a position to benefit from the turbulence in the Middle East. While the phones are not yet ringing from companies that want to begin drilling or from countries wanting to invest in new pipelines, the company is cautiously putting a little more capital in place in the belief that they will.

OIL AND THE MIDDLE EAST
 
Prices at the Pump
 
Gas station owners seemed to react to the oil crisis with the quickened reflexes of commodities traders last week. Retail prices soared an average of 12 cents a gallon by Wednesday, with analysts blaming psychological factors, motorists blaming gas station owners, gas station owners blaming Arabs and oil companies. The oil companies fell all but mute. ''You don't see President Bush doing any talking either,'' said a Mobil Corporation representative at the beginning of last week. By Wednesday, the President was talking: ''I'm asking the oil companies to do their fair share,'' he said. ''They should show restraint and not abuse today's uncertainties to raise prices.'' Suddenly, oil company executives recovered their voices, as several announced price cuts and several others defended their increases.
 
Iran's Surplus Sales
 
Iran, of all nations, to the rescue? Iran is said to have sold millions of barrels of oil from its storage tankers last week. After a long, punishing war with Iraq, Iran is apparently eager to profit from an embargo against its enemy. But oil company executives say that the boycott of Iraqi supplies has been almost completely effective. Western nations, they say, will have to draw from their strategic reserves. 
 
A Cold Winter?
 
President Hussein might have picked the wrong season to start a fight. The world can more easily manage without his oil when it's warm. Oil finished on Friday at about $26.23, where some traders expect prices to settle. Analysts say that other producers can help compensate for a while for the cut-off in Iraqi and Kuwaiti supplies. ''Right now you're in low-demand season,'' said Paul D. Mlotok, an energy analyst at Morgan Stanley. Getting along without Iraq's oil come winter is another matter. ''You're going to have to draw down inventory when people's tendency is to hoard it,'' he said. ''Prices could exceed $30.''
 
THE ECONOMY
 
An Architect to Remember
 
On Monday, at the age of 81, the architect who gave corporate America its modernist aspirations died. Beginning with Lever House - New York's first glass-walled office tower - in 1952, Gordon Bunshaft's example reverberated until all self-respecting corporations built with metal and glass instead of stone. His influence was amplified by his firm, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, whose huge New York office he headed.
Lever House itself was an act of corporate philanthropy. It sacrificed much of its permissible size to create a glade in Park Avenue's high-rise forest. Other architects perverted his principals to give developers the most rentable square feet for the money in boxy buildings that mar many an American downtown. And since Mr. Bunshaft retired a decade ago, architects have rediscovered materials and details that he had consigned to history. But his best buildings remain to embody a timelessness and vision that seem to have passed from the corporate scene.
 
Producer Prices Dip
 
Producer prices fell one-tenth of 1 percent in July - before the Iraqis invaded Kuwait. Some on Wall Street saw the decline was evidence of an economic slowdown. Steven Axilrod, vice chairman of Nikko Securities International, said that higher oil costs will hurt corporate profits, since demand is too weak for them to raise their prices.
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
Dual-Currency Soviet Economy?
 
Attention Soviet shoppers: Reach into your mattresses, pull out your dollars and marks, and hurry over to the beriozka for all the goodies that hard currency can buy. The Soviet Union opened its hard-currency stores to its own citizens at the beginning of this month, without questioning how an estimated $2 billion in foreign money came into private hands. Most methods of obtaining it, like trading on the black market, remain illegal. A writer for the Soviet news agency, Tass, in an article headlined ''Epitaph for the Ruble?'', predicted the further emergence of a dual-currency economy, ''where a Soviet citizen will be asked to pay in hard currency not only for a packet of Marlboro cigarettes, but also for his airline ticket, a reservation in the restaurant and for mending his television set.'' Businesses, at least, might might soon find it much easier to acquire foreign currency. Moscow announced last week that it would open corporate money exchanges around the country next year. Only selected Soviet companies have been allowed to bid at the country's foreign-currency auctions so far.
 
Japan Applies Oil-Shock Lessons
 
The outlook for the Japanese economy is healthier than some fever charts indicate. Since the oil shocks of the 1970's - when idled taxi drivers, swept up in the panic, committed suicide - the Japanese have stockpiled oil, turned to nuclear power and made their cars and industries some of the most energy-efficient in the world. ''The Japanese have a great capacity to learn from trauma,'' said Susan J. Pharr, a Harvard professor of government. Japanese investors are not nearly so confident. The Nikkei stock average fell 7.4 percent for the week, to a low for the year.
 
COMPANIES
 
Lorenzo Bows Out
 
After two corporate bankruptcies, three acquisitions and a raging strike, Frank Lorenzo is quitting the airline business. He announced his resignation as chairman of Continental Airline Holdings Inc., formerly Texas Air, on Thursday. The Scandinavian Airline System made his on-time departure a condition of buying his Continental stock, increasing its stake to 16.8 percent. His replacement is Hollis L. Harris, 58, who worked his way up from gate agent to president of Delta Airlines in 36 years. Mr. Harris pledged to transform Continental's image and service and restore its profitability. Investors, who have suffered from Continental's decline, celebrated the news by bidding up its stock 39 percent in a day. With the company doubled over by debt, ''Mr. Harris should be able to open more doors in the financial community,'' said Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley. The agreement with S.A.S. bars Mr. Lorenzo from the airline industry for seven years. Mr. Lorenzo has even more reason than shareholders to celebrate, as he leaves with $30.5 million from a comfortable severance package and a premium price for his stock.
 
Donaldson Heads Exchange
 
William H. Donaldson, one of the founding partners of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Inc., was named to head the world's largest stock exchange last week. He will succeed John J. Phelan Jr. as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange in January. Mr. Donaldson, who is 59 years old, faces the tasks of defending the exchange against challenges from overseas markets, regional exchanges and other new ways of trading stocks and betting on the market.
 
The UAL Takeover Plan
 
The board of directors gave employees of UAL Inc. a break last week, but the economy didn't. The board decided on Wednesday to give the employee unions two more months to arrange financing for their $4.38 billion, $201-a-share bid. But with fuel prices rising and the economy lurching towards recession, airlines look like the last companies to invest in. The unions have had trouble finding equity partners, and several banks have defected. One hopeful sign: Northwest's corporate parent, NWA, the only major airline to be taken private so far, is successfully paying its debts.
 
Asbestos Cases Accelerated?
 
Ten Federal District Court judges reached an agreement on Friday to consolidate tens of thousands of asbestos cases. The judges said their unusual agreement can bring about a quicker, less costly way of compensating more than 100,000 victims. As many as half a million more cases could be filed over the next decade as more workers who have inhaled asbestos fibers develop cancer. Some of the judges have estimated that about legal expenses have absorbed about two-thirds of the payments that would otherwise go to asbestos victims. But some companies and lawyers for the victims are likely to challenge the new arrangements.
 
In Brief
 
A Broadway show with record advance sales of $25 million was canceled after Actors' Equity refused to let an English actor play a Eurasian lead role. ''Miss Saigon'' had been scheduled to open in March 1991 with members of minority groups in 34 of 50 roles.
 
The chairman of the world's largest accounting firm resigned after some of his partners objected to his choice of a vice chairman and possible successor. Larry D. Horner said on Wednesday that he will leave as chairman of KMPG Peat Marwick in October.

HEADLINE: Mutual Funds;
Riding Out the Mideast Storm

BYLINE: By Carole Gould

 BODY:
How can investors in mutual funds maneuver safely through the choppy waters of the current stock market?
Most important, don't panic. After that, market experts say, the course you chart depends on your tolerance for risk and your time horizon. For the adventurous, there are superb opportunities. For the nervous, there are ways to construct fund portfolios that smooth the market's ups and downs. 
So far, at least, most fund investors are heeding the experts' advice not to sell. While some fund executives reported slight outflows from stock funds last week, the wholesale dumping of stocks that immediately followed the October 1987 market crash was noticeably absent.
The lesson of 1987 for most investors - to sit tight in times of panic - is especially valuable today. The Lipper Growth Fund Index, a benchmark for funds similar to Standard & Poor's 500-stock index, has dropped close to 12 percent since mid-July. Unless you need the cash immediately, it does not make sense to bail out when prices are so low.
''If you're holding a good stock fund, keep holding on,'' said Gerald W. Perritt, editor of the Chicago-based Mutual Fund Letter. ''Prices will go up again.'' For long-term investors, ''looking too closely at the events of the past few weeks is a mistake,'' said John Markese, director of research for the American Association of Individual Investors in Chicago.
Investors who dump their fund shares in the wake of bad news often overlook the tax implications of their hasty action, Mr. Markese said. And they also have to grapple with the problem of when to move their money back into the market.
Hanging on makes special sense for investors who have carefully crafted portfolios with 10-year horizons.
''What happens over the next few months isn't that critical to your overall return,'' said Don Phillips, vice president of Morningstar Inc., Chicago-based mutual fund consultants.
With prices down, should bargain hunters begin snooping around for good deals? Here the market pundits disagree.
Mr. Perritt, for one, doesn't see any buying opportunities yet. Hostilities in the Middle East pushed stock prices down, but other indicators, like a rising unemployment rate, also contributed to the decline, he noted. He predicts that further weakening in the economy will push stock prices down another 15 to 30 percent and concludes: ''It's premature to do any buying now.''
Other investment advisers advocate selective buying. They caution against jumping in immediately, because the markets traditionally overreact to bad news. As a result, they say, more sharp declines in the Dow Jones industrial average, like last Monday's 93-point fall, would not be very surprising. While part of the Dow's plunge was based on underlying fundamental changes, ''it's largely attributable to fear in the marketplace,'' said Craig A. Litman, a partner in Litman/Gregory, a San Francisco-based investment management firm that specializes in funds.
So these are good times for investors with strong stomachs who can handle the rough ride until events in the Mideast move forward and the markets settle down. Quick-footed investors can seize the moment to buy on weakness, picking up funds that they had long sought and are now at lower prices. ''Clearly, there are some opportunities out there,'' Mr. Litman said.
Of course, one way to hedge your bets is to buy funds that focus on oil or other energy stocks. Mr. Markese, for one, likes the T. Rowe Price New Era Fund, a no-load fund that invests mainly in companies that own or develop natural resources.
For his part, Mr. Phillips advises nimble investors to use the sharp market swings to ''pick up extra shares when prices are down, and sell when prices get ahead of themselves.'' But in fast-moving markets, Mr. Phillips said, it makes sense to stay with the familiar. Work with the funds that you have already researched or that you already own. ''This is not the time to be buying funds that you never heard of,'' he said.
On one thing, the pundits agree: the events of the past few weeks make a strong case for ''dollar-cost averaging.'' Investors using this method put money into the market on a regular basis, regardless of market levels. Accumulating shares over time at various prices works to smooth the volatility of the marketplace.
But buying small blocks of fund shares creates a problem for investors in load funds. In many funds, the upfront sales charge declines as the size of the purchase increases.
Investors who buy load funds can minimize the sales charge by signing a ''letter of intent'' which says that you plan to buy a certain number of shares in the fund over the next 13 months, says Dennis J. Kelly, vice president of Janney Montgomery Scott Inc. in New York. That way, you can qualify for the lowest sales charge on the total amount invested over that period, even though you are not buying the shares in a block.
 
PINPOINTING TAX-FREE PROFITS
Some tax-free funds are more equal than others. With some care, picking and choosing among them, you might find yourself pocketing some some extra profit.
The difference is that some funds hold ''private purpose'' municipal bonds, which are used to finance housing projects, student loans and recycling programs, among other things.
Private-purpose bonds offer higher yields than other tax-exempt issues because the interest they pay, although free from regular income taxes, may be subject to the alternative minimum tax.
That tax is designed to insure that wealthy taxpayers pay their fair share to the Government. It comes into play when an investor has a mix of certain types of deductions and tax-preferred income.
Investors who are not subject to the minimum tax can increase their returns by choosing funds that buy these bonds. To find out if a fund holds such bonds, call the fund's management.

Iraq Shatters Some Myths About Oil

BYLINE: By ARNOLD NADLER; Arnold Nadler is an energy consultant in Salem, Mass.

 BODY:
''We are frankly puzzled by claims that oil imports from OPEC countries constitute a threat . . . . References to OPEC as a ruthless cartel whose aim is to gain a stranglehold on economies of the West are completely false and misleading . . . . We must all endeavor to create a climate of mutual trust and respect . . . .'' - Dr. H. E. Subroto, Secretary General of OPEC, in the October 1989 OPEC Bulletin.
Like a thunderbolt, Saddam Hussein has shattered the benign illusion of peaceful, uninterrupted world trade in oil. We should be glad that the message has come now, not later. Better to have prices surge to $30 a barrel today, than to $60 under the same scenario in four or five years. 
Since the 1985 low point, world demand for oil produced by members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries has rebounded by seven million barrels a day. The rapid rise parallels the 1966-70 pattern, which was followed by the first oil price shock a few years later.
At about 23 million barrels a day, demand for OPEC oil is still moderate. However, if recent trends continue, by the mid- or late 1990's demand could be back to the daily peaks of 30 million barrels reached in 1973 and 1979. With market power clearly on OPEC's side, we would then be set up for a full-scale repeat of the price shocks of the 1970's. By breaking into the cycle early, Saddam Hussein has probably helped us avoid a more severe crunch down the road.
A useful assumption is that the Iraqi ruler will become the regional enforcer of the Middle East. He will make sure that the oil-producing states in the Persian Gulf and North Africa adhere to production quotas. What should we do?
First, of the 13 members of OPEC, five are outside the Middle East and North Africa. Venezuela, Nigeria, Indonesia, Ecuador and Gabon account for almost one-fourth of OPEC production. We should encourage them to move away from OPEC, something they may want to do anyway.
Second, we should try to brake the rise in world demand for OPEC oil. Since about half of the increase since 1985 is accounted for by soaring American imports, a sustained oil price surge could cost the country dearly geopolitically. Allies would quickly recognize that America's thirst for petroleum strengthened OPEC's hand. Though we are still the second-largest oil-producing nation in the world, our oil imports alone now exceed the petroleum consumed in France, Italy, Britain and West Germany combined.
Higher Federal gasoline taxes make sense. Each penny per gallon means about $1 billion a year in revenues. Both as a deficit-reducing measure, and to dampen consumption growth, a gradual increase of at least 25 cents per gallon would send the right message around the world.
There is a lot of oil in South America. Significant producers include not only Mexico and Venezuela, but Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador and even Peru and Trinidad. Together, they pump more oil than Saudi Arabia (or Iraq and Kuwait combined). Political stability, sensible privatization and outside investment could lead to significantly increased output.
Domestically, we should accelerate the use of natural gas as automobile fuel, and be more realistic about drilling for oil offshore and in Alaska. Offshore drilling can be safer than importing oil by tanker. (British Petroleum is one of the largest oil producers in Alaska, and the Kuwait Investment Office owns 9.9 percent of it. Thus it is conceivable that Saddam Hussein's Iraq could become a significant minority shareholder in Alaska's oil fields.) Prior to the attack on Kuwait, mainstream forecasts pointed to continuing growth in America's thirst for Middle East oil. To make our future more secure, and the world less prone to crisis, we should move decisively to reverse that trend.

Yes, a Bright Side to the S.& L. Bailout

BYLINE: By HAROLD B. EHRLICH; Harold B. Ehrlich is a managing director of the Stamford Company, an investment bank in New York.

 BODY:
By common agreement, the savings and loan bailout is a major financial debacle for everyone except depositors, whose money is safe because of Government guarantees. The cost is borne ultimately by the American taxpayers.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has assessed the near-term direct cost of the bailout at a minimum of $89 billion and perhaps as much as $130 billion, up from the original estimate of $73 billion, which has already been set aside. The General Accounting Office has estimated the long-term overall cost of the bailout at $325 billion or more, including interest, with the total reaching as much as $500 billion. 
The costs in terms of additional unemployment, reduced personal incomes, depressed home prices and business losses probably will run even higher than the G.A.O.'s estimates. Developers and contractors are going bankrupt, people are losing jobs, and savings and loan shareholders are being wiped out. Still, this unmitigated mess has four favorable aspects, none of which has received much attention.
First, the low-quality debt of the troubled savings and loans is being upgraded to the world's highest-quality credit, that which is backed by the United States Government. This is happening by virtue of the Congressionally mandated liquidation of the savings and loan industry's holdings of ''junk bonds,'' plus the Federal Government's financing of the bailout. Specifically, the savings and loan units must sell holdings of low-grade bonds by 1994. Most have already begun doing this.
At the same time, to earn income, savings and loan institutions have been reinvesting the proceeds of these sales largely in higher-quality debt instruments, many issued by the Federal Government or its agencies. In addition, Federal credit is being used to support insolvent saving and loans whose own credit is now worthless. The combination of these activities greatly enhances the overall debt structure of America.
Second, this process has the effect of reducing the total amount of debt in our economy. Savings and loan institutions are selling junk bonds, often at far less than face value. Real estate mortgages and construction loans are being restructured, and many other loans are being called in or written off. The savings and loan institutions are also being forced to cut their own indebtedness, a good deal of which is not worth even close to face value. Additional public debt - mainly Government-backed debt - is being issued to pay for the savings and loan bailout, but much more private debt is being extinguished. The net effect is less total debt.
Third, this reduction of debt and the forced liquidation of assets -dumping junk bonds and real estate holdings - acts as a check on inflation. When the prices of homes are under pressure, businesses are failing, and unemployment is rising, people tend to curb spending. And when so many assets are up for sale, prices in general tend to be soft. However, if the liquidation proceeds too rapidly or goes on too long, these negative impacts, combined with further bankruptcies and unemployment, could do far more than just help restrain inflation; they could bring on deflation, which would hardly be desirable from almost any point of view.
Putting that grim possibility aside, a fourth favorable outcome of the bailout is likely to be generally lower interest rates, for several reasons. Since the overall level of interest rates is greatly influenced by the pace of inflation, slower inflation should help reduce rates. Consolidating and liquifying the savings and loan industry, as well as upgrading its debt quality, also augur for lower interest rates because less demand for credit should help reduce the cost of money.
Few would argue that these favorable aspects of the savings and loan mess - credit upgrading, reduced overall debt burden, slower inflation, or even lower interest rates - are worth the heavy cost in terms of business losses and human hardship. We would not be suffering this trauma if the senior officers of our financial institutions and Congress had acted responsibly.
Without a doubt, a great many people would be better off today if the excesses of the 1980's had not occurred. We can only hope that our economy is not overly damaged by the painful regimen that has been adopted to purge the past financial ills. My assessment, however, is that after the bailout our financial system will be more sound and interest rates will be lower.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Oil Crunch '90: The Game Has Changed

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
If oil prices stay up, how will the poorer countries - and companies - pay their energy bills?
That question may take on great importance in coming weeks, as the world watches to see what Iraq will do as an economic boycott takes hold.
One sure thing is that the patterns established in the two oil shocks of the 1970's will not hold. Then, the oil exporters, awash in cash, deposited the money in Western banks, which in turn lent it to the countries that needed the money to pay for oil. The banks called the process ''recycling,'' and no one spent much time worrying about how those countries would ever repay the loans. It turned out many of them couldn't. Bankers have not forgotten that lesson. 
This time around, the problem may be greater because Eastern Europe no longer can count on cheap Soviet oil.
It's not only the countries that have problems, of course. ''The combination of recession and oil price shock will create a new wave of bankruptcies,'' forecasts Richard Hoey, the chief American economist for Barclays de Zoete Wedd. ''It's very clear that optimistic estimates of cash flow of a lot of borrowers will be disappointed.'' Mr. Hoey had been forecasting a mild recession before the Iraqi annexation of Kuwait. Now he thinks it will be longer and deeper.
Two years ago, when Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc. was still in business and peddling junk bonds, those companies might have found a friendly lender to tide them over. Now the credit markets are in what Mr. Hoey, a veteran of Drexel, calls a ''risk crunch,'' in which would-be borrowers without excellent credit find money unavailable at any price, while blue chip companies can borrow all they want.
In the stock market, a free fall in prices early in the week was followed by a mild rally in mid-week and then a new decline on Friday, as Saddam Hussein called for a ''holy war'' against ''evil enemies'' that included the Saudi royal family. That helped send oil prices back up, with crude for delivery next month at $26.23 per barrel, and send the rate on 30-year Treasury bonds up to 8.79 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average was down 93.07 points for the week, to 2,716.58, and is now 9.4 percent below the peak it reached less than a month ago.
Although it seems clear that Mideast news will dominate the markets for some time, and positive developments could start a rally, it is worth remembering that the current dip in prices started before the Iraqi invasion. ''Even if the Iraqi problem disappears,'' said Steven Einhorn, the chief investment strategist at Goldman, Sachs, ''the market still has to confront the fundamentals of a weak economy and earnings disappointments.'' He says stocks remain overvalued.
If the Mideast standoff drags on, and oil prices stay high, the big division in financial markets is likely to be one of quality and safety. Companies with the financial flexibility to cope with higher oil prices and lower sales are likely to do much better than those that badly need to borrow when no one wants to lend.

HEADLINE: Very Often, Low-Tech Is Beautiful

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The report on stylus-based computers (''Liberating Machines from Keyboards,'' July 29) demonstrates a tendency to seek a complex, high-tech solution when a low-tech one would do. 
For instance, a problem with keyboards for those of us who type badly is that we hit the wrong key or two keys at the same time. A larger keyboard, either with bigger keys or with greater spacing between the keys, would solve that problem very well.

HEADLINE: Chief Trumpet

 BODY:
Scholars like Clinton Rossiter describe the American President in terms that make him sound like a hat rack: Chief of State, Commander in Chief, Chief Diplomat, Chief Legislator, Chief Economic Strategist and, at least until the end of the cold war, Leader of the Western World.
Last week, a tired but tenacious George Bush demonstrated his appetite and aptitude for another role - leader of all countries, Western and Eastern, outraged by Saddam Hussein's naked aggression in Kuwait. Following his lead, the world rose up. 
At the same time, the President demonstrated a shortcoming that could undermine his orchestration of strength. ''Words at great moments of history are deeds,'' Attlee said of Churchill in 1945. Americans support their President when trouble strikes. But that support soon dissipates unless they understand the reasons to take risks. That's why Mr. Bush needs to fulfill another Presidential function as important as the rest: Chief Trumpet.
George Bush, foreign affairs expert, rarely shines as a strategist. He let a year pass before seizing the monumental openings offered by Mikhail Gorbachev. He aided and traded with Iraq for over a year. Even so, as Friday's remarkable news from Cairo attests, he is a superb crisis manager.
The decision by 12 countries to send an Arab force to Saudi Arabia gave him his third triumph of the crisis. It followed his success at persuading Moscow to join in condemning Iraq, and at mobilizing other countries to action.
President Bush's decision to send in troops was probably compelled by the danger that Iraqi armies would invade the Saudi oil wells. But it ran the risk that Arab attitudes would one day curdle, making American defenders look like infidel intruders. The Cairo decision could remove that curse.
As admirably as the President has performed as crisis manager, however, he faces another test of leadership. A President can call on patriotism for prompt support in a crisis. For it to last, he must engender understanding. To achieve that, the public needs answers to some uncomfortable questions.
Notably, why before the invasion did the Reagan and Bush Administrations so indulge Saddam Hussein? They granted him credits and technology transfers - all despite his hellish use of poison gas to attack Iranian troops and to slaughter 5,000 Kurds. Why did the U.S. stop at limp lamentation?
Since the invasion, Mr. Bush has been commendably clear in condemning Iraq. Still, his speech Wednesday was more notable for asserting the national interest than explaining it. A new New York Times Poll shows that while most Americans endorse the President's action, half do not comprehend the dangers.
Military necessity may have left no time to bargain with European allies over their troop contributions. But why must the U.S. again bear a disproportionate share of the burden of defending oil that they need even more than America does?
Sophisticated citizens know how much the world depends on Saudi oil. It's up to the occupant of the bully pulpit to educate ordinary citizens, including parents of those G.I.'s, to these harsh realities. Energy experts argue compellingly that it's time to release oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. But whose job is it to explain why America's conservation efforts have lapsed into indifference? The same Chief Trumpet.
No one expects eloquence from George Bush, who last week was at his plain-spoken best. But if he's to sustain the siege of Iraq, he'll have to see that words are deeds.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
Soldiers In the Sands

BYLINE: By A.M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The alliance between the United States and Western Europe will face a clear but so far unspoken danger in the Middle East. It is important to face it in advance.
Unless allies of the United States are willing to commit ground troops - not just votes at the United Nations, not just planes and warships, but ground troops fighting in support of American soldiers and Marines -the alliance will become a mockery to millions of Americans.
If there is a desert battle in which American troops are the only Westerners to fight and die, American emotional withdrawal from the alliance will come quickly. 
A national surge for American political and military withdrawal will follow as the night the day. In the next election American candidates who still believe the alliance is worth American treasure or blood will be able to say so - and then retire to private life.
The only way to prevent all this is for Americans who believe in the worth of the alliance to speak up, frank and loud. This has not yet been done by American diplomacy or the American press.
So far everybody is pleased by the Western support President Bush has been promised at sea and in the air. That pleasure will last until the first ground battle.
The votes at the U.N. show that finally European governments understand that Saddam Hussein's dictatorship is not simply a ''regional'' threat.
Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the other oil states are feudal tyrannies, in themselves not worth jeopardizing the life of a single foreign soldier. If Saddam ever decides to let some of the Kuwaiti ruling family creep back into the country, they will eagerly follow his boots where he leads them, preferably into Israel - but with their money, of course, not their lives.
But because Saddam's lust for power has exceeded his wisdom, the West sees now what was always quite plain to see. Saddam Hussein intends to control the entire Middle East, as the instrument for dominating the Western economy.
The West deluded itself so long because it was wonderfully profitable to sell him weapons and death factories and to buy and resell his oil. American business lobbies told us what a good guy he was, remember?
Western Middle Eastern specialists sang us the lullaby about Arab brotherhood and how Brother Saddam would not attack Brother Emir or Brother King.
Brothers? Ask the Lebanese about shellfire from the occupation of Brother Syrians or the Kurds about the slaughter by Brother Iraqis.
European, African and American nations also know how to kill each other. But they spare the world the prattle about brotherhood while doing the killing.
Saddam ended the delusion by making his threat to his brothers and to the West at least temporarily inseparable. Our economy and their necks are bound together by his greed.
Fortunately President Bush sent ground troops before he had any guarantee that the Arabs or our allies would join us with the necessary strength.
If Mr. Bush had waited for advance guarantees, we would be waiting still. Saddam would be turning the oil spigot on and off at his pleasure while we gathered below, with money and weapons for him in our submissive hands.
It is not brotherhood that prevented the Arab states from uniting against Saddam before he sent his troops into Kuwait or why they kissed him for the cameras. This is the knowledge that eats at their leaders: They are too weak in the esteem of their people to take any risks with confidence.
Now Arab states say they will create an Arab force to help the U.S. save their oil and skins. That will be welcome, but perhaps it is better to wait to see how many Arab states actually put soldiers into the field.
Whatever the Arabs do, Americans will feel they have every moral right to expect the support of the allies where the U.S. gave it to them - on the battle ground.
The Western alliance cannot afford to wait long for Britain, France, Italy, Greece and other partners to commit themselves to join the American soldiers in the sand if the battle comes.
Mr. Bush did not say the U.S. would send ships and planes but no ground troops. It will come hard if that is the position of America's allies.
One day Saddam Hussein will go down, to Western power, to a coup or to an Arab terrorist, perhaps even his own working for a new Arab master.
But it will be a terrible sorrow if, before he goes, he is able to do what Hitler and Stalin, his role models, could never do: Turn Americans away from the Western alliance.

HEADLINE: Saddam Hussein, Mideast's Noriega, Has to Go

BYLINE: By Bernard E. Trainor; Bernard E. Trainor directs the national security program at Harvard's Kennedy School of Government.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
The issue underlying President Bush's moves in the Persian Gulf is not Kuwait or Saudi Arabia or even oil. It is Saddam Hussein, the Noriega of the Middle East. Like his Panamanian counterpart, he has to go. He ought to be disposed of now before his power and opportunity for doing greater damage grows.
Apparently, President Bush's first strategic goal has been achieved. It's too late for President Hussein to try to conquer Saudi Arabia without paying an unacceptable price at the hands of U.S. air power. 
Mr. Hussein's first option is to sit tight in Kuwait and try to outwait the U.S. while American troops sweat and swat flies in the desert. This option is based on the assumption that the U.S. troops and the Arab troops who will join them will all weary of their commitment as the gulf remains tranquil and the world turns its attention elsewhere.
It also assumes that avarice and greed will lead some to circumvent the international economic sanctions and clandestinely deal with Iraq. Although President Hussein has little cash, he has enough to prolong the siege, as well as Arab admirers willing to secretly help a brother survive.
In playing a waiting game, he holds one card he will likely use to advantage: hostages - thousands from many nations.
Saddam Hussein can also be expected to agitate an increasingly inflamed Arab world into viewing the industrial nations as infidels determined to humiliate the Arabs - a tactic probably accompanied by a renewed terrorism campaign.
Ascending the ladder of violence, Saddam Hussein's next option is to try to inflict a surprising defeat or unacceptable casualties on the U.S. forces and make a grab for Saudi Arabia. Xenophobic and isolated, he may believe that significant American bloodletting would undermine American resolve, as it did after did after the bombing of the Marine barracks in Beirut that killed 241.
His tank divisions, well placed for a massive attack on Saudi Arabia with little warning, could succeed only if Iraq neutralized U.S. air power with chemical weapons. But the U.S. field commander, aware of this threat, surely would insist on a pre-emptive strike against Iraqi chemical-delivery capabilities. Even a partly successful strike by Iraqi missiles and aircraft armed with nerve gas against troops, airfields, ships, supply depots and the oil infrastructure could have a devastating psychological effect on Americans and Saudis alike.
It would also contaminate aircraft, making them temporarily unusable during a critical period and causing widespread casualties among servicemen and oil workers despite their protective clothing and antichemical devices.
U.S. troops are only marginally trained in chemical defense and have never faced such a prospect, as did their forebears in World War I. Besides, young soldiers won't want to wear clumsy protective overgarments, particularly in 120 degree heat, regardless of the lethal threat. Additionally, how well the suits will remain protective under rough use in the field is an unknown.
The third, most dramatic option available to Saddam Hussein, having declared an Arab holy war, is to attack Israel with chemical weapons, fulfilling his threat to scorch that country.
This might totally destabilize the Middle East and suck some of Saddam Hussein's Arab brothers into the conflict. At the least, it would generate further support from millions of disfranchised Arabs who lionize him and who could ignite civil disorder in the conservative and moderate Arab states. This turmoil would add a new dimension to the conflict and, in Saddam Hussein's eyes, create ripe opportunities to advance his ambitions.
If economic strangulation doesn't work, what are President Bush's options?
His greatest hope is to stimulate opposition in Iraq so that the Iraqis oust the man who is leading them to national suicide - not an easy task in the tightly controlled police state.
Though Americans are clumsy at fostering coups, it is not inconceivable that our agents might try to foment discontent, if not outright rebellion, among young army officers.
Another option is to wait patiently for a provocation that provides a credible justification for striking at Iraq's vitals: its industrial capacity, waterways, transportation and communications, depots and barracks, and, most of all, chemical and budding nuclear-production sites.
The odds are that in time Saddam Hussein will hand us the opportunity we seek; presumably we would then exploit our strong suit, air power, and avoid major ground combat.
Whatever we do, its goal should be to convince the Iraqi military to rid itself of its misguided commander. That may not be a possible or even realistic aim, but it is a worthy one in the service of Middle East peace.

HEADLINE: All for Oil, a Fuel That Fouls Air and Water

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The panic in the financial and oil markets and at the gas pumps in the wake of Iraq's invasion of Kuwait is just another one of many chickens, like the savings and loan institutions fiasco, that have come home to roost after having flown the coop in the shortsighted 1980's.
Sure, it is a bad thing that Saddam Hussein marched into Kuwait and stole all that oil. But anyone with sense knew that, sooner or later, he or someone like him was going to do just that. Yet all through the 80's, the Reagan Administration, with almost everyone's wholehearted assent, systematically dismantled all research into alternative fuels and eliminated all encouragements toward conservation (remember ''Americans have a right to all the heat and air-conditioning they want''?), so that by the end of the decade we were importing much more oil than at the beginning. 
Can we really be as stupid as we appear to be? Think about what we are now fighting over: a fuel that is inherently dirty and dangerous at all stages of its production and use, and one that becomes more and more inefficient as it becomes scarcer. As we are reminded every day by spills in Alaska, Galveston, the Arthur Kill and the Cape of Good Hope, and noxious clouds over New York, Los Angeles, Athens and Istanbul, petroleum is a substance that has fouled the water and air of the planet ever since we started using it and one that will continue to do so until the last economically viable drop is found, processed and burned (assuming that it is not spilled beforehand).
Obviously, there are massive amounts of capital tied up in the production, refining and distribution of petroleum-based products. Just as obviously, we should not have kicked the fossil-fuel habit cold turkey. But we've known how scarce and dangerous this stuff is for at least 20 years, and we've known that any of a number of foreign potentates can grab control of a big chunk of it easily.
Thus, there was simply no justification for abandoning efforts begun during the first series of oil crises and continued throughout the Carter years to encourage conservation and to develop clean, domestic sources of energy that would prevent the sort of lunacy we are now seeing from occurring over and over again.
As long as we sit back and believe that we can rely on energy sources from countries that have neither the stability nor the inclination to supply us, we will be vulnerable to the sort of massive dislocations we are facing. And even if the supplies were ever to become reliable, do we really want this stuff? Instead of threatening sanctions and war over a finite and filthy resource like crude oil, let's deploy our energies toward finding a more practical and satisfying substitute. The world will be a safer, cleaner and more peaceful place as a result.

HEADLINE: The Paris Season For Gate-Crashers

BYLINE: By alice Furlaud; Alice Furlaud is a writer and broadcaster who lives in Paris.

 BODY:
The summer invasion so dreaded by American residents of Paris is in full spate. As the French Parisians flee their city, heading for the sewage-saturated seashore, on come wave upon wave of our fellow Americans, inundating Paris and our apartments: the friends, the friends of friends, the children of friends of friends, the friends of friends of the children of friends, the whole implacable pack of them determined to live it up in Paris for one-eighteenth of what it costs them to live very simply in, say, Fond du Lac, Wis.
''Hi! You don't know me, I'm at the Gare de Lyon,'' is the typical early-morning telephone call being received daily by one or another American expatriate this month. It's not as easy to Just Say No as you might think. The first time the doorbell woke me at 8 A.M. I assumed the two young thugs at the door had just escaped from prison.
After a few seconds I realized that no self-respecting prison would have allowed the wide streaks of magenta in the center of their convicts' haircuts. I also realized that one of them was the son of a dear American friend, so for her sake I let him and his companion sleep on my floor for three (for me) troubled nights. 
They were on their way from the rented Venice palazzo of one divorced parent to the rented Amsterdam houseboat of another. But in spite of their privileged backgrounds neither of them had - and this is practically always the case - more than 100 francs in his pocket.
A friend of mine living on the elegant Rue Bonaparte once had guests for 93 consecutive nights. Calm ensued. On the 96th day they started coming again, and she lost count.
Another woman I know endured 83 consecutive days of self-invited guests in her luxurious Luxembourg Gardens apartment. Then a call came from her ex-husband's ex-girlfriend's daughter, a person my friend had never set eyes on: ''I'm at the airport; could I stay with you for a few weeks?'' The worm made a U-turn: ''No!''
But for several days thereafter young men telephoned from the United States at hours like 4 A.M. asking for the girl. She'd given out my friend's number with that confident assumption, which amazes all of us who live here, that one of our functions as residents of Paris is to provide hotel, restaurant, consular, translating and travel agency services for any or all Americans who manage to get hold of our addresses.
On behalf of all my fellow-suffering Americans in Paris, I am posting the following notice at all American international airports and at the major railroad stations of Paris:
 
Rules for Would-Be Guests Of Americans Living in Paris
 
Planning the Visit
1. Never, ever arrive at someone's home unannounced, even if you have to spend two nights in the Tuileries Gardens.
2. Even if a Paris resident you met in America has actually invited you to stay with her - I mean ''him'' too; but the most vulnerable pads in Paris seem to belong to women - when telephoning to take her up on the offer, reverse field at once if there's the slightest nuance of a hesitation in her voice.
3. If the hosts you have targeted turn you down on the ground that their apartment is too small and there's only one bed, do not say ''I don't mind sleeping on the floor.'' They might mind. You hadn't thought of that, had you?
4. Never ask to stay with anyone you wouldn't naturally stay with in the United States. Noticing in the school alumni magazine that someone you knew in the second grade lives in Paris, should not encourage you to move into her apartment, even if only for a weekend.
5. If you're accepted, ask your hosts if there's anything they would like from their native land. They will probably choose some small item unobtainable in Paris like bobby pins or shredded wheat. But this should not count as your total thank-you present. Unless the hosts respond to your offer by ordering Word Perfect 5 for their computer, take them something fairly costly.
An Indian turquoise ring is packable; so is a box of wild rice or 10 beautiful linen handkerchiefs. Or buy them something in Paris. A case of Champagne for every week you stay with your friends will be much cheaper than a hotel and is the least you should provide.
 
Once Installed as a Guest
1. Even if your hosts are the age of your parents, don't treat them like your parents. Take them out to dinner once, and don't ask ''Do you know a cheap restaurant?'' Go to a cheap restaurant by yourself; but when entertaining your hosts - who will inevitably have to provide you with quite a few meals - do not skimp. Remarks like ''Is the Tour d'Argent still the best place?'' will go down well.
2. Be generous not only with your hosts but also with yourself in Paris. It's a peculiar fact that many Americans, young and old, choose the occasion of their first visit to begin a strict, miserly economy regime. They wander suspiciously around the grandest and most glorious city on earth, treating it like a clip joint.
A well-heeled couple from Minnesota once decided to spend their first visit to Paris on my living-room floor. They dined at only one restaurant - at my insistence. The rest of the time they bought food (the first few times I had to go with them to protect them from the dreadful non-English-speaking market men) and ate it cross-legged on my floor. They kept me at the telephone for hours comparison-shopping for a cheap trip to England, and when I found one that cost about the same as going Greyhound from Minneapolis to St. Paul, they gasped in horror at the price.
3. Even if you are urged to have breakfast with your hosts (better to stay in bed until they leave for work), keep the questions you are burning to ask (''How many francs are there to the dollar?'' ''How do you say chocolate chip cookies in French?'' ''Why do the windows open like that?'') until much later, say at the cocktail hour.
4. Limit the calls you make from your host's telephone to a very few local calls. Most French telephone bills are not itemized, and ''timing'' your long distance calls always works out to the host's disadvantage. Buy a telephone card and use phone booths. If you speak no French, limit the number of calls you ask your host to make for you to two the first day, one thereafter.
5. If blue jeans are absolutely the only thing you ever wear at home, go ahead and wear them in Paris - no one will be shocked. But if normally you dress in establishment or Vogue magazine perfection at your office in San Francisco or at dinner parties in Greenwich, your choice of jeans for Paris is insulting to this elegant city and to your hosts, even if your only baggage is a backpack. In my college days, after the war and before permanent press, we came over to Europe for the summer carrying only what would fit on a bicycle. We too wore shorts and jeans - but rolled up in our knapsacks were a sleeveless jersey dress and a pair of ballet slippers, in case of an evening out. A crushable cotton Indian skirt or a tie can be rolled up just as easily.
6. Don't expect your Paris friends to tour the city with you: You are on vacation: they're not.
P.S. There is nothing shameful about staying in a hotel.The little French hotel is a vital part of the Paris experience. (See Babar and Celeste having breakfast in bed in what appears to be the Hotel Lancaster, in Jean de Brunhoff's ''Voyage de Babar.'') But don't ask American friends to get you a hotel room. They'll have to put down a deposit or at least write a confirming letter to the hotel. Yours will be the 15th or 20th request of this kind they have had this summer.

HEADLINE: At the End of the Oregon Trail

BYLINE: By Suzie Boss; Suzie Boss is a journalist who lives in Portland, Ore.

 BODY:
It's hard to imagine an American beyond the age of 12 who doesn't know a thing or two about the Oregon Trail. Rugged pioneers and their prairie schooners rank up there with the people on the Mayflower as historical archetypes. But even those who can manage a glib discourse on Manifest Destiny or identify the year when the Great Migration began might have trouble pinpointing where the pioneers' journey ended.
Oregon City, the official end of the trail, is a quiet community of 16,000, a dozen miles up the Willamette River from Portland. Once the capital of a territory that sprawled from the Rockies to the Pacific, Oregon City probably claims more firsts than any other community this side of the Mississippi: first incorporated city, first newspaper, first Masonic lodge, first jail, first moonshine whisky still. Oregon City also holds the original plat of San Francisco, filed in 1850 at the only Federal courthouse for thousands of square miles. 
Yet during occasional visits since I migrated to Oregon in the mid-1970's, I've found Oregon City surprisingly bashful of boasting about the role it played in Western history. This is a working town, not a museum piece, and the paper mill and county courthouse on Main Street are the twin peaks of the local economy. It's also a bedroom community for Portland, with newer housing subdivisions pressing in against the older city core. And as the last major suburb to the south of Portland, Oregon City is also a transition point between city and country, with farmland lapping against the edges of town.
During a recent tour, however, I sensed a shift in mood. In 1987, residents lobbied the state legislature to declare Oregon City the ''true and correct end of the Oregon National Historic Trail.'' The bill seemed to spark Oregon City's pride and has coincided with several other efforts to lure history-minded visitors. Oregon City doesn't yet rival Colonial Williamsburg, but the lower-key approach may well be part of its charm.
Since 1987, Oregon City has been host to an annual summer pageant dedicated to pioneer days. Last summer, 5,000 visitors watched the dramatization of life along the Oregon Trail, circa 1851.
The city has also taken stock of its architectural heritage and published five walking-tour guides, highlighting homes dating from the 1840's and many Queen Anne Victorians from the turn of the century. Many of these are tucked into the same hillside in the heart of the city.
Other historic houses have opened as museums, and two are now bed and breakfast inns. A group known as the Old Home Forum has installed markers on notable homes, many of them listed on the National Register of Historic Places. With its pioneer pageant, two historic districts and a dedicated cadre of historians and preservationists polishing the city's heritage, Oregon City is once again starting to draw visitors.
One letter tacked to a museum wall offers proof. The traveler, a 72-year-old from Vermont, said his journey across the Oregon Trail - by bicycle - took him ''six weeks lacking a day,'' a far sight quicker than the six months it took pioneers to cover the 2,200 miles from Independence, Mo. Other Oregon Trail buffs frequently arrive in Oregon City in RV's and cars, lining up to have their pictures taken next to ''End of the Oregon Trail'' markers.
Even those who don't cover the entire Oregon Trail before arriving here can expect to stretch their legs to get to the local sights. Contemporary Oregon City is set on three basalt terraces, rising like broad stairsteps above the Willamette River. A free-standing municipal elevator - billed as ''the nation's only vertical street'' - connects the riverside level with the second tier, 100 feet above. The ride is free in both directions, but lifetime elevator passes are dispensed as keepsakes. The observatory at the top offers views of the river, the old downtown district and, on clear days, Portland and Mount St. Helens to the north. Those who want a real workout can take the stone stairs, built by W.P.A. crews in the 1930's.
The city began at the river's edge, just above the crashing waters of Willamette Falls. Here, the river spills 40 feet over a wide, horseshoe-shaped basaltic reef, creating a natural fish ladder that has made the site a fishing and trading place for 3,000 years. During spring salmon and steelhead runs, fishermen anchor their boats side by side to form a ''hog line'' just below the falls. Willamette Falls Locks, operating since 1873 on the west bank of the river and now a National Historic Site, moves river traffic around the falls.
It took Dr. John McLoughlin, chief factor of the Hudson's Bay Company at Fort Vancouver and the man that local schoolchildren know as the Father of Oregon, to think of harnessing the river's power for a sawmill and flour mill. Since the gristmill was opened in 1838, Oregon City has been a mill town. Main Street still ends at a paper mill, and a second mill operates across the river at West Linn.
Much of the lower level of Oregon City houses county government offices, but a few older buildings are used as retail shops, taverns and cafes. South of Main Street along State Route 99E lies the Canemah National Historic District, home to riverboat captains and boat builders during the 1860's. Many of their Gothic Revival homes remain, including the 1867 E. B. Fellows Residence, now painted bright peach and used as a bed and breakfast inn and restaurant.
Most of the self-guided tours, however, begin at the McLoughlin House, built in 1846 and now a National Historic Site. The boxy, two-story, white Georgian Revival home sits atop the cliff on the city's second level, the McLoughlin Historic District, where most of the city's museums and older homes are situated. A parklike promenade lines the cliff's edge.
The McLoughlin House is the city's oldest preservation success story. Originally built on the lower level of town, the house fell into disrepair and disreputable use after the death of the Canadian-born Dr. McLoughlin and his Swiss-Indian wife, Marguerite. In 1909, the house was winched up nearby Singer Hill, and restored by the McLoughlin Memorial Association. It has been operating continuosly as a museum since 1910.
About a third of the furnishings are original, including the blue floral china that Dr. McLoughlin had shipped from the Staffordshire district of England. The ornately set dining table, capable of seating 24, came from Fort Vancouver, where Dr. McLoughlin supervised beaver trading for the Hudson's Bay Company for nearly 20 years. Hudson's Bay officers lived like noblemen in the wilderness, typically sitting down to a five-course midday meal.
Although Dr. McLoughlin was considered a capable manager, his kindness to American pioneers eventually cost him favor with the British trading company, and he was forced to retire. He cut a handsome deal with the trading company, landing in Oregon City a wealthy man. His home, complete with glass windows, milled door frames and separate outbuildings for cooking and bathing, was a model of gracious living. Dr. McLoughlin lived here the last 11 years of his life and became a United States citizen in 1851. He and his wife are buried on the grounds of the McLoughlin House.
Furnishings include Dr. McLoughlin's intricately carved mahogany four-poster, surprisingly short for a man who stood 6 feet, 4 inches. The museum curator, Nancy Wilson, said that health practices of the day called for sleeping propped almost to a sitting position. The desk he used, also from Fort Vancouver, housed a subscription library for the Hudson's Bay Company. Seven volumes from the original Columbia Libary remain in the desk, along with a medical library dating from 1833. Oriental cabinets, beaver hats and pelts, Indian artifacts, pioneer-era spool beds and a 200-year-old quilt are among other exhibits that draw 12,000 visitors a year.
Next door sits the 1849 Barclay House, built by Dr. Forbes Barclay, physician at Fort Vancouver from 1840 to 1850. Once he moved to Oregon City, Dr. Barclay threw himself into civic affairs, serving as town doctor, coroner, mayor and school superintendent. This Colonial Revival house was also built beside the river, moved to its present site in 1937 and renovated by W.P.A. workers. The first floor is open as a visitor's center and gift shop. A small swatch of original wallpaper, the lining from tea boxes, remains.
Two other homes turned musuems are a short walk away, both near the 1913 Carnegie Library, which occupies a grassy square block. The Frances Ermatinger House, built in 1845, is the third oldest house in Oregon and the oldest in Oregon City. Built on the riverfront level, it has been moved twice, occupying the current McLoughlin level site since 1986. Ruth McBride Powers, a long-time preservation activist and Oregon City resident, bought the house, restored it and furnished it with period piecs from her extensive collection.
Mr. Ermatinger, another fur trader with strong ties to the Hudson's Bay Company and to Dr. McLoughlin, lived only four years in Oregon City. His home, however, will long be remembered as the site where Portland, Ore., won its name. The pioneers Asa Lovejoy, from Boston, and Francis Pettygrove, from Portland, Me., each wanted to give the name of his hometown to the new settlement they were plotting downriver. After dinner one night in 1845, in the study of the Ermatinger House, they flipped a liberty penny. Mr. Pettygrove won, and the new town that was then just a clearing on the riverbank would grow to overshadow Oregon City. Portland gained an early advantage due to its deeper natural harbor. Once the hub of trade moved a dozen miles downstream, other commerce and culture followed.
By the turn of the century Oregon City had lost much of its early thunder to Portland, but the older community was scarcely a backwater. In 1908, Harley Stevens, a station agent for the Oregon Pacific Railway, packed his new Georgian Revival home with enhancements. The museum has been known as the Mertie Stevens House, since the daughter who occupied it until age 96 willed it to the Clackamas County Historical Society in 1968.
The home contains many of the Stevens's original furnishings. The kitchen looks as though the cook had just stepped out, leaving pie crimpers, cream stealers and pot lifters on the counter. A large pot pantry, next to a wood range, is stocked with tinware, and a summer kitchen on the back porch is set up for canning. With separate rooms for sewing and linens, an open-air sleeping porch, a pass-through pantry opening onto the dining room and extensive built-in cabinetry, the house was a showpiece of modern ideas. The Stevens House contains a large collection of dolls, many of them Mertie's, Native American baskets and artifacts and an assortment of antique clocks.
This McLoughlin level is also home to the End of the Oregon Trail Interpretive Center. A slide show recounts the saga of the overland migration that brought 300,000 pioneers west. Exhibits describe what life was like along the way. Visitors learn that pioneer women wore split drawer undergarments to make campground hygiene easier and insisted on bonnets to protect their complexions from the prairie sun.
Diary entries tell of the hardships and small joys of the journey, and letters home at the trail's end recount the optimism that even six months of hard travel didn't erase. ''We could in five years all be wealthy farmers,'' wrote one early arrival to Oregon City. The promise of 640 acres of free, verdant land and a chance at a fresh start in life proved intoxicating enough to risk 1-in-10 odds of death.
From the End of the Trail Interpretive Center, it's a short drive or leisurely walk downhill to the real end of the trail, marked by a pavilion, monument and flagpoles. Pioneers called the meeting place Abernethy Green, but today it's better known as the Kelley Field baseball diamond. The national pastime seems a fitting use. Baseball was invented at about the same time that wagons began heading west over the Oregon Trail.
When wagon trains arrived at trail's end after a harrowing journey over the Barlow Pass summit of snow-covered Mount Hood, families would camp at Abernethy Green while scouting for land to homestead. They filed land claims in Oregon City, then scattered throughout the Willamette Valley to start life from scratch.
On a clear day, 11,000-foot Mount Hood looks almost close enough to touch from Kelley Field. With a little imagination, it's not hard to envision prairie schooners billowing down the last hillside and children in sunbonnets and worn breeches running ahead to frolic on the green at journey's end.

HEADLINE: WHAT'S DOING IN;
The Twin Cities

BYLINE: By Suzanne Winckler; Suzanne Winckler is the author of Great Lakes and Plains States volumes of ''The Smithsonian Guide to Historic America'' (Stewart Tabori & Chang).

 BODY:
Minneapolis and St. Paul rise up on the plain like two glimmering mirages. They are known to outlanders as the Twin Cities, but since there's nothing for hundreds of miles across the farmscape that might invite comparison or confusion, most Minnesotans simply call them the Cities. They perch on tree-lined bluffs at the confluence of the Mississippi and the lesser-known but equally handsome Minnesota River.
Poised on these brinks, the cities somehow seem lofty, and from many vantage points a person has the giddy sensation of standing on a balcony or the prow of a boat. The Dakota Indians, from whom Zebulon Pike purchased the land in 1805 that inaugurated white settlement in these parts, called the area Mendota, or Meeting of the Waters.
As cities go, Minneapolis and St. Paul maintain a remarkable affiliation with nature. Excellent proof of this coalition are the four pairs of peregrine falcons that nested this year on the rooftops of high-rises in the metropolitan area. As August merges into September the air turns brisk, the trees start to gild, and people go out for a last-minute revel. 
There are a lot of places in the Cities for autumn basking. Perhaps the best-known natural attraction set aside for public use is the cluster of jewel-like lakes - Cedar Lake, Lake of the Isles, Lake Calhoun, Lake Harriet, Hiawatha Lake and Lake Nokomis - that lie in the heart of Minneapolis. But there are also many hiking and nature trails throughout the 7,000-acre Minnesota Valley National Wildlife Refuge in the suburb of Bloomington (visitor's center, 3815 East 80th Street; 612-854-5900).
In St. Paul, Como Park (main entrance at Midway Parkway and Hamline Avenue, 612-488-7291) is a lovely 350-acre park, which was established in the 1880's. It features a free zoo (612-488-4041) and a beautiful Victorian conservatory.
 
Events
The annual event that caps summer in these parts is the Minnesota State Fair (main entrance at North Snelling and Midway Parkway, 612-642-2262 or 800-383-3247). This year the fair runs from Aug. 23 to Sept. 3. The many exhibit barns and show arenas remind Twin Citians of the agricultural base of their urban economy. Performers at the fair will include Bill Cosby, Bob Dylan, Bonnie Raitt, the Beach Boys and George Strait. Gate tickets are $4 for adults, $2.50 for children and senior citizens. General admission to the shows is $6.75 to $8.25; reserved seats are $11.75 to $13.25.
At the Walker Art Center (Vineland Place, 612-375-7577), a show on ''Russian Constructivism, Art Into Life 1914-1932,'' runs from Oct. 7 to Dec. 30. Open Tuesday through Saturday from 10 to 8, Sunday from 11 to 5. Admission is $3, $2 for children and senior citizens, except on Thursday, when admission is free.
At the Minneapolis Institute of Arts (2400 Third Avenue South, 612-870-3131), ''Mirrors of Empire: Dutch Marine Art of the 17th Century'' runs from Sept. 23 to Dec. 30. Open Tuesday, Wednesday, Friday and Saturday from 10 to 5, Thursday from 10 to 9 and Sunday from noon to 5. Admission free.
The institute has also just completed restoration of the William Purcell House (2328 Lake Place), which was designed in 1913 by the architecture partners William Purcell and George Elmslie. This Prairie School masterpiece will be open to the public every weekend throughout September and the second Saturday of each month thereafter. Reservations are necessary. In St. Paul, the Science Museum (30 East 10th Street, 612-221-9488) dispels ursine myths with ''Bears: Imagination and Reality,'' which runs through Jan. 30. Shows at the museum's Omnitheater, noted for its large, wraparound screen, are ''Race the Wind,'' a movie on sailing that runs until Nov. 11, and ''The Great Barrier Reef,'' which opens Nov. 13 and runs to March 17. Open Monday to Saturday from 9:30 to 9, Sunday from 11 to 9. Admission $6 adults, $5 children and senior citizens, including the movie.
 
Great Vistas
The following spots reveal the blufftop character of the Twin Cities.
Fort Snelling (Routes 5 and 55 near Mendota Bridge, 612-726-1171) was a frontier outpost established in 1819 to regulate trade and traffic on the Mississippi River, which was then the main avenue of travel on the continent. Standing on sheer cliffs at the confluence of the two rivers, the diamond-shaped limestone compound commands a fine view. Open daily through Oct. 31 from 10 to 5; admission $2 adults, $1 children and senior citizens.
The James J. Hill House (240 Summit Avenue, 612-297-2555) sits on the edge of the bluff at the head of the most fashionable residential street in St. Paul. The 36,000-square-foot Richardsonian Romanesque mansion was the home of the 19th-century entrepreneur who built the Great Northern Railroad. Open Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday from 10 to 3:30; $2 adults, $1 children and senior citizens.
Windows on Minnesota (612-349-6250) is a restaurant on the 50th floor of Johnson and Burgee's well-known 20th-century architectural landmark, the IDS Center (717 Nicollet Mall), in downtown Minneapolis. While the tariff is steep (dinner for two will run around $90), this perch offers stunning views of the Mississippi River and the city of St. Paul to the east.
The Pillsbury A Mill (Main Street Southeast at Third Avenue Southeast) is a huge limestone structure built in 1881 to use waterpower from nearby St. Anthony Falls on the Mississippi. This cascade was the nucleus around which commercial-industrial Minneapolis grew. Call 612-296-8205 to get information on how to obtain Walking the Falls, a self-guided walking tour of the district.
 
Where to Stay
Hyatt Regency Minneapolis (1300 Nicollet Mall, 612-370-1234) is tucked into a surprisingly cozy corner on the south end of Nicollet Mall, nirvana for shoppers and window-shoppers. It is also an easy walk from the Walker Art Center and Sculpture Garden. Rates for two from $165 to $180 during the week; $99 to $110 weekends.
Normandy Inn Best Western (405 South Eighth Street, outside Minnesota 800-372-3131, in state 800-362-3131) is a short walk to Nicollet Mall and the Metrodome. Rates for double occupancy range from $56.50 to $72.50.
Budget choice (Minneapolis): Nan's Bed and Breakfast (2304 Fremont Avenue South, 612-377-5118) supplies a homelike atmosphere in a restored Victorian house. A room for two people, with shared bath, is $45.
The Radisson Hotel St. Paul (11 East Kellogg Boulevard, 612-292-1900) is in the downtown business district right next to the Mississippi River. A double is $99 during the week; $65 on weekends.
The Sheraton Midway in St. Paul (I-94 at Hamline Avenue, 612-642-1234) offers convenience for car travelers, since I-94 is the quickest route between the two cities. Weekday rates for a double are $79; weekend rates are $49.
Budget choice (St. Paul): The University Club (420 Summit Avenue, 612-222-1751), where F. Scott Fitzgerald used to meet friends for drinks, is now a tennis, athletic, eating and drinking spot for Summit Avenue neighbors. It also has two rooms for guests, which run $45 and $65 respectively for two people.
 
Where to Eat
Haute cuisine is not in overabundance in the Twin Cities and what survives there must pass the muster of a clientele that is by birthright thrifty and wary of affectation. Part of the fun of dining at a high-ticket establishment comes after the meal with the inspection of the check and discussion as to whether the occasion equaled the tab.
Under recent scrutiny was Azur (651 Nicollet Mall, 612-342-2500) in the Gaviidae Common shopping mall in downtown Minneapolis. Azur, with an icy underwaterlike interior of purple and black neon, has glass curtain walls overlooking a sleek urban landscape that includes a peek at the venerable Art Deco-style Foshay Tower. The artfully served Provence-inspired menu includes a scrumptious duck liver and rhubarb appetizer, tender medallions of lamb strewn with arugula, and numerous fresh fish and crustacean dishes adorned with seasonal vegetables. Dinner for two with a bottle of wine: $85, plus tip. Just down the street, in the Conservatory shopping mall, is Tejas (800 Nicollet Mall, 612-375-1132), a friendly, chic and breezy purveyor of neo-Mex, the lighter, more artful version of Tex-Mex. Dinner for two: about $65 with wine, plus tip.
The Loring Park Cafe (1624 Harmon Place, 612-332-1617), positioned conveniently between downtown Minneapolis and the Walker Art Center, is a crowded, sophisticated bistro. Dinner for two: $60 with wine, plus tip. After eating, take one of the greatest strolls in urban America: a walk to the Walker Art Center's Sculpture Garden across the beautiful blue and yellow bridge spanning Interstate 94.
Gelpe's Old World Bakery (2447 South Hennepin Avenue, 612-377-1870) sits amid the fun and funky shops that line a dozen or so blocks of Hennepin Avenue from Franklin Avenue south to Lake Street. The bakery makes Old World breads and a cosmopolitan array of cookies and sweets, from Viennese crescents to Ethiopian truffles and Java sticks.
On the culinary homefront, the Mississippi mud pie cupcake is a surpassing tribute to that local landmark.
A few pockets of 1960's counterculture can still be found in Minneapolis, the city that put Bob Dylan on the map. An inexpensive place to sit down to one of those cornucopian egg-potato-cheese-sprouts-avocado breakfasts of yore amid vintage 60's patrons is the Seward Community Cafe (2129 East Franklin Avenue, 612-332-1011). Try the earth breakfast ($3.20 to $7.70).
In St. Paul, not far from the baronial mansions on Summit Avenue, Cafe Latte (850 Grand Avenue, 612-224-5687) is a cafeteria-style eatery and bakery that serves fresh pasta salads, soups, sandwiches and some of the best desserts in the Twin Cities, including a chocolate-Kahlua cheesecake. Lunch for two: $14.
 
Shopping
In St. Paul, Grand Avenue between South Snelling Avenue and North Dale Street is lined with shops from the mainstream to the oddball in storefronts and old Victorian houses. Treadle Yard Goods (1338 Grand Avenue, 612-698-9690) carries an exceptional selection of natural fibers, including many hand-washed silks and pima cottons. Bijoux Bead (715 Grand Avenue, 612-221-9103) sells glass, metal, wood, plastic and ceramic beads, plus the paraphernalia for stringing the baubles into jewelry.
The West Bank is Bob Dylan territory. This mercantile zone lies along Cedar Avenue within sight of the Metrodome and the University of Minnesota campus, which has spilled over from the east bank of the Mississippi River. The West Bank's covey of shops and cafes is definitely more laid back than Nicollet Mall. Midwest Mountaineering (309 Cedar Avenue South, 612-339-3433) is a wilderness outfitter par excellence. Across the street, Tatters and Platters (316 Cedar Avenue South, 612-332-0071) is renowned for its hip recycled clothes and records.

One out of every four passenger cars produced domestically is manufactured by a ''transplant,'' a foreign, generally Japanese factory sited in the United States. In the 10-day period ending May 20, 1990, vehicle sales of the Big Three - General Motors, Ford and Chrysler - fell by about 900 a day compared with the same period last year, while transplant sales rose by about 2,000 a day. Lee Iacocca wails: ''The transplants are murdering all of us.'' The British journal The Economist has suggested that Detroit's Big Three are as good as dead right now, and that the sooner they give up the ghost the better. 
Ironically, the transplants are here as a result of Detroit's desire to check Japanese competition. Fearful that quotas would shut them out of the American market, Japanese auto makers decided that if they could not export their product they would export their production.
In doing so, they were - once more - aping the United States. When Europe and Japan began to protect their postwar ''infant industries,'' American corporations hurdled the barriers by setting up transplants over there. Now the Japanese (and Europeans, too) are doing unto us as we did unto them.
That the Japanese are here, then, should come as no surprise. What is surprising is that they have been able to outplay the Big Three on the latter's home turf and that the Americans are falling ever further behind.
Two books - ''Working for the Japanese'' by a husband-wife team, Joseph J. Fucini and Suzy Fucini, on a Mazda transplant, and ''Jump Start'' by a Philadelphia journalist, David Gelsanliter, on Toyota, Nissan and Honda transplants - try to tell why the invaders seem about to dethrone the once impregnable Detroit dynasties. Neither book spends much time on design or quality, traits commonly perceived to be the Japanese forte. Instead, the authors concentrate on culture, the distinctive Japanese culture that makes it possible for a Mazda plant, for instance, to turn out as many cars as an American plant and to do so with a work force that is 15 to 20 percent smaller than those of its American rivals. Mr. Gelsanliter applauds such performances, and sees this as the wave of the future in auto production. The Fucinis abhor the process as inhumanly oppressive, and darkly hint at mini-revolts in the making. But both relate management methods to the culture of Japan.
Culturally, Japan is an extended family, ethnically homogeneous (a biogenetic entity), while the United States might be called an ''intended'' family, demographically heterogeneous (a geopolitical comity). The former is collectivist and hierarchical; the latter is individualist and egalitarian. Although neither is purely either, each is sufficiently different from the other to spawn its own managerial methodology.
In the factories, the contrary cultures express themselves as ''JIT'' and what I would call ''JIC'' - for the Japanese ''just in time'' and for the Americans ''just in case.'' Under JIT, there is no room for error and, the Fucinis would add, no time to breathe. Under JIC, allowance is made for human error and humane needs. When an American worker, undergoing training for JIT, asks about sick days, the answer is, ''You're not supposed to get sick here.'' And if he or she does, according to the Fucini account, the stricken one is treated like a healthy worker.
The average workweek in the Mazda plant is 60 hours; when workers enter the plant in the morning they do not know when they will be leaving in the evening. Should a worker come up with a time-saving device, as encouraged to do, an additional chore is given the eager beaver to fill the unused minutes. These and similar practices are characterized by Mr. Gelsanliter as Japan's attempt to reintroduce the Protestant work ethic to the United States. The Fucinis see it as a return to the days of production-line tyranny, where the worker is a Chaplinesque cog in a soulless machine.
Though none of the authors say so, the Japanese regimen is surely rooted in Japan's overcrowded society: 123 million people (half the population of the United States) crammed into an ungenerous land area the size of Montana. There is no room for error or internal bickering. If a leader makes an error, he commits the modern equivalent of hara-kiri by retiring in disgrace. Eleven-year-olds have been known to commit suicide for failing to earn the expected grade. By the same token, a Japanese worker in an auto plant, guaranteed lifetime employment, owes his or her life to the company and is expected, like an American athlete or ballerina, to go on with the show no matter the pain or the price.
In this spirit of so-called community, Japanese management preaches consensus, a word that means different, almost opposite, things to Americans and Japanese. Here, it means an agreement reached among peers, even if the boss is recognized as primus inter pares. In Japan, language and custom preclude any such egalitarianism. Every pronoun carries an explicit declaration of where the speaker stands on the social scale in relation to the person who is being addressed; every greeting is confirmed with bows whose depths indicate the rank of the parties. In the Japanese family called the company, the boss is Papa.
Although both books are in-depth examinations of Japanese transplants in the United States, they are not looking at the same phenomenon. Mr. Gelsanliter describes three transplants that were set up in carefully selected areas where, in the opinion of the Japanese companies, the culture was most compatible with that of Japan. They chose regions of high unemployment in Tennessee, Kentucky and southern Ohio, where they could find a heavy proportion of youngsters of Germanic stock who, after repeated and penetrating interviews, revealed an antiunion bias. When the United Automobile Workers union tried to organize Nissan's plant in Smyrna, Tenn., a year ago it was trounced.
The Fucinis, who have written two previous books, ''Experience, Inc.'' and ''Entrepreneurs,'' zero in on the Mazda plant in Michigan, a highly union-minded state. Mazda was organized top-down: Mazda allowed the union to organize the plant under pressure from Ford, which had agreed to distribute the Mazda-produced Probe models, and was under contract with the U.A.W. The kind of workers at Mazda were, of course, quite different from those in what Mr. Gelsanliter calls ''the heartland.'' In a later plant election, they opted for a different union leadership, one that was part of the more militant New Directions movement in the U.A.W.
Taken together, the two books pose an ancient question: Can a dominant or ''conquering'' nation impose its culture on those it dominates? Mr. Gelsanliter suggests yes, if the Japanese relocate outside Detroit. The Fucinis suggest no, although, they suggest, through the confrontation of attitudes there may emerge a third culture.
Both may be right: Mr. Gelsanliter in the short run and the Fucinis in the long run. Because of the contrapuntal dissonance between these books, the wealth of information and insights contained in each is more than doubled when the two are read in tandem.
 
WHERE'S YOUR BASEBALL CAP?
Japanese and Americans had very different ideas about the degree of loyalty and obedience a company should expect from its employees. . . . Mazda issued its American employees company baseball caps, with the understanding that the caps were a voluntary accessory to the mandatory blue-pants-khaki-shirt Mazda uniform. Taking the term voluntary to mean that they had a choice whether or not to wear the caps, many Americans elected to come to work bareheaded. This upset the Japanese, who regarded not wearing caps as a sign of disrespect toward the company. When the Japanese pressed the issue, the Americans countered that cap wearing was voluntary. True, the Japanese acknowledged, but if you really cared about the company you should want to wear your caps. The Americans, who could accept being told what they had to do by an employer, took offense at being told what they should ''want'' to do. As far as they were concerned, Mazda had overstepped its boundaries by trying to force them to do something that was supposed to be voluntary. Mandatory-voluntary was the term they began to use to describe the company's cap directives.

BITTER HARVEST
Gordon Kahl and the Posse Comitatus: Murder in the Heartland.
By James Corcoran.
Illustrated. 274 pp. New York:
Viking. $18.95.
Of the tens of thousands of farmers, ranchers, small business people and rural laborers radicalized by the maelstrom of economic disaster in the 1980's, Gordon Kahl was simply one of a distressingly high number who went for their guns. Unlike most of those people, Kahl went on to kill. The most disturbing aspect of Kahl's one-man war on the United States Government is that he wasn't alone. 
But the death of the 63-year-old tax protester shed light on a rural subculture of extremism, growing like weeds in an already stunted garden. As a result, both the man's background and legacy following his violent explosion in 1983 make it imprudent to regard Gordon Kahl as a lone radical.
In ''Bitter Harvest,'' James Corcoran, a journalism teacher at Simmons College in Boston, provides mainstream America with the first honest appraisal of this heartland patriot-turned-terrorist and the cancer of the human spirit spread by the shadowy Posse Comitatus. Mr. Corcoran's novelistic narrative should frighten readers not because it shows what made Gordon Kahl different, but rather what made him so common.
In society's search for traits that set radicals apart, it overlooks the fact that such people are born and nurtured in our own neighborhoods, at our own dinner tables, often with the best intentions. They come not from aberrant gene pools or abused childhoods. They evolve ever so casually, one step at a time, from a growing sense of disenfranchisement and, ultimately, fear. Those who organize such extremists are often called hate groups. More aptly, they are fear groups.
Gordon Kahl became a man absolutely possessed by fear. A simple farmer and hard-working mechanic, he spent nearly all his life near his father's farm in central North Dakota, except for the meritorious duty he performed as a turret gunner during World War II.
But Kahl was on another journey, one he began during the cold war as an ardent anti-Communist. Fear of Communism fueled his trip through mainstream conservatism (represented by the Mormon Church and the John Birch Society) to a hard right turn onto the slippery slope of extremist religion and politics.
Kahl's last stop was a religion called Christian Identity and a political philosophy embodied in the Posse Comitatus. Christian Identity is an outgrowth of the anti-Semitic 19th-century religious cult called British Israelism, in which northern European Christians were ''identified'' as the literal descendants of the lost tribes of the kingdom of Israel. They were, they claimed, the true people of the covenant.
The Posse Comitatus combined their sense of being chosen with a virulent distrust of the Federal Government, income taxes and any abandonment of self-reliance beyond a dependence on the county sheriff. Its members, including many farmers, stockpiled sophisticated weapons and trained to use them against the Jewish-Masonic ''Synagogue of Satan.''
It was their belief that an enemy cabal actually controlled this chaotic, uncontrollable phenomenon called American society. Mr. Corcoran shows how even one of the ''good'' characters, the woman who fingers Kahl's last hideout, nearly backs out when she discovers to her horror that her F.B.I. contact is wearing a Masonic ring - proof, to her, of the international plot against white Christians.
Gordon Kahl finally was possessed by the most primal fear, that of losing his own life. He believed that the Government would kill him in prison if he surrendered to the ''New Sanhedrin.''
With the fanaticism of a true believer, Kahl was unbending. He stopped paying income taxes. He served a year at Fort Leavenworth and ostracized his wife when she paid off a tax lien behind his back. He refused to mail his probation reports after his release. And finally, he shot and killed two United States marshals who tried to serve him with a misdemeanor warrant for his probation violation.
Extremists like Gordon Kahl are not hooligans who simply latch onto a convenient ideology to justify their actions. They really do believe their lives are threatened, and are compelled to act out of those fears.
Mr. Corcoran analyzes the agrarian anarchy that gripped the Midwest in the last decade. His dispassionately reasoned presentation is nevertheless laced with the powerful emotions of those pulled into the whirlpool of failure. The author, whose roots are in North Dakota, refines the statistics, studies and excuses into portraits with personal impact.
The author shows the Federal Government in relentless pursuit of a tax resister who rarely made $10,000 a year - and only after he appeared on a television talk show to advocate tax resistance. As a result the radical right gained a martyr who has helped inspire others to violence. In 1984, Arthur Kirk, a Nebraska farmer whose land was in foreclosure, charged at a state patrol SWAT team with an assault rifle after threatening to shoot a warrant bearer; he was killed. That same year Robert Matthews formed a terrorist underground and carried out the assassination of the Jewish radio personality Alan Berg in Denver, before he too was killed.
There is a distressing lack of popular literature on radicalism of the right. The circumstances surrounding the principal event in ''Bitter Harvest'' show precisely the lack of understanding - on the part of both authorities and the public - of the causes, the effect and the dangerous potential of the farm crisis. For every Gordon Kahl, Arthur Kirk and Robert Matthews who picks up a gun, there are hundreds of other disenfranchised people in this loosely bound movement who probably never will. It should not fill us with relief, however, simply to stop frustrated people short of violence. Fighting an army of a thousand men is easier than fighting a thousand one-man wars.

HEADLINE: And Now, Doctorates in Development

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Sarit Rozycki is one of a handful of young New York City developers who have been bidding up prices for prime midtown Manhattan real estate parcels recently. In her case the goal is to put up a 50-story office tower with retail space that she expects to become the first American home of Harrod's, London's swank department store.
Ms. Rozycki is not concerned that commercial development is soft in Manhattan, or that department stores have been struggling.
''That's all right,'' she said. ''They're going to do great. We're optimists.'' 
And why not? Her giant project lives only in a thick project book she is preparing as a final project for her master's degree in real estate development at New York University. Hence the flurry of similar big paper land purchases in the city, at the midblock of 47th Street between Fifth and Madison Avenues, where Tom Glasgow is building a 300,000-square-foot mixed-use tower, and on the east side of Union Square, right on top of the Amalgamated Bank building, where Gil Shalit wants to put a 25-story apartment house.
These young graduate students are part of a growing phenomenon in the country's evolving real estate business - the graduate student of real estate development. What used to be something young master-builders learned on the job from the Zeckendorfs or the Tishmans - a profession, in other words, that was half on-the-job training and half whom you know - now involves master's and even Ph.D. programs from New York to Berkeley, Calif., from the University of Wisconsin to Texas A. & M. Columbia University has two graduate real estate programs, in fact, one in its architecture school and the other in its business school.
Enrollments in these one- and two-year masters' degree programs have remained strong - 30 to 50 students, depending on the school - despite the downturn in development activity in many parts of the country. Or perhaps enrollments have held steady because of the downturn: with development jobs scarcer, students give up less income to drop out of the work force and put themselves back in school for a while.
''This is a good time to be out of the real estate business,'' said Lawrence S. Bacow, head of the M.I.T. Center for Real Estate Development.
These are not the ''How to Sell Real Estate'' courses that community colleges teach aspiring brokers and sales associates. The new graduate programs, most of them having assumed their current form in the last 5 to 10 years, seek to combine the disparate elements of real estate development, from design to real estate law, appraisal to site selection, that have traditionally been scattered among a number of different and often competing graduate programs.
''About 1982, we started thinking about this big sector of the economy that had been largely ignored by the academy, and it was called real estate,'' said Dr. Bacow.
''We recognized that M.I.T. was teaching people to deal with the separate properties of real estate, we were training architects to become the clients of developers, civil engineers to be construction managers, the planning department was training planners - we were working all around the edges but nobody was focusing directly on the center.'' At the same time, other graduate real estate professors noted, the real estate industry was passing from the private men's club it had so long been known as, and was becoming institutionalized in the widening ring of businesses that specialize in aspects of the trade.
Banks, pensions and insurance funds are adding real estate specialists to their stables of accountants and lawyers; real estate financing syndications now routinely cross borders, so that a failed shopping center in Austin, Tex., is probably crimping some investor's dividends in Basel, Switzerland.
Graduates of the real estate programs are therefore being hired by concerns that 10 or 20 years ago had little to do with the nuts and bolts of real estate development - pension funds, investment banks, insurers. Manufacturers and other corporations whose principal business may have nothing to do with real estate have in the past found that they were failing to take full advantage of assets they had accumulated in land and buildings.
Now there is a National Association of Corporate Real Estate Executives to testify to the number of men and women who have been hired just to handle those assets.
''The real estate business has become highly institutionalized,'' said Robert Zerbst, a Ph.D. graduate of Ohio State University's Center for Real Estate Education and Research, who has turned theory to profit as owner of Piedmont Realty Advisors, a San Francisco consulting firm.
M.I.T., among other schools, has made a minor specialty in its program of training future public officials to manage the public end of joint ventures between municipalities and private developers. Other schools emphasize the analytical over the speculative, the public benefit over private gain.
''A far smaller percentage of the real estate in the U.S. is now owned by single individuals than it was before, while a much higher percentage is owned by institutions,'' Mr. Zerbst said. ''And by the Federal Government, for better or worse.''
But underlying the new real estate curriculums run the old themes and dreams of real estate development as one way for a young person to make a lot of money in a hurry.
''Uh, Donald Trump,'' said Dan Brenna of the N.Y.U. program when asked his name.
But seriously: ''I know I don't want to work for someone else all my life, to be a wheel in a machine,'' said Mr. Brenna, a recent Rensellaer Polytechnic Institute engineering graduate. ''This way, I think I can get a job with a developer and after a while, start working for myself.'' ''Absolutely,'' Miss Rozycki agreed. Like many graduate real estate schools, N.Y.U. requires its master's students to have some experience in the world before they enroll, and of a group of students recently interviewed only Mr. Brenna had come straight from college, although he believes his engineering degree amounts to some pre-enrollment experience in a key aspect of real estate development.
For her part, Miss Rozycki is in fact a developer, having been in a partnership that renovates apartment buildings in Manhattan.
''But I want to go on to the next level,'' she said, ''and this program is going to make me more knowledgeable and more confident when I go to put together deals. I mean, one of the things we're working on is specifically, how to go to a bank and get the loan.''
That course, like all the others at N.Y.U. and at most real estate programs, is taught by adjunct professors with full-time construction, development, law and finance jobs.
Dr. Robert Bjorklund, an associate professor of real estate and director of academic affairs for the Master of Science in Real Estate program at N.Y.U.'s Real Estate Institute, has a brokerage and development partnership in New Jersey; he believes that teachers with real experience are far more valuable to young real estate tyros than the textbook approach to business analysis favored by traditional business schools.
''Anybody can crunch numbers and come up with an internal rate of return, but the M.B.A.'s never get to learn real market analysis, site selection and that kind of thing,'' he said. ''The course work was always, 'Let's assume 5 percent increase in rents and 3 percent increase in maintenance expenses . . . ' and it was all garbage in, garbage out. What investors and developers are really trying to figure out is, what are future costs going to be, and if you misforecast the numbers you have a very small chance of getting it right.''
The emphasis on upper level real estate development at first confuses some students, who come expecting to learn how to be better residential brokers.
''One of the problems with brokerages is that it's basically selling, and a great salesman doesn't need to come to my school to learn how to sell,'' said Norman Weinberg, associate dean of the School of Continuing Education and director of the Real Estate Institute at N.Y.U.
In other words, he said, the degree-granting real estate graduate schools are not going to add to the luster of the ordinary real estate brokers who have long wished that their business would be given the same professional respect and distinction as law and medicine.
Dean Weinberg noted that real estate education grew out of the land-use programs at western colleges - future developers still study high-rise projects next to agriculture students at Texas A. & M. - while in the East, the subject was considered a trade school subject at best. The change came when corporations began seeking graduates with real estate specialties, several program directors noted.
''If you're a corporation and you can choose between a person with a degree and someone without, you take the more highly qualified person,'' said Kenneth Rosen, chairman of the Center for Real Estate and Urban Economics at the Haas School of Business at the University of California, Berkeley. ''So education in real estate is probably just at the beginning of its professionalization. It started in the last 5 or 10 years, as real estate became integrated into the overall capital markets, which meant that people in the stocks and bond business suddenly need to know about the real estate field.''
Dr. Rosen has no time for young real estate buccaneers on their way to retirement at 35. The emphasis at his school is on the analytical, not the speculative.
''If you're thinking of money, you had better go to Harvard or Wharton,'' he said, referring to the business school at the University of Pennsylvania. ''We don't train people to be C.E.O.'s, we train them to work with organizations.''
The pitfalls of real estate speculation are part of the course curriculum at Texas A. & M., said John Rodiek, a professor in the university's master's program in land development. The course is appropriate, he said, because the wreckage of the state's deflated real estate boom is all around.
''Speculation got this state's people in a lot of trouble,'' he said, ''so we are trying t0 teach our students the backgrounds to decision-making that are central to real estate management.''
As a project, some of the school's 50 degree candidates have begun preparing a thorough assessment of a 78-acre parcel of undeveloped land in San Antonio. The land is owned by the USAA Real Estate Company, a subsidiary of a big military life insurance company, which bought the land as speculation several years ago and is now casting around for something to do with it, Professor Rodiek said.
The students are swarming over the area, he said, studying vegetation, groundwater, city planning, local transportation and housing needs.
''The social values are important in a course like this,'' Professor Rodiek said. ''We want want to build housing on it, but we can't just address ourselves to what the yuppies will want. The Spanish population will increase sharply to 40, 45 percent in the next 15 to 30 years, and someone had better understand what that will mean for local housing.''
Still, he said, some of the students will want to hook their dreams to the next real estate boom to hit the Lone Star State.
''I think that some of them will want to have the same success that Donald Trump had,'' he said, ''but I think a lot of them have come to have a better understanding of what that means. Each student knows that they must take a much more realistic attitude about what it is going to take to be successful.''

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: X-Rated Tenants;
The Sun Is Setting on the Times Square Porn Palaces

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Twilight seems to be near for the gaudy, raunchy, blazingly public pornographic emporiums in and around Times Square, many of which - by a curious circumstance - are now tenants of the New York State Urban Development Corporation.
Although there is still a large core of hard-core businesses on Eighth Avenue, their counterparts on Broadway and Seventh Avenue appear close to extinction. The Pussycat Cinema and Melody Burlesk, at Broadway and 49th Street, disappeared in 1986 to make way for the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza. By year's end, the Big Apple Theater, at Broadway and 43d Street, and the Circus Cinema and World Theater, at 49th Street, are all likely to be out of business.
And they may not reappear anywhere else, at least not in the form of large-scale theaters and sex supermarkets. 
''As they leave Times Square, they're really not going anywhere - they're just drying up,'' said Albert Bialek, of Albert Bialek Associates, a broker, real estate consultant and property manager. ''I don't see them spreading through the city at all. I think they're going out of business. I think they're losing their market. There's no clientele for that type of stuff today.''
William H. Daly, who has directed the city's Office of Midtown Enforcement since 1984, put it rhetorically: ''Would you, as a consumer, prefer to come to Times Square and watch a porno movie and worry about your safety, or would you rather rent one and watch in the comfort and security of your own home? That's had a lot to do with the decline of sex businesses.''
''As the city has closed the number of illegal sex-related businesses and as others have gone because of development or cable TV or home videocassettes,'' Mr. Daly said, ''we have not seen in another part of the city a concomitant rise or a displacement effect.''
Today, of the two dozen or so obvious sex-related businesses that remain in the Times Square area, about half are tenants of the state's development agency, which took the properties by condemnation in April to prepare for the redevelopment of 42d Street.
What makes the situation noteworthy is that these are exactly the kinds of businesses whose image was conjured by officials in the 1980's as they sought to build a consensus for the redevelopment effort.
''The project is expected to substantially eliminate the dangerous and threatening street conditions and the sex-related uses that now pervade the area,'' said the draft environmental impact statement in 1984.
One of the largest state tenants is the Big Apple, whose marquee recently advertised this quadruple bill: ''Sex Girls,'' ''Magic Shower,'' ''Virgin Heat'' and ''Love Shack.'' Another is Peepland, 228 West 42d Street, whose facade is distinguished by a two-story keyhole framing a giant neon eye. Among its many offerings, to gauge from the signs in the window, are ''Live Nude Girls.''
The state has at least nine other tenants that it describes as ''blight-related'': Adult Video World Bookstore, Blackjack Book Store, Forsythe Book Store, Le Sex Shoppe, Peep Show, Playland, Roxy Three Theater, X-Rated Video and XXX Video Store.
No one at the Urban Development Corporation knows how much rent these tenants owe because many of them are simply refusing to pay, according to Lawrence Josephs, director of public affairs for the agency. Eventually, he said, when the state figures out how much rent is due, that amount would be deducted from any condemnation awards.
The state has no plans to evict any of these tenants or otherwise move against them until the time comes for site preparation and demolition. The first phase, to clear the way for two of the four office skyscrapers planned by the developer George Klein and the Prudential Insurance Company, will close the Big Apple by Oct. 31. Other tenants, particularly in the mid-block properties along 42d Street, might remain until early 1991.
''This project has always made a big point that it is not antismut,'' Mr. Josephs said. ''That has to do with First Amendment considerations.''
''Yes, we have these sex uses,'' he said, ''but we don't consider them - from an operational point of view - to be separate. We consider all 11 tenants to be blighting uses but we don't really have a mechanism for treating anybody differently than anybody else.''
''They contribute to an overall feeling of lawlessness,'' Mr. Josephs said, ''to the feeling that maybe the rules don't apply in this area and that you can get away with whatever you want. But these particular establishments are not where crimes are occurring on a regular and ongoing basis.''
His assertion was borne out by Mr. Daly. ''We've never really seen any direct correlation between these businesses and crime,'' he said. ''The only aspect where the sex business created criminal conditions was about 10 years ago when you had street-level massage parlors along Eighth Avenue.''
Mr. Daly said the city was not out to close sex-related businesses except when they are clearly fronts for prostitution or drug dealing. Some arrests were made at Peepland in the past, he said, because the glass partitions had been removed in the viewing booths, allowing patrons to touch the women who were performing. But he said that the courts determined this did not amount to prostitution and had dismissed the cases.
The other remaining theaters on Broadway, the Circus Cinema (''The Best Porn in New York - A Triumph of Erotica'') and World Theater (''100% Porn Spectacular!''), which share a three-story structure at the corner of 49th Street, are to be gone by the end of the year.
They will be replaced by a 27-story, 324-room Hampton Inn hotel, developed by affiliates of the Spire Realty and Development Corporation of Melville, L.I., and McCann Project Management Services Corporation of Manhattan.
To keep land costs down, and thus preserve a $90-a-night room rate, the parcel is being leased for 99 years, rather than bought outright, said Edward Lapidus, president of Spira. The owner is Arthur Morowitz.
As for the changing use at that site, Mr. Lapidus said, ''As you stand on the corner of 49th, Seventh and Broadway, it's like watching the actual metamorphosis of the caterpillar into the butterfly.''
As recently as 1984, the draft environmental impact statement for the 42d Street project predicted that upper Times Square ''will be the preferred relocation area for the sex businesses,'' which ''could have a significant adverse impact.'' However, by the time the state finally took title to its land, the area to the north had already been redeveloped with office towers and hotels.
Instead of moving northward, the business has dispersed. ''Over the past six or eight months,'' Mr. Daly said, ''what has developed is a rash of openings of videocassette outlets where they sell primarily tapes for home use.'' Last year, stores opened on the Avenue of the Americas, in Chelsea and Greenwich Village, and along Canal Street. Vociferous protesters included a group called No Times Square in Greenwich Village.
Since then, one store in the Village has closed. Judith Joice, president of the Greenwich Village Chamber of Commerce, said that the facade of a store at the Avenue of the Americas and Fourth Street had become ''somewhat more palatable,'' because ''instead of six-foot neon X's, they have a mural done by local artists which is very neutral.''
''I do believe we had some effect by having protests and getting petitions signed,'' she said. ''I'm not against pornography. It was the nature of the stores themselves. They were definitely 42d Street. It not only devalued property but made the neighborhood unsuitable for children to grow up in. I do think we stopped it by acting loudly and quickly. I'm not going to have my tongue cut out by the First Amendment that protects everyone except me.''

Ebb Tide In Market For Slips

BYLINE: By ANDREE BROOKS

 BODY:
Dockominium sales lie dead in the water. Echoing the direction of the real estate market in general, demand has all but dried up for these slips, some of which had been selling as high as $2,000 a linear foot in the New York area only 18 months ago.
The Northeast - in particular the New Jersey shore - seems hardest hit, with slips of 35 feet and less suffering more than larger ones and marginal locations faring far worse than prime ones, according to professionals in the marina industry. Only the emerging markets of the Great Lakes and the inland waterways of the South, like those along the Tennessee River, appear to be holding their own, they report. 
A conceptual cousin to a residential condominium, a dockominium is a boat slip in a marina in which slips are individually purchased rather than rented from the marina operator. Ownership may take three forms - a deed, shares or a long-term lease. Monthly maintenance fees are charged to cover ongoing costs with day-to-day operations placed in the hands of a professional manager.
The phenomenon first emerged on the West Coast in the late 70's. It reached the East Coast in the early 80's in time to ride the crest of a boating boom that left aspiring yachtsmen frantic that they would no longer be able to afford to dock that boat if they failed to purchase rather than rent a slip.
Rental rates were rising by about 25 percent a year and waiting lists growing ever longer. Not surprisingly, early buyers doubled their money within three seasons while investors eagerly came aboard because even greater appreciation seemed as predictable as the next high tide.
But Donald Trump has not been the only one forced to cut back on sailing. A weakening economy plus rising costs has lowered the boom on a great many other people too. ''And one of the first things to go has been that boat,'' said Stephen Smith, an expert on waterfront development with Edward F. Heberger & Associates, real estate appraisers of Cheshire, Conn. The result is a cooling of the demand for slips.
The drop in demand, he said, came in tandem with the arrival of dozens of new dockominium projects. The combination has now ''blown the market apart,'' said Paul Dodson, executive vice president of the International Marina Institute, a research and educational center in Wickford, R.I.
Mr. Dodson gave as an example a 40-foot slip in Newport Harbor, R.I, that would have sold in 1988 for around $85,000, but would have barely fetched $50,000 at auction earlier this summer. Similarly, in Boston Harbor, he noted, the recent addition of 700 new slips has created a vacancy rate of 25 percent.
Artemas H. Crimmins Jr., manager and developer of Minneford Marina and Yacht Club on City Island in the Bronx, said he is selling his remaining 30 slips for around $1,500 a linear foot compared to $2,000 two years ago. And even these prices can be discounted, he said, if someone is willing to purchase a boat along with the slip. Prices are more difficult to establish on resales because ''nothing is trading,'' he confirmed.
If you own a slip, these experts say, do not try to unload it now out of a fear that the market will sink even lower. Rather, they say, it is wiser to find someone to rent the space temporarily to help cover carrying costs.
''You should hold on as long as you possibly can,'' said Mr. Smith, the appraiser.
Several underlying factors point to this strategy. Mr. Dodson noted that the market is so weak that hardly any new dockominium projects are being planned - at least in the Northeast, which is suffering the deepest dip in sales and values. Moreover, they say, lenders have grown reluctant to release construction financing for dockominiums. Thus, should the economy perk up, a shortage may quickly redevelop.
Dwight Merriam of Hartford, who is general counsel to the Connecticut Marine Trades Association, noted that the amount of shorefront that could support additional boat slips is rapidly diminishing.
With the growth in environmental awareness it will be far more difficult in the future, he predicts, to obtain the needed approvals to set aside many more.
''And you can't stack one dockominium on top of another like you can a condo,'' he said. ''It's a low-density project.'' Mr. Merriam is so sure of the inherent value of dockominiums that he is buying one for himself this summer on Long Island Sound. ''I have tremendous faith in the concept over the long run,'' he said.
But how to survive in the interim? To find a renter, Mr. Merriam recommends dropping the rent, since some income is better than none. Further, he suggested offering to rent by the month instead of for an entire season, as has been traditional.
His other suggestions include advertising a year-round rental or a winter rental if the marina has such a capability. It has become so costly and such a hassle to have a boat taken out of the water and put back again in the spring, he noted, that a year-round slip is sometimes preferred.
He also recommended offering a lease-purchase option which allows someone to put a part or all of the rental fee toward the purchase price at some future date. Mr. Crimmins is offering this deal, for example, at the Minneford Marina. Finally, as at Minneford, the boat and the slip could be structured as an all-in-one deal.
Those who do sell may find it necessary to offer help with financing. ''Everyone who is selling is taking back paper,'' said the owner of a 38-foot slip on City Island, who preferred anonymity. She said she sold her boat a month ago and is now trying to sell the slip. She will be satisfied, she said, if she gets back the $47,000 she originally invested.
If the intended buyer is a homeowner the most useful form of financing would be an equity loan. ''Quite a lot of our buyers are using them,'' said Philip Wallach, owner of the Guilford Yacht Club in Guilford, Conn. He is aggressively marketing his slips - 193 in all when constructed is completed, 80 of which have been sold - through direct mail campaigns, advertising and boat show appearances.
For the individual seeking a resale he recommends placing classified ads in area newspapers in addition to listing that slip with boat brokers, who normally charge 10 percent should they find the buyer. Those are the two places where anyone who is seriously interested will look, said Mr. Wallach.

Rental Co-op Up for Sale
 
Question: I rent a co-op apartment that the owner is about to sell. If the co-op board approves the new owner, it looks as if he will occupy the apartment. If this is the case, is there any way I can maintain our rental position past the term of the lease? . . . D. H., Manhattan
 
Answer: It would depend on the kind of lease you have. If you are a rent-regulated tenant whose lease predates the conversion of the building to a co-op, you would have the right to remain as long as you continue to qualify as a rent-regulated tenant. 
If, on the other hand, you rented after the conversion or from the owner then you probably would not be entitled to a renewal. According to David L. Smith, a lawyer who specializes in real estate matters, many leases for co-op and condominium apartments include clauses that give the owner the right to terminate the lease upon the sale of the apartment. If there is no such provision the new owner would have to honor the terms of the lease, but would probably not have to offer a new one.
 
Discontinued Intercom
 
Question: A few years ago the intercom buzzers were removed from the apartments in our building, which includes both rent-stabilized and rent-controlled apartments. In place of the old system, one outside bell was installed connected with the one elevator. There are three elevator operators, each of whom works an eight-hour shift. Sometimes these operators are not available, so visitors are kept waiting in the lobby. Do we have the right to request that the landlord put the intercom back in the apartments? . . . R. R., Kew Gardens, Queens
 
Answer: Probably. According to the rules governing rent-stabilized apartments, landlords cannot arbitrarily change building services.
It is probable that the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal would consider the removal of the intercom such a reduction.
If so, you and your fellow tenants are probably entitled to a rent reduction as compensation if the landlord does not agree to replace it.
However, Lee Hudson, the agency's spokeswoman, said the change in the system may have been done for a legitimate reason, such as improved security.
You should first try to negotiate a return of this service with your landlord. If that does not work, file a complaint with the housing agency. You would use form RA-84, which covers complaints about buildingwide services.
It would not be necessary for each tenant to file a complaint, but it must be signed by someone who wants to be eligible for a rent reduction if it is determined that one is due.
The forms are available in the rent office of each borough. The Queens office is at 92-31 Union Hall Steet, Jamaica.
 
Controlled Unit Sublets
 
Question: I am a statutory tenant in a rent-controlled apartment. I have been told that the rules have changed and that rent-controlled tenants may now sublease their apartments. Is this true? . . . R. M., Manhattan
 
Answer: No. According to Ms. Hudson, there are still no provisions pertaining to rent-controlled tenants that give them the automatic right to sublet for two years, a right that rent-stabilized tenants have.
There are exceptions, Ms. Hudson said, if the original lease permited subletting or if the landlord permitted subletting in the past, increased the rent as compensation for the sublet and then continued to collect the higher rent after the prime tenant resumed occupancy.

HEADLINE: Northeast Notebook: Providence, R.I.;
Macy's to Open At a New Mall

BYLINE: By Lisa Prevost

 BODY:
Macy's has announced it will open a store in downtown Providence, which has no major department store. It will be an anchor of Providence Place, a $300 million mall, office and hotel project to be built not far from the State House lawn.
R.H. Macy and Company decided to open in Providence because of the size of the potential market, which includes Worcester, Mass., as well as Providence, and the level of competition, said Maureen Burgess, a spokeswoman for Macy's. The Providence store is one of 10 new stores Macy's has planned for the next four years, she said. 
With 250,000 square feet on three levels, the store will be comparable in size to other Macy's stores, except for the huge flagship store in New York City. It will employ about 500 people.
The arrival of Macy's will have a ripple effect, said Lee Juskalian, a real estate broker who is a member of the design review committee of the Capital Center Commission. Providence Place is within a 67-acre downtown redevelopment district called Capital Center.
''People will say, 'If Macy's is looking at Providence, maybe we should look at Providence,' '' Mr. Juskalian said. Bonwit Teller also announced last spring that it would open a Providence Place store.
Providence Place has had something of a tumultuous history, as partners in the project have come and gone. The current joint venture partnership was formed by Conroy Development Company of White Plains and the Pyramid Companies of Boston. Pyramid is co-owner of the Emerald Square mall in North Attleboro, Mass., about 15 minutes outside of Providence. The developers have hired John Sasso, a business consultant and former aide to Gov. Michael S. Dukakis of Massachusetts, to get permits and approvals.
The architect for the project is Adrian Smith, a partner in the Chicago office of Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, who designed Boston's Rowes Wharf.
The 1.4 million-square-foot project will sit on a state-owned 14-acre site immediately off Interstate 95; a continuing education division of the University of Rhode Island will have to relocate to accommodate the project. In addition to the 900,000-square-foot retail mall, the project is expected to include a 275,000-square-foot office building and a 325-room luxury hotel. An enclosed parking garage will hold 5,500 cars.
Though the Rhode Island economy is in the grip of a regional downturn, Ms. Burgess said, Macy's is undaunted. ''That doesn't mean you stand still,'' she said. ''It means that you plan a little bit more conservatively.''

HEADLINE: Agencies and Colleges Showing Effects Of Budget Cuts

BYLINE: By Jay Romano

 BODY:
IN the state's public colleges, tuition will be higher. At Division of Motor Vehicles offices, lines will be longer. And on state highways, potholes will deepen before they are filled, more litter will accumulate before it is removed, and more time will pass before the deer accidentally killed by a truck or a car disappears from the side of the road.
These are a sampling of what state and local officials say will result from the budget cuts that accompanied Gov. Jim Florio's sales and income tax increase.
Officials of state agencies and administrators of public colleges and professional schools say the budget cuts will cause layoffs, tuition increases, deferred maintenance of buildings and equipment and curtailment or elimination of some services. 
Administration officials, who have termed the budget ''austere,'' say the reductions are necessary to minimize the tax increase needed to close the budget gap left over from the Kean administration. Though the effects may be harsh, they say, the long-term results will be a permanently balanced budget and a stronger state economy.
 
Critics' Opinions Vary
Critics have widely varying opinions. School officials and administrators of state agencies say that the budget reductions were large and that their effect will be both far reaching and long lasting. But some Republican legislators say that even more could have been trimmed from the $12.4 billion budget to avert the record tax increase.
Still other critics say that some of the cuts only shift financial responsibility from the state to the counties and municipalities and that in the long run taxpayers will pay more for some services than they do now.
The controversy, which has intensified as a result of a strong grass-roots antitax campaign, has become the focus of national attention as Democratic and Republican leaders wait to see whether Mr. Florio can weather the political storm that has resulted from his tax increase. Mr. Florio said last week that he would address residents on television on Wednesday at 8 P.M. to explain the effects and expected benefits of his tax program.
 
'All Across the Board'
''We are going to have a reduction in service all across the board,'' said H. Arthur Smith 3d, spokesman for the State Division of Motor Vehicles. The division's budget, he said, was cut by about $10 million, more than half of which was being used for overtime pay to maintain expanded hours at motor vehicle offices.
As a result, he said, the division has had to discontinue its policy of opening on Saturdays and staying open on weekdays until the last customer is served. And that, he said, will mean longer waits at motor vehicle offices across the state.
Gene L. Farrell, shop steward for the employees at the division's Regional Service Center in Wayne, said that when the center was open on Saturday, the average waiting time during the week was 20 minutes.
''Now we have two hours' worth of customers waiting outside before we even open the doors,'' he said.
Another hard-hit agency is the State Department of Transportation, which received $36 million less this year than last year. Barbara Richardson, a department spokeswoman, said that some services would have to be cut back and that a hiring freeze would be imposed on the department's 5,489-member work force.
''But the biggest impact will be on the road materials budget,'' Ms. Richardson said. That appropriation was cut by 20 percent, she said, and the effect will be noticeable in road repair, snow removal, line striping and sign replacement.
The Department of Transportation budget includes the state's appropriation for N. J. Transit, which carries some 300,000 bus and train riders daily.
Although the $218 million appropriation is the same as last year's, growing operating costs and falling fare receipts have left the agency with a $47.8 million shortfall. As a result, some train services have been cut and 200 jobs will be eliminated through retirement, attrition and perhaps layoffs.
In addition, said Jeff Lamm, a spokesman for the agency, ''a lot of internal cuts that won't be readily apparent to the customer will be made.''
But one effect that is readily apparent is the 9 percent fare increase that went into effect with the new budget on July 1.
 
'We Really Had No Alternative'
''We really had no alternative,'' Mr. Lamm said. ''There are only three places we can turn to for funding: the Federal Government, the state government and the fare box.''
The state's higher education system will also have to charge more, experts say, because of a $107 million reduction in grants and state aid to colleges, universities and professional schools.
''For us, the cut was substantial,'' said Donald B. Edwards, vice president for public affairs and development at Rutgers University in New Brunswick. A decrease of $26 million in state aid together with unavoidable cost increases, he said, ''put us in a $35 million hole.''
As a result, Mr. Edwards said, university officials are deferring all but the most essential maintenance and repairs, have laid off several employees and have placed a job freeze on most open teaching positions. For those positions that must be filled, he said, part-time faculty members will be appointed instead of full-time assistant professors.
 
Tuition Up by $280
But even with such measures, he said, students will now pay $280 more for one year of full-time undergraduate study than the $2,576 they did last year, an increase of 10.8 percent.
''We will be able to get through this year by taking some steps that can't be repeated,'' Mr. Edwards said. ''We're trying to make sure that the folks in Trenton understand that.''
State Treasurer Douglas C. Berman said that officials in Trenton indeed understood the difficulties facing Rutgers and the other schools and agencies affected by the budget cuts.
''We had to hold the line,'' Mr. Berman said, ''and that is showing up in part as tuition increases.
''But every department took a 10 to 15 percent management cut except for Corrections and Human Services. We had to cut back on certain public health spending; we had to almost halve the state support for the arts; we've cut back on our ability to support tourism and our agriculture marketing program.''
 
Relief for Middle Class Seen
Yet along with those cuts, Mr. Berman said, the Florio administration is also creating a tax structure that will shift at least some of the rising costs of government away from the middle class.
''We are reducing the state's reliance on the property tax and increasing our reliance on a progressive income tax,'' he said. As a result, he said, there will be a shift in the tax burden from middle-income property-tax payers onto the state's most highly paid residents. But some say the shift may not turn out as expected. Teachers' union officials, for example, say the Governor's budget and school aid package will shift responsibility for some state expenditures on to property-tax payers rather than away from them.
Jerri Antunes, spokeswoman for the 130,000-member New Jersey Education Association, said that in the past, the state contributed approximately $900 million a year to the teachers' pension fund. But under Mr. Florio's school aid package, that contribution will be the responsibility of local school districts.
And though the state is reimbursing municipalities for the added responsibility by increasing state aid, education association officials say that eventually the pension costs will exceed the aid provided, placing a new burden on property-tax payers.
 
'It Will Get Worse and Worse'
''It may be one year, or three years or five years,'' Ms. Antunes said, ''but ultimately most districts will have to pay money. And from there it will get worse, and worse, and worse.''
But Mr. Berman said automatic ''inflator'' increases in the state aid to school districts would enable them to keep pace with the pension costs without increasing property taxes.
''The new school formula imposes spending discipline at the local level,'' Mr. Berman said. In the past, he said, state school aid was often based upon how much a school district spent. ''The more they spent, the more they got,'' he said. The new plan encourages local school boards to economize, he said.
And the budget reductions in other areas of state government, he said, impose that same discipline on department heads in state agencies.
''This budget is harsh,'' Mr. Berman said, ''but fiscal responsibility required some very tough choices.''
 
Budget Cuts Questioned
Some Republican lawmakers, however, say claims that the budget has been cut are inaccurate.
''This is typical, hypocritical, political nonsense,'' said State Senator Lee B. Laskin, Republican of Cherry Hill. ''When you cut through the maze of hogwash,'' he said, ''the budget is the same as last year except that we have more taxes.''
Cuts should have been deep enough to eliminate the need for a tax increase completely, he said.
''No matter who it hurts and no matter how hard it hurts,'' Mr. Laskin said, ''some cuts in services are necessary. The people in this state cannot afford to pay more taxes.''
Both critics and supporters of the budget agree that budget cuts are always difficult to make and that any reduction, large or small, has some impact.
 
Deer Recovery Program Eliminated
Many point to the elimination of the state's Deer Recovery Program as a striking example of how withdrawal of even a small amount of money can have an unexpected effect.
In past years, the State Division of Fish, Game and Wildlife assumed responsiblity for removing deer that had been accidentally killed on the roads. This year, the $145,000 previously appropriated for the program was eliminated.
''Last year the state picked up 1,320 deer on the roads in Hunterdon County,'' said John P. Glynn, the county's director of roads and bridges. ''They have advised us that they will no longer be doing that.''
As a result, Mr. Glynn said, the county obtained estimates from private contractors to remove and dispose of the deer. The estimates ranged from $50 to $75 an animal. The county, which had not anticipated such an expenditure in its current budget, chose another alternative. ''In most cases they haven't been picked up,'' Mr. Glynn said. County road crews move the dead animal off the roadway, he said, and leave it in the grass or brush on the side of the road. They then sprinkle lime on the carcass to prevent odor and to hasten decomposition.
''The Health Department has said that it's not a health hazard,'' Mr. Glynn said. ''I'd say it's more of a nuisance.''

 BODY:
THE biotechnology industry welcomed the California Supreme Court ruling last month that a man was not entitled to share in the profits from a drug developed from tissues removed from his body. But the case raised questions about the property status of tissues, genes and other biological materials, issues that are not likely to go away.
Should people be paid for organs when they are used in transplants? Should women be paid for aborted fetal tissue, which might one day be used to cure Parkinson's disease and other ailments? Should a country be paid if a plant specimen taken from its jungle produces a cancer drug?
So far, the answers have largely been no. Organs, tissues and plants have mostly been used by researchers without obligation. The 1984 National Organ Transplant Act prohibits the sale of organs, and society has recoiled in distaste at the prospect of any commerce in aborted fetal tissues. People are sometimes paid for donating blood or semen, but the payment is described as being for providing a service rather than for the material itself. 
Yet tissues and genes represent the raw materials of the biotechnology industry. As medical and genetic advances improve the capability to make use of such matter, its value continues to rise.
''We have to change the way we think about genetic information,'' said Jack R. Kloppenburg Jr., assistant professor of rural sociology at the University of Wisconsin at Madison and author of ''First the Seed: The Political Economy of Plant Biotechnology'' (Cambridge University Press, 1988). ''It is in a sense like oil or like copper.''
The California case involved John Moore, whose spleen was removed as part of treatment for his leukemia. David W. Golde, his doctor at the Medical Center of the University of California at Los Angeles, grew some cells in a culture from the spleen and found them rich in certain immune-system chemicals that were being studied for use as drugs.
U.C.L.A. patented the resulting cell line, a culture capable of reproducing indefinitely, and negotiated an agreement with Genetics Institute, a biotechnology company, to use the cells in developing a drug known as granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor. For $750, Genetics Institute, in Cambridge, Mass., provided Dr. Golde with stock that was eventually worth $3 million, according to the lawsuit. The company and Sandoz Pharmaceutical Company, which joined the venture, also gave U.C.L.A. about $440,000 in research grants.
Mr. Moore claimed that he was entitled to a share of the profits. While the court rejected the claim, it held that a patient must be fully informed of a doctor's economic interest in his tissues and that Mr. Moore can sue his doctor for failure to do so.
With regard to plants, the concept of property rights seems to be slowly gaining ground. For years, wild plants and seeds have been collected freely by researchers and crossbred with crops. A Turkish wheat variety helps give stripe-rust resistance to America's wheat crop at an estimated saving of $50 million yearly. An Ethiopian gene helps protect the barley crop from yellow dwarf disease, according to Mr. Kloppenburg, at a saving of $150 million a year.
Plant substances have also been the ingredients or inspiration for more than one-quarter of modern drugs, said Michael J. Balick, director of the Institute of Economic Botany at the New York Botanical Garden. The National Cancer Institute collects thousands of plant samples each year from Asia, Africa and Latin America in its search for new cancer drugs.
The countries from which such plants are obtained have rarely been compensated, since the specimens have been treated as the common heritage of mankind and have been exchanged without charge.
Some nations, however, are beginning to restrict access to wildlife samples or to demand compensation for their genetic resources as they do for mineral resources. Many of these nations, like Madagascar and Brazil, are in the tropics and are rich genetically but poor economically.
Some of the collectors are agreeing to provide compensation. The National Cancer Institute, for instance, is developing policies for paying royalties to countries where plant specimens have yielded valuable drugs. It has also brought scientists from those countries to the United States for visits or to collaborate.
Those advocating compensation say it is somewhat of a contradiction that companies can patent and sell the drugs, seeds and even genetically altered forms of life they make using the raw materials, and yet see no need to pay those who provide the ingredients. Why should Mr. Moore be barred from staking a claim to his cells when his doctor was free to do so?
But those opposing ownership rights argue that cells from Mr. Moore's spleen, transplantable organs, or even plant genes found in the wilds of third world countries have little value by themselves. ''Those folks who happen to live there didn't do anything to develop that material into something useful -it simply grows,'' said Richard D. Godown, president of the Industrial Biotechnology Association, a trade group in Washington.
Technology offers the means of transforming the raw material into something useful, he said, so people who apply the technology should be awarded with property rights. Paying patients for their tissues would not do any public good and could have a chilling effect on research benefiting humanity, Mr. Godown said. ''The patient gives up something that is of no earthly value to him on the chance that something valuable for society will be produced,'' he said.
Yet paying sources could, in some cases, have some public benefit. If tropical countries received compensation they might do a better job of preserving their forests, said Dr. Balick of the New York Botanical Garden. Some people also argue that if people were paid for their organs, more organs would become available for transplant, alleviating a serious continuing shortage. Henry Hansmann, a professor at Yale Law School, has proposed a futures market in which people would be given a discount on their insurance if they agreed to turn their organs over to the insurer after death. While people can't sell organs, they do have some semblance of property rights, said James F. Blumstein, a professor at Vanderbilt Law School. The Uniform Anatomical Gift Act adopted by all states already gives patients the right to determine whether they will donate organs after they die and to specify the recipient -institution or person.
Last year, 13,384 organ transplants were performed. The creation of a market to supply this demand, however, raises other difficult questions. People worry that rich patients would outbid poor ones for organs or that poor people would be sources of spare body parts for the rich. Prohibiting the sale of the body or its parts is ''one of the ways you show special respect for the body,'' said Arthur L. Caplan, a bio-ethicist at the University of Minnesota.
Some people argue that the supply can best be increased by further limiting people's control over their organs. For the common good, organ donation could be made mandatory upon death, they say, or people could no longer be allowed to specify where their organs should go. Not surprisingly, these approaches raise even more ethical questions.

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
The Hard Thing About Cutting Infant Mortality Is Educating Mothers

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
A PANEL of Bush Administration officials who investigated infant mortality recommended 18 steps to reduce infant deaths in the United States. Half the recommendations were marked ''high priority'' because they could have a ''direct and immediate effect.''
But the proposals, like the panel's draft report, have been in limbo for several months. The fate of the project is puzzling because its recommendations are relatively modest and seem well suited to an Administration that says it is eager to attack social problems but unable to finance big new programs. 
''Infant death and disability are not intractable problems,'' the report says, echoing studies by the National Academy of Sciences, in 1985, and the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, last February.
A central theme of the report, which was disclosed last week in The New York Times, is that the United States could substantially reduce infant deaths without redistributing income, eradicating poverty or spending billions of dollars. The techniques, by and large, are hardly revolutionary. But to be effective, they must be applied more widely, the White House Task Force on Infant Mortality said.
''If we just delivered routine clinical care and social services to pregnant women, we could prevent one-quarter to one-third of infant mortality,'' Dr. Ezra C. Davidson Jr., president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, said in an interview. ''We have an extremely difficult, cumbersome, complex, uninviting system of providing health care to pregnant women. Patients have trouble getting into it, and doctors have trouble dealing with it. The frustrations are unbelievable.''
The White House study group noted that the infant mortality rate was higher here than in less affluent countries like Spain and Singapore, where the per capita output of goods and services is less than half that of the United States. It cited Japan as an example of how ''a national commitment and accessible health services'' can sharply reduce infant mortality.
But in their social and economic profiles, these nations differ from the United States. In the more diverse American population, some groups do very well and others very poorly. The mortality rate among babies born to college graduates, for example, is less than half the rate among those born to high-school dropouts. For blacks and whites alike, infant mortality has declined, but the rate for blacks has consistently been about twice that for whites.
By contrast, the infant mortality rate for Hispanic Americans is about the same as the rate for whites, even though poverty is much more common among Hispanic families. In New Mexico, the infant mortality rate is lower for Hispanic people than for non-Hispanic whites.
''Mexican immigrant women benefit from the culture and values and support of an extended family,'' said Antonia Hernandez, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. ''When they're pregnant, they receive a lot of nurturing. Pregnancy is seen as a wonderful event, even if it's out of wedlock.''
Government programs can reduce infant mortality, experts say, with just such a nurturing approach, through home visits by nurses, social workers and other counselors. A study last month by the United States General Accounting Office said that home visiting could reduce infant deaths by insuring that pregnant women received prenatal care.
Virginia and South Carolina have reduced infant mortality through use of ''resource mothers,'' who pay frequent visits to the homes of pregnant teen-agers.
Rae K. Grad, executive director of the National Commission to Prevent Infant Mortality, established by Congress in 1986, said that ''one out of every three pregnant women gets insufficient prenatal care, meaning that it either begins too late or includes too few visits.''
She cites the armed forces as a model in offering ''universal access to prenatal care.'' Infant mortality among military families is lower than the national average, with no disparity between blacks and whites, she said.
Obviously, it is difficult for government programs to curtail behavior like smoking, drinking and drug abuse, which increase the risk of low birthweight and infant mortality. Drug addicts are unlikely to seek help or to follow medical advice. Dr. Anthony Robbins, a former president of the American Public Health Association, said, ''You have to create a demand for services, for prenatal care, through education and marketing.''
The study group, headed by Dr. James O. Mason, Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services, said many women could be reached by volunteers or health care workers paid modest salaries. It also recommended that more high schools offer instruction in ''pregnancy and parenting.''
Diane V. Downing, executive assistant to the New York City Health Commissioner, Dr. Woodrow A. Myers Jr., said, ''Many women don't realize they need to get prenatal care early in pregnancy.''
Sara Rosenbaum, program director of the Children's Defense Fund, said: ''The great majority of poor women understand the need for prenatal care and actively seek it out, but often have to wait weeks or months to get a doctor's appointment. In some cities, a pregnant woman has to be heroic just to get an appointment at a public clinic.''
Budget cutbacks and the closing of municipal hospitals in some large cities have raised additional barriers to low-income women.
In New York City, Ms. Downing said, poor women may have to wait six weeks to obtain an appointment. In the suburbs of Washington, the wait is often six to 10 weeks. In 16 of Oklahoma's 77 counties, mainly in rural areas, there is no doctor to deliver babies. Nationally, there is a shortage of doctors practicing obstetrics. Several thousand say they have quit because of the cost of malpractice insurance. Some decline to take Medicaid patients, because they find the reimbursement too low or the paperwork and bureaucracy too burdensome.
In its report, drafted in response to a White House request for policy options, the task force recommended ''a nationwide public information campaign'' to combat infant mortality. But the Administration has no intention of disseminating its own findings. The Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services have withheld most of the document from Congress, saying they must ''preserve the confidentiality of the deliberative process'' in the executive branch of Government.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Cambodians Face Loss of Eastern Aid And Trade

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

DATELINE: PHNOM PENH, Cambodia

 BODY:
SOVIET retrenchment and the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe, hailed in the West as the opening to a harmonious new post-cold-war world, promises yet another disaster for the people of Cambodia, who have already had their share of ravaging at the hands of external forces.
The Government of Prime Minister Hun Sen, installed in 1979 after Vietnam invaded and ended the Khmer Rouge's brutal rule, has depended on aid from what was once a solid, Soviet-led bloc to finance its reconstruction of Cambodia and its intensifying war for survival against Khmer Rouge guerrillas. Cambodia is isolated by the West and still subject to an American-led embargo on investment and trade.
Even today, with socialist ideological solidarity in tatters, aid from the countries of Comecon, the Eastern-bloc trading association, represents an estimated 80 percent of Cambodia's annual budget. 
That is about to change dramatically, even as the Khmer Rouge presses its war of destabilization in the countryside and as Cambodians die in greater numbers. Comecon's five-year plan for aid, trade and investment expires at the end of this year. On Jan. 1, the fantastic world of soft credits, weird barters and transferable rubles will come to an end, and Eastern Europe's trade relationships will be based on market prices and hard currencies.
The Soviet Union and the Eastern European countries want relationships with all countries built on ''mutually beneficial grounds,'' Eastern European diplomats here keep saying. ''Translated,'' one said, ''that means dollar for dollar.''
Can one form such a relationship with Cambodia? ''Ah,'' the diplomat said. ''Of course you cannot.''
The coming aid reductions provide an incentive for Cambodia, and for Vietnam, too, to improve relations with the West. The desire for Western aid adds further pressure to both countries to seek a peaceful settlement to the Cambodian conflict, since the United States has made a settlement a prerequisite to improved relations. The aid factor is one reason Washington is hopeful for the success of its recent shift in Cambodia policy, which involves direct talks with Hanoi and probably Phnom Penh.
For Moscow especially, Cambodia's dependency creates a special responsibility. The Soviets provide the greatest share of Cambodian aid, followed by the East Germans and the Czechs. It financed the 11-year Vietnamese intervention in Cambodia and the client Government that emerged.
But the Soviet Union no longer has the money or, seemingly, the will to project an ideology onto developing countries anywhere. And Moscow is healing its split with China, chief backer of the Khmer Rouge.
''But it's true, there is a question of credibility involved,'' said a Soviet diplomat here. ''There is also a feeling of moral responsibility to help this Government defend itself from the Khmer Rouge.''
So the Soviet Union, he said, would continue to supply the Hun Sen Government with arms so long as other countries, in particular China, continue to supply the Khmer Rouge and the non-Communist factions allied to them. Moscow wants a moratorium on such aid, he said. Cambodian officials complain that the arms supply from Moscow has already been reduced.
Still, arms are almost the least of Cambodia's problems. The Soviet Union provides all of Cambodia's oil and gasoline, for instance, and nearly all of Cambodia's electricity comes from oil-burning generators. A halt in the flow of oil would be a disaster both economically and militarily. Yet it is clear, the Soviet diplomat admitted, that Cambodia cannot pay market prices in hard currency for its oil, let alone its fertilizer.
So what will happen? ''I think we must continue,'' the diplomat said. ''But an agreement has not yet been worked out.'' For the first time, he said, the Soviet Union has a sort of functioning Parliament, with real politics driven by domestic concerns, that will also have a say on foreign policy and aid.
An associated problem is the Soviet Union's request for assistance from the International Monetary Fund. The fund prohibits loan recipients from providing aid to any third country.
An American veto bars the fund itself from helping Cambodia, which will suddenly be faced with an enormous financial squeeze at a time when inflation is high and the economy shaken by war.
Such dire economic factors quite probably were a major topic in recent United States-Soviet discussions on bringing about a settlement in Cambodia. Last month, Washington announced that it was withdrawing diplomatic support from the Khmer Rouge-led opposition and allowing export licenses for humanitarian aid to Phnom Penh. The latter move was an indication that Washington intends to try to help Moscow keep Phnom Penh breathing until a settlement can be fashioned.
The coming unification of Germany poses another problem. Cambodia is one of the few countries where East Germany has an embassy and West Germany does not. The Hun Sen Government, desperate for a breakthrough to the West that might bring replacement aid, is hoping that a united Germany will maintain its embassy here.
But some East European diplomats said it is now almost certain that Germany, afraid of stepping out ahead of the rest of the West, would keep its economic commitments to Cambodia but downgrade its embassy here to a mission only.
Of course, recognition alone, even by hundreds of countries, won't save Mr. Hun Sen from the Khmer Rouge. But these are early days yet, and while the Khmer Rouge fighters are disrupting the countryside, they are not near the gates. A general economic collapse and associated popular panic, however, might bring them there soon enough.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: The Big Voices;
A Debate About the Powers At the U.N.

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS

DATELINE: UNITED NATIONS

 BODY:
AS the United Nations Security Council prepared sanctions against Iraq last weekend for invading Kuwait, the epicenter of the drama was not the Council Chamber with its horseshoe table, nor was it even the conference suite reserved for private consultations between the Council's 15 members. The most critical talks occurred in the office of France's avuncular United Nations Representative, Pierre-Louis Blanc, at his mission in 1 Dag Hammarskjold Plaza, a five-minute walk away.
Mr. Blanc is currently ''coordinator,'' or chairman, of the five permanent Council members who hold vetoes on decisions. While the United States drafted the initial embargo plan, it needed a green light from the other four - Britain, China, France and the Soviet Union - before they took it to the other 10 members of the council. Those members' seats rotate, and they do not have a veto. 
For most of the last 45 years the Security Council was paralyzed by cold war tensions and most countries found it convenient to forget that the five leaders of the victorious World War II Allies still control this body. Now, as East-West tensions fade and the Council starts to carry out its mandate to preserve peace, many countries are questioning its composition and the way it works.
When its permanent members agree, the Security Council wields awesome powers, allowing it to intervene in a crisis, deploy peacekeeping forces, impose mandatory sanctions and even order armed forces into battle to enforce decisions. ''When it works, it's the only place to be at the United Nations,'' said a Western diplomat.
A permanent seat and a veto on decisions was the price sought by Stalin, Roosevelt and the other big powers for giving the Council such far-reaching authority. Without that veto Stalin would never have joined the United Nations and the United States Senate probably would have kept America out too.
Remembering the failure of the League of Nations and the horrors of the war that followed, the five major victors saw a powerful Security Council as the keystone, alongside the deliberative General Assembly, in a system of collective security that would make another such conflict impossible. Through the Council, they hoped, they could use their armed might to enforce peace and prevent a revival of militarism in Germany and Japan. The veto was invented because all five had to agree before using the big stick; none would tolerate its use against their own interests.
What is surprising, in retrospect, is that other countries also agreed to give such power to a Council on which, for most of the time, they would not even be represented. ''Only the idealism of the immediate post-war explains that,'' says Professor Richard N. Gardner of Columbia University, an authority on the United Nations.
The permanent members' privileges made clearer sense while Britain and France were imperial powers and when the five were the only nuclear powers. But the arrangements have come under question now - especially in the cases of Britain and France, which have lost their empires and have been outstripped by Germany and Japan in economic strength. Meanwhile, the end of colonialsm has created a third-world majority at the United Nations and turned nations like India and Brazil into regional superpowers.
Recasting the Council to better reflect current realities is difficult because the five must agree to changes in the Charter, and many fear that altering the Charter would open a Pandora's box of other demands.
Nevertheless, Japan, which has taken a back seat in world affairs for decades but now seems anxious to translate economic muscle into political influence, has informally proposed the creation of six new permanent Council seats that would not have a veto - for itself, a united Germany, India, Egypt, Nigeria and Brazil. Tokyo refrained from seeking veto powers for them because their claim to a greater voice is based on economic strength and population, not might.
There are, clearly, some stumbling blocks. For one, the plan would increase the already disproportionate representation of Europe. And would Pakistan accept a permanent Indian seat, or Argentina one for Brazil?
For now, in any case, the plan has been put on hold by Chancellor Helmut Kohl of West Germany, who fears that a German demand for a permanent Council seat at the moment of unification would send the wrong message to Europe. But few people at the United Nations doubt it will resurface.
Meanwhile, the five are consolidating their position, establishing themselves as effective mediators in conflicts. It was they who privately worked out the cease-fire agreement for the Iran-Iraq war, and now they are working on a peace plan for Cambodia.
Despite the jealousy their privileges arouse, the countries involved in these conflicts have accepted the five as impartial peacemakers. Like Winston Churchill's famous definition of democracy, the existing Security Council may turn out to be the worst possible mechanism for attempting to safeguard peace, except for all the others.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD: The Biggest Consumer;
America Is Still Demanding A Full Tank

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
THE threat by Iraq to the economy of the United States is once more demonstrating that the United States is an energy giant of the undesirable kind.
With 2 percent of the world's population and about 4 percent of its oil reserves, this country consumes a quarter of the world's oil. Since it produces only about one-seventh of the world supply, the United States is by far the largest oil importer.
Twice in the last 17 years, supply interruptions have made that fact painfully obvious; twice the Government pledged to trim energy use, but enthusiasm faded and the trend even reversed direction, with some sectors of the economy becoming less energy-efficient in recent years. 
In the Reagan Administration, which relied on the market to dictate changes in consumption, research and development spending was cut and auto efficiency standards reached a plateau. President Bush has taken a supply-side approach, seeking to protect the source of oil by military means.
The prospects for finding more oil here are poor. Richard Morrow, chairman of Amoco and president of the American Petroleum Institute, observed recently that of the roughly 600,000 producing wells in this country, average production is 14 barrels a day. At the current rate of pumping, the United States would be dry before 1998. In contrast, the Middle East's 3,000 producing wells average 3,900 barrels a day each, and the ratio of production to reserves gives some Persian Gulf countries more than a century of pumping at current rates.
All of this leads some to wonder if the United States can't cut demand.
That would certainly seem possible. Americans use nine times as much energy per person as the third world, a level hardly sustainable for the planet as a whole. Edward Renshaw, a researcher at the State University of New York at Albany, observed in a recent study that global oil reserves would last 47 to 88 years at current rates of consumption, but if all people used as much oil as Americans do, known reserves would be exhausted in 8 to 15 years.
The United States also stacks up badly against Japan and Western Europe, using roughly twice as much energy to produce each dollar's worth of goods and services.
The opportunity to conserve presents itself anew each time a new car is driven out of a showroom or a new water heater is installed. Between 1976 and 1986, improvements in water heaters, cars, industrial equipment and other energy-consuming devices cut the ratio of energy use to gross domestic product by 2.8 percent per year. But almost no progress was made in 1987 and 1988. Last year the improvement was about 1.5 percent.
Charles Komanoff, an energy analyst in New York, estimates that if the trend from 1976 to 1986 had persisted, and if half the additional energy thus saved had been oil, American consumption would now be lower by 1.6 million barrels a day - just a little more than Kuwait's OPEC quota.
Some improvement was more or less coincidental. The broadest measure of efficiency, the ratio of energy use to gross domestic product, hides what economists call a ''structural'' change. In the 1970's the United States exported much of its steel industry, which is energy intensive, and replaced it with service industries, which use relatively less energy. According to the Office of Technology Assessment, this switch accounts for one-third of the ''efficiency'' gain since the first oil shock in 1973.
Improvement also slowed because of market forces, according to experts; gasoline was as cheap last month as it was before the first oil shock, when inflation is taken into account, and because cars go 50 percent more miles on a gallon today than they did in 1973 the fuel cost to drive a mile is lower than ever.
One result of the decline in gas prices is that cars in the 1990 model year get mileage that is 4 percent worse than those in the 1988 model year.
Spending more to buy a more fuel efficient car is not a rational economic decision; nor is picking a place to live or work on the basis of how far away it is. ''I don't have any question that energy conservation is a very important thing for the country,'' said Constantine S. Nicandros, the chairman of Conoco, in an interview last week. ''But you can't have cheap prices for fuel and at the same time tell people, 'Don't drive so much.' '' He urges a ''hefty'' gasoline tax, at least 50 cents a gallon - an unusual position for an oil company executive. But he added, ''I don't think there are enough politicians with courage to impose a tax.''
Americans are not alone in their slippage. According to Lee Schipper, an energy expert at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory, consumers in Europe and Japan as well as the United States are ''backsliding, using more heat, buying bigger cars and driving in more congested areas.''
Americans are worst, using about 350 gallons of gasoline a person; West Germans use about 150. Dr. Schipper found a variety of reasons: the West Germans not only have more efficient automobiles, but they drive fewer miles and have fewer cars per 1,000 people.
But the ratio of cars to people is rising all over the world, as is industrial demand for oil. According to Cambridge Energy Research Associates, at the turn of the century daily consumption of all commercial fuels, including coal, oil and other sources, was equal in energy value to 11 million barrels of oil. It was 31.5 million barrels in 1950, and in 1988, 162.1 million.
And if the rest of the world demanded energy the way that this country does, even the oil fields of the Persian Gulf would run dry before long.

Fighting The War of Words Over Kuwait

 BODY:
''Since 1980 when we were at war, we faced circumstances which were as difficult as the war itself because they affected our economy and basic resource, namely, oil. There was confusion in the oil market. There was lack of abidance by OPEC decisions. . . . We say that war is fought with soldiers and harm is done by explosions, killing and coup attempts, but it is also done by economic means sometimes. . . . I say that those who do not mean to wage war on Iraq, that this is in fact a kind of war against Iraq.'' - President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, addressing closed session of Arab summit meeting in Baghdad, May 30.
''Iraqis will not forget the saying that cutting necks is better than cutting means of living. . . . O God almighty, be witness that we have warned them. If words fail to protect Iraqis, something effective must be done to return things to their natural course and to return usurped rights to their owners.'' - President Hussein, threatening Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates over oil-production policies, July 17. 
''Your country is being subjected to a barbaric invasion. It is time to defend it.'' - Kuwaiti radio, Aug. 1.
''He won't stop.'' - Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher to President Bush in Aspen, Colo., Aug. 2.
''Today, we take the unusual step of jointly calling upon the rest of the international community to join with us in an international cutoff of all arms supplies to Iraq.'' - Joint statement of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d and the Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, in Moscow, Aug. 3.
''After coordination with the leadership of brotherly Iraq, we have agreed together that their brave forces, which came to help their people and brothers, will start withdrawing according to a timetable on Sunday, Aug. 5.'' - Statement attributed by Iraqi news agency to the Kuwaiti radio, Aug. 3.
''With respect to the majority of the Arab world, President Saddam is a patriotic man who believes in his nation and its future and in establishing ties with others based on mutual respect.'' - King Hussein of Jordan, Aug. 4.
''Iraq lied once again. They said they were going to start moving out today, and we have no evidence that they're moving out. . . . This will not stand. This will not stand, this aggression against Kuwait.'' - President Bush, to reporters, Aug. 5.
''A puppet regime imposed from the outside is unacceptable. The acquisition of territory by force is unacceptable. No one, friend or foe, should doubt our desire for peace and no one should underestimate our determination to confront aggression.'' - President Bush, address to the nation after American forces began arriving in Saudi Arabia, Aug. 8.
''You said you would not strike and you struck. And now you are turning to Saudi Arabia and saying, 'I will not strike.' They will not believe you. Do you think they will wait until disaster strikes them, too? . . . You are not accepting the Arab umbrella. Well, you are getting the foreign umbrella. . . . You cannot put me in a bind like this. You cannot commit such a crime and then ask me for the impossible. Don't embarrass me. Just like you have interests, I have interests. I am trying as much as possible to protect Arab honor.'' - President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, address to his country, Aug. 8.
''Painful and regrettable events have been taking place since the dawn of last Thursday . . . when the Iraqi forces stormed the brotherly state of Kuwait in the most vile aggression known to the Arab nation in its modern history. . . . The Government of the U.S.A. and the British Government took the initiative, on the basis of the relations of friendship which link the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and these states, to send air and land forces . . . with the complete emphasis that this measure is not addressed to anybody but is only for a purely defensive aim imposed by the current circumstances.'' - King Fahd of Saudi Arabia in a statement broadcast by Saudi television, Aug. 9.
''The choice in front of us is clear - an Arab act that will preserve higher Arab interests and both Iraq and Kuwait, or a foreign intervention in which we will have no say or control.'' - President Mubarak, to a summit meeting of the Arab League, Aug. 10.
''Arabs, Moslems, believers in God wherever you are, this is your day to jump up and defend Mecca, hostage of the Americans. . . . Rise up against evil, against the foreigner who has trampled our sacred rights. . . . Tell the traitors and the rulers who are playing the role of middlemen in the service of foreigners and procuring Arab women for the emirs of oil that they have no place in the land of the Arabs, now that they have sold out the rights of the people and compromised dignity and honor. . . . Burn the soil under their feet. Burn the soil under the feet of the aggressors and invaders who want harm for your families in Iraq. Until the voice of right rises up in the Arab world, hit their interests wherever they are and rescue holy Mecca and rescue the grave of the Prophet Mohammed in Medina. . . . Your brothers in Iraq are determined on holy war without hesitation and without any slowing down, and without fear of the forces of the enemies.'' - Statement attributed to President Hussein, read on Iraqi radio, Aug. 10.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Split Among Arabs Unleashes a People's Anger

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: MANAMA, Bahrain

 BODY:
FOR Arabs everywhere, it was a momentous week, one in which long-suppressed antagonisms exploded into anger, military action and recriminations. For the Western powers, it was a week whose benefits and costs are only beginning to be counted.
''Whatever happens after this week - whether Saddam Hussein lives or dies, whether he keeps Kuwait or loses it, he will be remembered as an Arab who stood up to a formidable Western armada gathering to do battle with him,'' said Fawaz Jumayaan, a chemistry professor at the University of Jordan. ''After today nothing will ever be the same again in the Middle East.''
For the first time in contemporary Arab history, one Arab nation invaded another; for the first time since the cold war started in 1945, West and East joined in a gesture of geopolitical unity, opposing the annexation of Kuwait by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq. 
Saudi Arabia, that most conservative of Arab nations, made a momentous leap, admitting to itself and the world that in times of real danger it cannot do without American protection. The decision to invite the American army to defend the House of Saud will be with the ruling family for a long time to come.
And the Arab League broke its perennial search for a vacuous consensus with half the 22 members voting, openly and unequivocally, to impose sanctions on Iraq and with some agreeing to send troops to stand with the Saudis against Saddam Hussein. The sum of all this is yet to be known, but that some of it will not be pleasing to the West is already evident.
In the Arab world the veneer of unity has worn even thinner, and deep demarcation lines have been drawn between nations. The oil-plenty countries of the Persian Gulf - the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, Bahrain, Oman, in addition to Saudi Arabia - already envied and criticized around the Middle East as selfish, idle and arrogant, have now added the stigma of being ''American puppets,'' in the words of many an Arab commentator.
President Hussein, shrewdly calculating his moves so far, took full advantage of these suppressed anti-gulf sentiments, calling in a Friday speech for the overthrow of all ''oil emirs,'' describing them as infidels who squandered their oil wealth and invited Americans to the gates of Mecca, where lies the holiest of the holy Islamic shrines. Mr. Hussein, who had put a wealth-distribution program into effect, interrupted it to wage the nine-year war on Iran, and now is badly in need of additional revenues to pay $80 billion in debt - $40 billion of it owed to other Arab nations.
The Middle East has now split into a clearly moderate pro-Western camp led by Egypt, with the perhaps temporary participation of Syria, and a fiercely nationalistic anti-Western constellation gathered around Iraq, including most Palestinians and hundreds of thousands of citizens in countries like Jordan, Yemen, Tunisia and Algeria. This radicalism will almost certainly surge anew as the Palestinians make common cause with radical Arab states, led by Iraq.
''The Americans never accepted our right to self-determination,'' said Radawan Abu Ayyash, the head of the Palestinian Writers Association in Jerusalem, explaining why Palestinians are taking a clearly pro-Iraqi position in this conflict, risking a loss of support from Egypt and Saudi Arabia. ''We have to look after our own interests.''
The widely circulated Tunisian daily Achourouk crystallized this growing pro-Iraqi stand among Arabs in poorer countries in a Thursday editorial that said, ''From the Atlantic to the gulf, the Arab man in the street is on the side of Iraq.''
Popular committees have sprung up in several countries, sometimes in defiance of their governments, to back Iraq's stand. Thousands of volunteers have signed up at Iraqi embassies in Tunis, Yemen, Jordan and Algeria to ''fight American imperialism,'' according to independent news reports from various Arab capitals.
In Yemen on Thursday 300 people stormed the offices of the official Saudi Press Agency shouting ''No to America!'' and ''American cowards!'' while other crowds attacked the Egyptian embassy in Sanaa, the capital, to protest Egypt's condemnation of Iraq.
Even among Muslim fundamentalist movements, which ordinarily would have been expected to oppose the secular Iraqi regime, there was enthusiastic support for Iraq and open condemnation of the Americans and of the Saudis, who have been great benefactors to all Islamic movements in the region.
One-third of the Jordanian deputies, representing the Muslim Front in Jordan's freely elected parliament, called upon all Arabs last week to unite against what they described as ''the new Christian-Zionist crusade against Arab and Islamic lands.''
''Where was this American enthusiasm when Palestinian lands were confiscated by Israel or when Israel occupied the parts of Egypt, Syria and Jordan in 1967?'' asked Sobhi Taha, chairman of the Writers' Association in Irbid, Jordan. ''Where was Saudi Arabia then?''
Egypt, which has taken a leading role in trying to find an Arab solution, also felt somewhat on the defensive, with some of its spokesmen looking for excuses to explain its anti-Iraqi stand even as it sought to rally the other nations around it. ''The fact is that if we allowed one Arab country to occupy other Arab countries, what excuse do we have with the Israelis to tell them they have to let go of the West Bank?'' said Tahsin Bashir, a former Arab League ambassador of Egypt and spokesman for the late president Anwar el-Sadat.
Yet even before this week was over, the harsh truth was that Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and the other big oil producers of the gulf region had found a deep current of Arab dislike for them, and that wide segments of public opinion in the Arab world would hardly shed a tear if all the ruling families were overthrown as was the al-Sabah family of Kuwait.
These truths, long suppressed by the money doled by the rich Arabs to obtain support from their poorer brethren, are now coming out. As a result, many senior officials in the gulf region are saying they have washed their hands of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat and of King Hussein of Jordan, men whose sympathy for Iraq was all too evident.
But with many Palestinian nationals running the economies of the oil states, there is a question of whether that distance can be maintained.
To be sure, there will be little enthusiasm now in the gulf countries and the United States for a resolution to the Palestinian-Israeli problem that may secure a homeland for Palestinians.
Within the gulf, it already appears that Iran, while taking full advantage of any setbacks for Iraq, has more in common with its powerful neighbor than with the Arabs of the gulf. Both countries would like to see higher oil prices and revenues. Both are anxious to see American and Western fleets depart from the Persian Gulf. And both agree that in the end they have to subdue the rich gulf Arabs and their regional influence to achieve these aims. But Iran has gingerly sided with the anti-Iraq camp, probably delaying any alliance.
At the moment, the West appears to take some comfort in Egypt's leadership in the crisis. After all, this most important summit meeting was held in Cairo on one day's notice, not in Riyadh, Baghdad or Amman.
But the Egypt that is claiming leadership of the Arabs today is not the nation of the late Gamal Abdel Nasser, whose charismatic Arab mantle Mr. Hussein is trying to assume. Egypt today is an impoverished, overpopulated country with $50 billion in debt, dependent on the $3 billion in American aid sent each year. Even with Egypt's new leadership role, this dependency on American aid is widely seen in the Arab world as dependency on American will - a position now shared by Saudi Arabia.

HEADLINE: NO QUARTER;
America Could Face a Long and Costly Commitment in the Mideast

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
JUST as President Bush was beginning to trust in the stability of the emerging world order, the crisis most feared in the new era has exploded on the Arabian Peninsula. A war over oil is testing his ability to handle sudden adversity and holding out little hope for the kind of benign ending that followed the quiet revolutions of 1989.
Unlike in Europe, where just about everyone seemed to win at least a little, there will be losers in the Persian Gulf. It is difficult to imagine a resolution in which both George Bush and Saddam Hussein emerge unscathed, or even with equal damage. Indeed, what alarms the Bush Administration most is that it is easier to write scripts with no winners.
President Bush and the eclectic gathering of nations backing Washington say they had no choice but to enter this perilous position once Mr. Hussein invaded Kuwait, declared it part of Iraq and seemed to be eyeing Saudi Arabia. Now they are betting the ultimate stakes - war with a leader who has shown no qualms about prolonged bloodshed - that they can choke Mr. Hussein with economic sanctions until he surrenders Kuwait and, ultimately, some demand, his seat of power in Iraq. 
Mr. Bush seems to be enjoying popular and Congressional support for his military deployment, but Americans are not very good at waiting out wars, especially one that could involve 100,000 American soldiers and cost billions just when voters were waiting for the so-called peace dividend. How long, then, can the United States stand eyeball-to-eyeball with hostile Arab troops in a scorching desert where American soldiers seem certain to face cultural and political friction with their Saudi hosts? Is the United States embroiled in a politically volatile situation from which it may not be able to extricate itself easily? Will it find itself indefinitely protecting the gulf states?
Mr. Hussein has called for disenchanted Arabs to rise in a holy war against their oil-wealthy neighbors. This call seems to be falling on unsympathetic ears but even if Mr. Hussein is defeated, Middle East politics has been turned on its head, compelling the Arab world to rethink its alliances and potentially forcing some new balance between Arab oil and Western military and economic power. ''The legitimacy of the existing structure in the Middle East has not been this fundamentally challenged, even by Nasser,'' said Henry A. Kissinger, the former Secretary of State. The Bush Administration acknowledges that United States power is in the Persian Gulf to stay, one way or another, as long as the world economy must drink oil for survival. ''We're in for the long haul,'' a senior official said.
Oil is the political reality behind Mr. Bush's talk, however heartfelt, about national sovereignty, self-determination and the rule of law. Because oil is the lifeblood of the world economy, the Middle East, like no other region, has the potential to blow apart the fragile new comity between East and West. That, more than Kuwaiti independence, is what has drawn so many different interests together. Mr. Bush took advantage of the new East-West relations to rally an unprecedented coalition against Mr. Hussein, starting with a joint Soviet-American condemnation and culminating with swift passage of mandatory United Nations sanctions. With painstaking personal diplomacy, Mr. Bush has slowly enlisted European allies - and the Soviet Union - in sending warships to the Persian Gulf to enforce the embargo if necessary.
The Iraqi army, even if it has the million men President Hussein claims, seems a poor match for the American military with its overwhelming air power, and the American, Soviet, British, French, Canadian and German warships. But Iraq proved its endurance during the nine-year conflict with Iran and as tough as Mr. Bush may be prepared to be, Mr. Hussein can be meaner. This is a man who has used poison gas - and who has said he would not hesitate to use it again. Administration officials say there seems to be no solution acceptable to the West that includes Mr. Hussein's staying in Kuwait and, indeed, in Iraq. Representative Les Aspin, who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, was so alarmed that Mr. Bush had not made this point strongly enough that he wrote the President on Friday to ask him to ''make clearer to the American public and to the Arab public why we are there and the conditions under which we will leave.'' The White House, though, has tried to keep things as calm as possible under the circumstances by being circumspect in its talk about overthrowing Mr. Hussein.
It also shuns the word ''hostage'' to refer to the thousands of American citizens that Mr. Hussein won't let out of Kuwait or Iraq.
Washington is seeking a fine balance between a Western-imposed solution and an Arab solution. As the Arab countries tried to resolve the crisis within their own ranks, there was concern in Washington that they would buy off Mr. Hussein by erasing debts and permitting him some presence in Kuwait. Administration officials took heart from the vote at the Arab summit on Friday, in which only Iraq, Libya and the Palestine Liberation Organization opposed sending a common Arab force to Saudi Arabia. But Henry Schuler, director of energy-security programs for the Center for Strategic and International Studies, worried that ''the sine qua non of any Arab solution would be the withdrawal of American troops.'' The United States might want to resist if Mr. Hussein were still in a position of strength, but that would wreck any new Arab alliance.
The United States has been working to broaden Arab participation in the struggle against Mr. Hussein, arguing that otherwise, his portrayal of the fight as one between the Arab people and the American ''infidels,'' with the Saudi monarchy as their only ally, could be widely effective among Arabs disenchanted with the distribution of the oil wealth.
Mr. Bush sees a chance to improve relations with Syria and even perhaps with Iran. But there are risks associated with Arab military involvement. Mr. Schuler noted that the Egyptian army, for example, has a long history of fighting to overthrow monarchies, starting with the ouster of King Farouk in 1952. ''Now,'' he said, ''we expect this army to be reliable in propping up the House of Saud and putting the Emir of Kuwait back on his throne?'' In return for Arab assistance, Washington might find itself under increased pressure to push Israel toward a resolution of its disputes with the Palestinians.
In the cauldron of Middle East politics, Mr. Hussein's move has blown the already thin cover of the Saudi-American relationship. These relations have always had a fatal flaw: as soon as the Saudis acknowledged them - as they have by inviting American troops into their country - the rest of the Arab world could be at their throats. Mr. Hussein's efforts to exploit this have not worked so far since he can hardly assume the mantle of protector of the faith. But Administration officials and Middle East specialists worry that a prolonged presence of American forces in Saudia Arabia could rekindle religious resentment against the House of Saud. Then the Bush Administration, already talking about a long-term commitment to beefing up the Saudi military, could find itself having to prop up the Saudi Government.
The crisis has reinforced the idea of gulf dependence on American military power. ''We were living under a false sense of security,'' said Saud Nasir al-Sabah, the Kuwaiti Ambassador to Washington. Asked whether this means the United States must stay in the gulf as the protector of the states on its shores, Mr. Nasir was circumspect. ''We have to wait and see.'' This is not a new role. For two years, American war vessels protected Kuwaiti ships that were switched to the United States flag. Although the United States has no real logistical problem sustaining a major military force once it is in place in Saudi Arabia, there are important political ramifications at home. Just when many lawmakers were arguing for a cut in military spending, the gulf crisis has strengthened the hand of the strong-military lobby. At the same time, the prospect of paying for the costly Arab expedition is likely to strain American patience.
The Middle East operation has pointed up a flaw in American plans to meet a sudden crisis overseas: the shortage of ships and planes to carry armed forces to battle. ''We have a real airlift problem when it comes to moving anything heavy,'' said Richard H. Shultz, director of security studies programs at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University. ''This sort of engagement shows we are cutting in all the wrong places when we start shrinking our overseas facilities.''
In the end, it might appear unseemly to restore a feudal Emir to his throne. But a West European diplomat said the United States and its allies will find a justification.
''We have never bothered about democracy in the gulf,'' he said. ''We have bothered about oil.''

HEADLINE: Secret Service Faces A Rise in Counterfeiting

BYLINE: By ROBERT A. HAMILTON

 BODY:
INFLATION, and the drug trade, have aided counterfeiters in Connecticut, says Thomas W. Gardner of the United States Secret Service.
''Years ago, you'd go into a store with a $20 bill, and it was considered unusual,'' said Mr. Gardner, the agent in charge of counterfeiting cases at the Secret Service's Connecticut office, in New Haven. ''Today, the clerk sticks it in the cash drawer without even looking at it.''
And someone with $1,000 in genuine bills can exchange it for $10,000 in counterfeit ones, he said, then buy cocaine that can be peddled on the street for $30,000 - a 300 percent profit.
''Counterfeit money is very lucrative to the drug dealer,'' Mr. Gardner said. It can also be dangerous, he said, if the person who sold the drugs for counterfeit cash catches on. But most street dealers do not think ahead that far, he said. 
 
Larger Seizures
The amount of counterfeit cash seized in Connecticut rose to $117,000 in 1989, from $34,000 in 1985, he said, and is likely to go up again this year, with seizures averaging $3,000 a week.
The denomination of the average bogus bill is also increasing, Mr. Gardner said. In 1989, 4,200 bills were seized in the state, with an average face value of $28 each. In 1985, 1,300 bills were seized with an average value of about $26.
Despite the rise in counterfeiting, businesses that handle large amounts of cash said they have made few changes in their operations.
Robert Cunningham, president of the Salisbury Bank, in Lakeville, and chairman of the Connecticut Bankers Association, said he knows of no banks offering seminars to tellers on how to spot counterfeit notes.
At his bank, ''I can say while we pick up a few bills from time to time, we don't get a lot of it,'' he said.
The president of the Connecticut Retail Merchants, James Rogers said he was surprised to learn that counterfeiting had risen so sharply since the mid-1980's, because none of his members had mentioned any problems.
''I guess this is all part of a very tight economy,'' he said.
 
Big-City Operations
The Secret Service investigates all reports of counterfeit money.While it is better known for protecting the President and visiting heads of state, the Federal agency was created in 1865 to combat a counterfeiting problem so widespread that one-third of all paper money in the nation was believed to be counterfeit.
''You see more'' counterfeit money ''in Connecticut than you would, say, in the Midwest, because of its location'' between New York City and Boston, Mr. Gardner said. Counterfeiters typically operate out of big cities, he said.
A great many counterfeit coins, known as slugs, used to be made in Rhode Island, ''but inflation actually helped us there,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''Now it costs more to make them than they're worth.''
He said most of the counterfeit cases in Connecticut originate in Fairfield County, for two reasons.
''The cost of living in southwestern Connecticut is higher, so you get a faster turnover of money, and more counterfeit gets into the system,'' Mr. Gardner said. In addition, he said, the county is only a couple of train stops from New York City, where many of the bogus bills probably originate.
''We believe that 50 percent of the counterfeit that turns up here, if not as much as 75 percent, is manufactured outside of Connecticut,'' Mr. Gardner said.
 
'People Don't Understand'
Many of the other bills turn up in large cities, such as Hartford, New Haven and Danbury, Mr. Gardner said, which is probably the result of the increased drug trafficking in those cities.
But fake money sometimes turns up in other locations, he said.A few years ago, a young man who lived in Franklin was caught passing counterfeit bills. He worked at the Electric Boat Company in Groton and had purchased the bogus bills from a co-worker in Rhode Island.
''A lot of people don't understand the seriousness of the crime,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''Counterfeit is contraband, and having a counterfeit $1 bill is the same as having cocaine in your pocket.''
People also tend to think of counterfeiting as a victimless crime, until the first time they get caught with a bogus note. Even if criminal charges are not lodged, the store or bank that notices it must confiscate the bill and turn it over to the Secret Service.
''We get calls from people who want to know who's going to make up the $100 they lost because of a counterfeit bill,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''That's when they learn it's not a victimless crime. They're out that money, because they can't get it back.''
''People involved in counterfeiting are usually involved in other crimes,'' Mr. Gardner said. In about 50 percent of the arrests, a counterfeiter is carrying a weapon, he said.
 
Too Busy or Too Lazy
Making a bill look and feel genuine is very difficult, Mr. Gardner said, but many still pass undetected, because store clerks and bank tellers are often too busy or too lazy to look a bill over closely.
The Secret Service has only seven agents covering Connecticut, he said, and they are sometimes pulled out of the state for protection details, but they have the help of a sophisticated computer to track counterfeit money.
Each time a counterfeit bill turns up, a report is logged into the agency's computer, which looks for similarities to cases around the world that might lead back to the maker.
''We start at the bottom of the ladder and try to work our way up each rung,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''Sometimes we're lucky.''
Each year, he said, 16 to 20 people are arrested on counterfeiting charges in the state. In the last five years, the Secret Service in Connecticut has had 10 ''plant suppressions,'' which means shutting down counterfeiting operations.
''The average seize is probably $1 million now, and that's still relatively small,'' Mr. Gardner said. ''Operations of $10 million, $15 million or $20 million are not unusual in Miami and New York.''

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
U.S. Aid Helped Hussein's Climb; Now, Critics Say, the Bill Is Due

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
For 10 years, as Iraq developed a vast army, chemical weapons, nuclear ambitions and a long record of brutality, the Reagan and Bush Administrations quietly courted President Saddam Hussein as a counterweight to Iran's revolutionary fervor. Now, critics say, Washington is paying the price for that policy.
Iraq is a power with a 200,000-man army in Kuwait and nearby Iraqi territory and designs on the world's petroleum stocks, while the United States has hastily mounted its largest military mobilization since Vietnam to keep Saudi Arabia from sharing Kuwait's fate.
Iraq reached these heights with American acquiescence and sometimes its help. It benefited from a thriving grain trade with American farmers, cooperation with United States intelligence agencies, oil sales to American refiners that helped finance its military, and muted White House criticism of its human rights and war atrocities. 
 
A Big Buyer of Food
The United States removed Iraq from its list of nations supporting terrorism in 1983. The action was significant for it opened the door to Federal subsidies and loan guarantees.
Since 1982, Baghdad has become one of the biggest buyers of United States rice and wheat, purchasing some $5.5 billion in crops and livestock with federally guaranteed loans and agricultural subsidies and its own hard cash. It also has been extended some $270 million in Government-guaranteed credit from the Export-Import Bank to buy other American goods, despite repeated failures to make loan repayments on time.
Current and former Government officials also say the Central Intelligence Agency provided the Iraqis with valuable information on the military operations of their Iranian foes. In return, the United States received what the officials called largely disappointing data on terrorism, the Soviet Union and Iran.
 
The Cost Could Be High
The United States has had other cozy relationships with autocratic leaders in places like the Philippines and Panama. Some of those ties have been warmer than the ones with with Iraq.
But many critics, and some former Administration officials, say the potential costs of the Reagan and Bush Administrations' dance with President Hussein threaten to be especially steep. Beyond the prospect of a war over oil, the muted American reaction to the use of mustard and nerve gases by Iraq against Iran, first reported in March 1984, and its rocketing of Iranian cities with intermediate-range ballistic missiles may have encouraged the spread of such weapons - a problem some officials now regard as among the United States' most pressing national security concerns.
Speaking today on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said as much. ''I do think it's worth looking at, in the future, arms sales practices and policies,'' Mr. Baker said. ''We're very concerned about chemical weapons proliferation. These things, though, have all come about in the last three or four years. We should have been more concerned about all of this, perhaps going further back.''
In an interview last week, a senior Pentagon official in the Reagan Administration, Richard L. Armitage, said that ''in retrospect, it would have been much better at the time of their use of gas and IRBM's if we'd put our foot down.''
''The mistake we made was not pushing very hard and loud for international action,'' he said.
Mr. Armitage and other officials said they did not press for further punishment of Iraq at the time because they hoped to expand American influence with Mr. Hussein and shore up Iraq's ability to pursue the war with Iran.
 
Relationship Is Defended
The Administration has argued publicly that the relationship with Baghdad was in the United States' interest because Iran threatened to rout Iraq in their eight-year war, which ended in 1988. After the war the argument was that economic and political ties were the only hope of influencing President Hussein.
In the weeks before the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait, the White House abandoned even that tack, fighting trade sanctions against an increasingly belligerent Iraq by contending that they would hurt American farmers and businessmen without swaying Baghdad in the least.
Some members of Congress, especially from agricultural states, also lobbied strongly against sanctions and for increased trade.
Today, Administration officials concede that the policy did not work. But they insist, in the words of a senior State Department official, Edward W. Gnehm, that ''it was incumbent on us to try.''
''As a powerful nation with a global outlook, we are obliged to develop as close relationships as possible with countries in these positions, especially where we have strategic interests,'' Mr. Gnehm, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and Asian Affairs, said in an interview last week. ''There was a reasonable expectation that Saddam Hussein might well want to develop closer ties to the West. He has an oil-based economy that was tied to the West. He had a technology base with Western interests.''
 
Policy Called Craven
''There were lots of things in the equation that didn't work,'' Mr. Gnehm said, ''but we hoped to be able to weave him into the fabric of Western nations. And we never tried to build that relationship with an extended hand without pointing out these problems with the other hand. I can only say it failed.''
Mr. Armitage said the United States was never unaware of Saddam Hussein's potential for evil. ''We knew this wasn't the League of Women Voters,'' he said.
Critics call that policy craven. They say it encouraged Iraq to become ever more brutal by leaving the impression that no bad deed would go punished.
''We were so desperate to believe we could convert him that we were taken completely in,'' said Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato, a New York Republican who is one of Iraq's leading critics. ''And the State Department was a willing accomplice to it, because they wanted to believe, too.''
The Bush and Reagan Administrations declined to punish Iraq when it used poison gas against Iranian soldiers in 1984 or against its own Kurdish citizens in 1988, and did not protest when President Hussein bought 45 American helicopters, worth $200 million, with assurances that they were for civilian use, then transferred many, if not all, to his military.
 
Taken Off Terrorist List
The Reagan Administration removed Iraq from its list of terrorist nations in 1983, and declined to reinstate it in 1985, although the terrorist Abul Abbas took refuge in Baghdad after masterminding the hijacking of the cruise ship Achille Lauro, and Iraq refused American requests to expel him. More recently, Abu Nidal, another notorious terrorist leader, is said to have re-established an operations base in Iraq.
Nor did the Bush Administration publicly protest the forced relocation of at least 500,000 ethnic Kurds and Syrians in the late 1980's, although the act violated principles of the 1948 Genocide Convention, according to Middle East Watch, a human rights organization. And last year, despite a State Department report that described Iraq's human-rights record as ''abysmal,'' the Bush Administration declined to join 12 other Western powers in calling for a United Nations inquiry into Iraq's treatment of its population.
The beneficiary of these acts, President Hussein, had denounced America as an enemy from the 1960's until the early 1980's. Then setbacks in his war with Iran appear to have provoked an abrupt shift.
''He made it clear that Iraq was not interested in making mischief in the world,'' said Donald Rumsfeld, a former Defense Secretary who, as a Middle East envoy, reopened discussions with Mr. Hussein in 1983. ''It struck us as useful to have a relationship, given that we were interested in solving the Mideast problems.''
 
'Almost a Nil Relationship'
The spur to Washington's interest was Iran. A former Senate Intelligence Committee member recalled officials, ''white as sheets,'' warning in the mid-1980's that Iran might overwhelm Iraq.
''We got fired up and said, 'My God, we can't let Iran win this war,' '' said Mr. Armitage, now a State Department negotiator.
In that context, Iraq's use of poison gas in 1984 and 1988 was seen as troubling, but not enough so to rupture the new ties. The Reagan Administration publicly protested, limited Iraq's access to gas components and joined a United Nations condemnation of chemical weapons, but levied no other punishment.
In 1986, officials said, intelligence experts, Israel and other gulf states began to warn that Iraq could emerge from the Iran war as a menacing regional superpower. Espionage exchanges began to wither, and Mr. Armitage said the Pentagon maintained ''almost a nil relationship'' with Mr. Hussein.
But Iraq's growing might and ruthlessness appears to have had little effect on the conduct of diplomatic or business ties with Iraq. ''There was outrage here, going back to the chemical weapons issue,'' said Richard W. Murphy, the senior Middle East diplomat in the Reagan Administration's State Department, ''but we didn't support sanctions when they first came up because we thought we were getting somewhere in private channels. And we thought that unless they were internationally applied, sanctions wouldn't do the job.''
Mr. Hussein insisted in ''back channels'' that Iraq had no designs on its neighbors once the war ended, Mr. Murphy said.
 
Growing Militance a Concern
In the Agriculture Department, sales of farm goods to Iraq rose from $100 million in 1982 to $727 million by 1986. Almost all of the increase was on credit supplied by Washington. By 1989 the loans reached $1.2 billion.
Iraq's growing militance was a frequent concern in meetings, said Mel Sims, an Agriculture Department sales manager who visited Iraq often in the 1980's.
''I began to sense more political pressures'' from supporters of sanctions in the late 1980's, Mr. Sims, now retired, said in an interview. ''But here again, the State Department did not support them.''
''There are some who might say, 'You helped Iraq grow stronger,' and that, I think, is a true statement,'' he said. ''But it's hard to predict what countries will do.''
 
A Lost Chance for Change
Critics say the Bush Administration missed a chance to change its policy toward Iraq after the war with Iran ended in 1988, removing the major reason for American support of an increasingly aggressive Government.
The Administration and farm-state members of Congress successfully opposed legislation last September that would have suspended export credits and loan guarantees to punish Iraq.
New sanctions legislation swept through Congress last month, days before Iraq invaded Kuwait, over State Department objections that ''it would be the American farmer and the American exporter who would, in effect, be punished.''
The House sponsor of the sanctions legislation, Representative Gus Yatron, Democrat of Pennsylvania, dismissed that argument. ''Given the State Department's low-key and ineffective response to human rights abuses in Iraq,'' he said in a statement in April, ''you would never know that such heinous abuses were taking place.''

CORRECTION-DATE: August 15, 1990, Wednesday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article on Monday about American policy toward Iraq misstated the year in which the United States removed Iraq from a list of nations that sponsor terrorism. Iraq was taken off the list in 1982, not 1983.

HEADLINE: FEARING RECESSION, AMERICANS SKIMP ON VACATION COSTS

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN DIEGO, Aug. 11

 BODY:
Recession looms across America, and wary vacationers are camping out, eating in and heading home early to save a few dollars.
From the lush Tiger River Valley in the San Diego Zoo to the rocky coast of Maine, the travel industry is having its toughest summer in more than a decade. Travel officials see tourism as a sensitive barometer of consumer confidence and say its decline is an early warning of economic troubles.
''People are watching what they spend; they fear a recession, if a recession is not already in progress,'' said Jeff Jouett, a spokesman for the 74-year-old zoo, which imposed a hiring freeze last week after July attendance slumped 12 percent from last year. ''Consumer confidence is down.'' 
 
Further Slump Is Expected
Compounding the industry's woes are sharp increases in gasoline prices in the last week after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait. And a round of fare increases ranging from 5 percent to 10 percent just announced by American, Northwest, Pan Am, United, T.W.A. and other airlines seems certain to further depress leisure travel.
''I've had a lot more customers call up, get prices and then say it's really out of their price range right now,'' said Magda Corbin, a co-owner of Azer Travel in Los Angeles.
Instead, people are taking cheaper, shorter vacations closer to home. ''Normally we go to Florida for a week, but we just went to Cape Cod for the weekend,'' Deborah Gintey of Middletown, R.I., said last week. ''We have had a lousy vacation this summer.''
Thus, even as revenue is down 10 percent this summer at the Chatham Bars Inn on Cape Cod, Mass., the number of visitors is up 10 percent at the nearby beaches of the Cape Cod National Seashore. ''People may be doing more outdoors, one-shot kind of vacationing,'' said Anthony Bonanno, chief ranger at the 48-mile coastline.
The Midwest and Rocky Mountain states provide the main exception to the trend. State officials report that leisure travel this year is up 7 percent in Illinois, 5 percent in Missouri and 12 percent in Idaho.
A spokeswoman for Yellowstone National Park, in northwestern Wyoming, reports a banner year for the region. She said that visits rose to 526,260 in June, as against 472,856 in June 1989, and that the visits recorded last month had set a record for July.
At Rocky Mountain National Park, Colorado's prime tourist attraction, visits were up 15 percent in June over last year.
Near Saugatuck, Mich., a Lake Michigan resort popular with Chicagoans, the family-run Crane Orchards was reporting a good summer at its bed-and-breakfast inn and restaurant.
Midwest officials attribute their success to prices that are lower than on the two coasts, more aggressive promotion and a relatively stable Midwestern economy. ''We're now opening the book on the Midwest,'' said Dick Matty, administrator of Wisconsin Tourism Development, who said he expected spending by visitors in the state this summer to match or surpass last year's increase of 18 percent.
But elsewhere, the story is mostly negative:
* In Washington, visitors to the monuments along the Mall are scarcer this year. Sales of hot dogs and snacks at the dozen stands operated by Guest Services Inc., were down 17 percent last summer and are slipping again this year. The Smithsonian Institution's Air and Space Museum reported 100,000 fewer visitors in June compared with last year.
* At Colonial Williamsburg, attendance is steady, but hotel occupancy has declined sharply this summer, to 66.9 percent last June from 72.4 percent in June 1989, said Dr. Roy Pearson, director of business research at the College of William and Mary in Williamsburg. ''We seem to be a victim of shorter stays, shorter trips and shorter times on the road,'' he said.
* In the Northeast, where the recession has been centered, nearly all resorts report a bad summer. Visitors are tending to make day trips to Martha's Vineyard, leaving many of its 2,000 hotel and motel rooms vacant. ''In a one-industry economy like the Vineyard, any lack of confidence in consumer spending is deadly; tourism on this island impacts everything,'' said Angeljean Chiaramida, executive director of the Chamber of Commerce. Donald Wilkinson, general manager of Tycoon's, a steak-and-sandwich restaurant in Newport, R.I., said: ''We are just not getting the same amount of tourist cash that we did in years gone by. The droves of people who are coming are just not spending any money. Something like eating out is the first thing to go when people are worried about the economy.''
* In Southern California, attendance at theme parks and similar attractions is weak. The number of visitors is down about 10 percent at Sea World in San Diego and 6 percent at the Hearst Castle at San Simeon. Although attendance by Southern Californians is holding up, park officials say, visits from out of state are off more than 25 percent at Universal Studios in Hollywood and 5 percent at Knotts Berry Farm in Buena Park. Disneyland, which does not disclose attendance figures, is no exception, industry sources say. Like most theme parks, it has recently raised its admission rates, in this case, to $25.50 from $23.50, at a time when a family of four might find itself hard-pressed to spend $200 or more in a day, with meals and souvenirs.
* In the Southwest, the Grand Canyon National Park last month saw the first decline in visitors in a dozen years, to 400,358 from 471,813 a year ago.
* In New York City, hotel occupancy in the first half of the year was down slightly, to 71 percent from 72 percent. The number of visitors taking tours at the United Nations has been about 7 percent below 1989 levels. And the slump on Wall Street has slowed the once booming tourism industry on the eastern end of Long Island.
* The situation in Florida is difficult to gauge because of the openings of the Disney-MGM Studios theme park last year and Universal Studios Florida this summer. Orlando, where both are located, has been booming as a result, and Universal Studios says it has had a ''very solid, very comfortable'' debut since opening June 7. But experts foresee a softening in Orlando this year. In Miami, attendance at both the Miami Seaquarium and the Parrot Jungle was down 3 percent in June from last year.
In certain places, an uptick in foreign tourism, stimulated by the weak dollar, has partly offset lost domestic business. But it has not been nearly enough to compensate.
In the Pacific Northwest, for example, foreign arrivals at Seattle-Tacoma International Airport rose 17 percent in the first half of this year compared with last year, while domestic traffic grew only slightly. Foreign tourism was boosted by the Goodwill Games, which closed in Seattle on Aug. 5, but shops and restaurants on the city's waterfront and at Pike Place Market reported little additional traffic.
Hotel operators say guests are shortening their stays. The average stay is down to 5.3 days from 6.4 days last year at the 114-year-old luxury Black Point Inn in Prouts Neck, Me.
Americans have been taking shorter vacations for the last six years, according to the United States Travel Data Center, a Washington-based nonprofit research organization financed by the travel industry. From 1984 to 1989, the number of weekend vacations (one to three nights, including a Saturday) climbed 28 percent, chiefly because young, two-career couples began taking shorter but more frequent breaks.
Until two years ago, the number of longer vacations (10 or more nights) had been holding steady at 50 million a year, the center found, with a small decline in the last two years. Although the center will not have comprehensive statistics on travel this summer until later in the year, tourism officials are saying that the decline in long trips is accelerating this summer.
The $40 billion California tourism industry has been particularly hard hit in the current slump. The premiere destination, San Francisco, still suffering the aftereffects of last October's earthquake, finds its troubles compounded by the national economic malaise. Moreover, the state is facing greater competition from Florida and other states and a deteriorating reputation.
 
Fears About a Bad Reputation
''I know they're getting stories about California in the rest of the country, about water being a problem, that you can't take showers in hotels, earthquakes, fires, gangs, freeway problems,'' said William R. Kramer, manager of visitor services at Hearst Castle. ''It seems California is just not the place to go right now.''
The economic slump hits especially hard here in San Diego, where a building boom has nearly doubled the number of hotel rooms, to about 42,000.
''We've hardly ever had an experience with things being down,'' said Al Reese, spokesman for the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau.
The San Diego Princess Resort, a 450-room complex on Mission Bay, has had to boost its advertising budget $150,000, or 67 percent, just to stay even. ''A few years ago, we really did not have to advertise,'' said the general manager, Thomas C. Vincent 4th, also president of the San Diego County Hotel-Motel Association.
The indications are for slow conditions over the remainder of the summer, here and elsewhere. Said C. Lance Barnett, chief economist at the California Department of Commerce: ''People are feeling pinched, so they're inclined to go camping, visit Grandma, do more driving than flying.''

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Few Approach Starting Gates For 1992 Presidential Stakes

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
In the world of presidential politics, nothing much is happening in Panora, Iowa, these days, or Lansing, Mich., for that matter. And that is big news. After more than a decade of complaints that the American process for selecting its presidents had become too long, too grueling and too expensive, it can be announced here today that the 1992 race for President will be shorter.
In fact, it already is shorter. But it may be even more expensive.
Go back for a moment to four years ago today, Aug. 12, 1986. 
Bruce E. Babbitt had finished a seven-day bicycle trip across Iowa. George Bush, Pat Robertson and Jack F. Kemp were arguing over who had done best in the Republican precinct elections in Michigan, the first step in that state's seemingly endless process for selecting convention delegates. Gary Hart had laid out his vision of American foreign policy in a series of speeches.
 
No-Shows at Iowa Bike Ride
Now return to presidential politics, 1990. ''It's pretty dead,'' said David Yepsen, political correspondent for The Des Moines Register. Mr. Yepsen reports that not a single national political figure was seen pedaling the state recently in The Register's annual cross-Iowa bike ride (Mr. Babbitt instead got his exercise this summer walking in the mountains of Brazil studying environmental problems).
The absence of presidential activity in the Republican Party is, of course, easy enough to explain. The Republicans, despite some grumbling from the right, already know who their 1992 nominee will be. But what about the Democrats? Wounded or Wiser? Some Democrats worry that the dearth of clear presidential contenders reflects a loss of will, a delayed shock from the concussion of the 1988 defeat or an unwillingess to challenge George Bush, whose public approval ratings soared to 72 percent in a New York Times Poll taken after Iraqis invaded Kuwait.
But intimidation, always a potent political force, cannot by itself explain this. After all, Walter F. Mondale, Gary Hart, John Glenn, Ernest F. Hollings and Alan Cranston, to name a few, were all publicly maneuvering in 1982 for the 1984 Democratic nomination. It is unlikely that any of them thought President Reagan, the 1982 recession notwith-standing, would be a pushover.
So what other forces are at work? ''I've been expecting this call,'' Senator Al Gore, a 1988 Democratic presidential contender, said by phone from Tennessee, where he was campaigning for re-election to the Senate. ''Because four years ago you were all writing stories about how terrible it was that the presidential campaign was starting so early. I'm sure the reason for the dearth of candidates at this stage in the 1992 cycle is that everyone took those stories to heart.''
That theory may be an ego boost to political reporters, but if Mr. Gore's assesment is correct, then why has the press not had the same influence on politicians when it comes to, say, eliminating the Federal deficit?
''That's a good question; I'd prefer to revise and extend my remarks,'' replied Mr. Gore, invoking the senatorial privilege of keeping the record open until he figures out just what to say.
 
Making the First Move
In a different way, though, Senator Gore is an illustration of one reality that has slowed down the presidential race. He is among several potential Democratic contenders who are up for re-election this fall. Among the others are Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York and Senators Bill Bradley, Paul Simon and Sam Nunn, to say nothing of the House majority leader, Richard A. Gephardt, whose promise to his colleagues not to run in 1992 is viewed as easily revised.
These elections may be keeping anxious contenders off the presidential trail. But they also provide cover for those who do not want to get out in the lead too fast. Under the guise of his Senate campaign, for example, Mr. Bradley is raising millions of dollars more than he needs for re-election in his New Jersey campaign.
These potential candidates all keep a close eye on each other. But as long as no one gets out front there is less pressure for any of them to start running.
The slow start also reflects a rethinking of the importance of Iowa, which, after all, is where much of that early time was invested, in visits to pig farms and church breakfasts.
 
Iowa Dims
''The Iowa star has begun to crash,'' said Mr. Babbitt. His legwork in the state got him nowhere, but even those who won in Iowa, Mr. Gephardt and Senator Bob Dole, fizzled soon after. The winners of the nomination, George Bush and Michael S. Dukakis, each finished third in Iowa.
Moreover, the Democrats seem serious in their desire to move up the California primary to just after the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary. That, said Mr. Babbitt, would overshadow Iowa and change the whole nature of the contest. Early organizing and county-by-county campaigning, of the sort that helped Jimmy Carter win the nomination, would fade, said Mr. Babbitt, and be replaced by a search for money to buy television time in California.
''The Bruce Babbitt candidates are going to have a much tougher time in this kind of race,'' said Mr. Babbitt. ''The entry price in the 1988 Iowa/ New Hampshire cycle was a couple of million dollars. To be a serious candidate in 1992, I'm afraid the entry price is 10 million dollars.''
So the old definition of how a Presidential campaign starts - a visit to Panora, or Waterloo or Ames - may need revising. The decline of Iowa and the ascendancy of California make two things paramount, said Mr. Babbitt. ''One is staking out political positions in opposition,'' said Mr. Babbitt. ''That's what Cuomo is doing. The other is raising money. That's what Bill Bradley is, transparently, doing.''
 
Signs of Being on the Run
Does that mean the campaign is already under way, just not in the way we are used to?
Considered that way, there are these other whistlestops. Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas will give a series of Senate speeches in September on how Republican economic policies, in his view, have hurt the country. Senator Nunn, an opponent of abortion, says he is rethinking his position. And, of course, Jesse Jackson is not running for mayor of Washington.
There are also still those who believe the best way, or at least the cheapest way, to get attention in California is to win in Iowa. No one is yet out organizing in the state like in the old days. In any case, Iowans are pretty preoccupied with state races.
But a visit to campaign for one of those state candidates is still a good way to build goodwill - and set up some national speculation. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia was out a few weeks ago. Senator Bradley is going next weekend.
 
A Grateful Party Leader
Mr. Jackson has alread visited Iowa twice this year, and his chief delegate counter in 1988, Steve Cobble, has moved to Grinnell. That has all the look of the old get-to-Iowa-early style of campaign. But Mr. Cobble insists the move was personal, although he volunteers that Iowa might not be a bad place to be when 1992 rolls around.
The Democratic national chairman, Ronald H. Brown, says he is happy with the current situation. ''There are national Democrats giving serious consideration to mounting a presidential campaign and beginning to put the pieces in place to do that,'' Mr. Brown said.
Both the party and the country, he said, should be grateful it is taking them longer than it took their predecessors to go public. ''I think it is a good thing that we don't have a field of announced candidates,'' said Mr. Brown. ''I think the public can't take three-year presidential races. They get bored. Candidates get stale. No other democracy in the world does it that way. In most other democracies a presidential campaign is two or three months at most.''
By this time next year there will be plenty of Democratic candidates out running for President. There will be so many, Mr. Brown said, that he will probably wish there were fewer.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
BUSH ORDERS NAVY TO HALT ALL SHIPMENTS OF IRAQ'S OIL AND ALMOST ALL ITS IMPORTS

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
President Bush ordered the United States military today to block exports of Iraqi oil and all imports to Iraq except some food shipments, Administration officials said. The blockade would fulfill the President's threat to halt Iraqi commerce.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney and other top national security officials immediately began preparing specific orders to the Navy for carrying out the action, which Administration officials avoided calling a blockade.
The order to halt all ships involved in Iraqi commerce came as President Saddam Hussein of Iraq suggested that he might withdraw his forces from Kuwait if Israel first withdrew from the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip and if Syria pulled its soldiers out of Lebanon. Washington and Israel dismissed such a deal. 
 
Iraqis Asked to Cut Back
Predicting that ''the spark of war, if started, will burn many,'' Mr. Hussein had earlier asked Iraqis to cut their food consumption drastically in anticipation of a long standoff with American, Arab and European forces in the Saudi desert. [Excerpts from Mr. Hussein's address, page A8.] A senior Bush Administration official said the United States calculated that Iraq would begin to feel the effects of economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations in a month, but that it would take three or four months for the measures to bite deeply.
In London, the British Government said today that a British businessman was shot to death by Iraqi soldiers as he tried to flee Iraq and enter Saudi Arabia, The Associated Press reported. It was the first official report of a Westerner being killed by Iraqi troops in Kuwait.
 
Citing a Kuwaiti Request
In authorizing the first American naval blockade since the Vietnam War, Mr. Bush did not wait for the United Nations to take further action to enforce the sanctions it imposed on Iraq last week. But Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said the Administration was responding to a request submitted today by the exiled Emir of Kuwait, and that this would satisfy the requirements of the United Nations Charter. [Transcript of White House statement, page A11.] The White House said it would coordinate the naval action, which will primarily involve shipping in the Persian Gulf and Red Sea, with other nations that have deployed ships near the Arabian Peninsula. It was not immediately clear whether any of the other nations would help intercept vessels that may try to run the blockade.
 
Awaiting a Challenge
The United States was keeping careful watch on the Alqadisiyah, an empty Iraqi tanker at Yanbu, the Red Sea terminus of a pipeline carrying Iraqi oil across Saudi Arabia. But it was not clear when or if the tanker would be loaded and attempt to leave, and thus test the blockade.
The blockade would apply to all ships that might try to trade with Iraq or Iraqi-occupied Kuwait. But Administration officials said today that the trade embargo was generally being observed, and that only a small number of Iraqi ships were being actively monitored.
A State Department official said there were no plans now to intercept air traffic with Iraq, in part because oil is too bulky to be shipped by air in significant quantities. For other products, American officials are relying on the international sanctions imposed by the United Nations.
As in 1962, when the United States called the halting of Soviet missile shipments to Cuba with naval forces a ''quarantine,'' the Bush Administration avoided using the term blockade to describe its actions.
Apart from avoiding the connotation of an act of war, officials said, the careful phrasing might be intended to sidestep the question of whether the United States needs a new vote by the United Nations Security Council authorizing the halting of Iraqi shipments.
Administration officials said they hoped the mere threat of a blockade would prevent any shippers from violating the United Nations economic sanctions.
Some American military planners said they were told to make arrangements for a stay in Saudi Arabia that could last six months or even more. United States military forces in Saudi Arabia are now said to total around 10,000, the spearhead of a multinational force arrayed against an Iraqi force in Kuwait and southern Iraq that Mr. Cheney estimated today at more than 200,000 men.
 
Troop Projections Vague
Appearing on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' Mr. Cheney declined to say how many troops the United States might eventually deploy in Saudi Arabia. Pentagon officials have said they are planning a ground force in the range of 100,000 and that the precise size will depend on Iraqi military preparations. The Administration has offered no public estimate, but contingency plans have been made for a force that could exceed 200,000.
Although their primary task has been described as protecting Saudi air bases where American planes are stationed, a military official said the American troops had started running patrols around the oil fields and refineries near the Dhahran air base, where they are encamped. The American force took its first casualty today, an Air Force sergeant who was reported to have been killed in an accident in Saudi Arabia.
News reports from the region quoted an Iraqi Government spokesman as saying that the authorities had been instructed to ''facilitate the travel of the Arabs and foreign residents in Kuwait and other cities of southern Iraq.''
The announcement suggested that more than one million foreigners trapped in Kuwait and Iraq, including about 3,500 Americans, might be allowed to leave. But a State Department official said the United States had no knowledge of Americans being allowed to leave either country.
Mr. Bush told reporters today at his vacation retreat in Kennebunkport, Me., that the naval quarantine was being conducted in accordance with the United Nations sanctions. Administration officials pointed out that they received the request for aid in enforcing the United Nations embargo today from Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait, who has taken refuge in Saudi Arabia since Iraq invaded his country on Aug. 2.
Mr. Baker, appearing on the ABC News program ''This Week,'' said the request gave the United States legal authority to institute what he called ''interdiction'' of Iraqi oil shipments under the United Nations Charter.
In a written statement issued in Kennebunkport, Marlin Fitzwater, the President's spokesman, cited Article 51 of the Charter, which permits United Nations members to take individual or collective action in self-defense while the Security Council is considering measures of its own.
 
Requests to Other Nations
Mr. Fitzwater said Kuwait had also asked some of the other nations with ships in the region, which include Britain and France, to ''take appropriate steps'' to enforce the United Nations sanctions and that Washington would coordinate its actions with those countries. Throughout the gulf crisis, the United States has sought broad international support for its military moves.
Mr. Baker said the blockade would begin ''almost instantly.''
The Saudi Government could prevent the shipment of any Iraqi oil from Yanbu by refusing to load the oil that flows into the port via the pipeline through the Saudi desert. The Turkish Government has already taken such action at Mediterranean ports.
 
Saudi Pipeline Still Open
Saudi Arabia has not yet cut off the flow of Iraqi oil through its pipeline, but it is expected to do so once the United States marshals an adequate force on its territory.
During the television interview, Mr. Baker focused primarily on the interception of oil shipments from Iraq. The effort seeks to cut off Mr. Hussein's sole source of funds for replenishing a national treasury drained not only by this military exercise, but by eight years of war with Iran.
But Mr. Baker told reporters later that the embargo would go ''beyond just oil.'' Another senior official said the net would be ''very complete,'' suggesting that it would apply to imports of food and other supplies to Iraq beyond the small, strictly humanitarian shipments provided for by the United Nations sanctions.
During a round of golf in Kennebunkport, Mr. Bush was asked if the halt in Iraqi commerce would apply to food and other supplies as well as oil. He replied: ''Just watch. Everything.''
Mr. Baker declined to say what actions United States forces would be authorized to take to stop vessels involved in trade with Iraq.
Norman Polmar, the author of several books on naval warfare, said blockades normally are enforced by sending a small warship, like a frigate, alongside a merchant ship. The warship's crew signals the vessel to stop and then lowers boats to approach it.

In Canada's Big Sky Country, Eyes Turn South

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: COUTTS, Alberta

 BODY:
The bearded trucker finishing his pancakes at the Hillview Cafe called himself Big Dog, his call-sign on the citizen's band radio as he takes oil pipes, produce and other loads from Texas, Oklahoma and California into Canada.
''If you can't run with the big dogs, stay on the porch,'' he said, with the grin of a man with a 600-horsepower rig powerful enough to make the running on many a lonely highway.
Big Dog is a 45-year-old Albertan, and the topic of the moment was one much debated: whether the oil, wheat and cattle country of Alberta, and perhaps other parts of western Canada, should eventually become part of the United States.
The issue has been around since Alberta joined the Canadian confederation in 1905, but it has regained some limited momentum lately from the renewed push for independence in Quebec, whose French-speaking separatists are about as popular among conservative Albertans as wheat blight or cattle disease. Opposes Union With U.S. In a survey conducted in June for Maclean's, Canada's weekly newsmagazine, only 18 percent of the 1,000 Canadians questioned favored Canada and the United States becoming a single country, against 81 percent opposed. Soon after the survey, a constitutional deal that would have cemented Quebec's ties to the rest of the country collapsed, reigniting separatism in the province. 
With his degree in English literature, and loads that have taken him to every part of Canada in his 25 years on the road, Big Dog claimed to have a broader sense of the country than many of his fellow truckers.
His choice not to give his real name appeared to be based mainly on a concern to escape unwanted connections from his past. But he said the resurgence of Quebec nationalism seemed like a good moment to look afresh at the American option.
''We didn't do the right thing historically; we should have shipped them back to France right away,'' he said, speaking of the French-speaking inhabitants of Quebec who remained after France ceded the territory to Britain in 1763. ''Right now, I think it would be good for them to separate, so that the rest of us can freely join with the United States.''
 
Canada's Deep South
Indistinguishable physically from the flatlands of Montana that lie just across the 49th parallel from this tiny border town, this part of Alberta is often known as Canada's Deep South.
Among admirers, similarities are found in a baseball-hat culture impatient of fashion and pretension. Among detractors, the likeness lies in the region's reputation for prickliness toward those who challenge old established ways: the Indians from the reservations that lie close to many towns and the French Canadians who want to break up the country.
But for the accidents of history, the area might long since have been American. A roadside plaque at Milk River, Alberta, just north of here, reminds travelers that the region was part of the lands purchased from France in 1803 under the Lousiana Purchase, and that it remained part of the United States until 1818. It then reverted to Britain under the accord that made the 49th parallel the northern border of the United States across the Great Plains.
Ever since, the pull of geography and economics has had Albertans looking south. If you live in Coutts, or in Whiskey Gap, or in any of the Canadian communities that dot the Big Sky landscape, you are as likely to do your shopping in Sundance or Sweetgrass, Mont., as in Canadian stores that charge nearly twice as much for a six-pack of Canadian beer.
 
The American Connection
If you are a farmer, you may sell or buy your hay in the United States, or take your combine south in the spring or late autumn to join in harvesting American crops. You or somebody in your family may be an American, or have American forebears, since much of the land was settled by migrants from the American plains.
And what happens 2,000 miles away in eastern Canada is not likely to engage much of your sympathy. What sociologists call ''western alienation'' has a long history in Alberta, shored up by the eastern-dominated governments in Ottawa that have manipulated rail freight, oil prices and other levers in a way designed to benefit industries in Ontario and Quebec.
As for official bilingualism - the promotion of French as an equal language with English across the country - and its greatest champion, former Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau, the mention of them is likely to prompt derisive snorts. After Quebec set out in the 1970's to limit the uses of English in the province, whatever constituency there was for bilingualism shriveled.
''There shouldn't be a double standard, and if there is, well, look out,'' said Grant Shearer, a 32-year-old Coutts residents who has been a bull rider in rodeos, a truck driver and a customs broker. ''Where Quebec is concerned, the attitude around here is sort of a 'Let them freeze in the dark' kind of thing.''
 
Confederation Preferred
Still, even here, the views of a Big Dog, or of others in the area who expressed a preference for joining with the United States, take second place to those who would sooner see the Canadian confederation reformed. A western-based populist movement, the Reform Party, has widespread support, and federal leaders in Ottawa have begun to pay greater attention to western concerns.
''Join the States?'' said Lynn Sommerfeldt, a 53-year-old cattle farmer who works a 2,500-head ranch at Whiskey Gap, a thriving town that shrank to a dot on the map when the grain elevators closed in the 1960's. ''I hear that all the time, but I wouldn't like to see it. No, I'm a Canadian, and I appreciate Canada.''
Mr. Sommerfeldt's conversation is rich with tales of the villainy fostered by the proximity of the United States border, which runs across open fields, without so much as a fence to mark it. In the 1920's, whisky-running was the game; more recently, the Mounties have increased patrols against drug shipments that pass north and south.
 
Heavy Rains This Year
When a visitor arrived, Mr. Sommerfeldt was busy repairing his hay baler, little used in recent years as Canada's prairie provinces have suffered through a protracted drought. This year, though, there have been heavy rains, lifting farmers' spirits even as the rest of the country has been plunged into gloom over the prospect of a split with Quebec.
Asked about the country's political problems, Mr. Sommerfeldt wiped the grease from the hay baler from his hands, and said that he'd followed the dramas over Quebec on television, and concluded that the problem lay in misunderstanding.
''We haven't been down there, and they haven't been down here,'' he said. ''That's a big part of your problem, right there.''
He quickly reverted to his subject of choice, the rain. ''You should come out there with me,'' he said, gesturing across a green horizon. ''Honest to God, you can't even see the calves' heads, the grass is so high!''

HEADLINE: Bishop Warns That Corruption Could 'Sink' Kenya

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Aug. 12

 BODY:
In an unusually broad attack on corruption, a prominent church leader charged Saturday that misuse of power for economic gain had become the norm among Government officials.
The issue had until recently been treated rather gingerly in public. But the Archbishop of the Church Province of Kenya, the Rev. Manasses Kuria, told an Anglican congregation that the situation had become so bad that the ''organs of state machinery'' were seizing property from ordinary people.
''Unless God rescues Kenya, we shall sink,'' said the Archbishop, who until the last few months of political upheaval here had been reserved in his remarks about the Government. Corruption has become ''institutionalized,'' he said, echoing a complaint of foreign investors here. 
The Archbishop's admonition came as an Anglican bishop declared his financial wealth - mainly land acquired through a $32,000 loan from the church - and called on all public and church officials to do the same.
Church leaders have been at the forefront of the campaign for a more open political system in Kenya. The country's President, Daniel arap Moi, is one of the few remaining major leaders south of the Sahara who still adamantly oppose a multiparty system.
Three prominent politicians who called for a multiparty system have been detained without charges for more than a month. The crackdown in July attracted more international attention when Gibson Kamau Kuria, a human-rights lawyer representing two ministers who were detained, sought refuge in the United States Embassy here. Washington eventually negotiated his departure from the country.
Four people have been charged with trying to bring down the Government. In court hearings last week, they complained of inhuman jail conditions. The Government freed four lawyers who had been held without charges.
Churchmen, the one group of critics unscathed by the Moi Government's crackdown, are looking for ways to keep up the pressure on officials, people familiar with their strategy say.
They have added a cleanup of Government corruption to the church's other political demands - the dissolution of Parliament, new elections with candidates from numerous political parties, and a limit on the number of terms allowed a president.
Instead of opening the door to a multiparty political system, Mr. Moi appointed a commission to study possible reforms in Kenya's sole political party, the Kenya African National Union.
The commission, headed by Vice President George Saitoti, has been traveling around the country to hear suggestions for change from party members as well as critics. Last week corruption became an open topic of discussion. At one session, a cabinet member and a local party chairman whose names were not disclosed were accused of taking thousands of acres of land for themselves.
 
Reports of Property Seized
Three residents of the Embu district told the commission that the minister and party officials had seized land that had been set aside for people without property by Kenya's former president, Jomo Kenyatta.
Such outspokenness, especially before a public body, has been unusual in Kenya in recent years. The commission is to submit a draft proposal to Mr. Moi on possible reforms in the Kenya African National Union by Aug. 31.
In another sign that the question of official corruption is coming to the fore, The Sunday Standard newspaper published a long article today on its investigations into land dealings by a former cabinet minister and two serving senior public servants.
The World Bank and the United States Government have said that official corruption is hindering economic development here.
The testimony and complaints to the commission have raised expectations. The question now is whether the limited reforms that the commission and Mr. Moi are expected to approve - the reintroduction of secret ballots in primary elections and an end to expulsions of members from the party -will satisfy the pressures for accountability and for an open political system.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
And Now the 'B Word' (Do Not Say Blockade)

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The Bush Administration's reluctance to call the blocking of Iraqi commerce on the high seas a naval blockade apparently reflects legal and political concerns about using a word associated with declared wars.
Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said today that, in view of a request by the exiled Government of Kuwait, the United States had the legal right to stop oil exports. But Mr. Baker, in a television interview, added, ''Let's not use the word blockade.'' 
Instead, he said in an appearance on the ABC News program ''This Week''that the proper word to describe what the United States Navy had been ordered to do was ''interdiction.''
A Defense Department legal expert said, ''You would not normally implement a blockade without there being a state of war.'' A State Department official said, ''The lawyers tell us the word 'interdiction' is more accurate'' than ''blockade.''
 
U.N. Action Cited
As justification for the naval operation, Mr. Baker cited Kuwait's formal request for a United Nations economic embargo on Iraq and Article 51 of the United Nations Charter, which accords countries the right to defend themselves as well as the right to request assistance from other countries when they come under attack. Legal scholars say the United Nations resolution calling for an embargo could reasonably be interpreted as authorizing this naval action.
Marlin Fitzwater, President Bush's spokesman, said the United States would coordinate the operation with allied nations.
To the layman, the military blocking of a nation's coastline is a blockade. But governments often avoid calling it one. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, for example, characterized Britain's naval blockade of Argentine waters during the war over the Falkland Islands in 1982 as creating an ''exclusion zone.''
 
The 'Quarantine' of Cuba'
Arthur Schlesinger Jr., the historian and adviser to President John F. Kennedy, said the Kennedy Administration deliberately chose its word - ''quarantine'' - when it decided to stop Soviet ships and block the entry of offensive weapons into Cuba during the Cuban missile crisis in 1962.
The definition of the word in texts that describe well-established international law is an act of war carried out by warships of a belligerent, detailed to prevent access to or departure from a defined part of the enemy's coast. Technically, a blockade can only be instituted by a government at war.
But that definition is in a state of flux, according to many legal scholars.
''Since the Cuban missile crisis, the law has been in evolution, so stopping ships may no longer be an act of war,'' said Richard N. Gardner, a professor of international law at Columbia University. '' 'Blockade' is a word that has these traditional connotations, so they are wisely using other phrases that are less inflamatory.''
 
'There Could Be War'
But he added, ''If the country whose ships are stopped considers it an act of war, then there could be war.''
As the Bush Administration attempts to deter an attack on Saudi Arabia, roll back the invasion of Kuwait and protect the lives of thousands of American citizens who are trapped in Iraq and Kuwait, its officials are choosing their words with extreme care.
The word ''hostage'' has been stricken from the Administration's vocabulary to describe even the 38 Americans held under armed guard in a Baghdad hotel. Administration officials say that what some are now calling ''the H word'' might further incite President Saddam Hussein of Iraq and make it more difficult to negotiate their release.

Proposals by Iraqi President: Excerpts From His Address

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: ICOSIA, Cyprus, Aug. 12

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the address on the Persian Gulf crisis made by President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, carried by Baghdad radio and the official Iraqi News Agency and translated from Arabic by The Associated Press:
In an attempt on our part to create a peaceful atmosphere in the region and place the region in a stable situation and in order to reveal America and its ally the monster Israel and its small allies, and their crimes against the nation, we have decided to propose the following initiative.
The United States has tried to cover its moves against humanity and the people of this region by pretending that the economic sanctions against Iraq are to protest the aid given by Iraq to the people of Kuwait, who have saved themselves from the rule of the Sabah family.
I propose that all cases of occupation, and those cases that have been portrayed as occupation, in the region, be resolved simultaneouly and on the same principles and basis that should be laid down by the Security Council, as follows:
Preparation for an immediate and unconditional Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab lands in Palestine, Syria and Lebanon; a Syrian withdrawal from Lebanon; mutual withdrawals by Iraq and Iran and arrangement for the situation in Kuwait. 
All military withdrawals and all related political arrangements should take into consideration Iraq's historical territorial rights and guarantee the Kuwaiti people's right to decide on their future.
 
U.N. Resolutions Backed
The basis of the program should be all United Nations and Security Council resolutions, both to arrive at the earliest possible solution and to apply the same action taken by the Security Council against Iraq on any party that does not comply with these arrangements and answer to them.
In order to reveal the facts to the world public opinion, to judge them according to objective conditions, away from American wishes and pressure, we call for the immediate withdrawal of American forces and all other forces that responded to this plot from Saudi Arabia, to be replaced by an Arab force, whose duties, nationality, size and area of deployment should be determined by the Security Council aided by the Secretary General of the United Nations.
In deciding the nationality of these forces, they should not include any troops from Egypt, which is being used by the United States as a cornerstone in its conspiracies against the Arabs. There should be an immediate freeze of all boycott and siege decisions, and matters should go back to normal in economic, political and scientific dealings between Iraq and the world, or these sanctions should be imposed on any party refusing to comply and respond to the conditions stated above.
Should the United States, its allies and its agents fail to respond to our initiative, then we as the people of Iraq along with our brethren in the Arab world will resist its evil intentions and aggressive schemes. We will fight America's evil plans, with help from the good people of our Arab nation and our great Iraqi people, and we will be victorious with God's help. The evil-doers will regret their acts when they are driven out in shame from the region.

HEADLINE: Confrontation in the Gulf;
Oil Crisis Like 1973's? It's Not Necessarily So <

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The jump in oil prices and drop in supplies stemming from Iraq's invasion of Kuwait will do far less damage to the world's economy than did the 1973 and 1979 oil shocks, economists and energy experts say.
Economists say that barring an escalation of the gulf crisis, the global economy will adapt to the higher oil prices, both because they are less than in the previous oil shocks and because many countries have systematically reduced their reliance on petroleum.
Nevertheless, if the gulf crisis worsens dramatically and disrupts a substantially larger part of the Middle East's oil exports, through the bombing, for instance, of Saudi oilfields, then world oil prices could skyrocket well above $50 a barrel, sending the world economy into a tailspin.
The industrial countries' oil bill will rise about $90 billion a year if oil goes to $30 a barrel. That sounds immense, but it will be far easier to handle than the increased oil bills of the 1970's because it represents just six-tenths of 1 percent of the industrial world's economic output. The additional oil bills from the 1970's shocks represented 2 percent of economic output. 
The United States, Europe and Japan have established large emergency stocks of oil and have set up a system of cooperative procedures, including potential measures to cut demand.
''We have been able to learn lessons from the previous crises,'' said Joseph Stanislaw, managing director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates in England. ''The potential for governments to have coordinated actions is now much better than 10 years ago.''
The governments of the industrial world have about a billion barrels of oil in their emergency reserves, which represents 250 days of Iraqi and Kuwaiti exports.
What is more, the ability of the industrial world's governments to draw on their emergency reserves, which are far larger than in the 1970's, can help prevent astronomical price leaps.
''It is not necessary to let the price rush upward if we very quickly adopt a policy of releasing stocks in a gradual manner,'' said Robert Mabro, director of the Oxford Institute for Energy Research in England.
 
Lessons From Earlier Crises
Another factor that could mitigate the damage from an oil price increase, economists say, is the lesson that finance officials and central bankers learned from previous oil shocks. This could help them prevent an oil price rise from producing an unmanageable inflationary spiral.
In many countries, after governments did not move in time to prevent the 1973 and 1979 shocks from causing inflationary spirals, they clamped down on prices and pushed their nations into deep recessions.
''The simple lesson is that if you have an energy price hike, you have to limit the inflationary damage to the rest of the economy as best you can,'' said Michel Develle, chief economist for Banque Paribas in Paris.
World oil demand is rising only slowly nowadays, and this will make it easier for nations to absorb a shortage. Demand is climbing 2 percent a year, compared with 5 percent in 1979, when economic growth was strong. ''The softer is demand, the less likely that oil price increases will stick,'' said Allen Sinai, an economic adviser to the Boston Company.
Many economists and petroleum experts predict oil prices will stay in the $22 to $28 range over the next few months, assuming that other producers make up for much of the Iraqi and Kuwaiti oil, as they have promised to do, and assuming that the gulf crisis does not intensify.
If the projected shortage of four million barrels a day is not significantly reduced, then prices could rise to $30 or more per barrel, many oil analysts say.
Although most economists say the industrial world is less vulnerable to oil shocks, the recent oil price increase is expected to help push the already-weak United States economy into recession. ''A $5 increase will bring the U.S. very close to a recession if not into a brief recession,'' said Roger Brinner, chief economist for DRI, an economic consulting company. ''A $10-a-barrel increase would certainly bring the U.S. into a classic recession.''
The International Energy Agency, a Paris-based group of oil-importing nations, has coordinated the West's efforts to react to an oil shock and to keep demand for balance in balance with supply. For example, it has encouraged countries to build power plants that use other fuels as well as plants that can switch from oil to other fuels.
Mr. Stanislaw, the Cambridge Energy Research official, says that the industrial world could cut demand for oil by 700,000 barrels a day simply by having dual-energy plants switch from oil to coal or to natural gas.
Probably the biggest reason why this oil supply disruption will not do as much damage as previous ones is that prices have risen far less, on a percentage basis.
The 1973 Arab oil embargo caused Mideast oil prices to rise from $2.10 a barrel to $10.40. The 1979 shock pushed the price of Mideast light to $31.33 by late 1980, from $13.48 in early 1979.
So far, the Iraqi invasion has caused a far lower percentage jump, about 50 percent, as oil prices have risen to about $25 a barrel from $17. After accounting for inflation, oil at $25 a barrel is actually cheaper than oil was in 1978, before prices soared.
The other major reason why the oil crisis is expected to do limited economic damage is that the industrial world's economy is far less oil intensive. For example, in 1973, the United States used 35-hundredths of a ton of oil for each $1,000 of economic output, compared with 24-hundredths in 1989, a drop of 31 percent.
The change is even greater in Japan, which dropped to 15-hundredths of a ton last year from 33-hundredths of a ton for $1,000 in output in 1973 - a reduction of 55 percent.
Many factors explain the change. One, of course, is conservation. Mileage per gallon for automobiles has doubled since 1973 and many countries have raised gasoline taxes to curb demand.
In Italy, taxes are 75 percent of the price, up from 61 percent in 1980. In the United States, taxes represent 30 percent, up from 11 percent in 1980.
 
Nuclear Power and Coal
Reliance on oil has also been reduced because France and Japan have invested heavily in nuclear power. The United States has looked increasingly to coal.
In addition, the economies of many countries have moved away from energy-intensive industries like metallurgy toward less energy-intensive fields like electronics and finance.
As a result of such developments, in France about 70 percent of the energy came from oil in 1973, while today it is just 40 percent.
Japanese officials estimate that a 10 percent increase for oil will increase the inflation rate by one-tenth of 1 percentage point, while in 1973, a 10 percent rise would have pushed up inflation 10 times as much.
Also of help to Europe and Japan in absorbing higher oil prices is the fact that the dollar is far weaker, which means that their oil imports, which are priced in dollars, are cheaper.
Many economists are optimistic that economic officials will learn from the policy mistakes made in handling the previous oil price shocks. How to Curb Inflation? The economists say some governments did not act strongly enough to stop the inflationary impact of oil price hikes. Other governments are criticized for having fought them too hard, with many economists saying, for example, that Washington and London went overboard and pushed their nations into painful recessions.
France and Italy are most often cited for having not done enough to counter the inflationary effects of oil price increases. After the 1979 oil shock caused price rises throughout the economy, Paris and Rome allowed wages to climb as a way to help workers from losing purchasing power. That caused an inflationary spiral.
''The right approach is to contain the inflationary effects of oil-price hikes,'' said Mr. Sinai of the Boston Company ''That means a one-time and substantial loss of purchasing power for workers.''
Japan, which was battered by the 1973 oil shock, won praise later for the way it handled the 1979 shortage. To prevent huge inflation waves from spreading though the economy, Tokyo pushed for wage restraint and held down monetary supply.

Many Prominent Americans Support the President's Action in the Gulf . . .Resistance to Blatant Aggression, Defense of Allies and, Above All, Oil

 BODY:

Henry Kissinger
 
National security adviser to Richard M. Nixon, 1969-75; Secretary of State, 1973-77. Now chairman of a consulting firm, Kissinger Associates.
The fundamental problem, it seems to me, is that this is the most blatant case of 1930's-style aggression in the entire postwar period. In the middle of peace, without any particular provocation except the desire for more territory, Iraq has annexed Kuwait. If that is permitted to stand it will lead to a whole series of conflicts and revolutions in the region.
I referred to Germany in the 30's and not to Soviet expansionism in the 1950's because the Soviet Union did not actually annex those countries. Rather, it insisted on its right to impose puppet governments on unwilling populations. Saddam Hussein is actually abolishing a state and a dynasty that has ruled Kuwait for 250 years. 
If Saddam Hussein succeeds, in particular on the basis of the arguments he has used -that Iraq has an implicit right to supplant Arab states by military action - all the principalities in the gulf will be put at risk because virtually every country in the area, including Jordan, fits Hussein's criteria for justifying the overthrow of Kuwait, with the possible exception of Egypt.
If Hussein succeeds, a cycle of conflicts in the Middle East is absolutely inevitable, probably culminating in an Arab-Israeli war.
If Saddam Hussein can make his coup stick, in the face of unanimous opposition from the United Nations, a worldwide embargo and a U.S. military deployment, we will enter a period of growing chaos.
 
Edward W. Said
 
The Old Dominion Foundation Professor in the Humanities, Columbia University; a member of the Palestine National Council.
As an Arab and an American, the awful events unfolding in the gulf fill me with dread and sorrow. I have grown up with the spectacle of Arab and American interests in the Middle East for the most part in conflict. My assessment of American interests today as they have been acted apon and spoken about by President Bush now and in the past is that these interests are the unimpeded flow of relatively inexpensive and abundant Arab oil, the compliance of one or several Arab leaders with U.S. interests basically in protecting the flow of oil and not standing in the way of America's other major interest: Israel.
Beyond that, I have felt that the aspirations, the attempt to deal with a difficult historical legacy, the desire to achieve development and independence which have characterized the best of Arab nationalism - all these have never been considered to have entered the pursuit of American interests in the region. It is true that the Arab world today presents a sorry spectacle, with all sorts of inequities, tyrannies and mediocrities to make us all feel ashamed. Saddam is one of the results of the difficulties the Arab world faces - a tyrant and an aggressor, who seems nevertheless to speak to hidden emotions and frustrations in the collective Arab soul.
I am also angered as to why an illegal Iraqi occupation of Kuwait has aroused far more American force and passion than the brutalities and callousness of Israel's 23-year-old occupation of Arab land.
 
John C. West
 
Attorney and Distinguished Professor of Middle East Studies at the University of South Carolina; Governor of South Carolina, 1971-75; Ambassador to Saudi Arabia, 1977-81.
We do have a tremendous economic stake in the Mideast. We cannot afford to have Saddam Hussein or anyone else who is unfriendly to the United States control nearly half of the world's oil supplies. The fact is that we are far more dependent on imported Mideast oil than we want to admit. For example, in 1973, when we had the first oil embargo, we were importing less than 30 per cent of our oil. President Nixon declared Operation Independence, saying we would be free of imported oil in seven years. . . . The crisis ended, Mr. Nixon's plans were shelved, the next crisis came in '79, and at that time we were importing 40 percent of our oil.
In the late 70's, the Congress appropriated $88 billion for alternate energy sources and to meet the problem of dependence upon foreign oil. Again, the crisis ended, and there is at most only one small part of that program still alive.
Today . . . the person who controls half of the world's oil resources determines the world economic outlook, inflation, and whether we have a depression or whether we have prosperity.
The United States has some difficult times ahead. The history of boycotts' working is not good. But the hope must be maintained that the boycott of Iraq, including a shutting off of the oil supplies, will cause Saddam Hussein to retreat. If that does not work, we are faced with a long stalemate with our soldiers and airmen in a combat status in a hostile foreign environment, not unlike Vietnam.
 
Rep. Ted Weiss
 
Democrat of New York, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee.
For those of us who remember World War II, and know how it happened, what Saddam Hussein is doing bears a startling resemblance to how Hitler behaved. There were terrible consequences then, when the international community did not stand up - it just encouraged aggression.
I have had no reluctance whatsoever to speak out against American military action when it was illegal or improper, but I support U.S. policy when it stands up to illegal and improper behavior in other nations. . . . Secondarily, what is happening in the Middle East is important because of the oil - it is of terribly important concern to our economy. . . .
If you allow someone like Saddam Hussein to get a stranglehold on oil production, it gives him control of our economy. The price of oil operates on the basis of availability.
If you give that kind of control to a person such as Saddam Hussein, who is very, very ruthless, the consequences would be very, very dire.
I've been touting Saudi Arabia as a moderate force in the region, one we had the capacity to rely on, so it is nice to know that in fact, they are willing to let us help them defend themselves. . . .
Also, the crisis demonstrated that when Israel expresses its concern for its security, it is not being paranoid. There are nations surrounding her which are in fact very aggressive and very powerful. The safety and security of Israel has to be one of the top priorities for Israel and to her friends.
 
Rep. Patricia Schroeder
 
Democrat of Colorado and a member of the House Armed Services Committee.
Basically, our main interest in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait comes down to a three-letter word, oil. It is oil, oil and oil. Regrettably, we have diverted all our attention away from an energy program, and alternate sources of energy. We don't seem to have any capacity as a nation to think long-term: anyone who looked at the region could tell it has not gotten any more stable, and we certainly know the entire industrialized world relies heavily on oil. The world economy is quirky enough without a massive oil shock.
That's why we didn't have time to play around in dealing with this crisis. . . . Saddam Hussein had to be told that if he crossed the border into Saudi Arabia, he would be picking a fight with a force that is far bigger than just Saudi Arabia. We had to do that to convey our seriousness.
The thing I wish is that we had gone in under a United Nations flag. We did it the last time - reflagging the Kuwaiti tankers. We have become the 911 for the world. This time, we obviously had international support . . . and the Soviets also sided with us. As a military exercise, this is going to be very costly, and I wish we didn't have to bear all of the cost by ourselves.
The tragedy of this is that some will use the crisis to insist that we need an MX missile and a B-2 bomber and S.D.I. If we had spent the billions of dollars those weapons systems cost on building up our energy independence, we would have something to sell to the rest of the world, we would be like Saddam Hussein.
 
Jesse Jackson

My position has been that we must defend our allies, protect our national interests, and contribute to world stability. . . .
Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are our allies and whenever the free passage of traffic in the gulf has been threatened, they have allied with us. In the cold war, they have been our trading partners, and have played a factor in the price stability of petroleum, which affects us and the Western world. They have done things to support us, when we needed it, and they had no place else to go.
Saudi Arabia is more of an asset to us than Grenada was a threat, Kuwait is more of an asset to us than Noriega was a threat. . . .
We went to Saudi Arabia with an invitation, so it was not an invasion as it was in Panama and Grenada. In Panama and Grenada, we violated international law and put in our own governments and the world scorned us for doing so. In this case Hussein broke international law. He said he would not invade, and he did. He said he would withdraw from Kuwait, and then he annexed. And then he began moving toward Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia asked for our help. It seems to me that we were obliged to respond.
Hopefully, our military presence there will serve as a deterrent to Hussein's expansion, and our diplomatic and economic initiatives will be a factor in getting him back to his borders and getting all parties around a table for a negotiated settlement. . . . Our military presence must be temporary, for the longer they are there, the more hostilities they will engender. And that's why we must put at least as much energy into helping the Arab nations' summit succeed, led by Mubarak, as any other tactic.

Why is Saudi Arabia so important? Because it is the largest producer of oil, and the U.S. is becoming increasingly dependent on foreign sources of supply.
Could we survive without Saudi Arabia? Sure. We would find ourselves more subject to the whims of those who control the supply, but the U.S. is a large and powerful country.
Oil prices would be higher, and probably more erratic; there would be conservation, fuel-switching, and there would be a tendency to turn to other sources of supply for oil itself. Even if Venezuela and Mexico could meet the U.S.'s oil needs, they could not compensate for the oil dependence of Europe and Japan. But the U.S. would then lose its position as the leader of the world in the post-cold war atmosphere.
We were right to provide troops in Saudi Arabia as a deterrent to dissuade Iraq from attacking Saudi Arabia. We had a commitment, which has been stated and restated since the late 1970's. . . . For us to stand aside and watch Saudi Arabia be swept away would be the equivalent of standing by and watching Berlin be swept away in the 1940's.
I'm not sure Mr. Bush's political objectives of immediate and total and unequivocal withdrawal of Iraq from Kuwait and the restoration of its legitimate rulers, are achievable. We may have prematurely set our feet in concrete over this.

President Bush basically had no serious option but the one he is pursuing. I think it is very important, however, that he not fall into the habit of talking about this as though this were an American operation. . . . The legitimacy of what the United States is doing depends now on the Security Council resolution. It's a United Nations action; he's got to keep that firmly in the forefront.
Even in the most moderate Arab countries, the Arabs privately have a considerable admiration for Saddam Hussein because they have such contempt for the Kuwaitis, who have been the beneficiaries of enormous wealth and . . . have behaved in an extremely self-indulgent way.
One of the major reasons that the Saudis are not better equipped than they were to resist this aggression is because the American Congress has bowed to the pressure of the Israeli lobby and denied the Saudis the military hardware that they have tried to buy.
While the United States a few years ago was the greatest creditor nation in the world, we are now the greatest debtor nation, and we are able to maintain ourselves in substantial part because of the flow of investment money from the oil-producing countries. . . . Should Saddam Hussein be permitted to roll over on the Saudis, then with his Iraqi-Kuwaiti-Saudi production, he would have a stranglehold on the world oil market - and he would be the last person who would be inclined to use his money to . . . mitigate our position as a debtor.

The vital interest of the United States in Saudi Arabia is oil. With a capital O. Any interest that we have in Kuwait is the same: oil.
When I use the term ''oil,'' I am referring of course to crude oil production. It is the movement of this crude oil to refineries around the world which keeps the wheels of industry humming and the wheels of automobiles turning. Also oil, as the Shah used to say, is a precious commodity, because it provides the basis for a whole series of plastic byproducts as well as petrochemicals of different kinds.
The current crisis in the Middle East indicates once again how important it is for the United States to establish an energy policy. We have made various passes at this difficult activity, but each time whatever crisis has arisen, it has passed over, and the American public has forgotten the vital importance of crude oil to our economy, if not our very existence.
In recent years our import of crude oil has steadily risen until it is now almost 50 percent of our needs. This is a dramatic change from the days when Texas oil dominated the American domestic scene. It is incumbent upon the country - the President and the Congress - to wrestle with this difficult problem of an energy policy. Otherwise the United States, in fact the free world, will become increasingly hostage to unpredictable events in the Persian Gulf area.
 
Bernard Lewis
 
Cleveland E. Dodge Professor of Near Eastern Studies Emeritus at Princeton University.
I can understand the irritation of people who ask why on earth should we get involved with all these difficult and troublesome people in far places. . . . Nevertheless I feel that irritation is misplaced.
It seems to me that there are two major reasons why we should be concerned about the Middle East to the point of doing something about it - and even incurring some risks. The first point is oil, which is necessary not only for this country, which now imports almost half its oil, but also for the free world generally.
There is a real danger that one country, one government, you might almost say one man, would control so large a proportion of the world's oil that he would have power over not only pricing but also supply. He could allocate and price as he chose, and thereby exercise a degree of control which is more than unacceptable - which is positively dangerous.
Ultimately the only way to escape from this dilemma is to escape from oil, which pollutes the sea, the land, the air, politics, the economy, and much else besides.
The second point, which I think is even more important, is that if in this year 1990 a country may simply invade and annex a neighbor while the world merely says tut, tut and does nothing effective about it, then this is the first step to the breakdown of the international order. . . . If we let this pass, we shall be back in the international jungle of the 1930's, and we know where that led.
These comments were elicited in telephone interviews by Eric Pace and Alessandra Stanley.

Transcript of U.S. Statement About Measures Against Iraq

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., Aug. 12

 BODY:
Following is a transcript of the statement on measures to be taken against Iraq made today by President Bush's press secretary, Marlin Fitzwater, as recorded by the Federal News Service, a transcription company:
This morning, the President received a letter from His Highness, Sheik Jaber al-Ahmed al-Sabah, the Emir of Kuwait, requesting on behalf of the Government of Kuwait, and in accordance with Article 51 of the U.N. Charter and the right of individual and collective self-defense, that the United States Government take appropriate steps as necessary to ensure that the U.N.-mandated economic sanctions against Iraq and Kuwait are immediately and effectively implemented.
In view of the Emir's request, the President has decided that the United States will do whatever is necessary to see that relevant U.N. sanctions are enforced. The President stressed that these efforts will complement, not substitute, for individual and collective compliance that has been highly successful thus far. The United States will coordinate its efforts with the governments of other nations to whom the Kuwaiti Government has made similar requests.
Regarding Saddam Hussein's proposals announced today, the United States categorically rejects them. We join the rest of the U.N. Security Council in unanimously calling for the immediate, complete and unconditional withdrawal of Iraqi forces from Kuwait, and the restoration of Kuwait's legitimate Government. These latest conditions and threats are another attempt at distracting from Iraq's isolation and at imposing a new status quo. Iraq continues to act in defiance of U.N. Resolutions 660, 661 and 662, the basis for resolving Iraq's occupation. The United States will continue to pursue the application of those resolutions in all their parts.

HEADLINE: G.M. Strike in Michigan Imperils Industry Talks With Union

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Aug. 12

 BODY:
A four-day-old strike at a General Motors Corporation parts plant in Flint, Mich., is affecting other G.M. plants around the country and is influencing bargaining between the Big Three automakers and the United Automobile Workers union.
Leaders of the U.A.W. have insisted that the walkout by 2,800 assembly workers at the General Motors A.C. Rochester Division plant was undertaken purely over local issues that have been disputed for a year, including charges of unsafe conditions, work speedups and subcontracting of work to non-union companies.
The national contract that expires Sept. 14 allows strikes by individual plants only over such local issues, which are set out in the agreement.
But union leaders and G.M. negotiators are acutely aware that the strike has received the blessing of Stephen Yokich, the U.A.W.'s vice president in charge of relations with G.M., the nation's biggest automaker. The union leadership could presumably have withheld its approval until after a national contract was ratified, as has been the case in previous contract negotiations. 
 
'Sending a Signal to G.M.'
''There's little doubt that Steve is sending a signal to G.M.,'' said a union staff worker who spoke on condition of anonymity.
Mr. Yokich, who took over his post a year ago, is regarded as more confrontational with automotive management than his predecessor, Donald Ephlin. Mr. Yokich is a leading candidate to succeed Owen F. Bieber as U.A.W. president when Mr. Bieber retires some time in the next few years.
Harry C. Katz, a professor of labor relations at Cornell University, said the U.A.W. is trying to assert Mr. Yokich's tougher negotiating style as distinct from that of Mr. Ephlin.
''They want to show management they are not patsies,'' Mr. Katz said. ''It may be helpful in that this will allow the membership to let off a little steam.''
Many believe union members are frustrated with G.M. assurances over job security. The automaker in the past three years has closed several plants after the union thought it had received assurances that there would not be any further closings.
In the national contract talks, the union has earmarked job security as its No. 1 issue, ahead of wage and benefit increases. In recent years, the automakers have been willing to guarantee ''income security'' to laid-off workers, in essence acquiescing to an economic penalty for curtailing operations.
 
Unused Plant Capacity a Problem
G.M., which has much more unused plant capacity than other domestic automakers, has said it must close some plants to remain competitive. Moreover, company executives have recently said G.M. plants that make components, as opposed to those where vehicles are assembled, are a particular problem since many non-union manufacturers have wage scales far lower than G.M.'s.
The union cannot acknowledge that the strike in Flint is part of its national bargaining strategy. Doing so could provide ground for some states to deny employment benefits to workers who are idled as a result of the walkout at the Flint plant, which makes fuel tanks for more than half of the G.M. vehicles built in the United States, among other parts.
Already forced to close because of the Flint walkout are G.M. plants in Moraine, Ohio; Pontiac, Mich.; Shreveport, La., and a second plant in Flint employing 7,000 workers.
G.M. management is widely regarded by labor and automotive experts as having with the most troubled relations with union workers of any automaker. The problems are partly historic and partly a result of the excess capacity of its automaking and parts-making plants, which has caused frequent layoffs and shutdowns. G.M. executives have also aggravated ill will by awarding themselves lavish pay and benefit packages.
Disputes have been particularly bitter in Flint, about 60 miles north of Detroit, which is the birthplace of G.M. and of the U.A.W. Flint has lost about 30,000 of about 70,000 G.M. jobs since the mid-70's.
Part of the agenda of grievances at A.C. Rochester was the company's announcement six months ago that it plans to eliminate the jobs of 600 workers who make doors for various G.M. van models.

World War Long Over, But Not The Battles

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PROVIDENCE, R.I., Aug. 7

 BODY:
Behind a tiny American flag on his office desk, Cliff Wilson, the state commander of the American Legion, talks of Pentagon cutbacks, glasnost and the current Middle East crisis with cool detachment.
But mention Japanese pressure to change the name of a state holiday that will be celebrated Monday from Victory Day or V. J. Day to Peace Day, and the 62-year-old former Navy gunman begins his attack.
''If they were offended when we called it V. J. Day, we were pretty offended when they bombed Pearl Harbor,'' said Mr. Wilson, who is a veteran of World War II. ''Why should we have to pacify them?'' 
President Harry S. Truman proclaimed the holiday to mark Japan's surrender to the Allies on Aug. 15, 1945, and for years Victory Day was celebrated around the nation.
But now Rhode Island, the defiant colony that was the first to declare independence from England, is the only state still celebrating the Japanese surrender, although the state has changed to marking Victory Day on the second Monday in August.
While many Rhode Islanders consider Victory Day just another chance for sunbathing, members of the state's small but economically influential Japanese community say some residents use the holiday as an excuse to cause trouble. A name change, they say, is not just a matter of semantics, but also one of safety.
The Japan Society of Rhode Island says the name Victory Day promotes anti-Asian sentiments, slurs and racially motivated attacks. The cultural society has retained two lawyers to press for a change to a name like Remembrance Day or Peace Day.
''We are just concerned about increasing accounts of anti-Asian violence that have occurred on and around the holiday,'' said Jennifer Wood, a lawyer for the group, which has about 90 private and corporate members. ''Keep the holiday, just change the name.'' She said the society was considering filing a lawsuit against the state.
Hiroko Shikashio, a 47-year-old painter who was born in Japan, said she felt uncomfortable leaving her home in North Providence on Victory Day. ''Because I am Japanese, I have always felt uneasy about going outside on that day,'' she said. ''I think it is nice for people to have a holiday, but they should call it something else.''
Lawmakers here have found themselves straddling two forceful constituencies planted firmly at either end of the debate over a name change.
Rhode Island's 119,000 veterans, more than one-third of whom are World War II veterans, wield substantial influence over public policy decisions, state officials say. More than 100,000 soldiers, or 10 percent of Rhode Island's population, were swept into combat in World War II.
Now in their 60's and 70's, many of the World War II veterans, who have successfully opposed two legislative efforts to change the name of the holiday, contend that the issue is not one of civil rights but of foreign economic interests.
Last year, Japan was Rhode Island's third-largest trading partner, receiving almost $50 million in state exports, up from $34.5 million in 1987. At the same time, Japanese companies have invested about $500 million in Rhode Island, creating hundreds of jobs and helping to strengthen the state's sagging economy.
Kenneth J. Willette, director of the state's Department of Economic Development, insists that the name of the holiday is not the real problem. ''It is the perception that we are the only one that celebrates that raises questions,'' he said.
But local business leaders, many of whom are seeking Japanese investment, are still wary about the name.
''I have tried to get the players together to see if we could come up with a compromise, keeping the holiday without offending anyone,'' said Henry S. Woodbridge Jr., chairman of the Japan-America Society of Rhode Island, a business group that promotes relations between the state and Japan. In addition to sponsoring a summer festival that highlights Japanese culture, the society has suggested that Victory Day be changed to Rhode Island Veterans' Day.
But Mr. Wilson, the American Legion commander, says keeping the holiday name is a matter of principle. ''We can pacify them by calling it Victory Day instead of V. J. Day, he said. ''But we can't go any farther than that. They will have to win the title back.''

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
Bush's Double Gamble

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
If President Bush loses the gamble he took in pledging that Iraq's conquest of Kuwait ''will not stand,'' he might turn out to be a loser in American politics too.
For the moment, polls and every other indication suggest that the Democratic Congress as well as the American people approve of Mr. Bush's determination to oppose Saddam Hussein, even to send troops to Saudi Arabia to guard a prime source of Western oil against any further Iraqi aggression.
Mr. Bush's well-received performance as Commander in Chief also may have allowed him to recover, at least for the time being, from reaction against his broken pledge not to raise taxes, and to rise above a surge of unwelcome economic news.
That's not surprising. Presidents who take military action abroad, particularly if they invoke rhetoric appealing to the overdeveloped American sense of self-regard, always benefit from a rally-round-the-flag effect. Mr. Bush spoke in ringing tones of turning back an aggressor and played on memories of the disastrous failure of other nations to stop Hitler's Germany at the outset. 
Prudently, the President did not picture his defense of Saudi Arabia for what it also is: protection of the oil supplies that fuel Western economies. Americans are not so ready to fight wars for such realistic but unidealistic reasons.
Nor has the word ''Panama'' passed Mr. Bush's lips in the Middle East crisis. But Panama is relevant, for at least two reasons. One is that not a few nations and at least a few Americans regard the U.S. conquest of that country as having been aggression masquerading as ''Operation Just Cause.'' George Bush thinks that's different; that was our aggression, not their aggression.
The second reason is that in Panama, U.S. forces were able to make the hit, quickly win a one-sided battle, and come home before the criticism began to build. So were the forces engaged in Ronald Reagan's glorious victory over Cuban construction workers in Grenada. In the age of television, such hit-and-run wars can be celebrated, since there's no need or time to watch on the home screen as a long parade of body bags comes sadly home.
The Bush Administration, perhaps at the behest of the feudalistic Saudi regime, did not permit a U.S. press pool to accompany the first troops sent to the desert - despite pledges, after Grenada and Panama, not to black out the U.S. public again. That may suggest White House hopes, however vain, for another quick, successful, vote-getting operation.
In the Middle East, that may not be in the cards. Indications are that Saddam Hussein will not invade Saudi Arabia and undertake the war with the U.S. that Mr. Bush's moves make a certain result. But nothing suggests, so far, that Mr. Hussein will pull out of Kuwait and restore the emirate, in effect surrendering to Mr. Bush's public demand.
If the President then tries to throw Iraq out of Kuwait by military force, it will not be a quick or bloodless operation, and it might not even be successful; and the alternative, as it now appears, would be stalemate in the desert - Iraq in Kuwait, the U.S. in Saudi Arabia. As became evident in Korea and Vietnam, however, the American public has little tolerance for long, limited, stalemated wars and the high casualty rate they bring.
If such a stalemate develops, which many military experts and authorities on the region believe likely, Mr. Bush might soon find himself under the severe public pressures to win or settle an unpopular, faraway conflict from which Presidents Truman, Johnson and Nixon suffered during Korea and Vietnam. Those Presidents had international military support; but Mr. Bush may not be able to persuade other nations - save Britain - to keep troops for long in a peacekeeping force in Saudi Arabia.
Meanwhile, tightening oil supplies and rising oil prices might bring both inflation and recession in the United States, a tough combination to overcome for a President seeking Congressional majorities and his own re-election. Thus, the long-term political outlook for Mr. Bush may not be as rosy as his present standing might indicate.
He and his political advisers are well able to make that calculation for themselves; apparently, they went ahead, anyway, with a policy they considered necessary, despite its political hazards. But beyond the line he's drawn in the sand, perhaps George Bush and the nation now can see that it would make more sense to regain independence from Middle East oil than to die for it.

HEADLINE: The Changing City; Woodside, Queens;
New Accents and Old Brogue Quietly Reshape Woodside

SERIES: A periodic look at New York's neighborhoods in transition.

BYLINE: By JOSEPH P. FRIED

 BODY:
Madge O'Boyle stood in front of the apartment building in Woodside, Queens, where she has lived for three decades, since shortly after the Irish native arrived in the United States, and chatted with neighbors on the sun-baked steps.
Across 52d Street, Mike Lin, a native of Taiwan who came to Woodside five years ago, whacked a tennis ball on a handball court in Windmuller Park.
On nearby Roosevelt Avenue, Matilde Ramirez, once of Ecuador, prepared for the day's first patrons at the Colombian restaurant that she and her husband, a Colombian native, have operated for five years.
It was a typical summer day in the streets and parks and shops of Woodside, a largely working-class area of western Queens that has undergone sharp ethnic and cultural changes in recent years. And it has weathered the transformation, New York City officials and area residents say, with little of the trauma, tension or bias-based bellicosity that have too often accompanied such shifts in other areas of the city. 
Two miles long and about a mile and a half wide, Woodside extends from about 48th Street on the west to the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway and Conrail tracks on the east, and from about 30th Avenue on the north to a winding southern line formed by the Long Island Expressway and Maurice and Calamus Avenues. The woods and swamps that dotted the area in the 19th century gave it its name.
From a district once known as ''Irishtown,'' Woodside has evolved into a polyglot of tongues and traditions in which immigrants from Latin America and Asia are now estimated to make up nearly half of the 40,000 residents.
''It's one of the more integrated areas of the city, and in a really positive way,'' said Ted Finkelstein, director of the west-central Queens office of the city's Neighborhood Stabilization Program.
But despite the extensive changes, the Irish seem in no danger of disappearing from the blocks of well-kept private homes and solid apartment buildings that house mechanics, transit workers and office clerks, laboratory technicians, shopkeepers, accountants and lawyers. True, many Irish-Americans did move from Woodside as the newcomers flowed in over the last 15 years.
And, true, some of the Irish did vocally complain a dozen years ago about the many illegal aliens among the Hispanic newcomers - contending that the ''illegals'' were an unfair burden on the community's schools and hospitals, and being accused, in turn, of resenting people from a different culture.
But many other Irish, like 54-year-old Mrs. O'Boyle, saw no reason to pack up and leave.
''I love the neighborhood and I can find no problem with them,'' said Mrs. O'Boyle, the wife of an elevator mechanic.
Many of the newcomers are from Ireland, whose troubled economy has helped spur many young people to head for the cities of America. The result for Woodside has been several thousand ''new Irish'' who, longtime Woodsiders say, are different enough from the ''old Irish'' to add their own distinct flavoring to today's ethnic brew.
''You go into a diner and it doesn't take 10 seconds before you hear the brogue, which you wouldn't have heard around here 10 years ago except occasionally,'' said one of Woodside's old Irish, City Councilman Walter L. McCaffrey. The 41-year-old Democrat, whose parents arrived in the neighborhood in the 1930's, observed that most of the area's old Irish are at least second- or third-generation Americans.
Sean Benson, one of the new Irish, who came to Woodside from County Kildare five years ago, said the latest generation of his countrymen were contributing more than Hibernian tones. With their youth and vigor, he said, they are bringing ''a new freshness, a dynamism, into the neighborhood - into the pubs, the restaurants, opening new businesses themselves.''
For the most part, though, ''the guys work in construction, the women as waitresses or nannies,'' he said. The 29-year-old Mr. Benson, who heads an advice center for Irish newcomers maintained by the Irish Immigration Reform Movement on Roosevelt Avenue, said most of the new Irish are in this country illegally, often having entered on limited tourist visas and staying on when they expired.
 
Paradox Over New 'Illegals'
There is more than a little paradox in this, some Woodsiders acknowledge, considering the resentment by some local Irish in the 70's, when ''illegals'' were all from south of the border.
But paradoxes and legalities apart, Woodside has come through its transmutation pretty smoothly, officials say.
Yet there have been rough moments. In what the police termed a bias-related incident in 1988, a group of Hispanic men, some wielding baseball bats and iron rods, beat several worshipers outside an Islamic mosque, which was then at Queens Boulevard and 50th Street. Congregants said there had been months of harassment.
Last year, two Korean men were assaulted by whites voicing racial slurs in a doughnut shop on Roosevelt Avenue, the area's main commercial strip, said Capt. Ryan Thomas, commander of the 108th Precinct, which covers most of Woodside.
 
'People Are Mostly Friendly'
But such incidents are exceptions, he said. Mostly, Woodside is a solid area of people who ''go to work and come home and seem to have their own place in the community,'' he said.
Residents of various backgrounds agreed.
Pausing from her summer job at a summer school for Korean children, near her 51st Street home, Jung Yoon Choi, 18, who came from South Korea with her family eight years ago, said: ''Sometimes when I'm passing in the street a person might yell out, 'Chink!' But, really, hardly ever. The people are mostly friendly. Those who do it may not even live here.''
The Rev. Sang Il Park, a Woodsider who is pastor of the Korean Presbyterian Church of Southern New York, said that Woodside has ''not at all'' been like the Flatbush section of Brooklyn, where some blacks have been waging a long and venomous boycott against two Korean-owned groceries.
''There will never be an A plus neighborhood, but I give Woodside an A minus,'' he said.
Woodside is ''definitely not a high-crime area,'' Captain Thomas, the precinct commander, said. He acknowledged, however, that many of its residents, like people all over the city, are increasingly concerned with crime.
One anonymous group of citizens, disturbed by prostitution along stretches of Queens Boulevard, recently put up signs on utility poles warning that the license-plate numbers of the prostitutes' customers would be recorded and their families notified.
A major reason for its generally peaceful transformation in recent years, said Mr. Finkelstein, the Neighborhood Stabilization official, is that local leaders and institutions have developed ''programs that service all the groups.'' Residents say two groups have been especially important: Woodside on the Move, which dates from the 1970's and sponsors job-placement, business-aid and youth programs, and St. Sebastian's Roman Catholic Church, which runs English-language classes and conducts one of its Sunday Masses, celebrated by more than 1,600 people, in Spanish.
Despite this, many Hispanic people in Woodside ''don't feel welcome'' at St. Sebastian's, said Jorge Aleman, a Woodsider of Honduran origin who works with a Hispanic-aid group called Hispanos Unidos. ''At the end of Mass, Spanish people like to stay around at their church and get to talk to the priest,'' he said.
The Rev. James Frost, the church's parochial vicar, said that a tight schedule of crowded Masses and limited space restricted such socializing.
For his part, Mr. Aleman was quick to say that that was his only complaint about life in Woodside. ''Otherwise,'' he said, ''it's a beautiful neighborhood.''

HEADLINE: In New York's Parks, More Litter and Less Money

BYLINE: By ANDREW L. YARROW

 BODY:
Newspapers blow across the dusty, threadbare Great Lawn of Central Park. Abandoned cars block a running path in Pelham Bay Park in the Bronx. Citywide, trees that were once regularly pruned and meadows that were once regularly sodded now receive infrequent care.
After a decade of dramatic improvement on the coattails of the mid-80's economic boom, New York City's parks are a testament to a leaner, meaner era of municipal finance.
Maintenance has been cut, land acquisitions have been put on hold, the number of employees has fallen 12 percent since 1986 and tens of millions of dollars in capital projects have been delayed. And while police statistics do not show an increase in crime, many people say the parks seem more dangerous, or at least less inviting. 
The new Parks Commissioner, Betsy Gotbaum, acknowledges that basic maintenance has suffered. ''We've had to reduce the number of people who clean and plant, as well as playground attendants,'' she said. ''And our tree-pruning has been cut incredibly.''
Linda Davidoff, executive director of the Parks Council, a private advocacy group, said, ''The parks are shabbier, dirtier and less usable.''
 
'Hardest Times' in 10 Years
The cuts, which Parks and Recreation Department officials and park users say pose a threat to one of the city's most valuable and fragile resources, began in the late 80's, when the New York economy started to falter. But they have become more severe with this year's city budget-cutting.
''These are the hardest times we've seen in 10 years,'' said Elizabeth Barlow Rogers, the Central Park administrator. ''A lot of things break my heart. The Great Lawn is a dust bowl and the pond is almost completely silted up. They were due for a major restoration, but now I don't know when we'll get the money. And there's a terrible problem with homeless people living in the park.''
While Mrs. Gotbaum is attempting to cope with the cuts by increasing private fund raising, worker productivity and volunteerism, she has also shifted the department's priorities from ecology and public events, like having gondoliers in the lake at Central Park, to improving recreational services.
Many employees say that the new Parks Commissioner - a venture capitalist and avid tennis player who was a leading campaign fund raiser for Mayor Dinkins - has worked tirelessly to maintain services and boost morale. They say she is more open to employees and less media oriented than her predecessor, Henry J. Stern, but also less politically connected and less vocal about environmental issues.
The Parks Department's 26,000 acres include scores of parks and a network of natural, historic and recreational areas. The department oversees 7,200 acres of woodlands, marshes and other natural areas; 2.7 million trees; 15 miles of beaches; 862 playgrounds; more than 500 tennis courts; 27 recreation centers; 37 swimming pools; 40 preschools; 13 golf courses; six ice-skating rinks; 15 historic houses, and 1,500 monuments, statues and other artworks. The department sponsors more than 500 concerts, 900 nature walks, 1,000 family workshops and 200 school programs a year.
 
More Trims Are Sought
''My immediate goals are to energize field workers and get this agency running better,'' Mrs. Gotbaum said. ''I also think we can get more help from the private sector and work more closely with communities and other city agencies.''
The department's budget was reduced from $195 million, or 0.73 percent of the city's budget, in fiscal 1990 to $185 million, or 0.68 percent of the budget, in the 1991 fiscal year that began July 1. The staff has been cut by 135 positions, to about 4,340; five years ago, the payroll included 4,950 people. Last week, Mayor Dinkins called for more trims in the Parks Department budget as part of a package of cuts to pay for hiring more police officers.
In Van Cortlandt Park in the Bronx, the clean-up staff has been cut 30 percent in the last two years, said Paul C. Berizzi, the park's administrator. ''There's a lot of litter and illegal dumping of cars, and we just can't keep up anymore,'' he said.
The capital budget for building and restoration, which is financed separately by city bond issues, was also cut this year from $146 million to $135 million. ''A lot of high-priority projects got knocked out or delayed, and it looks bleak for the coming years,'' said Diana Chapin, the department's deputy commissioner for planning. Projects in poorer areas, like ones in Thomas Jefferson Park in East Harlem and Belmont Playground in the Bronx, have been especially hard hit, she said.
 
'The Fear Is There'
Crimes like the rape of a jogger in Central Park last year have also increased fear among park users. There are no citywide statistics on crimes in parks, and the number of major crimes in the Central Park precinct declined slightly last year, according to the Police Department. But parks like Tompkins Square, Washington Square and Marcus Garvey Park are notorious sites for drug-related crimes. A recent count found 1,600 homeless people live in Manhattan parks.
''The fear is there,'' said Debbie King of the New York Road Runners Club. ''People are running more together, but if you can't go into our parks except in groups during the day, what's the point of having parks?'' She said that the number of attacks that are reported to her group, like the rape of a woman a week ago last Sunday morning in Inwood Hill Park in upper Manhattan, has increased in the last year.
But the most significant effect of the department's financial problems may be that the city will be unable to acquire new park lands before sites are lost to private development.
Community advocates and environmentalists have particularly urged that former commercial waterfront in Brooklyn and on the West Side of Manhattan be converted to parks. One of the sites of much contention has been the 76-acre Penn Central Railroad yards between West 59th and West 72d Streets owned by Donald Trump. ''I'd like to acquire it,'' Mrs. Gotbaum said, ''but the site belongs to Trump, and the city doesn't have the money.''
 
Needs of Brooklyn and Queens
Although nearly one-fourth of the Bronx is park land, the borough's big parks like Pelham Bay and Van Cortlandt are in the middle-class north, with few open spaces in the South Bronx. In Brooklyn and Queens, the two boroughs with the lowest percentage of city park land, the central section of the former and the northwest part of the latter ''urgently need new parks,'' Ms. Davidoff of the Parks Council said. While the National Park Service operates Jamaica Bay Wildlife Refuge at the south edge of the two boroughs, other natural areas like Udalls Cove in northeast Queens and Spring Creek in Brooklyn are unprotected.
The creation of Staten Island's 1,780-acre Greenbelt was one of the Parks Department's major accomplishments of the early 1980's. But environmentalists say the city must act quickly to save the borough's other natural lands.
Mrs. Gotbaum acknowledged that if areas are not acquired, ''they'll go to ruin.'' But unless a state environmental bond issue passes this fall, she said, the city cannot afford to acquire much land and if it could, it would have trouble paying to maintain new parks.
In an effort to alleviate the department's financial problems, Mrs. Gotbaum has expanded the year-old City Parks Foundation and embarked on an aggressive private fund-raising drive. She has raised about $350,000 during her first seven months, and has convinced corporations to ''adopt'' parks for contributions of $5,000 to $250,000.
 
Working With Schools
Fees have also been imposed this year for previously free services like summer day camp and preschool, and the department may increase what it charges the 350 park concessions, which provide about $18 million a year.
Although there have been volunteer planting and clean-up campaigns like the annual You Gotta Have Park festivals for several years, Mrs. Gotbaum has enlisted 35 volunteer Urban Park Rangers to supplement the 184-person paid force. Last month, she initiated an antilitter drive in which park visitors seen picking up litter are given tickets to Mets games or other prizes.
The Commissioner is also forging closer ties with other agencies, like the Board of Education and Departments of Environmental Protection and Cultural Affairs, whose purviews overlap that of the Parks Department.
Representing her emphasis on recreation, which Mrs. Gotbaum calls her No. 1 goal, several schools will begin this fall to use city centers for sports instruction, said William T. Castro, the assistant commissioner for recreation.
''We're not just throwing up our hands and saying, 'We have less resources, so we're going to do less,' '' said Robert L. Garafola, the department's deputy commissioner for management. ''We're going to make every effort to equal what we did in the past. But it's going to be difficult.''

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Americans Turn the Tables And Buy a British Agency

BYLINE: By KIM FOLTZ

 BODY:
During the last decade, acquisitive British advertising agencies snapped up some of Madison Avenue's most famous names - Ogilvy & Mather; Ted Bates; Compton; Backer & Spielvogel and J. Walter Thompson.
Now, the tables have been turned. On Friday, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles bought Yellowhammer, one of London's largest and most well-respected agencies.
The Yellowhammer deal is likely to be but the first in a series of acquisitions by large American agencies that have already begun shopping in London's Soho district, where many British agencies have their offices, some industry analysts and British advertising executives said. McCann-Erickson has reportedly been looking over London agencies and Grey Advertising unsuccessfully tried to buy Yellowhammer. 
Charles Channon, a spokesman for the Institute of Practitioners in Advertising, a trade group for British agencies, said there appeared to be a number of agencies for sale. Already, a handful are looking for buyers.
Would-be buyers may well be compiling shopping lists, and it would be no surprise if the lists included some of British advertising's most well-known names, like Collett Dickenson Pearce & Partners, Bartle Bogle Hegarty and Cowan Kemsley Taylor, which was started earlier this year by a group of executives from Saatchi & Saatchi's London office.
British agencies are attractive to their American counterparts for several reasons. London is an ideal base for American agencies that want to increase their presence in Europe and take advantage of the boom in advertising that is expected to follow the lifting of trade barriers in the European Community at the end of 1992.
Some analysts predict that advertising spending in continental Europe will rise by at least 10 percent annually for the next few years. In comparison, spending in the United States is expected to rise at about half that rate.
Roy Bostock, the chairman and chief executive of D.M.B.& B., said Yellowhammer's reputation for innovative work for Barclays Bank, Fiat and the British Government would give D.M.B.&B. additional clout when it competed for European accounts.
D.M.B.&B., like other large American agencies, already has a well-established office in London, from which it controls its European operations. An easy way for American agencies to pick up new European clients, analysts said, is to buy British agencies.
Mr. Bostock said his agency was also interested in Yellowhammer because the agencies shared an important client, Fiat. Yellowhammer handles the Italian auto maker's advertising in Britain; D.M.B.&B. has the account in Spain, Italy and Greece. ''We want to build our Fiat business in Europe, and the addition of Yellowhammer is going to help,'' he said.
British agencies can now be bought at bargain rates because many are financially vulnerable, analysts said. High inflation and a depressed British economy have slowed advertising spending in Britain, and ad expenditures are expected to decline at least 1 percent this year, compared with a 12 percent rise in 1988 and a 3 percent increase in 1989.
''A lot of agencies are in trouble,'' said Chris Akers, an analyst with Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers in London. ''A few big agencies may see business grow by 5 percent or more, but many are going to see their business decline by 10 percent to 15 percent.''
Prices are also expected to be low because, by Madison Avenue standards, British agencies are small. A mid-sized agency in London has billings of about $150 million. In New York, middle-ranked agencies are at least twice that size, with billings of $300 million to $500 million.
Yellowhammer is a good example of how some British agencies have become vulnerable. The publicly owned agency, which has billings of about $120 million, had expanded aggressively into continental Europe in the last few years and had started a number of advertising and marketing subsidiaries at home.
When the British ad industry took a nosedive last fall, Yellowhammer found it increasingly difficult to service its debt and the agency went into receivership last week, said Jon Summerill, the agency's chairman.
D.M.B.&B. had been eyeing Yellowhammer for some time, said Graham Hinton, the co-chairman of D.M.B.&B.'s London office. Mr. Hinton moved quickly, completing the complicated deal in just five days. And while he would not disclose the terms of the agreement, Mr. Graham said he acquired Yellowhammer at a ''very good price.''
Mr. Summerill said some Yellowhammer's subsidiaries like Generator, a small agency, would probably be sold in management buyouts.
Yellowhammer will remain a separate operation, Mr. Hinton said. But, he said, Johan Fourie, a D.M.B.&B. executive, has been named Yellowhammer's managing director to give the agency some ''of our discipline and grit.''
And, while Yellowhammer's house is being put in order, Mr. Hinton said, he is keeping an eye open for another acquisition. ''When the right agency comes along at the right price,'' he said, ''I'll buy it.''

HEADLINE: Europe's Quick Pace May Slow a Bit

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The higher oil prices that are likely to be the legacy of Iraq's military moves in the Middle East will slow but not stop the buoyant economy of Western Europe, economists say.
Before the current crisis, Western Europe seemed to have everything going for it. The 12-nation European Community's program to turn itself into a single market of 325 million consumers by the end of 1992 had started an investment boom. Higher spending generated by German reunification and the rebuilding of Eastern Europe promised to keep Western Europe's economy growing.
The expectation among economists and oil companies is that the price of oil will stabilize at $23 to $25 a barrel - provided President Saddam Hussein of Iraq decides not to challenge the American-led forces in Saudi Arabia and the Persian Gulf. 
While those prices are about one-third more than those of a few weeks ago, ''oil prices would have to be a lot higher to put Europe into a recession,'' said Peter Gutmann, an economist at the National Westminster Bank, one of Britain's largest banks. Only a major disruption that sent prices beyond $40 a barrel could bring European expansion to a standstill, he said.
But that analysis by no means suggests that Europe will feel no pain. Oil at $23 to $25 a barrel will reduce economic growth in Western Europe by as much as one-half percentage point over a year and will increase inflation by one-half to 1 percentage point, most economists agree. The effects of such changes would quickly become apparent.
Economists now expect the average inflation rate for Western Europe to edge up to 5.5 or 6 percent by year-end, from about 5 percent now. Economic growth is expected to be about 2.5 percent in 1991, compared with the previously expected growth of about 3 percent. Last year, Western Europe's economy grew 3.5 percent.
There are a number of reasons why the oil crisis will not be felt as severely as the oil shocks of the 1970's.
For one thing, this increase is not nearly as great as those in the past. In 1973, prices quadrupled when Arab members of OPEC embargoed oil shipments to the United States and some of its allies. In 1979, after the fall of the Shah of Iran, prices doubled.
In addition, in inflation-adjusted dollars, the price of oil has fallen dramatically since the early 1980's, when it peaked at about $60 a barrel in today's dollars.
Western Europe has also become much more energy efficient. ''Oil consumption relative to economic growth is much less than it was,'' said William P. Ledward, an economist at Nomura Research Institute Ltd., the London-based research arm of the Japanese securities firm. That dependency has dropped by about 30 percent since 1980, he estimates.
 
Strong Forces Behind Growth
Economists also think Western Europe is in better shape to weather higher oil prices because strong forces are behind its growth. These include the 1992 program and German reunification.
What happens to West Germany, whose gross national product accounts for 25 percent of the European Community's, matters a great deal to Western Europe. West Germany's growth is expected to slow to 3 percent to 3.5 percent in 1991 from 4 percent this year. But economists say they are not worried.
With German reunification, ''the strongest impetus for growth in Europe is the acceleration of domestic demand in Germany,'' said John Lipsky, director of international research at Salomon Brothers in London.
A growing number of economists expect the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, to lead an interest rate increase on the continent to make sure that the higher oil prices and heavy public spending related to German reunification do not ignite inflation, now 2.4 percent.
They say the Bundesbank could raise rates by a half to three-quarters of a percentage point within three to six months, which would increase short-term German rates to as much as 9 percent. That means the dollar, which has recently been weakening, could fall during the next six months to perhaps as low as 1.50 marks, from near 1.60 marks now.
Economists in Western Europe are also confident that the higher oil price will not mean a return to the days of raging inflation. One reason, they say, is that central bankers will act more decisively this time to make sure inflation does not take hold.
In addition, labor markets are not as tight as they were in 1973 and 1979 in many countries, making it less likely that higher oil prices will set off a wage-price spiral as they did in the past. Although the level of wage increases has been rising in Britain in particular, and to a lesser extent in West Germany and Italy, economists had already been expecting a moderation next year.
While Britain's unemployment is now a low 5.7 percent, it is beginning to rise. And reunification with East Germany will ease some labor shortages in West Germany, where unemployment is 7.1 percent. In addition, unions are much weaker in countries like Britain and France than they were in the 1970's.
''I don't think the rise in inflation is going to be a self-generating problem,'' said George A. Magnus, chief international economist at S. G. Warburg Securities in London.
 
Impact Will Vary
While Western Europe as a whole is in good shape to weather the higher oil prices, the effect will vary from country to country.
The impact will be somewhat less in France, for example, which gets a relatively large portion of its electricity from nuclear power plants. Italy is more vulnerable because its power plants burn more oil. Energy-producing countries like Norway, Denmark and the Netherlands will be even better off, said Mr. Ledward of Nomura.
Britain, with its North Sea oil fields, is a small net exporter of oil. That means the higher oil prices should have a positive, if minor, effect on its trade balance, which has been deeply in the red.
On the other hand, Britain's economy is currently the weakest of any major country in Western Europe, and its inflation, at 9.8 percent, the highest. A base interest rate of 15 percent has already caused a recession in the commercial and residential real estate markets, and the Confederation of British Industry had warned that the manufacturing sector was on the verge of a recession even before Iraq invaded Kuwait.
 
European Monetary System
Because they expect Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's Government to ease interest rates, many economists expect Britain to avoid a recession. As a matter of fact, they think the higher oil prices will cause the Government to lower interest rates sooner rather than later and to join the European Monetary System, which would tie the pound to the mark.
The Conservative Government has to hold an election by July 1992, and probably would like to hold one next year if possible. That means getting the economy moving again. And if the Bundesbank raises interest rates, economists reason, Mrs. Thatcher will have to join the European Monetary System so she can lower British rates without causing the value of the pound to plummet.
 
British Credibility
Although lowering rates is often inflationary, tying the pound to the mark would give Britain credibility in the financial markets in connection with its willingness to fight inflation.
Mrs. Thatcher has promised to join the system, whose member currencies are managed so their value relative to one another does not radically change. So far Mrs. Thatcher has had to be dragged, kicking and screaming, to join the system. She has no desire to see the European Commmunity become a United States of Europe and she fears that proposals to create a single European currency and a central bank will be a big step toward just that.
During the summer, John Major, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, made comments that have led analysts to believe that Britain would join the system in the fall. The higher oil prices, said Christopher Dillow, a Nomura economist, ''mean we're still on course.''

HEADLINE: Crisis at Top Loan Insurer: A $1.5 Billion 'F'

SERIES: Students in Default: A troubled Agency - Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By ERIC N. BERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Aug. 12

 BODY:
The nation's largest guarantor of student loans is facing a financial crisis because its borrowers defaulted on $1.5 billion in obligations in the last two years. And on Capitol Hill, some legislators are saying that the $2 billion the Treasury spends each year on student loan defaults is a sign that the Government's policies toward such loans are lax.
Education experts say the troubles at the largest guarantor, the Higher Education Assistance Foundation, might be the blow that forces changes in how student financial aid is administered.
Students are currently eligible for federally insured loans regardless of their credit histories and earning potential. Because banks know they are likely to be reimbursed 100 percent for any losses on student loans, they typically exercise little or no credit judgment in making them. That policy, enacted by Congress during the Administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson, may be cast aside if the foundation's problems turn out to be more than an isolated case. 
The Higher Education Assistance Foundation backs $9.6 billion in loans made by banks, savings and loan associations, credit unions and other financial institutions to students for college and vocational study. In turn, at least 80 percent of its commitments are backed by the Government.
The foundation recently told the Government it was having trouble covering the loans it had guaranteed, because of a sharp increase in defaults, particularly among vocational-school students like those studying to be truck drivers, hairdressers and court stenographers. The roughly $1 billion in defaults forced the foundation to make such large payouts that a cash squeeze is threatening its survival. Government officials say the agency's troubles will not affect the availability of new student financial aid, although some banks are backing away from the foundation's program.
 
Effort to Avoid Federal Bailout
Education Department officials say they are working on ways to avoid using public money to resolve the foundation's problems.
The foundation has already been lent money by the Student Loan Marketing Association, known as Sallie Mae, a federally chartered but shareholder-owned corporation, and earlier this month Sallie Mae said it would provide up to $200 million more in emergency financing to keep the organization afloat.
But tax dollars may have to be used to meet the foundation's obligations if a private-sector rescue cannot be arranged. Coming at a time when billions of Federal tax dollars are already being used to rescue hundreds of savings and loan associations, the mere chance of a Federal bailout of the foundation is sounding alarms on Capitol Hill.
Some legislators worry that a bailout of the troubled agency could cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
''It is the question of whether or not there has been diligence in seeking strong, stern measures to control defaults and to stop those who would abuse the system,'' said Senator Claiborne Pell, Democrat of Rhode Island.
Ted Sanders, the Under Secretary of Education, has said six other federally backed guarantee agencies are also having financial difficulties. $14 Billion in Loans Guaranteed The Higher Education Assistance Foundation is a private, nonprofit company based in Overland Park, Kan., a suburb of Kansas City. A subsidiary of the HEAF Group, the foundation is one of the oldest of 58 agencies, some privately owned, others state controlled, that were established by the Government in the mid-1970's to relieve it of the administrative burden of guaranteeing payment on student-loan defaults.
Since it was started in 1977, the foundation has guaranteed more than $14 billion in student loans. Last year alone, it guaranteed $1.79 billion in new loans, 14.6 percent of all such loans made in 1989.
Under pressure in recent years as loan losses mounted, the Government put some restrictions on its repayment rates to agencies like the foundation that have a high default rate. If any of the 58 agencies have 9 percent or more of their loans go bad, the Government limits reimbursement to 80 percent on any further defaults.
 
More Pressure on Banks Likely
Even if a liberal lending policy is retained, financial experts say the system needs to be refined. The Government is likely, these people say, to force banks to be more discerning by limiting reimbursements.
''It seems to fly in the face of all sound principles of lending money and issuing insurance,'' said Thomas Wheeler, the president of the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company.
The Higher Education Assistance Foundation was incurring sizable losses well before it got into its current pinch, but when the Education Department announced that the foundation was experiencing ''serious financial problems,'' a slow, steady decline turned into a free fall. A number of lenders indicated that they would never again do business with the foundation; other lenders said they would seek to have their student loans insured elsewhere until they could be confident that the foundation was solid.
 
Range of Agency's Default Rates
''The 'Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval' was removed by the Department of Education,'' said David Westbrook, a spokesman for the foundation. ''We now need to put it back on.''
Mr. Westbrook said the overall default rate on loans in the foundation's portfolio ranged from 4 percent to 17 percent, depending on the state. He added that those default rates were roughly twice as high as those for healthier guarantee agencies. The foundation's average default rate is 35 percent on loans to students who attended trade schools. At some trade schools, the rate is as high as 68 percent.
Some people involved in the rescue efforts say that the foundation may be beyond repair and that a takeover of the troubled agency may be necessary.
One possibility is that the foundation's loan guarantees would be assumed by Sallie Mae. Sallie Mae buys student loans from banks, credit unions and other educational lenders, and adding a guarantee business like the foundation's might be a logical extension. Another possibility is that the foundation would be carved up and its obligations assumed by other federally insured agencies.
 
Possibility of Fraud
Some experts suggest the foundation's difficulties may stem more from fraud among vocational schools than from deficiencies in the foundation's management.
''There are a number of unscrupulous trade-school operators who have made a handsome living at the expense of the student-loan program and of American taxpayers,'' said David S. Hochstim, a financial institutions analyst at Bear, Stearns & Company. ''They bilk the system by luring students in, obtaining the proceeds of their student loans and not providing a valuable education. The students then typically default, often not even aware that they obtained loans for which they now have obligations to repay.''
In recent years, trade-school loans have shown a default rate four times that of conventional student loans. Yet the foundation managed to become the nation's leading backer of these shaky borrowings, at one point devoting 65 percent of its guarantees to them.
 
Students' Problems Cited
The foundation is required by various state and Federal laws to take on this risky business, but one question that will undoubtedly arise in upcoming Congressional hearings is whether the foundation's management actively pursued the bad business.
For their part, representatives of trade schools say the problem is not with trade-school curriculums but rather with the financial condition of many trade-school students.
''The problem is that we have made poor people borrow too heavily to finance their education,'' said Steven Blair, president of the National Association of Trade and Technical Schools. ''If you took our students and placed them in a two-year college or a four-year university, their rate of default would be the same.''
The toughest questions are likely to be directed at Richard C. Hawk, the foundation's chairman and chief executive. A former assistant dean at the University of Chicago's Graduate School of Education, Mr. Hawk is a founder of the foundation. Mr. Hawk, who declined to be interviewed, helped build the foundation into a nationwide operation with 800 employees.

HEADLINE: New Boom In U.S. Oil Is Doubted

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Executives of American oil companies say they do not expect the sudden jump in crude oil prices to stimulate exploration and drilling because they have not yet been convinced that the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait will have a long-term effect on prices.
In addition, industry experts say, the drilling industry withered during the 1980's and does not have the capacity to sustain a sharp increase in activity now. And even if there were the ability, the multinational oil companies have concluded that geologic prospects are better abroad than in the United States, so most new investment would be overseas.
The companies say their profits from drilling done in previous years will rise this year because the oil now being pumped is suddenly worth more. But money spent now to look for a new oilfield might not result in oil being brought to market before the invasion is just a memory. 
 
Riding Out Price Fluctuations
''The lead times are so long, you'd just be nuts to change your basic investment strategy on the basis of price changes in one week,'' said John Lord, a spokesman for the Mobil Corporation. ''You're talking about investments that won't come on stream for 5 years, if you're lucky, or maybe 10 years.''
Mobil bases its investments in exploration and production on an internal estimate of oil prices three years into the future, and has not changed its current estimate for the next three years, Mr. Lord said.
At the Exxon Corporation, the largest American oil company, which will spend $7.5 billion to $8 billion this year looking for oil, William Smith, a spokesman, said: ''Exploration and production budgets are based on long-term considerations. It would seem premature to base E. and P. plans on recent events.''
 
Long-Term Strategy
Shell said in a statement: ''Shell Oil's exploration and production program is based on long-term strategy rather than short-term reactions to market swings or other economic factors. We have not made any changes to our E. and P. programs based upon the Iraq-Kuwait situation.''
At Conoco Inc., which will spend about $2 billion this year and probably the same next year on exploration and production, Constantine Nicandros, the chairman, said that higher prices would have to persist for a year before planners believed that they were here to stay.
Ten years ago, when the Iranian revolution made prices triple and economists were predicting that oil prices could only rise from there, Mr. Nicandros said his company, a subsidiary of the Du Pont Company, and many others had drilled wells that would be profitable at $30 or $40 a barrel, only to see the prices fall to less than $10. ''The cemeteries are full of people like that,'' he said.
At another big oil company, an executive who agreed to speak only if he was not identified said of the recent surge in prices, ''even if it stays up for a year, that isn't very important to drilling plans.''
''The important thing is what will the price be in six years,'' he said.
The companies will continue to seek permission to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska and in offshore areas where they have been barred. And they will argue that the turbulence in the Middle East shows the significance of the United States' dependence on imports, which is now near 50 percent.
 
Drilling Abroad
But even if the companies decide to drill more, a larger volume of drilling would follow the same pattern as current drilling: mostly abroad. Because the United States has been so thoroughly drilled compared with the rest of the world, industry officials do not believe that the decline in American production would stop even if oil stayed at $25 a barrel for the next few years. But some experts add that production of gas, which substitutes for oil in many industries, could grow if the increase in oil prices helps pull the price of gas out of its current slump.
But the state of the drilling industry complicates that prospect.
''The only way to drill more is to have more rigs running, and there are not that many rigs that are available to go to work anymore,'' said James M. Nicklos, an oil driller and the former president of the Houston chapter of the International Association of Drilling Contractors.
At the peak of the oil boom, in the early 80's, more than 5,000 rigs were running; about 1,000 are operating now. Mr. Nicklos once ran 15; now he has 2, and is building a third.
''Nobody really knows how many more rigs there are available to go to work,'' said Mr. Nicklos, who estimated there were 1,500. ''We've been in the process of buying rigs recently, and the equipment's dried up. There's not much out there.''
''You can't just go to a supply company and say 'I want a rig,' '' he said. ''They're not even set up to build them.''

HEADLINE: Business Scene;
Airlines in Pull Of Global Magnet

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
THE changes wrought by airline deregulation since 1978 go on and on. Many fares were cut drastically. Routes within the nation were revamped. The industry became concentrated in the hands of nine major carriers. And now globalization is bringing a new upheaval.
Globalization means, in effect, that simply being a domestic airline is no longer enough. The new view is that long-term survival also requires a network of flights between the United States and numerous foreign cities. Some carriers, particularly American Airlines, believe in globalization more enthusiastically than others, like USAir. But willingly or not, all the big carriers are being drawn into overseas expansion. 
''If you are going to take full advantage of your domestic market, then international growth is almost unavoidable,'' said Donald J. Carty, an executive vice president at American Airlines.
The reasons are plain enough. One is that passenger traffic between the United States and other countries has been growing at more than 15 percent a year since 1987, while passenger traffic on domestic flights has hardly increased at all. Secondly, the fares are not subject to the discounting that cuts into profits on domestic flights, because international fares are mostly regulated through bilateral agreements. And finally the new hub-and-spoke route structure in the United States almost requires the airlines to expand overseas.
The hub airports developed by the top airlines in recent years are usually in large cities and are fed by numerous ''spoke'' flights from smaller cities. Thus, Delta Air Lines channels passengers into its Atlanta hub for Delta flights to London, Paris and Frankfurt. USAir feeds into Pittsburgh for a recently inaugurated daily flight to Frankfurt. For example, five people bound for Frankfurt, fly in to Pittsburgh from Louisville, Ky., five more from Akron, Ohio, and so on. Without USAir's Pittsburgh-Frankfurt flight, each of these feeder trips might carry five fewer passengers, depriving USAir of the extra domestic revenue. The same Louisville passengers, wanting to get to Frankfurt, might instead travel via Delta to Atlanta.
''If the airlines don't have international operations, they are depriving themselves of the opportunity to carry those passengers over their domestic legs,'' said William Boyd, an analyst at the Transportation Department.
Such economics explains why the nation's carriers are scrambling for overseas routes. American, for example, recently bought Eastern's Latin American routes and is acquiring flights as rapidly as it can to Europe and East Asia. It is bidding, in one case, against United, Delta and Contintental for a soon-to-be-awarded Tokyo-Chicago route.
Dozens of alliances and joint ventures are also being struck with foreign carriers, the latest being the announcement last week that the Scandinavian Airlines System had agreed to increase its ownership stake in Continental Airlines. Whether an equity stake or a marketing agreement, the goal of these arrangements is to serve routes that airlines do not yet want to fly themselves. Thus, American Airlines feeds passengers into a Cathay Pacific flight from Los Angeles to Hong Kong, and USAir, through a deal with Alitalia, allows a passenger in Rome to check his bag through to Akron as if he were making the entire trip on a single airline.
USAir is also seeking authorization to fly its own planes between Philadelphia and Paris and between Pittsburgh and Manchester, England. But USAir's specialty is serving small American cities, and it lacks the wide-bodied jets usually used in international service. ''We will take advantage of market opportunities, but we won't expand on a global basis in a big way,'' said John Bronson, a USAir spokesman.
That decision might someday cost USAir its place among this country's Big Nine, those carriers with more than $1 billion in annual revenue. Today, American, Delta, United and Northwest are thriving as domestic and international carriers. Continental is just behind them in size. Trans World Airlines and Pan Am are fading, in part because they lack extensive domestic routes to feed international flights. USAir and America West Airlines, while strong at home, are fledglings abroad.
Fledglings are exposed to two dangers. One is that the Federal Government might award new overseas routes to the four or five carriers with the strongest international operations. The other is that the Government might someday permit Lufthansa or KLM or Alitalia or some other foreign carrier to operate flights within the United States, in exchange for that same right for American carriers in Europe.
No United States carrier officially favors this much deregulation. Even Alfred E. Kahn, the architect of deregulation in the Carter Administration, acknowledges that a USAir, lacking an extensive overseas operation, might not win out in competition on its home turf against a KLM or a Lufthansa. And the Big Nine might become the Big Six or the Big Five.
