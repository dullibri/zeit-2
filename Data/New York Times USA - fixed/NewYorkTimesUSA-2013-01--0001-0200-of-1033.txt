HEADLINE: No Era for Grand Deals

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The confusing struggle to head off a national fiscal crisis has made one thing crystal clear: The era of the Big Deal is over.
Despite repeated, intense and personal efforts by President Obama and Speaker John A. Boehner as well as bipartisan coalitions, gangs of senators, supercommittees, special commissions and wonky outsiders, the grand bargain remains the elusive holy grail of fiscal policy and seems destined to stay that way for now.
''We don't seem to be able to do grand bargains very well,'' said Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine, who has long been a force for compromise. 
Some groups have produced the framework for smaller deals and even gained some bipartisan support, particularly the 2010 Simpson-Bowles plan, which fell just short of a 14-vote threshold required to get before Congress. But the alchemy of Mr. Obama and the current Republican-controlled House, not to mention the ideologically diverse Senate, appears hopelessly inhospitable to accomplishing something huge.
As Mr. Obama all but acknowledged Monday, big bipartisan legislative dreams seem all but certain to be miniaturized as incremental policy visions.
''My preference would have been to solve all these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain, whatever you want to call it,'' he said. ''Maybe we can do it in stages. We're going to solve this problem instead in several steps.''
Republicans appear to agree. ''We'll continue to work on smart ways to cut spending,'' Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, said on the Senate floor. ''But let's not let that stand in the way.''
The list of unrealized goals from Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner's last attempt at a grand bargain two weeks ago are breathtaking in their number, particularly when compared with the probable outcome of these final Congressional negotiations. Ambitious plans to overhaul the individual tax code, tackle corporate rates, revamp the Medicare program and possibly consider changes in Social Security appear to have given way mainly to a tax increase for big earners.
Members in both the House and the Senate said perhaps that was O.K.
''We can't do the task all at once,'' said Senator John Hoeven, Republican of North Dakota. ''I pushed for a big deal, but in this case this time we can only get the tax piece done, so we need to move we need to get it done.''
The downside of incrementalism is apparent every month in Washington, as a new battle emerges and legislative Band-Aids are affixed to fiscal gunshot wounds.
While Congress appeared on Monday to be lurching to a deal to avoid significant tax increases for millions of Americans, the emerging patchwork tax deal would push a series of fights into the next Congress, most of them very likely to be marked by the same 11th-hour, rancorous dynamics that have been the signature of every other fiscal deal.
Most pressing, Congress will have to come together as early as next month to lift the debt ceiling, which Republicans are already hoping to leverage to eke more spending cuts from Democrats. A similar fight almost led to default in 2011, and damaged the nation's credit rating.
In March, Congress will spar again over a short-term spending agreement to keep the government open, the same sort that led to a near shutdown almost two years ago. It appeared on Monday that scheduled spending cuts to the Pentagon and other parts of government -- the result of last year's debt ceiling agreement -- will be delayed for two months, yet another short-term kick of the can. Republicans and Democrats will most likely revisit the recurring question of revenues versus spending cuts when those two months are up.
Because the sharply divided 112th Congress and the White House repeatedly eschewed large-scale deals in favor of quick fixes, myriad bills left undone will be in the hands of the 113th Congress, set to convene at noon Thursday.
The legislation includes a farm bill to replace the one that has expired, a lapse that may result in soaring milk prices; a transportation bill; a funding mechanism to supplement the waning gas tax reserves to meet infrastructure needs; and even a measure, once completely uncontroversial, to prevent domestic violence.
Also left to the new year is a bill to help states hit by Hurricane Sandy. The Senate passed such a measure last week, but House Republicans, as has been the case with every disaster relief bill in this Congress, disagree with Democrats on its level of spending, and a final deal seems unlikely until the next Congress. The House was also set to vote on Tuesday on a quickie measure to deal with dairy prices.
Doing business in pieces may end up a productive formula -- in the sense that walking 100 miles will still transport a person absent an airplane or a bus -- but many outside Congress do not think such halting forward motion should be confused with actual success.
''That's the nature of the dysfunction,'' said Julian E. Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton. ''For the parties, it gives them temporary cover and to fight again on the issues in the next few months. The parties please their base, but the country does not get a solution.''
But that seems to be the nature of what constitutes progress in such a sharply divided political world.

HEADLINE: U.S. Birthrate Dips as Hispanic Pregnancies Fall

BYLINE: By SUSAN SAULNY

 BODY:
ORLANDO, Fla. -- Hispanic women in the United States, who have generally had the highest fertility rates in the country, are choosing to have fewer children. Both immigrant and native-born Latinas had steeper birthrate declines from 2007 to 2010 than other groups, including non-Hispanic whites, blacks and Asians, a drop some demographers and sociologists attribute to changes in the views of many Hispanic women about motherhood.
As a result, in 2011, the American birthrate hit a record low, with 63 births per 1,000 women ages 15 to 44, led by the decline in births to immigrant women. The national birthrate is now about half what it was during the baby boom years, when it peaked in 1957 at 122.7 births per 1,000 women of childbearing age.
The decline in birthrates was steepest among Mexican-American women and women who immigrated from Mexico, at 25.7 percent. This has reversed a trend in which immigrant mothers accounted for a rising share of births in the United States, according to a recent report by the Pew Research Center. In 2010, birthrates among all Hispanics reached their lowest level in 20 years, the center found. 
The sudden drop-off, which coincided with the onset of the recession, suggests that attitudes have changed since the days when older generations of Latinos prized large families and more closely followed Roman Catholic teachings, which forbid artificial contraception.
Interviews with young Latinas, as well as reproductive health experts, show that the reasons for deciding to have fewer children are many, involving greater access to information about contraceptives and women's health, as well as higher education.
When Marucci Guzman decided to marry Tom Beard here seven years ago, the idea of having a large family -- a Guzman tradition back in Puerto Rico -- was out of the question.
''We thought one, maybe two,'' said Ms. Guzman Beard, who gave birth to a daughter, Attalai, four years ago.
Asked whether Attalai might ever get her wish for a little brother or sister, Ms. Guzman Beard, 29, a vice president at a public service organization, said: ''I want to go to law school. I'm married. I work. When do I have time?''
The decisions were not made in a vacuum but amid a sputtering economy, which, interviewees said, weighed heavily on their minds.
Latinos suffered larger percentage declines in household wealth than white, black or Asian households from 2005 to 2009, and, according to the Pew report, their rates of poverty and unemployment also grew more sharply after the recession began.
Prolonged recessions do produce dips in the birthrate, but a drop as large as Latinos have experienced is atypical, said William H. Frey, a sociologist and demographer at the Brookings Institution. ''It is surprising,'' Mr. Frey said. ''When you hear about a decrease in the birthrate, you don't expect Latinos to be at the forefront of the trend.''
D'Vera Cohn, a senior writer at the Pew Research Center and an author of the report, said that in past recessions, when overall fertility dipped, ''it bounced back over time when the economy got better.''
''If history repeats itself, that will happen again,'' she said.
But to Mr. Frey, the decrease has signaled much about the aspirations of young Latinos to become full and permanent members of the upwardly mobile middle class, despite the challenges posed by the struggling economy.
Jersey Garcia, a 37-year-old public health worker in Miami, is in the first generation of her family to live permanently outside of the Dominican Republic, where her maternal and paternal grandmothers had a total of 27 children.
''I have two right now,'' Ms. Garcia said. ''It's just a good number that I can handle.''
''Before, I probably would have been pressured to have more,'' she added. ''I think living in the United States, I don't have family members close by to help me, and it takes a village to raise a child. So the feeling is, keep what you have right now.''
But that has not been easy. Even with health insurance, Ms. Garcia's preferred method of long-term birth control, an IUD, has been unaffordable. Birth control pills, too, with a $50 co-payment a month, were too costly for her budget. ''I couldn't afford it,'' she said. ''So what I've been doing is condoms.''
According to research by the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health, the overwhelming majority of Latinas have used contraception at some point in their lives, but they face economic barriers to consistent use. As a consequence, Latinas still experience unintended pregnancy at a rate higher than non-Hispanic whites, according to the institute.
And while the share of births to teenage mothers has dropped over the past two decades for all women, the highest share of births to teenage mothers is among native-born Hispanics.
''There are still a lot of barriers to information and access to contraception that exist,'' said Jessica Gonzáles-Rojas, 36, the executive director of the institute, who has one son. ''We still need to do a lot of work.''
In Denver, Olga Gonzalez, the daughter of Mexican immigrants, teaches a family-planning class in Spanish to Mexican immigrants. She tells her students that as a teenager in the 1980s, she decided to take the long view on life: ''I chose to do the college route first and establish my career and then think about babies later.''
Now 40, Ms. Gonzalez has a master's degree in nonprofit management, two children and a solid foothold in the professional middle class. (Her father, one of six children, never finished the fifth grade back in Guanajuato, Mexico, before he had to go to work.)
Ms. Gonzalez often asks her students, ''What is the optimum situation we want so our kids don't struggle?'' The students answer that they want education and smaller families, just like Ms. Gonzalez, who is content to keep the number of her children at two.
Ms. Guzman Beard is an advocate of smaller families, too. She is the youngest woman on staff at Latino Leadership, a nonprofit group that serves the poor in Central Florida. She has refused to involve the group in abstinence-only education initiatives, much to the chagrin of her older, tradition-minded colleagues.
''There needs to be real-life situations in the contraception conversation,'' she said. ''At the end of the day, we can't tell families how many children to have, but if you're already in a position where you don't have enough money to care for them, that you're unemployed, that you don't have stable housing, why would you be adding more children to that mix?''
Ms. Guzman Beard's mother, Marytza Sanz, founded Latino Leadership 12 years ago and is content to let her daughter make programming decisions, as well as choices about her own family's size -- without grandmotherly interference.
''I think we are changing,'' said Ms. Sanz, 54, whose own grandmother had nine children in Puerto Rico, and who faced considerable pressure to produce a large family herself after marrying in Bayamon at age 18. However many children her daughter ends up having, she said, she will support her.
''One, two, three or four, grandma is going to be here,'' Ms. Sanz said.

HEADLINE: Big Innovations in Football Are Just Past the End Zone

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
In its home opener in 2005, the Central Florida football team ended a 17-game losing streak with an upset of Marshall. Fans swarmed the field and, in a time-honored tradition, tore down one of the goal posts at the Florida Citrus Bowl in Orlando.
Although no fans were hurt in the celebration, Allen Johnson, the executive director of Orlando Venues, which runs the stadium, soon began looking for a way to avoid a potentially dangerous situation. A solution was a goal post that, with the push of a button, sinks to the ground in less than a minute, using a hydraulic hinge at the base.
Built by Sportsfield Specialties in Delhi, N.Y., about a three-hour drive north of New York City, the 500-pound aluminum posts not only frustrate fans intent on tearing them down, but also are easier for the stadium staff to repair and remove for concerts and other events. The posts can rotate away from the field so soccer and field hockey games can be held, and they expand for high school and college football games, which require posts with different goal widths.
''They're very versatile,'' Johnson said of the posts, which cost about $13,000 a pair. ''They're safer, quicker and more economical.'' 
Fans can see this increasingly ubiquitous style of goal post on Tuesday when the Florida Citrus Bowl hosts the Capital One Bowl. The posts are also used at MetLife Stadium, where the Jets and the Giants play, and at University of Phoenix Stadium, the Arizona Cardinals' home field. They will be installed in the future home of the San Francisco 49ers, among many other sites.
The collapsible goal posts have been around for only a few years. But they are just the latest in a long list of updates and innovations to a cornerstone of every football field, whether the old two-post steel standard on the goal line or the single aluminum post placed behind the end zone.
Goal posts are just one of the hundreds of products that manufacturers like Sportsfield make for sports facilities. These companies produce things like padding, netting, dugouts, bleachers, portable pitching mounds and steeplechase pits. Fans may barely give them a thought, but these products are continually being tweaked to adapt to changing needs, tight budgets and growing safety concerns.
''Nothing we make is perfect, but we constantly look to improve it,'' said Tim Driscoll, the president of AAE in Royersford, Pa., which introduced the first rollaway goal posts decades ago. ''The one constant is change in this business.''
Estimates vary, but the market for equipment for sports facilities is worth roughly $100 million, with Sportsfield, Gilman Gear and AAE among the leaders in an industry dominated by small, family-run companies. Sales over all have remained steady in recent years despite a downturn in new school construction and pressure on municipal and college sports budgets, the companies said.
Donations, particularly at universities, have helped. Oklahoma State, for instance, overhauled its sports facilities after T. Boone Pickens, an alumnus and an oil tycoon, donated hundreds of millions of dollars. Schools are also expanding their programs in sports like lacrosse and soccer even as they shut down less popular and more expensive programs.
''Schools have had to make choices in everything from curriculum to what sports they offer and decide where the greatest demand and return is,'' said Jack Plunkett, the chief executive of Plunkett Research, a market research firm in Houston.
The need to contain costs has led manufacturers to create new products. Instead of building new fields, for instance, some schools are installing netting systems that divide existing fields in half so two teams can practice simultaneously. Artificial fields, too, are replacing natural grass fields because they do not need to be mowed or seeded.
''What's driving the market is the need for efficiency and a reduction in labor,'' said Neil Gilman, the president of Gilman Gear, who said his company introduced the first manually operated hinged posts.
Hinged goal posts increase productivity because up to four people may be needed to remove a fixed goal post, and injuries are always a risk. Workers use ladders to unbolt uprights from the crossbars and then lower the poles, which can be as long as 30 feet. The gooseneck, which weighs about 150 pounds, must be unscrewed as well.
Only two people are needed to disassemble hinged posts, and they can do the job faster.
''The quicker you can turn something over, the more money you can save,'' said Bill Squires, a facilities consultant to the N.F.L.'s Giants. At Squires's suggestion, MetLife Stadium installed Sportsfield's hydraulic hinged posts this year. Sportsfield ''is not reinventing the wheel, but they're making it a lot better,'' he said.
Sportsfield, which makes about 500 sets of posts a year, has also made less visible changes. Instead of welding the uprights to the crossbar, the company created an adjustable sleeve within the crossbar so the uprights can move a few degrees front to back. This allows installers to set the uprights perpendicular to the ground more easily.
''To the average person, it's four pieces of pipe put together to form a goal,'' said Eric Hulbert, the chief of operations at Sportsfield, a company whose revenue has grown by an average of 27 percent a year since it began making its own products in 2003. ''But with all the internal working mechanisms, it's a fairly complex engineering piece that's been developed for over 100 years.''
Hulbert said Sportsfield had grown partly because of the company's ability to improve seemingly simple equipment like goal posts.
Sportsfield's posts start as aluminum pipes produced at mills in the Midwest. The uprights are cut to length, which is typically 20 feet for high school posts and 30 feet for collegiate and professional leagues. To make the gooseneck, a 21-foot pole that is 6 5/8 inches in diameter is bent using a roller that applies about 70 tons of pressure for about 15 minutes. This forms a five-foot arc that will allow the post to sit behind the end zone.
Holes are then drilled in the crossbar for the two uprights. The length of the crossbar varies: 23 feet 4 inches for high schools and 18 feet 6 inches for colleges and professional leagues. Expandable crossbars allow stadium managers to keep just one set of posts.
A cylindrical connector is then welded in the middle of the crossbar so the gooseneck can be fit on later. Adjustable sleeves are put inside the ends of the crossbars so the installer can square the uprights.
Caps with the company's logo are welded onto the ends of the crossbar. Another set of caps is welded on the top of the uprights with hooks for the red nylon directional flags so kickers can get a sense of which way the wind is blowing.
The two uprights, the gooseneck and the crossbar are then washed with a phosphate and sprayed with a granular polyester that holds up better in the elements than paint. About 80 percent of goal posts are yellow, and the rest are white.
The poles are then wheeled into an oven that is 55 feet deep, 14 feet high and 14 feet wide, and are baked at 400 degrees for 15 minutes. After they cool, they are wrapped and shipped. In all, it takes about 17 hours of total manpower to make a set of goal posts, Hulbert said. And now it takes much less time to take them down.

HEADLINE: Discussing Disaster Relief Costs, and Changing Tone When It's Closer to Home

BYLINE: By MICHAEL POWELL. 
E-mail: powellm@nytimes.com Twitter: @powellnyt

 BODY:
Glint-eyed and with a practiced amiability, the House Appropriations Committee chairman, Harold Rogers, would have us know that his heart is heavy at our suffering, even as he applies a little Kentucky common sense to New York and New Jersey.
Just because the United States Senate approved a $60.4 billion package for the hurricane-ravaged lands of New York and New Jersey last week, don't expect the Kentucky congressman to move so fast. 
''That's the Senate; they do their thing,'' Mr. Rogers, a Republican, told reporters recently. ''We are scrubbing the numbers, looking at the justifications, being sure we are dealing with the results of the hurricane and not other causes.''
I set out in search of other causes on Monday, driving down Father Capodanno Boulevard on Staten Island. I saw houses spun like tops off foundations and strips of siding ripped off once-handsome homes. I saw ruined Barbie dolls and Legos swept in eddies, mountains of debris and the broken skeleton of the vintage 1940s Victory Diner.
I knocked at the door of Santo Lisa's home, which faces the white-flecked Atlantic Ocean. A retired firefighter with the loose-limbed walk of a man accustomed to running toward danger, Mr. Lisa is the sort whom politicians love to pose with after disasters. The same is true of his next-door neighbor, a young firefighter, except that he's not there now. His home, smashed and leaning sideways, has an ''Unsafe -- Do Not Enter or Occupy'' notice taped to its front door.
When Hurricane Sandy howled, Mr. Lisa heard an old woman screaming for help. He ran downstairs to get a thick rope; he planned to wade into ocean waters and run fast as rapids to rescue her. His basement already bubbled with water. He listened until her screams stopped. They found her body later in the marsh behind her home.
''New York is getting $60 billion? When? Where?'' Mr. Lisa said. ''Show it to me. We'll be O.K., but this was a great neighborhood of cops, firemen and sanitation men. A lot of us are hurting here.''
There are few sights less edifying than self-satisfied men giving themselves a fiscal conservative rubdown as a stretch of America lies ruined. United States Senator Dan Coats of Indiana assured the Northeast last week that he cared deeply, even as he tried to surgically remove more than half the hurricane relief package.
''An emergency funding bill should focus on the emergency needs of the victims, not the needs of politicians,'' he noted primly, adding that loading up an expensive package ''with unrelated projects and earmarks for other states is not the way we should use taxpayer dollars.''
No doubt the keen-eyed could discover lard in the rescue package. Our politicians are as expert as those of Indiana, South Carolina and Mississippi in mining a budget for riches.
The cost of disaster aid has crept up, fueled by the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and Hurricane Katrina, to the point that the Federal Reserve recently found that most cities, whatever their bitter losses, no longer suffer any long-term economic declines from natural disasters.
That might be seen as cause for celebration. Or not. Senator Coats has many complaints. Only $9 billion of the Senate rescue package, he says, would be spent in the next nine months. And it should not include money for the Legal Services Corporation.
THIS last is a tip-off as to the game afoot, as the Legal Services Corporation long ago achieved Hezbollah status in the Republican cosmology. I nosed around and found that after tornadoes and all manner of disasters in Missouri, Tennessee, Mississippi and Kentucky, Legal Services lawyers helped broken families and businesses file insurance, FEMA and unemployment claims.
Tug still harder on the yarn ball of these arguments and the filaments come apart. Some money will not be spent quickly? Guilty as charged: It takes many months to fortify boilers and elevators in public housing, to replace subway electrical systems and rebuild nursing homes and beaches.
House and Senate Republican leaders seem particularly distressed when our politicians talk of safeguarding our region against the next globally warmed torrent of ocean water. This carries the unwelcome scent of free spending.
Representative Rogers is a more practical man when playing locally. After floodwaters ripped through Kentucky in 2010, he announced that he had snared $2 million in federal dollars so various rural hamlets could put up flood walls and diversionary canals.
Years ago, as a reporter, I sat in post-Katrina Gulfport, Miss., and listened as Gov. Haley Barbour, a Republican, crowed of raking in federal aid. I might have felt more enthusiastic had I not just heard his people boast that federal cash would change the ''Redneck Riviera'' into a more upscale locale.
Whatever. In my city, in my region, the musty whiff of disaster hangs heavy, and our politicians talk of keeping neighborhoods whole. That commitment, to quickly rebuilding neighborhoods within reason, offers a good definition of the commonweal.

HEADLINE: Shares End Higher on Hope for Fiscal Deal

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Stocks were driven sharply higher on the last day of the year by signs that a resolution to the fiscal negotiations in Washington could come within days.
Traders hung on every word out of Washington on Monday, sending share prices on a jerky path upward on what is usually a quiet day of trading ahead of the New Year's Day holiday.
It ended up being the best day for American stocks since the middle of November and was enough to push leading indexes into positive territory for December. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index finished the day up 1.7 percent, bringing the year's gains to 13.4 percent. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3 percent for the day and 7.3 percent for 2012. 
The government was expected to go over the so-called fiscal cliff on Monday night, when a package of tax increases and spending cuts was set to start being phased in. But the political signals out of Washington convinced many investors that the White House and Congress would avert the changes that would be most damaging to the economy. ''By day's end, the assumption was that a deal was in hand -- minor details needed to be worked out, but a finished product would be in the books within the next few days,'' said Daniel Greenhaus, chief global strategist at BTIG. ''Investors that had spent the last couple of days trading down reversed that trend and took things higher.''
Late Monday evening, a tentative deal was reached that would raise taxes on incomes above $400,000.
The market's jump, much of which occurred after an early-afternoon news conference by President Obama, brought an unexpected end to a day that began with continuing bickering in Washington and a sense of foreboding on Wall Street. Stocks had fallen steadily for most of the last week and opened the day trading down.
Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the leader of the Republican minority, said late in the day that an agreement was ''very, very close.''
Stocks could easily lose their gains if either chamber of Congress is unable to pass the compromise that was being negotiated on Monday. Senators said they were hoping to agree upon legislation and pass it along to the House for a vote on Tuesday. Some details of the agreement were still unclear, and the Republican-controlled House could demand changes.
The stock markets are closed on Tuesday, and most traders will be back at their desk Wednesday morning after a week of vacations and light trading.
Even if there is an agreement, it is unlikely to resolve a separate debate over the limit on the amount the government can borrow. The government hit its self-imposed debt ceiling on Monday, and Treasury Department officials have said they will be able to finance the budget for only a few weeks using emergency measures.
Some Republicans have said they want to use the debate over the debt ceiling to extract more spending cuts from Democrats. Investors are preparing for another bout of volatile trading if that happens.
The year did end with many market strategists in an optimistic mood about the American economy, once the fiscal talks in Washington are out of the way.
''While fiscal policy and political gridlock are negatives, there are other factors that remain supportive of growth, including a modest recovery in housing and further improvements in household balance sheets,'' BlackRock's chief investment strategist, Russ Koesterich, said in a note to clients.
The Standard & Poor's 500 index climbed 1.7 percent, or 23.76 points, to 1,426.19. The Dow Jones industrial average was up 1.3 percent, or 166.03 points, to 13,104.14. The Nasdaq composite index rose 2 percent, or 59.20 points, to 3,019.51.

HEADLINE: Coveting Horns, Ruthless Smugglers' Rings Put Rhinos in the Cross Hairs

BYLINE: By JEFFREY GETTLEMAN; Gaia Pianigiani contributed reporting from Rome.

 BODY:
KRUGER NATIONAL PARK, South Africa -- They definitely did not look like ordinary big-game hunters, the stream of slender young Thai women who showed up on the veld wearing tight bluejeans and sneakers.
But the rhinoceros carcasses kept piling up around them, and it was only after dozens of these hulking, relatively rare animals were dead and their precious horns sawed off that an extravagant scheme came to light.
The Thai women, it ends up, were not hunters at all. Many never even squeezed off a shot. Instead, they were prostitutes hired by a criminal syndicate based 6,000 miles away in Laos to exploit loopholes in big-game hunting rules and get its hands on as many rhino horns as possible -- horns that are now worth more than gold.
''These girls had no idea what they were doing,'' said Paul O'Sullivan, a private investigator in Johannesburg who helped crack the case. ''They thought they were going on safari.'' 
The rhino horn rush has gotten so out of control that it has exploded into a worldwide criminal enterprise, drawing in a surreal cast of characters -- not just Thai prostitutes, but also Irish gangsters, Vietnamese diplomats, Chinese scientists, veterinarians, copter pilots, antiques dealers and recently an American rodeo star looking for a quick buck who used Facebook to find some horns.
Driven by a common belief in Asia that ground-up rhino horns can cure cancer and other ills, the trade has also been embraced by criminal syndicates that normally traffic drugs and guns, but have branched into the underground animal parts business because it is seen as ''low risk, high profit,'' American officials say.
''Get caught smuggling a kilo of cocaine, you will receive a very significant prison sentence,'' said Ed Grace, a deputy chief with the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. But with a kilogram of rhino horn, he added, ''you may only get a fine.''
The typical rhino horn is about two feet long and 10 pounds, much of it formed from the same substance as fingernails. Yet it can fetch nearly $30,000 a pound, more than crack cocaine, and conservationists worry that this ''ridiculous price,'' as one wildlife manager put it, could drive rhinos into extinction.
Gangs are so desperate for new sources of horn that criminals have even smashed into dozens of glass museum cases all across Europe to snatch them from exhibits.
''Astonishment and rage, that's what we felt,'' said Paolo Agnelli, a manager at the Florence Museum of Natural History, after three rhino horns were stolen last year, including a very rare one from 1824.
American federal agents recently staged a cross-country undercover rhino horn sting operation, called Operation Crash, ''crash'' being the term for a herd of rhinos.
Among the 12 people arrested: Wade Steffen, a champion steer wrestler from Texas, who pleaded guilty in May to trafficking dozens of horns that he found through hunters, estate sales and Facebook; and two members of an Irish gang -- the same gang suspected of breaking into the museums in Europe.
In an e-mail to an undercover agent, an Irish gangster bragged: ''Believe me WE NEVER LOSES A HORN TO CUSTOMS, we have so many contacts and people payed off now we can bring anything we want out of nearly any country into Europe.''
Corruption is a huge element, just like in the illegal ivory trade, in which rebel groups, government armies and threadbare hunters have been wiping out tens of thousands of elephants throughout Africa, selling the tusks to sophisticated criminal networks that move them across the globe with the help of corrupt officials.
Here in South Africa, home to the majority of the world's last surviving 28,000 rhinos or so, the country is throwing just about everything it has to stop the slaughter -- thousands of rangers, the national army, a new spy plane, even drones -- but it is losing.
The number of rhinos poached in South Africa has soared in the past five years, from 13 killed in 2007 to more than 630 in 2012. The prehistoric, battleship-gray animals are often found on their knees, bleeding to death from a gaping stump on their face.
''Ever seen a dead rhino?'' asked Philip Jonker, who works for a private security firm that has gone into wildlife protection. ''It's worse than going to a funeral.''
The only answer, some contend, is to legalize the trade, which would flood the market with rhino horns, lower the price and dissuade rhino poachers from risking their lives -- or so the argument goes. Rhino horns regenerate, and the horns can be shaved down every few years and sold off without significantly hurting the animal.
One of most passionate advocates of this legalization movement is John Hume, a South African entrepreneur who now owns more than 800 rhinos, with names like Curly, Titan, Hillary and Pinocchio, and has amassed a 2,000-pound mountain of horn worth millions of dollars -- if he is ever allowed to sell it.
''Why shouldn't the person who breeds rhino get a reward?'' he asks.
Every time Mr. Hume's ranch hands trim down a few rhinos, they organize an armed escort to take the horns straight to a safe-deposit box in a bank because the same gangs that waylay armored bank trucks are now cruising around South Africa looking for rhino horns.
But many wildlife groups say legalizing the rhino trade would be a disaster.
''The consuming power in my country is growing so rapidly that the supply would never meet the needs,'' said Jeff He, spokesman for the Chinese branch of the International Fund for Animal Welfare. ''And besides, it'll always be cheaper to poach an animal than raise it.''
Kruger National Park, an enormous wildlife refuge in South Africa's northeast, is where many rhinos are being poached. The park lies on the border with Mozambique, a much poorer country still scarred from years of civil war. Park rangers say Mozambican gunmen are pouring through Kruger's chain link fences, downing rhinos left and right.
Some sophisticated poaching rings use helicopters to spot the animals and veterinarians to dart them with tranquilizers. Others don women's shoes, to leave misleading tracks. ''At any one time, there are up to 10 groups operating inside the Kruger,'' said Ken Maggs, a South African National Parks official. ''These guys are trying new methods daily.''
Scientists say that maybe a million rhinos once roamed the earth, and for some reason, humans have been fascinated with the horn for ages. The ancient Persians thought rhino horn vessels could detect poisons. The Chinese thought rhino horn powder could reduce fevers. The Yemenis prized the horn for coming-of-age daggers, presented to teenage boys as a sign of manhood.
In Asia, faith in traditional cures runs strong, fueling demand as Asian economies grow, though there is no scientific proof that rhino horn can cure cancer.
In 2008, a Vietnamese diplomat in South Africa's capital, Pretoria, was caught on camera receiving rhino horn -- in the parking lot of the embassy. Around the same time, a Chinese company opened a secretive rhino breeding center in Hainan Province, reportedly to produce rhino-based medicine.
In the past 50 years, the overall rhino population has plummeted by more than 90 percent, despite an international ban on the trade in rhino parts since 1977.
But in South Africa, it is legal to hunt rhinos, creating the loophole that the Thai prostitutes sauntered through. Hunters must agree to keep the horn set (rhinos have a large front and smaller back horn) as a trophy and not sell it, and hunters are allowed to kill only one white rhino every 12 months. (Black rhinos are critically endangered and very few are hunted in South Africa.)
According to South African law enforcement officials, gang leaders in Thailand and Laos decided that to maximize the number of rhinos they could kill, they would enlist Thai prostitutes who were already in South Africa with valid passports, which were used for the hunting permits. The women then tagged along on the hunts, often dressed in catchy pinks and blues, but somebody else -- usually a professional hunter -- pulled the trigger.
''I don't know whose idea it was to use the ladies, but it was a damn good one,'' said Mr. O'Sullivan, the private investigator.
None of the two dozen or so prostitutes involved have been prosecuted -- the intent was to get the big fish. So Mr. O'Sullivan leaked a photograph of an enormous stockpile of ivory and rhino horns to one of the women, along with a message for her boss, a bespectacled Thai man named Chumlong Lemtongthai, that everything was for sale: ''I wanted the big man himself to come here and negotiate.''
Mr. Lemtongthai did exactly that, and he was arrested soon after. He pleaded guilty and was sentenced in November to 40 years.
''I do not want to see a situation where my grandchildren will only be able to see rhino in a picture,'' said the judge, Prince Manyathi.

HEADLINE: Chief Justice Prods Congress to Resolve Budget Talks and Control National Debt

BYLINE: By ADAM LIPTAK

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. used his year-end report on the federal judiciary to give Congressional budget negotiators a little nudge.
''Our country faces new challenges, including the much-publicized 'fiscal cliff' and the longer-term problem of a truly extravagant and burgeoning national debt,'' he wrote. ''No one seriously doubts that the country's fiscal ledger has gone awry. The public properly looks to its elected officials to craft a solution.'' 
The chief justice said that his branch of the government provided an example of doing much with few resources. The federal judiciary makes do with a budget appropriation of about $7 billion, he wrote, ''a mere two-tenths of 1 percent of the United States' total budget of $3.7 trillion.''
''Yes,'' he went on, ''for each citizen's tax dollar, only two-tenths of one penny goes toward funding the entire third branch of government!''
In the report, Chief Justice Roberts said the judiciary was doing what it could to cut costs in rent, salaries and computer services. The Supreme Court ''continues to set a good example,'' he said, asking for a smaller appropriation in the last fiscal year than in the previous one. This fiscal year, the request rose slightly, ''largely in response to new judicial security needs,'' he said. He did not elaborate.
An appendix to the chief justice's report on the workload of the federal courts showed decreases in the Supreme Court's docket and in the number of cases it is deciding. In the term that ended last year, the number of requests for Supreme Court review dropped by almost two percent from the previous term. The justices issued just 64 signed opinions in the most recent term, down from 75.
The federal courts went to great lengths last year in trying circumstances, notably after Hurricane Sandy. ''As just one example,'' he said, ''the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York conducted emergency hearings in Lower Manhattan the day after the storm hit, working in a building without heat or hot water that was only sparsely lit by gas-fueled emergency generators.'' Though Chief Justice Roberts did not say so, the Supreme Court also showed fortitude the day the storm hit, hearing arguments when the rest of official Washington was closed.
He called on President Obama and Congress ''to be especially attentive to the needs of the judicial branch and provide the resources necessary to its operation.''
''Because the judiciary has already pursued cost containment so aggressively, it will become increasingly difficult to economize further without reducing the quality of judicial services,'' he wrote. ''Virtually all of the judiciary's core functions are constitutionally and statutorily required. Unlike executive branch agencies, the courts do not have discretionary programs they can eliminate or projects they can postpone.''
The number of judicial vacancies does not help matters, he went on. ''At the close of 2012, 27 of the existing judicial vacancies are designated as presenting judicial emergencies,'' he wrote. ''I urge the executive and legislative branches to act diligently in nominating and confirming highly qualified candidates to fill those vacancies.''

HEADLINE: A Year of Market Gains, Despite Turmoil

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A year ago, some thought 2012 was destined to be the year that the euro zone -- and maybe even the entire European Union -- broke up. The banks that supported their governments, and that in turn depended on those same governments for bailouts if they went broke, were deemed to be particularly vulnerable to disaster. 
It did not happen, and while the euro zone countries hardly solved their economic problems, the Continent's stock markets turned out to be good investments in 2012, with bank shares among the best performers. The same could be said about the United States, where the broad stock market posted double-digit gains and Bank of America shares doubled in 2012, albeit from a very depressed level.
Over all, the Standard & Poor's Euro 350-stock index was up 13 percent for the year, measured in euros, and more than 15 percent measured in dollars. The S.& P. 500 wound up the year with a gain of 13 percent.
It may have been typical of 2012 that it was politicians and central bankers -- not economic news or corporate developments -- that dominated investor attention. As the year ended, the difference was that it was Washington, not Europe, where the squabbles were taking place.
For much of the year, it appeared that the European squabbles were leading nowhere, and by midsummer, markets were pessimistic about the outcome. Finally, Mario Draghi, the president of the European Central Bank, took decisive action to assure that the banks -- and the governments that depended on them -- would have access to funds. That did not turn around recessionary conditions in much of the euro zone, but it was enough to turn around financial markets. Prices of government bonds in many of the most troubled countries began to rise. Those who bet that Europe would solve its problems did well in the financial markets.
The accompanying charts show the performance of stocks in 10 economic sectors in both Europe and the United States, both in 2012 and since Oct. 9, 2007, the day that world stock markets peaked before what would turn out to be a world recession and credit crisis.
What stands out is how well financial stocks and consumer discretionary stocks did during 2012. The latter stocks are things purchased by consumers that are likely to do better when the economy is improving. In the United States, the two best such stocks in the S.& P. 500 were PulteGroup, a homebuilder, and Whirlpool, an appliance maker.
But while Europe did better in 2012, it remains much farther from recovering all of the losses experienced since the 2007 peak. The American index is just 9 percent lower than that, while the European index is about a third below where it was then. The only sectors that have completely made up their losses on both sides of the Atlantic are health care and consumer staples. In the United States, the consumer discretionary and information technology sectors have also done so, although the latter sector's performance is largely because of Apple, whose shares are more than three times as high as they were in 2007.

HEADLINE: A Tepid Fiscal Agreement

 BODY:
For the first time since President George W. Bush began the country's long slide into debt by cutting taxes in 2001, an agreement was reached late Monday in the Senate to raise income taxes on the rich. That's what makes the deal significant: assuming it is approved by the House, it begins to reverse the ruinous pattern of dealing with Washington's fiscal problems only through spending cuts.
Nonetheless, this deal is a weak brew that remains far too generous to the rich and fails to bring in enough revenue to deal with the nation's deep need for public investments. Given that the Bush-era tax cuts expire on Jan. 1, Republicans were forced to give ground on their philosophical opposition to higher taxes, but they made it impossible to reach a farsighted agreement that truly grappled with government's role in fostering improvements to education, transportation and manufacturing. 
The deal, hammered out by the Obama administration and Senate Republican leaders, raises income taxes to Clinton-era levels on families making more than $450,000 a year and individuals making $400,000. That's a far cry from the $250,000 threshold that Mr. Obama said defined the upper range of the middle class in the campaign.
But White House officials said they had to compromise on that number to win renewal of important provisions that would otherwise have expired: unemployment insurance for three million people, tax credits for low-income working families, and a reduction in the impact of the alternative minimum tax on many middle-class families. Republicans cynically used those vital measures as bargaining chips. (What was not a point of contention was allowing the payroll tax to go back up by 2 percentage points.)
The higher income threshold isn't the only price the White House wound up paying. The estate tax on the nation's biggest inheritances is going up slightly but not nearly enough (estates of more than $5 million would be taxed at 40 percent, up from the current 35 percent) in a big and unnecessary giveaway to the very richest families. Significantly, the estate tax rate would be made permanent, while the credits for low-income families would expire in five years. Capital gains and dividend tax rates go up to 20 percent from the current 15 percent, but again, only for families making more than $450,000 a year.
The White House argues that it achieved 85 percent of its revenue goals, raising $600 billion over a decade, a third of which comes by phasing out exemptions and deductions for people with incomes greater than $250,000 a year. And Republicans achieved none of the draconian spending cuts they wanted.
But that battle is far from over. Negotiators have yet to work out a deal to stop the arbitrary spending cuts known as the sequester, which are scheduled to slash $110 billion from the defense and domestic budgets beginning this week. And Republicans are waiting for the Treasury to hit its debt limit in a few weeks, hoping to once again extort more spending cuts.
President Obama has ruled out any negotiations over the debt ceiling, and, on Monday, he vowed that revenue increases must match any further spending cuts. But as this deal shows, he often compromises at the last minute, and, in this case, it was Senate Democrats who undercut him on both the estate tax and the income tax threshold, making it hard to remain adamant.
The fiscal-cliff agreement could still be blown up by the House, which would not be out of character. But a cleareyed look at the deal's limitations shows how much Republicans have gotten for their intransigence.

HEADLINE: New Old Dating Tip: If You've Got It, Flaunt It

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Perfect 10? Never Mind That. Ask Her for Her Credit Score'' (front page, Dec. 25):
Jessica LaShawn's date as well as Josephine La Bella's boyfriend are being extremely shortsighted. While it's true that a low credit score could be indicative of spending habits that are diametrically opposed to yours, it's more likely an indication of today's economic landscape. 
When I met my husband five years ago, he was recovering from a divorce that devastated him financially, and his credit score was very bad. I had a six-figure income, made three times what he did and had a credit rating in the high 700s.
Well guess what? Since that time he's gone to school, improved his job and struggled to bring the credit rating up. I lost my high-paying job, am making a third of what I used to and considered bankruptcy.
I still technically have a ''good'' credit rating, but it really doesn't reflect my financial status. You could be making six figures and have a bad credit score or vice versa.
Bottom line: Next time one of these shallow guys ask for your credit score on a first date, tell him you'll share it after he shows you his bank account.
LISA GOLDHAMER Edison, N.J., Dec. 26, 2012
To the Editor:
How cheering it was to read about sharing credit scores. At 90, and after a marriage that lasted more than 65 years, I realized that I had never asked for my late wife's credit score, nor had she for mine. What an oversight!
We had the good fortune to be born into a world that gave credit to qualities other than ostentatious wealth: our children and the other virtues that warmed our spirits and brightened our lives.
Perhaps next year will bring a new scale. Meantime, my condolences to those who recall a different time on the dating scene.

HEADLINE: The Emancipation of Abe Lincoln

BYLINE: By ERIC FONER. 
Eric Foner is a professor of history at Columbia and the author, most recently, of ''The Fiery Trial: Abraham Lincoln and American Slavery.''

 BODY:
ONE hundred and fifty years ago, on Jan. 1, 1863, Abraham Lincoln presided over the annual White House New Year's reception. Late that afternoon, he retired to his study to sign the Emancipation Proclamation. When he took up his pen, his hand was shaking from exhaustion. Briefly, he paused -- ''I do not want it to appear as if I hesitated,'' he remarked. Then Lincoln affixed a firm signature to the document.
Like all great historical transformations, emancipation was a process, not a single event. It arose from many causes and was the work of many individuals. It began at the outset of the Civil War, when slaves sought refuge behind Union lines. It did not end until December 1865, with the ratification of the 13th Amendment, which irrevocably abolished slavery throughout the nation.
But the Emancipation Proclamation was the crucial turning point in this story. In a sense, it embodied a double emancipation: for the slaves, since it ensured that if the Union emerged victorious, slavery would perish, and for Lincoln himself, for whom it marked the abandonment of his previous assumptions about how to abolish slavery and the role blacks would play in post-emancipation American life. 
There is no reason to doubt the sincerity of Lincoln's statement in 1864 that he had always believed slavery to be wrong. During the first two years of the Civil War, despite insisting that the conflict's aim was preservation of the Union, he devoted considerable energy to a plan for ending slavery inherited from prewar years. Emancipation would be undertaken by state governments, with national financing. It would be gradual, owners would receive monetary compensation and emancipated slaves would be encouraged to find a homeland outside the United States -- this last idea known as ''colonization.''
Lincoln's plan sought to win the cooperation of slave holders in ending slavery. As early as November 1861, he proposed it to political leaders in Delaware, one of the four border states (along with Kentucky, Maryland and Missouri) that remained in the Union. Delaware had only 1,800 slaves; the institution was peripheral to the state's economy. But Lincoln found that even there, slave holders did not wish to surrender their human property. Nonetheless, for most of 1862, he avidly promoted his plan to the border states and any Confederates who might be interested.
Lincoln also took his proposal to black Americans. In August 1862, he met with a group of black leaders from Washington. He seemed to blame the presence of blacks in America for the conflict: ''but for your race among us there could not be war.'' He issued a powerful indictment of slavery -- ''the greatest wrong inflicted on any people'' -- but added that, because of racism, blacks would never achieve equality in America. ''It is better for us both, therefore, to be separated,'' he said. But most blacks refused to contemplate emigration from the land of their birth.
In the summer of 1862, a combination of events propelled Lincoln in a new direction. Slavery was disintegrating in parts of the South as thousands of slaves ran away to Union lines. With the war a stalemate, more Northerners found themselves agreeing with the abolitionists, who had insisted from the outset that slavery must become a target. Enthusiasm for enlistment was waning in the North. The Army had long refused to accept black volunteers, but the reservoir of black manpower could no longer be ignored. In response, Congress moved ahead of Lincoln, abolishing slavery in the District of Columbia, authorizing the president to enroll blacks in the Army and freeing the slaves of pro-Confederate owners in areas under military control. Lincoln signed all these measures that summer.
The hallmark of Lincoln's greatness was his combination of bedrock principle with open-mindedness and capacity for growth. That summer, with his preferred approach going nowhere, he moved in the direction of immediate emancipation. He first proposed this to his cabinet on July 22, but Secretary of State William H. Seward persuaded him to wait for a military victory, lest it seem an act of desperation.
Soon after the Union victory at Antietam in September, Lincoln issued the Preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, a warning to the Confederacy that if it did not lay down its arms by Jan. 1, he would declare the slaves ''forever free.''
Lincoln did not immediately abandon his earlier plan. His annual message to Congress, released on Dec. 1, 1862, devoted a long passage to gradual, compensated abolition and colonization. But in the same document, without mentioning the impending proclamation, he indicated that a new approach was imperative: ''The dogmas of the quiet past, are inadequate to the stormy present,'' he wrote. ''We must disenthrall our selves, and then we shall save our country.'' Lincoln included himself in that ''we.'' On Jan. 1, he proclaimed the freedom of the vast majority of the nation's slaves.
The Emancipation Proclamation is perhaps the most misunderstood of the documents that have shaped American history. Contrary to legend, Lincoln did not free the nearly four million slaves with a stroke of his pen. It had no bearing on slaves in the four border states, since they were not in rebellion. It also exempted certain parts of the Confederacy occupied by the Union. All told, it left perhaps 750,000 slaves in bondage. But the remaining 3.1 million, it declared, ''are, and henceforward shall be free.''
The proclamation did not end slavery in the United States on the day it was issued. Indeed, it could not even be enforced in most of the areas where it applied, which were under Confederate control. But it ensured the eventual death of slavery -- assuming the Union won the war. Were the Confederacy to emerge victorious, slavery, in one form or another, would undoubtedly have lasted a long time.
A military order, whose constitutional legitimacy rested on the president's war powers, the proclamation often disappoints those who read it. It is dull and legalistic; it contains no soaring language enunciating the rights of man. Only at the last minute, at the urging of Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, an abolitionist, did Lincoln add a conclusion declaring the proclamation an ''act of justice.''
Nonetheless, the proclamation marked a dramatic transformation in the nature of the Civil War and in Lincoln's own approach to the problem of slavery. No longer did he seek the consent of slave holders. The proclamation was immediate, not gradual, contained no mention of compensation for owners, and made no reference to colonization.
In it, Lincoln addressed blacks directly, not as property subject to the will of others but as men and women whose loyalty the Union must earn. For the first time, he welcomed black soldiers into the Union Army; over the next two years some 200,000 black men would serve in the Army and Navy, playing a critical role in achieving Union victory. And Lincoln urged freed slaves to go to work for ''reasonable wages'' -- in the United States. He never again mentioned colonization in public.
Having made the decision, Lincoln did not look back. In 1864, with casualties mounting, there was talk of a compromise peace. Some urged Lincoln to rescind the proclamation, in which case, they believed, the South could be persuaded to return to the Union. Lincoln refused. Were he to do so, he told one visitor, ''I should be damned in time and eternity.''
Wartime emancipation may have settled the fate of slavery, but it opened another vexing question: the role of former slaves in American life. Colonization had allowed its proponents to talk about abolition without having to confront this issue; after all, the black population would be gone. After Jan. 1, 1863, Lincoln for the first time began to think seriously of the United States as a biracial society.
While not burdened with the visceral racism of many of his white contemporaries, Lincoln shared some of their prejudices. He had long seen blacks as an alien people who had been unjustly uprooted from their homeland and were entitled to freedom, but were not an intrinsic part of American society. During his Senate campaign in Illinois, in 1858, he had insisted that blacks should enjoy the same natural rights as whites (life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness), but he opposed granting them legal equality or the right to vote.
By the end of his life, Lincoln's outlook had changed dramatically. In his last public address, delivered in April 1865, he said that in reconstructing Louisiana, and by implication other Southern states, he would ''prefer'' that limited black suffrage be implemented. He singled out the ''very intelligent'' (educated free blacks) and ''those who serve our cause as soldiers'' as most worthy. Though hardly an unambiguous embrace of equality, this was the first time an American president had endorsed any political rights for blacks.
And then there was his magnificent second inaugural address of March 4, 1865, in which Lincoln ruminated on the deep meaning of the war. He now identified the institution of slavery -- not the presence of blacks, as in 1862 -- as its fundamental cause. The war, he said, might well be a divine punishment for the evil of slavery. And God might will it to continue until all the wealth the slaves had created had been destroyed, and ''until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid by another drawn with the sword.'' Lincoln was reminding Americans that violence did not begin with the firing on Fort Sumter, S.C., in April 1861. What he called ''this terrible war'' had been preceded by 250 years of the terrible violence of slavery.
In essence, Lincoln asked the nation to confront unblinkingly the legacy of slavery. What were the requirements of justice in the face of this reality? What would be necessary to enable former slaves and their descendants to enjoy fully the pursuit of happiness? Lincoln did not live to provide an answer. A century and a half later, we have yet to do so.

HEADLINE: Subway Victim Remembered as Always Lending a Hand

BYLINE: By VIVIAN YEE

 BODY:
Sunando Sen had no close relatives still living, nor had he started a family in his adopted home of New York. So it was the close circle of friends whom he had come to call his family in the United States that gathered to pray for his soul and cremate his body on Monday, four days after he was pushed onto subway tracks in Queens and crushed by a train.
At St. Michael's Cemetery in East Elmhurst, Queens, those friends -- about 20 old roommates, former co-workers and members of his Hindu temple -- chanted as they bore his pale-blue coffin through the doors of the small chapel off the crematorium. One flicked holy water over the others as they placed incense, candles, puffed rice and bananas on paper plates around the raised coffin, reciting and singing Hindu prayers and mantras. 
Mr. Sen, 46, was pushed from behind onto the tracks at the 40th Street-Lowery Street station in Sunnyside around 8 p.m. Thursday. With no chance to defend himself or react, he was pinned under an incoming No. 7 train. On Saturday, the police arrested Erika Menendez, 31, who they said told investigators she shoved Mr. Sen onto the tracks because she believed he was a Hindu or a Muslim and she wanted to retaliate for the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.
Ms. Menendez was charged with second-degree murder as a hate crime. For years, according to friends and law enforcement officials, she had suffered from mental illness, receiving psychiatric treatment from at least two city hospitals. Her turbulent past included at least three arrests, two for violent outbursts.
No one at Mr. Sen's cremation ceremony publicly mentioned his attacker. As a few in the small crowd took photos, others busied themselves with lighting the votive candles. Adapting elements of a traditional Hindu send-off, several men walked in counterclockwise circles around their friend's coffin as they chanted the Hare Krishna, praying that Mr. Sen's soul would separate peacefully from his body. In preparation for the burning, a mourner set the bananas, puffed rice, leaves and other offerings atop the flowers that blanketed Mr. Sen's body before pouring a jug of milk into the coffin.
A temple representative asked for a minute of silence. ''Forgive him,'' he said. ''Pray for him, for peace in his soul.''
With a final prayer, the mourners followed the coffin to the crematorium and chanted as it slid toward the flames.
Customarily, Hindu funeral rites are performed by the deceased's brother, son or other close relative alongside religious elders. But both of Mr. Sen's parents died more than a decade ago in India, where he was born and raised, and he had no siblings. Friends said he had fallen out with more distant relatives in India when his mother died several years after he arrived in New York, and was no longer in contact with them.
It was his lack of family ties in India that kept him in New York even after he failed to finish his doctorate in economics at New York University about 15 years ago, friends said. Though he had lost the scholarship that brought him here, he decided to stay in the country and found a job at a copy center in the East Village, where he worked until quitting soon before he suffered a stroke in October 2011.
He was quiet, friends recalled, but generous with favors. People frequently asked him to fix their electronic devices, and he almost always could. He enjoyed movies -- up to three a day -- American literature and Indian religious music, they remembered.
''You ask him 10 questions, you probably get two answers,'' said Mohammad Rahman, 34. ''But any problem, he was the guy. He was a very talented and cool guy.''
Mr. Sen had been a promising student, earning a master's degree with first-class honors in economics at one of India's most prestigious universities, Jawaharlal Nehru University in New Delhi. But his friends said that his mother's death and his failure to complete his Ph.D. propelled him into depression and sapped him of ambition.
After he recovered from his stroke, however, Mr. Sen decided to start a copy business of his own on the Upper West Side, relying on an initial investment from his oldest friend and former roommate, Sanjeeb Das. He called it Amsterdam Copy Center. And after years of shaking his head at his friends' urgings to marry and start a family, he had allowed his friends to begin looking for a wife for him in the Hindu Bengali community.
He felt he belonged in New York. '' 'I don't want to go back there,' '' to India, one of his oldest friends, Ashim Dey, 48, recalled Mr. Sen telling him. '' 'You're the people who have to take care of me.' ''

HEADLINE: Bond Craze Could Run Its Course In New Year

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
The big story in the markets this year was not about stocks.
Americans sold off their stock mutual funds, the most popular way to invest in American companies, at the fastest clip since 2008, the year the financial crisis began. That occurred despite the fact that the stock market itself rose steadily; the benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the year up 13.4 percent.
Investors have been opting instead for the assumed safety of bonds. Money has been steadily flowing into mutual funds holding bonds of all sorts for the last four years, but the pace accelerated this year. The percentage of household investments in bonds shot up to 26 percent from 14 percent just five years ago, according to Morningstar.
Entering the new year, a growing number of professional investors are betting that the craze for bonds has gone too far, perhaps dangerously so, as has been evident in the headlines from the year-end reports from large investment firms. ''Bond PAIN in 2013?'' Wells Capital Management's chief strategist asked. ''Caution: Turn Ahead,'' BlackRock analysts wrote. ''The inflection year,'' said Bank of America. 
This is not the first time that analysts have forecast an end to the rally in bond values that has lasted for decades. But previously many of the voices predicting it were pessimists who believed that investors would sell off their bonds when they lost faith in the American government's ability to pay back its bonds, forcing the government and many other bond issuers to pay higher interest rates. When interest rates rise, older bonds with lower interest rates are worth less.
While those previous forecasts have proved expensively wrong, this year the forecasters are being joined by many economic optimists who argue that a strengthening American economy is likely to make investors willing to embrace the risks involved in stocks, luring them out of bonds. The question, they say, is only how quickly it will happen.
''Mathematically, it's next to impossible to get the kind of returns on bonds you've seen over the last few years,'' said Kate Moore, the chief global equity strategist at Bank of America.
When the turn does ultimately come, it is likely to cause pain for at least some of the people who have been investing in bonds in recent years.
''You don't want to be the last one out the door when the trends turn,'' said Rebecca H. Patterson, the chief investment strategist at Bessemer Trust. ''All good things come to an end and we want to make sure we're in front of it.''
Most of the talk of investors shifting money from bonds into stocks relies first on the assumption that politicians in Washington are able to resolve the current impasse over the so-called fiscal cliff, the automatic spending cuts and tax increases that will go into effect if Congress and President Obama do not come to an agreement, and the coming debate over the nation's debt ceiling. (Late Monday evening, the two sides crept closer to a deal, tentatively agreeing to raise taxes on incomes above $400,000.)
But a number of surveys suggest that professional investors are already starting to prepare for a shift. Hedge funds polled by Bank of America said that they had more of their portfolio allocated to stocks than at any time since 2006.
All but one of the 13 bank strategists tracked by Birinyi Associates expects stock markets to rise in 2013. When 2012 began, the same strategists were predicting a downturn in share prices. Even among mutual fund investors, there are signs that the flows out of stocks and into bonds have been slowing down recently.
The preference for bonds has already been costly for retail investors. Over the last year, most types of American bonds have returned less than an investment in the S.& P. 500. When inflation is factored in, the benchmark 10-year Treasury security is delivering negative returns.
But many investors are still rattled by the 2008 financial crisis and the turbulence in the stock markets since then, which have led to wild swings. Over the last five years, all major types of American bonds have done better than leading stock indexes.
The Federal Reserve has been engaged in an aggressive effort to buy bonds and drive down interest rates. The long term goal of that program is to encourage banks to lend money and to drive investors out of bonds. But in the meantime, falling interest rates have made bonds more attractive. The Fed has said it wants to keep rates low until 2015, though it could let them rise sooner if the economy picks up faster than expected. The 10-year Treasury hovered near 4 percent in recent years but has stayed below 2 percent for much of 2012.
A number of big-name investors say they believe that the low rates and economic uncertainty are likely to endure, giving bonds a continuing attraction. William H. Gross, the co-founder of Pimco, and perhaps the world's most famous bond investor, said on Twitter that he expected interest rates would fall further in 2013, in part because of continuing growing pains in the American economy.
Mr. Gross's prediction is particularly notable because in 2011 he bet that interest rates would rise, leading him to sell off some of his firm's Treasury bond holdings. When that bet lost money, Mr. Gross reversed course.
Garth Friesen, the chief investment officer at the hedge fund manager AVM, compared the current situation in the United States to the last few decades in Japan, where investors have continually predicted that interest rates will rise and drive down the value of Japanese bonds. Almost all of those predictions proved wrong as slow economic growth continued to push Japanese interest rates down.
''More money has been lost trying to predict the rotation out of Japanese bonds than almost anywhere else,'' said Mr. Friesen.
But Mr. Friesen says he does believe that the returns from bonds will be lower than they have been in recent years. A Bank of America global bond index has returned 6 percent over the last year, 17 percent over the last three years and 32 percent since 2007.
Most of the predictions that interest rates will stabilize or turn around are based on the belief that an improving American economy will help push unemployment lower, restore confidence in American companies and encourage inflation to start to rise. If inflation does go up, it will make current bond holdings less attractive.
There is growing evidence this is already happening. In addition to the rising stock market, housing prices have begun to move up and unemployment has been trending down.
Ms. Patterson said that this shift was likely to occur slowly, giving investors time to sell off their bond investments without sustaining any significant losses. What is more, a turn in interest rates will not cause the same problems for all bond holders.
Investors who hold bonds directly will continue to collect regular interest payments and will receive back their entire initial investment, the principal, when the terms of the bonds expire. But for people who frequently buy and sell bonds, including mutual funds, the value of the bonds they currently hold will go down when interest rates rise.
Even among bond mutual funds, some types are expected to continue to do well if and when interest rates rise. Bonds that are issued to provide loans to banks generally do well when rates rise. Among corporate bonds, investments in high-yielding speculative companies -- so-called junk bonds -- generally do better in times of rising rates than bonds issued by companies with high credit ratings.
But all of this calculus could be thrown on its head if the doomsayers are right and interest rates rise quickly at some point. That could happen if, say, there were serious military tensions in the Middle East and oil prices spiked suddenly. It could also occur if investors lose faith in the ability of the United States government to pay back investors who buy its bonds.
Tad Rivelle, the head of bond investing at TCW, said that the Federal Reserve's current policy was most likely to fail and kill confidence in Treasury bonds, forcing the government to pay higher interest rates to borrow. But even if the Fed succeeds, Mr. Rivelle said, interest rates will end up in the same place.
''Whether Fed policy succeeds or fails, rates are ultimately going to be going significantly higher,'' said Mr. Rivelle.

HEADLINE: Another Fiscal Flop

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Over the course of the 20th century, America built its welfare state. It was, by and large, a great achievement, expanding opportunity and security for millions. Unfortunately, as the population aged and health care costs surged, it became unaffordable.
Public debt as a percentage of gross domestic product was around 38 percent in 1965. It is around 74 percent now. Debt could approach a ruinous 90 percent of G.D.P. in a decade and a cataclysmic 247 percent of G.D.P. 30 years from now, according to the Congressional Budget Office and JPMorgan. 
By 2025, entitlement spending and debt payments are projected to suck up all federal revenue. Obligations to the elderly are already squeezing programs for the young and the needy. Those obligations will lead to gigantic living standard declines for future generations. According to the International Monetary Fund, meeting America's long-term obligations will require an immediate and permanent 35 percent increase in all taxes and a 35 percent cut in all benefits.
So except for a few rabid debt-deniers, almost everybody agrees we have to do something fundamental to preserve these programs. The problem is that politicians have never found a politically possible way to begin. Every time they tried to reduce debt, they ended up borrowing more and making everything worse.
So Congress and President Obama set up the ''fiscal cliff,'' an artificial disaster scenario that would force them to do the right thing. Obviously, the fiscal cliff negotiations were not going to lead toward the deep structural reforms that will eventually be needed. But they could have begun the reform process.
They could have shown the world that the two parties can work together to avert the eventual calamity. They could have produced a balanced program that would have combined spending cuts and targeted tax increases. They could have reduced Medicare spending on the rich to free up more money for young families.
President Obama and Speaker John Boehner both earnestly wanted to achieve these things. But the deal we are heading toward is discouraging. Yes, the deal does raise $600 billion in revenue over 10 years from a tiny sliver of the population (compared with the $8 trillion in new debt likely to be accrued over that time).
But the proposal is not a balance of taxes and spending cuts. It doesn't involve a single hard decision. It does little to control spending. It abandons all of the entitlement reform ideas that have been thrown around. It locks in low tax rates on families making less than around $450,000; it is simply impossible to avert catastrophe unless tax increases go below that line.
Far from laying the groundwork for future cooperation, it sentences the country to another few years of budget trench warfare. There will be a fight over drastic spending cuts known as sequestration, then over the debt limit and on and on.
The White House envisions a series of stages bringing us closer to fiscal sustainability. I hope that's right. But if Congress couldn't make a single tough decision under these circumstances, why should we think it'll make any further down the road? More likely, there will just be more squabbling and brinkmanship, more posturing and punting, which would not only poison future budget talks but also prospects for immigration reform, tax reform, gun control and many other projects.
Whom should we blame for this? Again, we should not blame Obama and Boehner. In their different ways, they and a number of other people in the Congress are trying to find a politically palatable way to deal with these hard issues. They got what conditions allowed.
Ultimately, we should blame the American voters. The average Medicare couple pays $109,000 into the program and gets $343,000 in benefits out, according to the Urban Institute. This is $234,000 in free money. Many voters have decided they like spending a lot on themselves and pushing costs onto their children and grandchildren. They have decided they like borrowing up to $1 trillion a year for tax credits, disability payments, defense contracts and the rest. They have found that the original Keynesian rationale for these deficits provides a perfect cover for permanent deficit-living. They have made it clear that they will destroy any politician who tries to stop them from cost-shifting in this way.
Most members of Congress are responding efficiently to the popular will. A large number of reactionary Democrats reject any measure to touch Medicare or other entitlement programs. A large number of impotent Republicans talk about reducing the debt, but are incapable of forging a deal that balances tax increases with spending cuts.
The events of the past few weeks demonstrate that these political pressures overwhelm the few realists looking for a more ambitious bargain. The country either doesn't know or doesn't care about the burdens we are placing on our children. No coalition of leaders has successfully confronted the voters, and made them heedful of the ruin they are bringing upon the nation.

HEADLINE: Hold Your Applause Until After The Toasts

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN

 BODY:
Gentlemen, ladies, please take your seats.
It is time for DealBook's annual "Closing Dinner," where we toast - and more important, roast - the deal makers of 2012 (and some of the still-hammering-out-the-fiscal-cliff-deal makers).
This year's dinner is in Washington so that some of esteemed attendees can run back for negotiations.
We have a number of Wall Street deal makers at the front table: Jamie Dimon, Lloyd C. Blankfein and Warren E. Buffett. They may have an easier time negotiating than some of our elected officials because, as Mr. Buffett likes to say, "My idea of a group decision is to look in the mirror." 
Across the way is Steven A. Cohen of SAC Capital. We sat him next to Preet Bharara, the United States attorney for the Southern District of New York, so they could get to know each other a little better. Steve, a little advice: don't let Preet borrow your cellphone.
Greg Smith, the former Goldman Sachs banker who wrote a tell-all called "Why I Left Goldman Sachs," is here. Mr. Smith managed to wangle a reported $1.5 million payday from his publisher, but his book sold poorly and his publisher was left with a huge loss. Nice to see you learned something from your years in banking, Greg.
Timothy F. Geithner and Ben S. Bernanke are sitting at the dais this year, as is Mario Draghi. Strangely, they are playing Monopoly under the table with real dollar bills. (I heard Mr. Bernanke tell Mr. Draghi, "We can always print more.")
The board of Hewlett-Packard is at the table at the back. Senator Harry Reid and Senator Mitch McConnell, whatever you do, don't ask Meg Whitman for pointers on how to make the numbers work.
We're pleased that Speaker John Boehner also decided to join us this year. We had asked him to invite some other senior members of his caucus, but as you can see from the empty seats at his table, none of them were willing to join him. So we've stuck him next to Vikram Pandit.
Mitt Romney just arrived and is sitting at the table sponsored by the Private Equity Growth Capital Council. He is with some of his supporters, among them Leon Cooperman of Omega Advisors and the Koch Brothers. And yes, Mitt, there is a hidden video camera in the floral arrangement in front of you.
Finally, a quick thank you to the folks from Barclays and UBS. Their teams who got caught up in the Libor scandal agreed to pay for tonight's dinner. Apparently, there is some dispute with the caterer, however, because the bankers are trying to set the rate. (Rimshot.)
And now, before the humor runs out (if it hasn't already), onto the official toasts and roasts of 2012:
TURNAROUND OF THE YEAR Robert H. Benmosche, A.I.G.'s chief executive, take a bow. The bailout of your company at the height of the financial crisis will probably never be popular, but it will be profitable. (And it should be a bit more popular, too.)
The Treasury Department sold its last shares in the company in 2012, racking up a profit of $22.7 billion for taxpayers. Mr. Benmosche, a tough-talking executive who at one point early in his tenure at A.I.G. threatened to quit because of efforts by the government to meddle in the business, revived a company that had been left for dead. Most of the media, the pundits and the speculators got it wrong. You got it right. We do all owe you a thank you.
LEADERSHIP LESSON: JAMIE DIMON Mr. Dimon, the biggest failure of your career happened in 2012 with the loss of more than $5 billion by a group of your traders, including one known as the "London Whale." Many C.E.O.'s would have lost their jobs and certainly would not be given a toast.
But you did something most executives would not have done: you admitted to the mistake. In an age when it's almost de rigueur on Wall Street to hide problems, obfuscate and shade the truth, you told it how it was: "We have egg on our face, and we deserve any criticism we get."
That's not to say the situation was handled perfectly; the lack of details about the loss and your continued pushback against regulations raised more questions than answers. But your insistence that "We made a terrible, egregious mistake" is a lesson in leadership for your peers.
CREDIT WHERE CREDIT IS DUE: MARIO DRAGHI Mr. Draghi, the economist and former Goldman Sachs banker turned president of the European Central Bank, nearly single-handedly saved the euro zone in 2012. In a master stroke, he said: "Within our mandate, the E.C.B. is ready to do whatever it takes to preserve the euro."
That sentence will go down in history for the confidence it inspired in the markets and in countries like Greece, Spain and Italy that were thought to be on the precipice. Through behind-the-scenes shuttle diplomacy with leaders like Angela Merkel of Germany and Mario Monti of Italy, Mr. Draghi was able to convince reluctant politicians that it was in his purview to start buying up bonds if a country needed help - and requested it. So far, his comments alone have served as a remarkable backstop; no country has sought his help.
A BOARD IN NEED OF HELP, AGAIN Bashing the board of Hewlett-Packard is becoming boring. Its members, who have routinely turned over, had another tough year.
The company's stock fell about 45 percent. H.P. disclosed that its $11.7 billion acquisition of Autonomy, in which it paid an 80 percent premium, had turned out to be a mess (which wasn't exactly a secret) - or worse, a fraud. But in a strange twist, perhaps trying to remove some of the blame for the disaster of a deal, the board attributed at least $5 billion of the write-down of the deal simply to accounting chicanery.
Some have questioned H.P.'s math. Perhaps some of the write-down is the result of accounting problems, but $5 billion? C'mon. Hewlett's board, however, still has some friends: It has paid an estimated $81 million to Wall Street to help orchestrate some its failed deals in recent years.
SEEKING FACEBOOK 'FRIENDS' Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's C.E.O., has been attending our "Closing Dinner" for years. (He wore Adidas flip-flops to his first.) Back then, he was the "It" boy - the one everyone in the room wanted to "friend." This year, after Facebook pursued its I.P.O., some investors want to "unfriend" him.
As everyone knows, the market has not been kind to Facebook shares, which were sold at $38 a share and at one point this year dropped by half. The good news is that Facebook's shares have rebounded and are now at about $26 a share; the bad news is that long-term shareholders are still down about 30 percent.
With questions about Facebook's privacy policies and mobile strategy still at the fore, Mr. Zuckerberg has some work to do. Hopefully, when we reconvene next year, more investors will want to sit at your table. (My apologies for sticking you next to Andrew Mason of Groupon.)
YAHOO FINALLY GETS IT RIGHT For nearly the last five years, if not decade, Yahoo had clearly lost its luster. It went through a series of C.E.O.'s, its best engineers left to work at Google and Facebook, and its stock had tanked.
Enter Daniel S. Loeb, the activist investor. He saw value where others didn't. He also used some clever powers of persuasion to get on the company's board: He ousted Scott Thompson, Yahoo's new chief (remember him?) for lying on his résumé by saying he had a computer science degree when, in truth, he had an accounting degree. That sleuthing, and the ensuing embarrassment for the board, gave Mr. Loeb an opening to get his slate of directors on the board.
But most important, once he got on the board, he did something nobody expected: He hired Marissa Mayer, a true Silicon Valley star from Google, to run the company. The jury is still out on the company's future, but for the first time in ages, people are talking about the company as if it actually has a future. Kudos.

HEADLINE: Again Biden Gets the Call From the Other Team

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
Another year, another fourth-quarter summons off the fiscal bench for Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.
The late entry of Mr. Biden into the tax and spending talks that have consumed the capital over the last two months recalls his role in the debt crisis of 2011 and again seems to have been critical toward cutting through the deadlock. 
Mr. Biden, below, was handed the ball not by President Obama but by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican minority leader, who called the vice president after growing frustrated by negotiations with the Democratic majority leader, Senator Harry Reid of Nevada. Mr. McConnell and Mr. Biden have had good relations going back to their years together in the Senate.
As soon as the talks boiled down to Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell, the path to a tentative agreement on taxes became relatively short. The two talked late into the night on Sunday, with their last call around 12:45 a.m.
Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell were back on the phone at 6:30 a.m. on Monday, and by the afternoon Mr. Obama and Mr. McConnell were reporting a near deal. The vice president and the senator had agreed on a compromise to raise some tax rates, renew a variety of tax credits, increase the estate tax on the wealthy and extend unemployment insurance. But the two remained in talks about how long to postpone automatic spending cuts due to take effect this week.
It was not as if Mr. Biden had not been part of the jockeying over the two months before the call from Mr. McConnell. He sat in on the meetings and advised the president on what to do. But he was largely a secondary figure as long as the action was centered on the House, with Speaker John A. Boehner as the main Republican negotiator. Once Mr. Boehner gave up and handed off the issue to Mr. McConnell, the vice president's long history in the Senate put him back on the field.
Last year, Mr. Obama gave Mr. Biden the task of negotiating with Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the House majority leader, for a way out of a confrontation over the nation's debt ceiling, but they failed to come up with a resolution, and Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner stepped in. After the two of them failed to reach a grand bargain, Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell came up with an agreement that resolved the issue for the moment but set up the automatic spending cuts that take effect this week unless the two sides come up with an agreement to stop them.
The tandem of Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell is not a result of any ideological affinity. But Mr. McConnell has a strained relationship at best with the other two main Democratic players, Mr. Obama and Mr. Reid, leaving the vice president as his best "dancing partner."
"They have a good relationship," said a senior White House official who asked not to be identified discussing continuing talks. "It's borne fruit before."
Both sides are hoping it does again.

HEADLINE: Tentative Accord Reached To Raise Taxes On Wealthy

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Furious last-minute negotiations between the White House and the Senate Republican leadership on Monday secured a tentative agreement to allow tax rates to rise on affluent Americans, but not in time for Congress to meet its Dec. 31 deadline for averting automatic tax increases and spending cuts deemed a threat to the economy.
While the Senate moved toward a vote on legislation to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, the House was not going to consider any deal until Tuesday afternoon at the earliest, meaning that a combination of tax increases and spending cuts would go into effect as 2013 began. If Congress acts quickly and sends the legislation to President Obama, the economic impact could still be very limited.
Under the agreement, tax rates would jump to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individual incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits would start phasing out on incomes as low as $250,000, a clear win for President Obama, who campaigned on higher taxes for the wealthy. 
''Just last month Republicans in Congress said they would never agree to raise tax rates on the wealthiest Americans,'' Mr. Obama said at a hastily arranged news briefing, with middle-income onlookers cheering behind him. ''Obviously, the agreement that's currently being discussed would raise those rates and raise them permanently.''
Democrats also secured a full year's extension of unemployment insurance without strings attached and without offsetting spending cuts, a $30 billion cost.
As negotiators tied up the last points of dispute, officials said that the two top Democrats on Capitol Hill -- Senator Harry Reid of Nevada and Representative Nancy Pelosi of California -- had signed off on the agreement. In an effort to win over other Democrats uneasy with the proposal, Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., who had bargained directly with Republican leaders, traveled to the Capitol on Monday night for a 90-minute meeting with his former Senate colleagues.
''I feel very, very good,'' Mr. Biden said after the meeting. ''I think we'll get a very good vote.''
In one final piece of the puzzle, negotiators agreed to put off $110 billion in across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs for two months while broader deficit reduction talks continue. Those cuts begin to go into force on Wednesday, and that deadline, too, might be missed before Congress approves the legislation.
To secure votes, Mr. Reid also told Democrats the legislation would cancel a pending congressional pay raise -- putting opponents in the politically difficult position of supporting a raise -- and extend an expiring dairy policy that would have seen the price of milk double in some parts of the country.
Anticipating Senate approval of the deal, Speaker John A. Boehner late Monday said the House would ''honor its commitment to consider the Senate agreement if it is passed. Decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members -- and the American people -- have been able to review the legislation.''
The nature of the deal ensured that the running war between the White House and Congressional Republicans on spending and taxes would continue at least until the spring. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner formally notified Congress that the government reached its statutory borrowing limit on New Year's Eve. Through some creative accounting tricks, the Treasury Department can put off action for perhaps two months, but Congress must act to keep the government from defaulting just when the ''pause'' on pending cuts is up. Then in late March, a law financing the government expires.
And the new deal does nothing to address the big issues that Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner hoped to deal with in their failed ''grand bargain'' talks two weeks ago: booming entitlement spending and a tax code so complex that few defend it anymore.
Though the tentative deal had a chance of success if put to a vote, it landed with a thud on Capitol Hill. Republicans accused the White House of ''moving the goal posts'' by demanding still more tax increases to help shut off across-the-board spending cuts beyond the two-month pause. Democrats were incredulous that the president had ultimately agreed to around $600 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years when even Mr. Boehner had promised $800 billion. But the White House said it had also won concessions on unemployment insurance and the inheritance tax among other wins.
Still, Democrats openly worried that if Mr. Obama could not drive a harder bargain when he holds most of the cards, he will give up still more Democratic priorities in the coming weeks, when hard deadlines will raise the prospects of a government default first, then a government shutdown. In both instances, conservative Republicans are more willing to breach the deadlines than in this case, when conservatives cringed at the prospects of huge tax increases.
''I just don't think Obama's negotiated very well,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.
But as night fell on New Year's Eve, senators seemed worn down and resigned. ''Everybody by this time is angry, but sooner or later this has to be resolved,'' said Senator Orrin G. Hatch of Utah, the ranking Republican on the Finance Committee.
Even House Republicans signaled that enough of them, in combination with Democrats, could most likely pass the legislation, just weeks after Republicans shot down Mr. Boehner's proposal to raise taxes only on incomes over $1 million.
''I don't want to say where I am until I read the legislation, but it is certainly better than the alternative,'' said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.
With a deal agonizingly close, official Washington still prepared for the worst. The Defense Department prepared to notify all 800,000 of its civilian employees that some of them could be forced into unpaid leave without a deal on military cuts. The Internal Revenue Service issued guidance to employers to increase withholding from paychecks beginning Tuesday to match new tax rates at every income level.
''No deal is the worse deal,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, rejecting the assertions of liberal colleagues that no deal would be better than what they would see as a bad deal.
However, new wrenches were gumming up the machinery. Democrats put out late word that Republicans wanted the threshold at which inherited estates would be taxed to be indexed to inflation, a nonstarter for them. Republicans said they needed to see what cuts would pay for the $24 billion needed to put off across-the-board spending cuts.
But with Republicans and Democrats grumbling, it was clear that a deal hashed out through intense talks between Mr. Biden and Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, had given both sides provisions to cheer and to jeer.
Under the deal, tax rates on dividends and capital gains would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent, on income over $400,000 for single people and $450,000 for couples. The deal would reinstate provisions to tax law, ended by the Bush tax cuts of 2001, that phase out personal exemptions and deductions for the affluent. Those phaseouts, under the agreement, would begin at $250,000 for single people and $300,000 for couples.
The estate tax would also rise, but considerably less than Democrats had wanted. The value of estates over $5 million would be taxed at 40 percent, up from 35 percent. Democrats had wanted a 45 percent rate on inheritances over $3.5 million.
Under the deal, the new rates on income, investment and inheritances would be permanent, as would a provision to stop the alternative minimum tax from hitting middle-class families.

HEADLINE: Liberalism's $400,000 Problem

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: What the fiscal cliff bargain means for the long-term liberal project. 

 BODY:
If the tax debate could be simplified to a liberal desire to make sure the tax burden is borne by those who can most easily afford it and a conservative desire to keep taxes as low as possible on as many people as possible, the fiscal-cliff bargain that was struck between Mitch McConnell and Joe Biden over the last 48 hours - a bargain that could still fail to pass the House, but probably won't - seems to offer something credible to both sides. One the one hand, it includes a real Democratic concession, which substitutes a top income rate threshold of $400,000 for the $250,000 threshold that President Obama had long insisted on. But at the same time, for liberals seeking progressivity and fairness, that should be the easiest possible concession to make. The $400,000 threshold still puts the top bracket close to where it was under Bill Clinton when you adjust for inflation, and that Clintonian definition of "rich" wasn't an implausible one: While the whining of the upper upper middle class (or, if you prefer, the not-that-rich rich) can be unseemly, there really is a big difference between a taxpayer making six figures annually and a taxpayer making seven or eight, and setting the top rate in the mid rather than low six figures is a way of acknowledging that the near-rich and super-rich do not occupy the same financial universe. 
It becomes more plausible, too, when you consider that many of the revenue-enhancing tax reform proposals that have been bruited about would probably raise taxes significantly on earners in the $100,000-$400,000 range, which means that exempting the near-rich this time around doesn't mean that they won't end up paying more down the road. (And, in fact, it looks like the proposed deal will include a de facto down payment on such a reform, by reinstituting a phaseout on exemptions for households making over $250,000.)
Alas for liberals, the tax debate isn't that simple, because it's taking place in the context of immense projected future deficits and a welfare state that seems unsustainable without substantial increases in revenue. Given these realities, fairness and progressivity are necessarily less important to liberalism over the long run than simple dollar figures, and the American left actually has a long-run incentive to make the federal tax code less progressive, because only a broader base can keep the liberal edifice solvent in the long run.
And here I think liberals have a real reason to be discouraged by the White House's willingness - and, more importantly, many Senate Democrats' apparent eagerness - to compromise on tax increases for the near-rich. Liberal pundits seem most worried about what this concession signals for the next round of negotiations, over the sequester and the debt ceiling. But if I were them I'd be more worried about the longer term, and what it signals about their party's willingness and ability to raise tax rates for anyone who isn't super-rich. As I've suggested before, these negotiations amounted to a test of liberalism's ability to raise revenue, and it isn't clear that this outcome constitutes a passing grade: If a newly re-elected Democratic president can't muster the political will and capital required to do something as straightforward and relatively popular as raising taxes on the tiny fraction Americans making over $250,000 when those same taxes are scheduled to go up already, then how can Democrats ever expect to push taxes upward to levels that would make our existing public progams sustainable for the long run?
Responding to this argument last week, The New Republic's Noam Scheiber countered that Democrats could actually afford to be somewhat accommodating today, because in the long run tax increases, while controversial, will prove more popular and politically plausible than entitlement cuts:
... the fiscal long-game mostly favors liberals. To see this, let's fast forward a decade or two and imagine a similar negotiation. I suspect that, if anything, Medicare and Social Security will be even more popular than they are today given the aging of the population, making them even harder to cut. It's possible that raising taxes on the affluent will be less popular-some 60 percent supported Obama's desire to do that in last month's exit polls-but I doubt it. Historically, Americans have been sympathetic to the idea. And while it's true that, as conservatives point out, you can't fund the entire welfare state by raising taxes on the wealthy, it's not the only source of revenue that's likely to exist. If nothing else, I'd guess a future Democratic president could raise taxes on income well below $250,000-probably down to $100,000-without incurring major blowback.
I didn't find this quite persuasive before the events of the last 48 hours, and I'm even less persuaded now. What was somewhat clear already has become a lot clearer: There is a significant constituency among Congressional Democrats that was already uncomfortable with the $250,000 threshold and wanted to push it higher - all the way to a million dollars, if a certain influential New York Senator had his way - and the possibility that these Democrats might go wobbly in a post-cliff scenario gave the White House a reason (or an excuse) to concede ground that Obama had once promised to defend unstintingly. Nor is this tax-wary caucus likely to grow weaker with time: It exists because many Democratic lawmakers represent (and are funded by) a lot of affluent professionals in wealthy, high-cost-of-living states, and that relationship is only likely to loom larger if current demographic and political trends persist. Is a Democratic Party that shies away from raising taxes on the $250,000-a-year earner (or the $399,999-a-year earner, for that matter) in 2013 - when those increases are happeningly automatically! - really going to find it easier to raise taxes on families making $110,000 in 2017 or 2021? Color me skeptical: The lesson of these negotiations seems to be that Democrats are still skittish about anything that ever-so-remotely resembles a middle class tax increase, let alone the much larger tax increases (which would eventually have to hit people making well below $100,000 as well) that their philosophy of government ultimately demands.
Agreeing that the New Year's bargain bodes ill for the liberal vision of government doesn't require believing that Paul Ryan's vision of government is poised to triumph instead. Here I agree with Scheiber: Because Social Security and Medicare are so popular, the right-wing path to fiscal sustainability does sometimes have an air of fantasy about it. It's just that on the evidence of what the Obama White House and Senate Democrats have been willing to concede this week, the left-wing path to solvency looks pretty implausible right now as well.

HEADLINE: When the Deficit Will Be Fixed

BYLINE: BRUCE BARTLETT


HIGHLIGHT: It's difficult for members of Congress to agree to take a political hit for raising taxes and cutting into popular programs when the benefits will be realized only by their successors, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul. He is the author of "The Benefit and the Burden: Tax Reform - Why We Need It and What It Will Take." 
The Holy Grail for budget hawks is the "grand bargain" - some combination of tax increases and entitlement reforms that will get the deficit on a sustainable track, permanently. On paper, it always looks simple - relatively small adjustments to the growth path of revenues or big spending programs like Medicare or Social Security compound over time into big savings. 
The problem, of course, is getting Congress to act, because of what economists call a time-inconsistency problem. The Congress that raises taxes and cuts benefits will suffer politically, while the benefits of lower deficits will accrue to future Congresses.
Historically, what has moved Congress to enact big deficit-reduction packages was the prospect of quick improvement in terms of inflation, growth and interest rates. Given that deficit reduction today is very unlikely to improve any of these in the near term, deficit hawks lack any real payoff from a grand bargain.

The two problems most likely to result from budget deficits are inflation and high interest rates. Many economists believe that deficits are inherently inflationary; others believe that they inevitably put pressure on the Federal Reserve to "monetize" the debt by, in effect, printing money to pay for it.
High interest rates are even more easily blamed on the deficit. As Floyd
Norris of The New York Times recently recounted, so-called bond vigilantes terrorized Wall Street in the early 1980s. Economists including Henry Kaufman of Salomon Brothers and Albert Wojnilower of First Boston regularly issued apocalyptic warnings of doom unless drastic action was taken on the deficit immediately.
It was often said that the Treasury's borrowing was crowding out private borrowers from the bond market, because the federal government is not constrained by the amount of interest it is willing to pay. It will pay whatever the market demands to sell all the bonds it has to sell that day. Private borrowers will pull back their borrowing if rates get too costly.
Economists worried that if private companies lacked access to the bond market they would reduce investment in new plants and equipment, which ultimately reduced productivity and economic growth. High interest rates also raised the "hurdle" rate of return, snuffing out investments that in the past would have been profitable.
Some economists disagreed on the mechanism by which deficits affected interest rates. They pointed out that expected inflation automatically raises market interest rates. Generally speaking, a rise of 1 percent in the expected rate of inflation will raise long-term rates by 1 percent.
Those of a more liberal persuasion often contended that the Fed was forced to run a tighter monetary policy when faced with large deficits in order to offset their inflationary effect.
The precise mechanism didn't matter much for policy purposes, because each perspective came back to the idea that deficits had to be reduced to improve the economy. Lower deficits would simultaneously reduce crowding out and inflationary expectations and give the Fed room to ease monetary policy - a virtual trifecta of payoffs.
It's worth remembering just how severe the problem was. According to Mr. Norris, the interest rate on the Treasury's 30-year bond peaked at 15.21 percent on Oct. 26, 1981. That is a rate almost incomprehensibly high given that Treasury bonds are assumed to have zero risk of default. The rate on the 30-year bond today is about 2.8 percent, about half its historical rate.
Even taking into account the fact that inflation was a serious problem in 1981 - the consumer price index rose 8.9 percent for the year - the "real" component of interest rates was very high. The real interest rate is the market rate minus the expected inflation rate.
With the benefit of hindsight, buying bonds in 1981 was the profit-making opportunity of a lifetime. Just imagine being able to get better than 15 percent a year on an investment for 30 years at zero risk.
Of course, at the time bonds were toxic, which is precisely why rates were so high. But as time went by, the deficit improved, inflation collapsed and the Fed eased. But it didn't happen all at once; the process was slow and painful, involving many budget deals that were extremely difficult, politically.
Perhaps the most difficult was the 1990 deal, in which President George H.W. Bush courageously bucked his own party and agreed to a small increase in the top tax rate in order to get spending cuts and tough budget controls that deserve much of the credit for the budget surpluses of the late 1990s.
Mr. Bush's own party basically turned its back on him, and it cemented for all time the now universally held Republican idea that taxes must never be increased at any time for any reason. Even those Republicans still sane enough to know this is nuts live in fear of a Tea Party challenger in the next primary, underwritten by the vast resources of the Club for Growth, which helped torpedo John Boehner's "Plan B" effort at a "fiscal cliff" deal because it would raise the top tax rate on millionaires.
It is an article of faith to Grover Norquist, of tax pledge fame, that budget deals involving higher taxes are always bad for Republicans.
A new study from the European Central Bank confirms that significant deficit improvement is usually driven by rising interest rates. However, by the time budgetary action occurs the rising cost of interest on the debt tends to overwhelm the adjustment.
According to the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, none of the preconditions that historically are necessary for a significant budget deal are now present. Inflationary expectations continue to fall and real interest rates are very low. Hence, it is impossible for politicians to promise any benefit from large spending cuts or tax increases that would materially improve peoples' lives. The benefits are purely abstract. 
This suggests that we are a long way from meaningful legislative action on the deficit.

HEADLINE: Bright Passages (Humor Division)

BYLINE: PHILIP B. CORBETT


HIGHLIGHT: In the right place and in the right hands, a flash of humor can be a powerful tool in our writing. Understatement is effective, and we're not looking for belly laughs. It's important for editors to serve as a skeptical audience, lest a writer's wit seem witty mostly to the writer. But here are a few recent examples where an amusing incongruity made a sharp point. And if readers smiled, so much the better.

In the right place and in the right hands, a flash of humor can be a powerful tool in our writing.
Understatement is effective, and we're not looking for belly laughs. It's important for editors to serve as a skeptical audience, lest a writer's wit seem witty mostly to the writer. But here are a few recent examples where an amusing incongruity made a sharp point. And if readers smiled, so much the better.
National, 11/29:
Despite Powerball Odds, A Mad Rush to the Registers 
 NEW ORLEANS - All across this recession-weary country on Wednesday, Americans of every rank and station lined up at convenience stores and delis, placed their hard-earned dollars on countertops and took part in a venerated national tradition: trying to get really rich without doing anything. ... 
Most of the buyers interviewed on Wednesday acknowledged that their chances were not especially good. 
A standard practice in news media coverage is to compare lottery odds unfavorably with odds of dying in peculiar ways (shark attack, lightning), but even that morbid exercise does not do justice to the long shot. The odds of picking the winning numbers in Wednesday's drawing were longer than the odds of picking an American man completely at random and having him happen to be Alan Alda.
Campbell Robertson brought wit and some journalistic self-awareness to the predictable story about lottery mania. And his "Alan Alda" reference was perfect in its randomness, much more effective than the predictable "George Clooney" illustration in the source he linked to.
Sports, 11/29:
Firing a Coach, at a Price, With Little Evidence the Move Pays Off
 For an especially lucrative occupation, one might consider becoming a fired college football coach. 
We should all be so lucky, as Jeré Longman's arch lead and well-reported story made clear.
Business, 10/22:
Fresh Windows, but Where's the Start Button?
 It took Mr. McCarthy several minutes just to figure out how to compose an e-mail message in Windows 8, which has a stripped-down look and on-screen buttons that at times resemble the runic assembly instructions for Ikea furniture. 
A truly apt, if idiosyncratic, allusion in Nick Wingfield's story, and "runic" was the perfect word on many levels.
 
 Number Trouble 
We're still struggling to keep those subjects and verbs in accord. In many cases, sharper and less convoluted sentences would keep us on track. And copy editors, your writers are counting on you to save them!
 On clear days, the white peaks of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain after Everest and K2, floats over the hilltop city like an ethereal fortress. 
The intervening nouns seem to have thrown us off track. Make it "peaks ... float."
 He and his writers broke news, sent shrapnel into many subject areas with provocative, opinionated copy and was part of the notorious pilfered iPhone 4 story that had law enforcement officials breaking down doors on Apple's behalf. 
We lost the agreement thread before reaching the final element in the compound predicate. Make it "he and his writers ... were part."
 Republicans have strenuously opposed any increase in capital gains rates, and the notion that low rates on capital gains promotes economic growth is an article of faith for many conservatives, even though the empirical evidence is inconclusive. 
Make it "low rates ... promote" or "having low rates promotes."
 
 In a Word 
This week's grab bag of grammar, style and other missteps, compiled with help from colleagues and readers.
 Ammar, whom Mr. Boal has said is a composite, looks as if he has been beaten. 
Make it "who," the subject of "is."
 Sitting for an interview with Ami, a Jewish magazine, Mr. Hynes gave the side of his hand to "some absolute clown at The Daily News" who had written editorials criticizing his inaction on the Hasids. 
The Times's stylebook calls for "Hasidim" as the plural.
 While other rookies may be hitting the proverbial wall, he said he feels as though his season has barely begun. 
Make it "felt as though he season had barely begun" (sequence of tenses). Also, let's be wary of "proverbial," which appeared five times in the last seven days. It is often the warning sign of a cliché.
 But it is clear that for Mr. Obama, giving up on Ms. Rice's appointment was far different than accepting the resignation of David H. Petraeus, his C.I.A. director, or firing Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal, his commander in Afghanistan. 
Unless what follows is a full clause, make it "different from."
 After six years in business, her clothes are sold in nearly 100 stores, she has designed a licensed collection of eyewear, and this week, she introduced a fragrance of her own, a limited-edition scent that is a collaboration with Barneys New York. 
Dangler. Her clothes have not been in business for six years. Rephrase. 
 As a boy, heart problems kept him from attending school regularly, though he became an avid reader with a particular passion for astronomy. 
Another dangler. Rephrase.
 That is between 34 to 48 times what Bergman was paid for sharing top billing with Humphrey Bogart. 
Make it "between 34 and 48."
 No doubt, he was one of the few mechanical engineers who not only was aware of Faulkner's immortal line - "The past is never dead. It's not even past" - but also understood what it meant. 
Recorded announcement: "who" refers to the plural "engineers" in this construction, and so requires a plural verb in the relative clause.
 The original musical became a word-of-mouth sensation in 1974 for the nudity and sexual frankness on stage at the Village Gate, where it ran for two-and-a-half years before moving from Greenwich Village to Broadway's Morosco Theater in June 1976. 
No hyphens needed in this phrase.
 Such frustrations are typical in Venezuela, for rich and poor alike, and yet President Hugo Chávez has managed to stay in office for nearly 14 years, winning over a significant majority of the public with his outsize personality, his free-spending of state resources and his ability to convince Venezuelans that the Socialist revolution he envisions will make their lives better. 
Here, too, the hyphen is unnecessary. It would only be needed if the phrase were a modifier, e.g. "his free-spending policies."
 But his name did not appear on the State Department's list of most wanted militants, and his role and stature inside Al Qaeda was not clear. 
"Were," not "was." 
 ANCHORAGE, Alaska - In a conversation with homicide investigators before his suicide in jail this week, Israel Keyes said he had lived much of his life thinking that people only pretended to be nice. 
Anchorage stands alone in datelines, according to the stylebook. (This was fixed for later editions and Web.)
 But it marks a new phase of American engagement in a bitter conflict that has claimed at least 40,000 lives, threatened to destabilize the broader Middle East and defied all outside attempts to end it. 
As the stylebook cautions, "Resist the journalese use of mark to mean signify and, even more, to mean is or are."
 In Paris 29 years later, she sung the part in her farewell opera appearance. 
Make it "sang."
 The State Department has no policy that forbids former diplomats from lobbying on behalf of nations where they served or returning to them them for profit, beyond the one applying to federal employees as a whole, which prohibits senior officials from contacting agencies where they once worked for one year and bans all federal employees for life from advising on the same matters. 
Aside from the fact that this sentence is overstuffed, the correct phrasing is "forbids ... to lobby," not "forbids ... from lobbying."
 But the speed with which the court moved also raised the possibility of a split decision, one that would provide federal benefits to same-sex couples married in states that allow such unions but would permit other states to forbid gay and lesbian couples from marrying. 
Ditto. Make it "forbid ... to marry."

HEADLINE: A Century Ago, a Mayor Who Wrote Back

BYLINE: SAM ROBERTS


HIGHLIGHT: Probably no mayor of New York City except Edward I. Koch came close to writing as many letters to constituents as William J. Gaynor, who served from 1910 to 1913 and dictated missives filled with philosophical touches. 

 BODY:
John V. Lindsay often delivered homespun advice to ordinary constituents, and Edward I. Koch claims to have answered every letter or e-mail he has received. But a century ago, few elected officials were more prolific or perspicacious in their correspondence than William J. Gaynor, who became New York City's mayor 103 years ago on Tuesday, and served until 1913.
A biographer, Lately Thomas, wrote that Mayor Gaynor's "means of communicating with the mass of the people were two: the daily newspapers and the United States mails," and that he spent a considerable amount of his workdays personally answering his constituents. One critic even complained that the mayor, who wrote thousands of his letters in office, conducted "government by epistle."
In sheer numbers, probably no mayor except Mr. Koch came close. And Mayor Gaynor's letters were distinguished by frequent references to philosophers and other learned figures whom he had encountered during his early religious training. 
His candor, sagacity, vigorous defense of civil liberties and fierce independence (and his scrapping of the East River bridge tolls) endeared him to his constituents. In 1910, his shooting by a fired city employee prompted such an outpouring of sympathy that he was briefly mentioned for governor and even president. (Mayor Gaynor died three years later of complications from the wound.)
A former seminary student and State Supreme Court justice, he was nominated for mayor by the regular Democratic organization, but governed independently and was described as a liberal with libertarian leanings.
His inauguration as mayor on Jan. 1, 1910, was his first visit to City Hall. From then on, he routinely walked across the Brooklyn Bridge between his office and his home in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He often coupled common sense with Greek philosophy, which, he wrote, "seemed to astonish the whole journalistic fraternity in New York City."
No less a cynic than H.L. Mencken pronounced Mayor Gaynor a "great political philosopher and a great soul" who "began an heroic but vain effort to give New York decent government." 
The mayor dictated his letters, many of which survive as typed copies in the municipal archives. No subject was too small; he once delivered a lengthy exposition on how to boil an egg.
Mayor Gaynor dismissed critics with sarcasm. Accusing a Republican politician of lying, he wrote, "Suppose you pray every morning for a while for God to direct you to tell the truth, and see what fruits it will bear."
When Charles M. Frey, an erudite rat catcher, complained that his livelihood was threatened by repeated calls to jury duty, the mayor suggested that rat catchers be exempt, cautioning, though, that "so many exemptions have already been passed by the Legislature that there seems to be only the rat catchers and a few other people left to serve on juries."
To a solicitation for a $10 contribution from the Anti-Saloon League, Gaynor wrote: "If I gave money in response to all the similar demands that are made on me, I should be bankrupt in short order."
When a Christian minister asked for a license to preach conversion in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the mayor responded, "Did not we Christians get much or the most of what we have from the Jews?''
When city aldermen proposed banning the Socialist's red flag, Gaynor lectured, "They chose the color red for their emblem, not to signify that they favor violence or the shedding of blood, as the unintelligent suppose and as actions of those in official authority often lead people to believe, but for the purposes of typifying the common brotherhood of all men of all nations through the same red blood which flows through the veins of all.''
Constituents frequently groused about noise. To one who was irked by the cries of newsboys, Gaynor wrote, "A whole lot of people have been hollering at me of late, but they do not disturb me, and much less does the hollering of the little newsboys disturb me."
To another who worked in the Flatiron Building near a church presided over by his nemesis, the Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst, and who complained that the clock on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower chimed 40 times an hour, he wrote: "But really, does the clock make as much noise as Dr. Parkhurst does? You know we all have to bear with something, and I am willing to do my share of it."
When a Manhattan lawyer demanded that piano playing and singing be banned at night, especially during the summer when people open their windows, the mayor advised: "I hereby authorize you to carry out all of these reforms. It may be that you will first have to get elected to the Legislature, and pass laws therefor, for you know this is a government of laws, and not of men."
He championed children's street games, advising one young man who wrote him, "If you show this letter to the policeman, I think he will let you play with a soft rubber ball on 101st Street between Lexington and Park Avenues if you ask him and if you are careful not to hit other people."
To a correspondent who grumbled that aldermen were extorting a fee to preside over marriages, he wrote, "if I had time I would marry you all for nothing."
His reply to a Chicago woman reads like advice to the lovelorn: "You are looking for happiness in the wrong direction. I do not think there is any man living who would suit you. If you want to be really happy for the rest of your life, work for the happiness of others, and forget yourself." 
Gaynor was not easily impressed. Responding to a book by the pastor of a Park Slope church, he wrote that the Emancipation Proclamation "had to be almost extorted" from President Abraham Lincoln, "and the Russian emperor had done the like not long before."
Of George Washington, Gaynor wrote that he was "of warm blood and prone to passion," that he was "even known to have sworn like a trooper at times," that his "face was pitted" and that he "was not the equal in knowledge of history, economics and government of the men who surrounded him."
Many of the letters were answered the same day they were received. Form letters were dismissed. Anonymous ones were often answered in the press. "You are evidently a dishonest scamp, but I acknowledge the receipt of all letters," he wrote one correspondent. 
And to the National Publicity Bureau, which asked what message he would deliver to readers of the group's 3,000-member newspapers, the mayor replied, "I would say to them to be very careful about believing all they see in the newspapers."

HEADLINE: Is America Still the Land of Opportunity?

BYLINE: MARCUS MABRY


HIGHLIGHT: Ninety-three percent of all income growth in the U.S. in 2010 went to the top 1 percent. And just 15,000 households received 37 percent of all of those gains. 

 BODY:
Millions of immigrants head to the United States each year. And millions more would if they could get a visa. Yet, more and more Americans complain of a sense that the cards are stacked against the middle class - and, more devastatingly, its children. 
It's not just sky-high college costs, especially compared with Western European universities, or the substantial difference between the amount of state support in Europe and the United States of everything from health care to child care to education - whether Europe's social generosity is sustainable over the long term or not. 
Many Americans - both in the United States and abroad - are concerned that the heart of the American Dream, the belief that, as former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice often puts it, in America "it doesn't matter where you come from, but where you're going," is less and less true. 
A provocative set of statistics in a column by the New York Times opinion contributor Steven Rattner makes the case.
Over the last decade or two, the American middle has been hollowed out, with an affluent, well-educated class growing on one side of the divide and a poor and working-class majority on the other, faced with limited opportunities to change their circumstances. 
Not unlike the view that many Americans have of a traditional European lack of social and economic mobility: if your father was a farmer or a factory worker, chances are you will be a farmer or a factory worker.
One of the most eye-popping statistics reported by Mr. Rattner, is that 93 percent of all income growth in the U.S. in 2010 went to the top 1 percent of Americans. And 37 percent went to the top .01 percent. He writes:
Also astonishing: just 15,000 households received 37 percent of all of those income gains. In no other period in recent American history have economic gains been concentrated so disproportionately in an elite sliver.
And thetax-and-spending deal to avert the so-called fiscal cliff does little to slow America's increasing wealth disparity.
 What do you think? What is the future of the American Dream? Whether you are an immigrant, an expat or a global citizen, do you believe in the American Dream? Is there something different about the United States than other societies? Has the once-American dream been exported to developing nations and their growing middle classes?

HEADLINE: Fixing Our Food Problem

BYLINE: MARK BITTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Let's resolve to develop a clear plan for improving our food system and fight for it. Patiently. 

 BODY:
Nothing affects public health in the United States more than food. Gun violence kills tens of thousands of Americans a year. Heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes kill more than a million people a year - nearly half of all deaths - and diet is a root cause of many of those diseases.
And the root of that dangerous diet is our system of hyper-industrial agriculture, the kind that uses 10 times as much energy as it produces. 
We must figure out a way to un-invent this food system. It's been a major contributor to climate change, spawned the obesity crisis, poisoned countless volumes of land and water, wasted energy, tortured billions of animals... I could go on. The point is that "sustainability" is not only possible but essential: only by saving the earth can we save ourselves, and vice versa.
How do we do that?
This seems like a good day to step back a bit and suggest something that's sometimes difficult to accept.
Patience.
We can only dismantle this system little by little, and slowly. Change takes time. Often - usually - that time exceeds the life span of its pioneers. And when it comes to sustainable food for billions, we're the pioneers of a food movement that's just beginning to take shape. The abolition movement began at least a century before the Civil War, 200 years before the civil rights movement. The struggle to gain the right to vote for women in the United States was active for 75 years before an amendment was passed. The gay rights struggle has made tremendous strides over the last 40 years, but equal treatment under the law is hardly established.
Activists who took on these issues had in common a clear series of demands and a sense that the work was ongoing. They had a large and ever-growing public following and a willingness to sacrifice time, energy and even life for the benefit not only of contemporaries but for subsequent generations.
They were also aware that there is no success without a willingness to fail; that failure is a part of progress. A single defeat was seen as a temporary setback. The same vision should be applied to every issue the nascent food movement is tackling.
Yet before we can assess our progress, we must state our goals. There is no consensus behind a program for achieving sustainable production of food that promotes rather than attacks health. We can't ask for "better food for all"; we must be specific. In the very near term, for example, we must fight to protect and improve programs that make food available to lower-income Americans. We must also support the increasingly assertive battles of workers in food-related industries; nothing reflects our moral core more accurately than the abuses we overlook in the names of convenience and economy.
Beyond that, I believe that the two issues that will have the greatest reverberations in agriculture, health and the environment are reducing the consumption of sugar-laden beverages and improving the living conditions of livestock.
About the first I have written plenty, and can summarize: when we begin treating sugar-sweetened beverages as we do tobacco, we will make a huge stride in improving our diet.
The second is even more powerful, and progress was made in that arena in 2012 as one food company after another resolved to (eventually) reject pork produced with gestation crates. So over the next few years, some animals will be treated somewhat better. This is absolutely, unquestionably thanks to public pressure, which should now set its sights higher and insist that all animals grown for food production be treated not just better but well.
Well-cared-for animals will necessarily be more expensive, which means we'll eat fewer of them; that's a win-win. They'll use fewer antibiotics, they'll be produced by more farmers in more places, and they'll eat less commodity grain, which will both reduce environmental damage and allow for more land to be used for high-quality human food like fruits and vegetables.
Allies may argue that I miss the mark with either or both of these, and that's fine: it's a discussion. The point is that no major food issue will be resolved in the next 10 years. As pioneers, we must build upon incremental progress and not be disheartened, because often there isn't quick resolution for complex issues.
An association between tobacco and cancer was discovered more 200 years ago. The surgeon general's report that identified smoking as a public health issue appeared in 1964. The food movement has not yet reached its 1964; there's isn't even a general acknowledgment of a problem in need of fixing.
So, in 2013, let's call for energy, action - and patience.

HEADLINE: Publishing Without Perishing

BYLINE: DAVID STREITFELD


HIGHLIGHT: The Internet removed the stigma from vanity publishing and, more important, most of the cost. As a result, millions of people have fulfilled their dream of becoming an author. For a much smaller group, technology is just beginning to enable a related but much more specialized pursuit; they are becoming publishers. 

 BODY:
In the old days, life for small publishers was a hassle. The economics were such that copies got dramatically cheaper when printed in bulk, but then the books had to be stored, which was expensive. Finding an audience was the hardest part; some independent presses took years or even decades to sell out a modest print run.
Now books can be efficiently printed in small quantities, like one copy. Amazon, meanwhile, is happy to do the job of fulfilling orders. The stage is set to allow everyone to become his own Alfred Knopf. 
James Morrison, a 36-year-old editor and graphic designer in Adelaide, Australia, is an old-fashioned book enthusiast, with around 10,000 books in his personal library. In 2007 he began a blog, Caustic Cover Critic: One Man's Endless Ranting About Book Design, which showcases and evaluates new jackets. Like any inveterate reader, Mr. Morrison would stumble across obscure books practically begging to be reprinted. For instance, he read an account by the historian David S. Reynolds of "the largest monster in antebellum literature," which was "the kraken depicted in Eugene Batchelder's 'Romance of the Sea-Serpent, or The Ichthyosaurus,' a bizarre narrative poem about a sea serpent that terrorizes the coast of Massachusetts, destroys a huge ship in mid-ocean, repasts on human remains gruesomely with sharks and whales, attends a Harvard commencement (where he has been asked to speak), [and] shocks partygoers by appearing at a Newport ball."
Mr. Morrison concluded that "the audience for an 1850 book-length Monty Python-style doggerel poem about a socially aspirant sea serpent is probably just me," but how could he be sure? The Internet is all about weaving people together with even stranger tastes.
The critic has published about a dozen out-of-copyright volumes using Lulu, which does the printing, and Amazon, which does the selling and shipping. He dubbed his venture Whisky Priest in homage to Graham Greene, himself an enthusiast of uncommon and unjustly forgotten literary efforts. On the Whisky Priest list are the Batchelder book; a collection by Edith Wharton; "Artists' Wives," Alphonse Daudet's stories about the war between the sexes; and Storm Jameson's "In the Second Year," a prophetic look at fascism.
At a moment when predictions of the demise of print are omnipresent, Whisky Priest seemed an indication that the future might be more complex than anticipated. Mr. Morrison answered some questions by email. What follows is an edited extract.
Q. Will the ultimate pleasure for lovers of the printed book be your own editions of your favorite out-of-copyright books?
A. For me it was a matter of there being books in the public domain that I wanted to read which were either not available as physical books, or were available only in staggeringly ugly and expensive editions. I originally intended to just design a cover I liked and then print a copy for myself to read, but it turned out to be an almost negligible amount of extra effort to make them available for others to buy as well, so I thought I might as well do so. It would be as easy to produce editions of things like "Moby-Dick" or "Pride and Prejudice," but there are already hundreds of versions of those, some with fantastic cover designs, so it would be a bit pointless.
Q. How easy would it be for others to become a publisher the way you did?
A. It's very easy indeed, assuming you have some basic layout or design skills. Even without those you could still do it, though the book would probably not be so appealing. I'd certainly recommend it for people who, unsatisfied with the available editions, wanted a book they enjoyed having around the house. I wouldn't recommend it as a way of making money. I've spent slightly more on proof copies, etc., than I've earned through royalties. Partly this is because I try to set the book prices as low as possible (I make about $1 a book through Amazon, and a little more if someone buys the books direct from Lulu), since they're: a) books usually available free or cheaply in electronic form, and b) Print on Demand books, which are not quite as nice to hold and handle as conventionally published books, so it seems unfair to charge more for them.
Q. I was struck by how little capital you needed.
A. Lulu and Amazon take a cut of each copy sold but require no up-front listing fees or anything like that. The only money I spend is on ordering proof copies for myself, which is the production cost without anything else added on -- about $8 for one recent title. To make a book available on Amazon, you need to order at least one physical copy yourself, check it, and then let Lulu know it's OK to go ahead and list it. If you just wanted to list on Lulu's own site, you don't even need to do that -- you could upload a thousand different books and make them available for sale via the Lulu site without ever spending a cent (though you'd never know what they looked like as physical books, of course).
Q. How have the books done?
A. Not vast numbers. The most popular has sold 27 copies. That, a little surprisingly, is A. P. Herbert's "The Secret Battle": it's a very good novel by a once-popular and now nearly forgotten English writer, based on his World War I experiences, and about the way the English army would execute its own men for cowardice. Close behind are "Transfiguration," a pair of novellas and some nonfiction by the great Austrian writer and suicide Stefan Zweig, and "The Dangerous Age," a classic feminist Danish novella by Karin MichaÎlis. But then there are some which have done surprisingly poorly. F. Scott Fitzgerald's play "The Vegetable," the only edition currently in print, has sold only two copies. But then I can't sell that in the U.S., where it's still in copyright, and that's probably where the main market for a parody on Warren Harding's presidency is likely to be found. Thinking over that sentence, maybe it's a surprise I've sold any copies at all.
Q. Who sets the prices?
A. The pricing is under my control, to a point. Basically, Lulu tells you the absolute minimum you can charge, which covers the production costs and their profit, and then you add to that whatever you want. For example, the Stefan Zweig production cost is $8.10 and then Lulu add a little to that to create the absolute lowest price, which is the lowest I could charge and still make them a little profit (they take 20 percent of any profit on physical books, or 10 percent for ebooks) -- in this case around $9. I sell it for $11.95, from which Amazon then takes a little over $3 (some of this may also go to Lulu or some other third party -- Amazon doesn't disclose that), and I get 69 cents. If someone decided to buy the book from Lulu, which is less likely since they have to pay for postage and so on, I make $3.08 (and Lulu gets 77 cents); however, almost every sale comes via Amazon. But I could set the price at anything above that base cost of $8.10, like $25 or even $250, if I thought anyone was mad enough to pay it, and most of that inflated cost would come to me.
Q. How much have you invested in this overall and how much has it brought you?
A. I've only earned a few hundred dollars over two years, and have probably spent about $200 to do that, so I'm slightly ahead, but it's no way to make a living. Partly this is my own fault - I have no interest in marketing or networking, so I just publish the books and let them do their thing.
Q. Are others doing this?
A. To my surprise, I don't know of anyone doing things in quite the same way as I am. Most publishers of Print on Demand classics seem to operate on a different scale: they make thousands of titles available, usually with identical covers and at eye-watering prices, or else they just sell them as ebooks. I suspect it's a matter of poor timing, technologically: the ability to print a whole physical book cheaply but at a decent quality has become available to everyone just at the same time as ebooks have started wreaking havoc with the market. It's a niche thing, I suspect, but I'm happy enough in that niche.
Q. I think this is just beginning. I envision a future where we will all have competing Stefan Zweig lines.
A. I hope this is the way it pans out.

HEADLINE: Who Pays for the Right to Bear Arms?

BYLINE: By DAVID COLE. 
David Cole is a professor of constitutional law and criminal justice at the Georgetown University Law Center.

 BODY:
Washington
IN the days following the Newtown massacre the nation's newspapers were filled with heart-wrenching pictures of the innocent victims. The slaughter was unimaginably shocking. But the broader tragedy of gun violence is felt mostly not in leafy suburbs, but in America's inner cities.
The right to bear arms typically invokes the romantic image of a cowboy toting a rifle on the plains. In modern-day America, though, the more realistic picture is that of a young black man gunned down in his prime in a dark alley. When we celebrate gun rights, we all too often ignore their disproportionate racial burdens. Any effort to address gun violence must focus on the inner city. 
Last year Chicago had some 500 homicides, 87 percent of them gun-related. In the city's public schools, 319 students were shot in the 2011-12 school year, 24 of them fatally. African-Americans are 33 percent of the Chicago population, but about 70 percent of the murder victims.
The same is true in other cities. In 2011, 80 percent of the 324 people killed in Philadelphia were killed by guns, and three-quarters of the victims were black.
Racial disparities in gun violence far outstrip those in almost any other area of life. Black unemployment is double that for whites, as is black infant mortality. But young black men die of gun homicide at a rate eight times that of young white men. Could it be that the laxity of the nation's gun laws is tolerated because its deadly costs are borne by the segregated black and Latino populations of North Philadelphia and Chicago's South Side?
The history of gun regulation is inextricably interwoven with race. Some of the nation's most stringent gun laws emerged in the South after the Civil War, as Southern whites feared what newly freed slaves might do if armed. At the same time, Northerners saw the freed slaves' right to bear arms as critical to protecting them from the Ku Klux Klan.
In the 1960s, Huey P. Newton and the Black Panther Party made the gun a central symbol of black power, claiming that ''the gun is the only thing that will free us.'' On May 2, 1967, taking advantage of California's lax gun laws, several Panthers marched through the State Capitol in Sacramento carrying raised and loaded weapons, generating widespread news coverage.
The police could do nothing, as the Panthers broke no laws. But three months later, Gov. Ronald Reagan signed into law one of the strictest gun control laws in the country.
The urban riots of the late 1960s -- combined with rising crime rates and a string of high-profile assassinations -- spurred Congress to pass federal gun control laws, banning interstate commerce in guns except for federally licensed dealers and collectors; prohibiting sales to felons, the mentally ill, substance abusers and minors; and expanding licensing requirements.
These laws contain large loopholes, however, and are plainly inadequate to deal with the increased number and lethality of modern weapons. But as long as gun violence largely targets young black men in urban ghettos, the nation seems indifferent. At Newtown, the often all-too-invisible costs of the right to bear arms were made starkly visible -- precisely because these weren't the usual victims. The nation took note, and President Obama has promised reform, though he has not yet made a specific proposal.
Gun rights defenders argue that gun laws don't reduce violence, noting that many cities with high gun violence already have strict gun laws. But this ignores the ease with which urban residents can evade local laws by obtaining guns from dealers outside their cities or states. Effective gun regulation requires a nationally coordinated response.
A cynic might propose resurrecting the Black Panthers to heighten white anxiety as the swiftest route to breaking the logjam on gun reform. I hope we are better than that. If the nation were to view the everyday tragedies that befall young black and Latino men in the inner cities with the same sympathy that it has shown for the Newtown victims, there would be a groundswell of support not just for gun law reform, but for much broader measures.
If we are to reduce the inequitable costs of gun rights, it's not enough to tighten licensing requirements, expand background checks to private gun sales or ban assault weapons. In addition to such national measures, meaningful reform must include initiatives directed to where gun violence is worst: the inner cities. Aggressive interventions by police and social workers focused on gang gun violence, coupled with economic investment, better schools and more after-school and job training programs, are all necessary if we are to reduce the violence that gun rights entail.
To tweak the National Rifle Association's refrain, ''guns don't kill people; indifference to poverty kills people.'' We can't in good conscience keep making young black men pay the cost of our right to bear arms.

HEADLINE: Problem With Weak Bolts Has Complicated the Barclays Center's Early Days

BYLINE: By CHARLES V. BAGLI; Mayeta Clark contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Their vision called for an edgy, urban design that would stand apart from the clamshell look of arenas elsewhere.
The weathered steel panels and swooping canopy of the Barclays Center, the new home for the Brooklyn Nets, have served notice that brawny, once-industrial Brooklyn is back in the big leagues.
But with innovation has also come headaches. 
The fabricator for the 12,000 steel panels -- no two alike -- abruptly shut down midway through the job.
The panels have occasionally dripped rusty orange blossoms onto the sidewalk.
And lately, iron workers have replaced hundreds of bolts that anchor the panels to the building's structure. Engineers determined that weaker ones were originally installed, raising concerns about the structure's integrity.
The incorrect bolts were discovered only a month before the Barclays Center was scheduled to open on Sept. 28. The arena ultimately opened on time and it survived Hurricane Sandy's winds a month later.
After examining every joint, engineers determined that only 8 percent of the 23,351 weaker bolts needed to be replaced.
But the issue has led to questions about communications between regulators and the arena's developer, Forest City Ratner.
The New York City Buildings Department said its inspectors had not been told about the problem with the bolts.
''The department was not made aware of this issue,'' said Anthony Sclafani, a Buildings Department spokesman. ''We would expect to be notified in a case like this.''
But Forest City provided a copy of a nine-page letter concerning the bolts that it said had been filed with the Buildings Department on Sept. 14. That was the day the agency issued a temporary certificate of occupancy that allowed the arena to open as scheduled.
The letter, from an engineering company, outlined a plan to address the ''recent discovery'' that incorrect bolts had been used. It did not indicate how many bolts would be replaced, only that a ''change out'' had begun.
Robert Sana, executive vice president for construction at Forest City Ratner, played down the problem. He said such issues were not unusual during a major construction project, particularly one with highly customized architecture. But the result was worth it, he said.
''Our building is successful because it creates a proper front door for the project and a dramatic entrance that arenas generally don't have, sitting in the middle of a suburban parking lot,'' Mr. Sana said.
Bruce C. Ratner, chief executive of Forest City Ratner, had offered something for everyone when in 2003 he unveiled plans for the $4.9 billion Atlantic Yards development, which includes the arena.
There would be a professional basketball team to salve the wound left by the departure, many decades before, of the Brooklyn Dodgers baseball team. The project would have lots of affordable housing, and a striking design by the architect Frank Gehry.
But the recession and opposition from community groups stalled the project. In 2009, Mr. Ratner jettisoned the Gehry design, which called for a $1 billion arena, because it was too expensive.
He asked a more conventional arena architect, Ellerbe Becket Architects and Engineers, to come up with an alternative. Later, he brought in SHoP Architects to give the building a striking facade that Mr. Ratner hoped would fulfill his original promise.
''It was clear to us, coming off a Gehry design, that we couldn't do just anything,'' Mr. Sana said.
SHoP wrapped the arena in three bands of pre-weathered steel to give a gritty, muscular cast, hinting at an industrial past. A swooping canopy with an oculus, or circular window, extended 80 feet from the front doors toward a new subway entrance.
''This had to be a civic gesture, with the canopy and the oculus creating a public area where people would want to gather, at the mouth of mass transit,'' said Christopher Sharples of SHoP. ''It's a legacy project. It's not just about sports.''
In February 2010, Hunt Construction, Forest City's manager for the project, awarded a $32.4 million contract to ASI Limited, a steel fabricator outside Indianapolis, to produce the 12,000 panels that cover 85 percent of the facade.
ASI was to put the panels through a series of wet and dry cycles over four months to create the protective rusty patina.
But right before Christmas 2011, ASI defaulted on a bank loan and shut its doors.
Hunt Construction was eventually able to have the fabrication plant reopened. Most of the original workers were hired to fill two 12-hour shifts a day in a race to make up for lost time.
But in August, an engineering firm discovered the problem with the bolts that fastened the steel plates to the structure. The fabricator had sent five-eighths-of-an-inch bolts that were half as strong as those of that size that had been ordered.
In the end, engineers determined that only 1,768 of the 23,351 bolts -- about 8 percent -- would need to be cut out and replaced. Workers in December were replacing the final batch, all in the canopy that extends over the entryway.
As for the blossoms of metal staining the sidewalks surrounding the arena? Eventually the panels will stop rusting and workers will use power washers to remove all traces of metal from the sidewalks.

HEADLINE: Fixing Our Food Problem

BYLINE: By MARK BITTMAN. 
Thomas L. Friedman is off today.

 BODY:
Nothing affects public health in the United States more than food. Gun violence kills tens of thousands of Americans a year. Heart disease, cancer, stroke and diabetes kill more than a million people a year - nearly half of all deaths - and diet is a root cause of many of those diseases.
And the root of that dangerous diet is our system of hyper-industrial agriculture, the kind that uses 10 times as much energy as it produces. 
We must figure out a way to un-invent this food system. It's been a major contributor to climate change, spawned the obesity crisis, poisoned countless volumes of land and water, wasted energy, tortured billions of animals... I could go on. The point is that "sustainability" is not only possible but essential: only by saving the earth can we save ourselves, and vice versa.
How do we do that?
This seems like a good day to step back a bit and suggest something that's sometimes difficult to accept.
Patience.
We can only dismantle this system little by little, and slowly. Change takes time. Often - usually - that time exceeds the life span of its pioneers. And when it comes to sustainable food for billions, we're the pioneers of a food movement that's just beginning to take shape. The abolition movement began at least a century before the Civil War, 200 years before the civil rights movement. The struggle to gain the right to vote for women in the United States was active for 75 years before an amendment was passed. The gay rights struggle has made tremendous strides over the last 40 years, but equal treatment under the law is hardly established.
Activists who took on these issues had in common a clear series of demands and a sense that the work was ongoing. They had a large and ever-growing public following and a willingness to sacrifice time, energy and even life for the benefit not only of contemporaries but for subsequent generations.
They were also aware that there is no success without a willingness to fail; that failure is a part of progress. A single defeat was seen as a temporary setback. The same vision should be applied to every issue the nascent food movement is tackling.
Yet before we can assess our progress, we must state our goals. There is no consensus behind a program for achieving sustainable production of food that promotes rather than attacks health. We can't ask for "better food for all"; we must be specific. In the very near term, for example, we must fight to protect and improve programs that make food available to lower-income Americans. We must also support the increasingly assertive battles of workers in food-related industries; nothing reflects our moral core more accurately than the abuses we overlook in the names of convenience and economy.
Beyond that, I believe that the two issues that will have the greatest reverberations in agriculture, health and the environment are reducing the consumption of sugar-laden beverages and improving the living conditions of livestock.
About the first I have written plenty, and can summarize: when we begin treating sugar-sweetened beverages as we do tobacco, we will make a huge stride in improving our diet.
The second is even more powerful, and progress was made in that arena in 2012 as one food company after another resolved to (eventually) reject pork produced with gestation crates. So over the next few years, some animals will be treated somewhat better. This is absolutely, unquestionably thanks to public pressure, which should now set its sights higher and insist that all animals grown for food production be treated not just better but well.
Well-cared-for animals will necessarily be more expensive, which means we'll eat fewer of them; that's a win-win. They'll use fewer antibiotics, they'll be produced by more farmers in more places, and they'll eat less commodity grain, which will both reduce environmental damage and allow for more land to be used for high-quality human food like fruits and vegetables.
Allies may argue that I miss the mark with either or both of these, and that's fine: it's a discussion. The point is that no major food issue will be resolved in the next 10 years. As pioneers, we must build upon incremental progress and not be disheartened, because often there isn't quick resolution for complex issues.
An association between tobacco and cancer was discovered more 200 years ago. The surgeon general's report that identified smoking as a public health issue appeared in 1964. The food movement has not yet reached its 1964; there's isn't even a general acknowledgment of a problem in need of fixing.
So, in 2013, let's call for energy, action - and patience.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Biotech Players Lead a Boom in Cambridge

BYLINE: By KAREN WEINTRAUB

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Mass. -- Anyone who knows the history of this town would be surprised to find a fashionable coffee shop on Third Street, with dozens of people walking by. The lattes and chai teas are being sold on a Kendall Square site that had been empty for most of the last 40 years -- since factories with names like American Rubber and the Badger Company were razed for a NASA facility that was never built.
Instead, the land lay fallow for decades, even as spinoff companies from the adjacent Massachusetts Institute of Technology transformed the neighborhood into a major research hub. 
But now, this corner of Cambridge is at the center of a real estate boom.
''You sit here and you'd never know there's a recession going on anywhere else in the country,'' Travis McCready, executive director of the Kendall Square Association, said over chai tea recently at Voltage Coffee & Art.
Cranes are busy on eight separate construction sites in this area, and roughly two million square feet of space is being built or renovated or is under city review here. An additional 1.4 million new square feet is committed, and more is expected elsewhere in this city of 106,000, located directly across the Charles River from the city of Boston. If it all gets built, the new investment in Cambridge will come close to $2 billion.
''It's one of the hottest submarkets in the country,'' said Steven Purpura, managing partner of Richards Barry Joyce & Partners, a commercial real estate firm based in Boston. ''Top two or three for sure.''
Most of that growth is connected to the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, including new buildings for Pfizer and Novartis. Amazon just revealed plans to rent 100,000 square feet here; Google is expanding its footprint by 40,000 square feet; and Microsoft, I.B.M. and Nokia are nearby.
Pharmaceutical companies traditionally preferred suburban enclaves where they could protect their intellectual property in more secluded settings and meet their employees' needs.
But in recent years, as the costs of drug development have soared and R.& D. pipelines slowed, pharmaceutical companies have looked elsewhere for innovation. Much of that novelty is now coming from biotechnology firms and major research universities like M.I.T. and Harvard, just two subway stops away.
''People are putting their pride away and working with who they need to work with,'' said George A. Scangos, chief executive of Biogen Idec.
Mr. Scangos's company illustrates the trend. When he took the helm at Biogen in 2010, his predecessor had just relocated the company's headquarters to the suburban town of Weston, leaving its scientists behind in Cambridge, a half-hour's drive away.
Mr. Scangos thought the separation was bad for the company, but rather than move the scientists, he decided to bring the company back to town. Biogen is now the anchor tenant of a $500 million, 1.7-million-square-foot development being built by Alexandria Real Estate Equities, on the former urban renewal site. The rest of its 3,500 local employees will occupy a second building nearby also expected to be completed by late 2013 by Boston Properties.
''It's an amazing place to be,'' Mr. Scangos said. ''The intellectual firepower that is in Cambridge, between Harvard and M.I.T. and the number of companies, is quite remarkable.''
Pfizer also chose Cambridge when it was looking to consolidate some of its research operations. In 2011, the pharmaceutical giant announced it would move 400 research jobs to a new building on M.I.T.-owned land in Cambridge, even as it was closing facilities in Groton, Conn., and elsewhere. That $300 million, 180,000-square-foot building is expected to be completed later this year.
Novartis, one of the first giant pharmaceutical companies to set up major operations in Cambridge, is adding two buildings to its campus on Massachusetts Avenue. They will occupy a combined 550,000 square feet at a cost of $600 million when they open in 2015.
And a fourth pharmaceutical company, Millennium: The Takeda Oncology Company, hopes to double its Cambridge footprint, occupying a 250,000-square-foot building proposed in Central Square, just down Massachusetts Avenue from M.I.T.
Trends in philanthropy are helping Cambridge, as well. Large donations from private philanthropies helped build the $200 million David H. Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research, completed last year on the M.I.T. campus, in addition to a second, 250,000-square-foot building for the Broad Institute, a genetics research institute spun off from Harvard and M.I.T. The Ragon Institute, a collaborative venture of M.I.T., Harvard and Massachusetts General Hospital to support AIDS vaccine research, will move into a nearby building now being renovated.
Another boost is coming from area hospitals. Five Harvard-affiliated hospitals and Harvard Medical School are clustered in Boston's Longwood Medical Area. While that area is nearly built out, Kendall Square is one stop on the rail line from Mass General, the other Harvard-affiliated flagship hospital, providing easy collaboration.
Mr. Scangos said he liked to look out his office window and see all his competitors. When he goes downstairs to lunch, he has choices now, beyond the food trucks and cafeterias that were the only options a few years ago.
Although the closest drugstore and market are still a 20-minute walk away, that may change soon, too. Over the last seven years, 1,000 housing units have opened up in Kendall Square, adding to demand for such stores, Mr. McCready said. And last month, M.I.T. formally filed a rezoning petition with the city to turn 26 acres near its red line subway stop into a ''gateway'' for the campus, along with nearly 1 million square feet of office space and 240,000 square feet for housing units.
''All in all, it's a pretty exciting time,'' said Robert Healy, Cambridge's city manager for more than three decades. ''This is not the best of economic times. Yet there's still the faith being shown in Cambridge by virtue of what's in the ground and going up now.''

HEADLINE: A Century Ago, a Mayor Who Wrote Back

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
John V. Lindsay often delivered homespun advice to ordinary constituents, and Edward I. Koch claims to have answered every letter or e-mail he has received. But a century ago, few elected officials were more prolific or perspicacious in their correspondence than William J. Gaynor, who became New York City's mayor 103 years ago on Tuesday, and served until 1913.
A biographer, Lately Thomas, wrote that Mayor Gaynor's "means of communicating with the mass of the people were two: the daily newspapers and the United States mails," and that he spent a considerable amount of his workdays personally answering his constituents. One critic even complained that the mayor, who wrote thousands of his letters in office, conducted "government by epistle."
In sheer numbers, probably no mayor except Mr. Koch came close. And Mayor Gaynor's letters were distinguished by frequent references to philosophers and other learned figures whom he had encountered during his early religious training. 
His candor, sagacity, vigorous defense of civil liberties and fierce independence (and his scrapping of the East River bridge tolls) endeared him to his constituents. In 1910, his shooting by a fired city employee prompted such an outpouring of sympathy that he was briefly mentioned for governor and even president. (Mayor Gaynor died three years later of complications from the wound.)
A former seminary student and State Supreme Court justice, he was nominated for mayor by the regular Democratic organization, but governed independently and was described as a liberal with libertarian leanings.
His inauguration as mayor on Jan. 1, 1910, was his first visit to City Hall. From then on, he routinely walked across the Brooklyn Bridge between his office and his home in Park Slope, Brooklyn. He often coupled common sense with Greek philosophy, which, he wrote, "seemed to astonish the whole journalistic fraternity in New York City."
No less a cynic than H.L. Mencken pronounced Mayor Gaynor a "great political philosopher and a great soul" who "began an heroic but vain effort to give New York decent government."
The mayor dictated his letters, many of which survive as typed copies in the municipal archives. No subject was too small; he once delivered a lengthy exposition on how to boil an egg.
Mayor Gaynor dismissed critics with sarcasm. Accusing a Republican politician of lying, he wrote, "Suppose you pray every morning for a while for God to direct you to tell the truth, and see what fruits it will bear."
When Charles M. Frey, an erudite rat catcher, complained that his livelihood was threatened by repeated calls to jury duty, the mayor suggested that rat catchers be exempt, cautioning, though, that "so many exemptions have already been passed by the Legislature that there seems to be only the rat catchers and a few other people left to serve on juries."
To a solicitation for a $10 contribution from the Anti-Saloon League, Gaynor wrote: "If I gave money in response to all the similar demands that are made on me, I should be bankrupt in short order."
When a Christian minister asked for a license to preach conversion in predominantly Jewish neighborhoods of Brooklyn, the mayor responded, "Did not we Christians get much or the most of what we have from the Jews?''
When city aldermen proposed banning the Socialist's red flag, Gaynor lectured, "They chose the color red for their emblem, not to signify that they favor violence or the shedding of blood, as the unintelligent suppose and as actions of those in official authority often lead people to believe, but for the purposes of typifying the common brotherhood of all men of all nations through the same red blood which flows through the veins of all.''
Constituents frequently groused about noise. To one who was irked by the cries of newsboys, Gaynor wrote, "A whole lot of people have been hollering at me of late, but they do not disturb me, and much less does the hollering of the little newsboys disturb me."
To another who worked in the Flatiron Building near a church presided over by his nemesis, the Rev. Charles H. Parkhurst, and who complained that the clock on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company tower chimed 40 times an hour, he wrote: "But really, does the clock make as much noise as Dr. Parkhurst does? You know we all have to bear with something, and I am willing to do my share of it."
When a Manhattan lawyer demanded that piano playing and singing be banned at night, especially during the summer when people open their windows, the mayor advised: "I hereby authorize you to carry out all of these reforms. It may be that you will first have to get elected to the Legislature, and pass laws therefor, for you know this is a government of laws, and not of men."
He championed children's street games, advising one young man who wrote him, "If you show this letter to the policeman, I think he will let you play with a soft rubber ball on 101st Street between Lexington and Park Avenues if you ask him and if you are careful not to hit other people."
To a correspondent who grumbled that aldermen were extorting a fee to preside over marriages, he wrote, "if I had time I would marry you all for nothing."
His reply to a Chicago woman reads like advice to the lovelorn: "You are looking for happiness in the wrong direction. I do not think there is any man living who would suit you. If you want to be really happy for the rest of your life, work for the happiness of others, and forget yourself."
Gaynor was not easily impressed. Responding to a book by the pastor of a Park Slope church, he wrote that the Emancipation Proclamation "had to be almost extorted" from President Abraham Lincoln, "and the Russian emperor had done the like not long before."
Of George Washington, Gaynor wrote that he was "of warm blood and prone to passion," that he was "even known to have sworn like a trooper at times," that his "face was pitted" and that he "was not the equal in knowledge of history, economics and government of the men who surrounded him."
Many of the letters were answered the same day they were received. Form letters were dismissed. Anonymous ones were often answered in the press. "You are evidently a dishonest scamp, but I acknowledge the receipt of all letters," he wrote one correspondent.
And to the National Publicity Bureau, which asked what message he would deliver to readers of the group's 3,000-member newspapers, the mayor replied, "I would say to them to be very careful about believing all they see in the newspapers."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Energy Drinks Promise Edge, But Experts Say Proof Is Scant

BYLINE: By BARRY MEIER; Hiroko Tabuchi contributed reporting from Tokyo and Poypiti Amatatham from Bangkok.

 BODY:
Energy drinks are the fastest-growing part of the beverage industry, with sales in the United States reaching more than $10 billion in 2012 -- more than Americans spent on iced tea or sports beverages like Gatorade.
Their rising popularity represents a generational shift in what people drink, and reflects a successful campaign to convince consumers, particularly teenagers, that the drinks provide a mental and physical edge.
The drinks are now under scrutiny by the Food and Drug Administration after reports of deaths and serious injuries that may be linked to their high caffeine levels. But however that review ends, one thing is clear, interviews with researchers and a review of scientific studies show: the energy drink industry is based on a brew of ingredients that, apart from caffeine, have little, if any benefit for consumers.
''If you had a cup of coffee you are going to affect metabolism in the same way,'' said Dr. Robert W. Pettitt, an associate professor at Minnesota State University in Mankato, who has studied the drinks. 
Energy drink companies have promoted their products not as caffeine-fueled concoctions but as specially engineered blends that provide something more. For example, producers claim that ''Red Bull gives you wings,'' that Rockstar Energy is ''scientifically formulated'' and Monster Energy is a ''killer energy brew.'' Representative Edward J. Markey of Massachusetts, a Democrat, has asked the government to investigate the industry's marketing claims.
Promoting a message beyond caffeine has enabled the beverage makers to charge premium prices. A 16-ounce energy drink that sells for $2.99 a can contains about the same amount of caffeine as a tablet of NoDoz that costs 30 cents. Even Starbucks coffee is cheap by comparison; a 12-ounce cup that costs $1.85 has even more caffeine.
As with earlier elixirs, a dearth of evidence underlies such claims. Only a few human studies of energy drinks or the ingredients in them have been performed and they point to a similar conclusion, researchers say -- that the beverages are mainly about caffeine.
Caffeine is called the world's most widely used drug. A stimulant, it increases alertness, awareness and, if taken at the right time, improves athletic performance, studies show. Energy drink users feel its kick faster because the beverages are typically swallowed quickly or are sold as concentrates.
''These are caffeine delivery systems,'' said Dr. Roland Griffiths, a researcher at Johns Hopkins University who has studied energy drinks. ''They don't want to say this is equivalent to a NoDoz because that is not a very sexy sales message.''
A scientist at the University of Wisconsin became puzzled as he researched an ingredient used in energy drinks like Red Bull, 5-Hour Energy and Monster Energy. The researcher, Dr. Craig A. Goodman, could not find any trials in humans of the additive, a substance with the tongue-twisting name of glucuronolactone that is related to glucose, a sugar. But Dr. Goodman, who had studied other energy drink ingredients, eventually found two 40-year-old studies from Japan that had examined it.
In the experiments, scientists injected large doses of the substance into laboratory rats. Afterward, the rats swam better. ''I have no idea what it does in energy drinks,'' Dr. Goodman said.
Energy drink manufacturers say it is their proprietary formulas, rather than specific ingredients, that provide users with physical and mental benefits. But that has not prevented them from implying otherwise.
Consider the case of taurine, an additive used in most energy products.
On its Web site, the producer of Red Bull, for example, states that ''more than 2,500 reports have been published about taurine and its physiological effects,'' including acting as a ''detoxifying agent.'' In addition, that company, Red Bull of Austria, points to a 2009 safety study by a European regulatory group that gave it a clean bill of health.
But Red Bull's Web site does not mention reports by that same group, the European Food Safety Authority, which concluded that claims about the benefits in energy drinks lacked scientific support. Based on those findings, the European Commission has refused to approve claims that taurine helps maintain mental function and heart health and reduces muscle fatigue.
Taurine, an amino acidlike substance that got its name because it was first found in the bile of bulls, does play a role in bodily functions, and recent research suggests it might help prevent heart attacks in women with high cholesterol. However, most people get more than adequate amounts from foods like meat, experts said. And researchers added that those with heart problems who may need supplements would find far better sources than energy drinks.
A spokeswoman for Red Bull did not respond directly to the European marketing claims report but said that the company did ''not make claims for individual ingredients but rather for the product in its entirety.''
To woo consumers, companies have also used another tactic -- including huge amounts of well-known nutrients that make for eye-catching numbers on labels.
For example, a two-ounce bottle of 5-Hour Energy contains 500 micrograms of Vitamin B12, or 8,333 percent of the recommended daily allowance. The energy shot also has 20 times the recommended intake of Vitamin B6.
B-group vitamins serve many functions, such as in the digestion of food. But several experts said that healthy people get adequate amounts of them from food and that huge added dosages do not provide benefits.
''They are not going to increase energy levels,'' said Paul R. Thomas, a scientific adviser with the National Institutes of Health Office of Dietary Supplements.
Elaine Lutz, a spokeswoman for the distributor of 5-Hour Energy, Living Essentials of Farmington Hills, Mich., said the amounts of B vitamins used were safe and effective. ''The body is going to use what it needs and it is going to excrete what it does not absorb,'' said Ms. Lutz.
The sugar found in some drinks does provide a quick source of energy. But as for glucuronolactone, the additive that made rats swim better, the authors of a recent report in a scientific journal, Nutrition Reviews, said they were clueless as to why it was used in the products or what it did.
''Certainly, this is one ingredient for which evidence-based studies are needed to justify its popularity,'' wrote the researchers. That same review, which examined all published energy drink studies, also concluded that there was an ''overwhelming lack of evidence to substantiate claims'' that drink ingredients, apart from caffeine and sugar, provided any benefits.
The roots of the energy drink phenomenon -- and the claims surrounding ingredient mixes -- can be traced to Japan. Those origins appear tied to the emergence of supposed cure-alls after World War II, a time when drugs there were in short supply.
In the late 1940s, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, a Japanese drug maker, began selling taurine extract, apparently drawn to it by accounts citing its wartime use by the Japanese Imperial Navy to reduce fatigue among sailors and sharpen their vision at night, a history of the drug company states. ''A formula that is so effective in treating unexplained fevers, neuralgia, fatigue, whooping cough and other conditions for which there is no drug is very rare indeed,'' an advertisement for the extract declared.
But around 1960, Taisho executives decided to use taurine in a new product, one that helped start the energy drink industry -- Lipovitan D.
Lipovitan D, which was sold in a small vial, contained 50 milligrams of caffeine, 1,000 milligrams of taurine, various B vitamins and flavorings. The product, which was sold cold in drugstores, was a huge success during Japan's economic boom years, particularly with overworked office employees.
However, 50 years and 34 billion bottles later, Taisho officials acknowledged they had not run a single clinical study involving Lipovitan D or taurine.
''Taurine is added to Lipovitan D not so much for specific medicinal benefits but for its multifaceted functions,'' said Dr. Takanori Kouchiwa, a Taisho executive.
It was also in the 1960s that a product appeared in Thailand that was similar to Lipovitan D in its ingredient mix. It was called Krating Daeng (pronounced grating deng), or Red Bull. An Austrian businessman named Dietrich Mateschitz reportedly discovered it when trying to cure a case of jet lag and, in 1987, he and the drink's Thai creator founded Red Bull.
Red Bull quickly became popular in Europe with truck drivers and students and as a mixer for alcoholic drinks. It arrived in the United States in the late 1990s and soon inspired hundreds of competitors. In 2002, for example, Monster Energy was marketed in a 16-ounce can, twice as large as Red Bull's 8-ounce can and with twice as much caffeine.
Over the years, some producers have financed scientific studies to try to bolster performance claims. A British researcher, Dr. Chris Alford, said that Red Bull approached him about a decade ago while he was doing work on the ability of stimulants to reduce fatigue in drivers.
In 2001, Dr. Alford, a psychologist at the University of the West of England in Bristol who has received financing from Red Bull, published a study that found test participants given the energy drink had better reaction times, were more alert and showed increased physical endurance than test subjects given a placebo like flavored water. But studies like Dr. Alford's, researchers say, only underscore caffeine's known benefits. And more recent attempts to tease out the impacts of drink ingredients have produced mixed results.
Last August, Scottish researchers reported that 1,000 milligrams of taurine taken as a supplement appeared to improve the performance of middle-distance runners. But other taurine studies have been negative or inconclusive. ''We found it difficult to make any conclusions about what taurine was doing,'' said a graduate researcher at Tufts University, Grace Giles, who headed a study that ran participants through a battery of mental reaction and memory tests.
Dr. Goodman, the University of Wisconsin researcher, said he believed there was a reason for such equivocal results. The scientist, who works at the school's college of veterinary medicine, said that laboratory animals, like mice or rats, must be given huge dosages of taurine to see an effect.
''You can force a mouse to drink a lot of taurine,'' said Dr. Goodman. ''With humans, it is harder to do.''
What may qualify as the strangest trial in the annals of energy drink studies was financed by Living Essentials, the distributor of 5-Hour Energy. The office of a proctologist in a small Maine town apparently served as a setting for the 2007 study, the results of which were never published. But its findings and other details about it, like its location, emerged in a 2008 lawsuit filed by the maker of Monster Energy against Living Essentials.
The study found that test subjects given 5-Hour Energy experienced ''energy'' for about 40 minutes longer than when given Red Bull or Monster Energy, though it was not clear from court papers whether that difference reflected the energy shot's higher levels of caffeine.
But another finding from that study sheds an interesting light on one of 5-Hour Energy's central claims -- that the energy shot, unlike competitors', produces ''No Crash Later.''
According to the study, 24 percent of test participants who received 5-Hour Energy had reactions similar to a ''moderately severe crash that left them extremely tired and in need of rest, another drink or some other action,'' lawsuit filings show.
Ms. Lutz, the Living Essentials spokeswoman, said the bold ''No Crash Later'' statement on product labels was followed by a special mark. That mark, which also appears on the back label, explains in fine print that ''no crash means no sugar crash.''
That is hardly surprising, because 5-Hour Energy does not contain sugar.
Asked whether consumers mistakenly believe that the shot does not produce a caffeine-related crash, Ms. Lutz said that the use of the special mark and its explanation were clear. ''I don't believe that it is misleading,'' said Ms. Lutz, who added that the advertising division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus had approved the ''No Crash Later'' claim.
She added that another study showing the benefits of 5-Hour Energy was undergoing ''peer review'' for possible publication in a scientific journal. But she declined to say why the results of the study, which was apparently conducted five years ago, had not yet appeared. That study found a benefit when 5-Hour Energy was compared to a placebo like flavored water, she said.
Whatever the case, the energy drink boom has come full circle in Asia, the region where it started. Over the last decade, sales of Lipovitan D have fallen and its maker, Taisho Pharmaceuticals, has tried various strategies to revitalize the brand. Among them: bringing out Lipovitan Junior, a caffeine-free version for children.
In Thailand, Krating Daeng has suffered a similar fate. Its producer has tried to freshen up that brand by proclaiming that the Vitamin B12 in it ''helps the functions of the nervous system and brain.''
Last year, the Foundation for Consumers in Thailand, an advocacy group, started a publicity campaign against energy drinks like Krating Daeng, arguing that producers were promoting unfounded health claims to push caffeine.
''This product just needed a way to add value to extend its life cycle,'' said Patchara Klaewkla, an official at the foundation. ''This product has been in the market for a long time.''

HEADLINE: On the World's Plates, A Bit of New York

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
HONG KONG
AT Mario Batali's luxe new Lupa in a gleaming tower on Queen's Road here, soignée Chinese diners, expatriate regulars and foreign tourists glide up escalators to their tables. They navigate past a four-foot-tall bronze of Romulus and Remus in this sleek $3.2 million restaurant of glass, steel and floral terrazzo. On the menu are bucatini all'amatriciana and spaghetti alla carbonara.
Eight thousand miles away, in the original Lupa in an unassuming storefront on Thompson Street in Manhattan, dressed-down customers crowd the battered tables of Mr. Batali's thriving Roman osteria. Yes, bucatini and carbonara are on the menu.
If the two restaurants' décor, customers and locales are vastly disparate, their core menus and basic concepts are the same, as is another crucial element: the buzz and edge of New York City dining. 
As the economy in the United States sputters and Europe's reels, New York restaurateurs are exporting their increasingly sought-after brands to the more robust economies of Asia and the Middle East.
Mr. Batali has opened two restaurants in Singapore and two in Hong Kong, where Michael White also has an outpost of his Italian-food empire. Danny Meyer has Shake Shacks in Dubai, Kuwait, Qatar and, as of last month, Abu Dhabi. The chef Laurent Tourondel and the restaurateur Jimmy Haber own three BLT restaurants in Hong Kong and are thinking of adding more there and elsewhere.
''We've been approached by Qatar, Korea, the Philippines,'' Mr. Haber said.
Other New York chefs and restaurateurs who have already set up foreign operations include Daniel Boulud, in Singapore, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten, in Shanghai and Doha, Qatar. Zakary Pelaccio and Rick Camac are planning Fatty Crab restaurants in Southeast Asia. David Bouley has been approached about starting a restaurant in Beijing. Gray Kunz departed New York in 2009 to open a restaurant in Hong Kong, then stayed. David Chang said he has been sifting through transoceanic inquiries about planting his flag in Asia and the Middle East.
''In the culinary world, New York is the creative incubator and has some of the best-known restaurants on the planet,'' said Sandeep Sekhri, who invited Mr. Batali, Mr. White and Mr. Tourondel to Hong Kong and now manages their restaurants. ''Here, it is easier to market someone from New York -- they have name recognition.''
Despite complicated feelings about the United States in the Middle East, ''New York City is a very strong brand in its own right,'' said Hilary Baker, a vice president of M.H. Alshaya Company in Kuwait, which has opened the Shake Shacks there and in Dubai. ''And it has a hip urban cachet that helps to define Shake Shack.''
Even the devastation that Hurricane Sandy wreaked on many New York restaurants does not appear to have dampened the owners' ardor to proliferate, or the city's image overseas.
''New York's restaurant brand wasn't affected,'' Mr. Sekhri said, ''because although the hurricane was widely reported in our media, there wasn't much coverage locally of what restaurants had to go through.''
There are economic hurdles, like the frightfully expensive real estate in Hong Kong and some Middle Eastern locations. But considerable profits -- 13 to 15 percent a year, as compared to an average 10 percent or so in New York -- are possible, Mr. Camac said after a recent Asian trip to scout locations for his Fatty restaurants. At the BLT steakhouse and burger places in Hong Kong, Mr. Haber said revenues have risen each year by more than 5 percent.
In the quest for faraway gold, though, restaurateurs must navigate a host of potential pitfalls, including menu mistranslations, cultural embarrassments, difficulties in finding ingredients and staff, and aggressive copycatting.
Foreign partners like Mr. Sekhri are necessary because ''you can't just plunk down an exact copy of the original,'' said Malcolm M. Knapp, who heads a New York restaurant consulting company that bears his name. ''You need to comprehend the exact dynamics of the local market, or you will come aground awfully quick.''
Menus require a difficult balancing act, he added.
''You need to offer that core of items that are your brand, although you might have to change the flavors,'' he said. ''You just have to adapt to the culture.''
Mr. Sekhri, whose company, Dining Concepts, owns or manages 21 restaurants and has $65 million in yearly revenues, described Hong Kong, with its history as an English colony, as the gateway to Asia and the Chinese market. As Joseph Bastianich, Mr. Batali's partner, put it, ''It's an easier way to get your feet wet.''
But there is still a problem with salt.
''You think that Chinese food is very salty,'' Mr. Bastianich said, ''but we learned we had to tone down the salt a whole lot, so as not to have a lot of acidity in the food, because they don't like that.''
Mr. Tourondel discovered that he had to offer a lunch buffet ''because Hong Kong people like to eat buffet style,'' he said. And it turns out that many women here prefer their tap water warm.
One evening in the Hong Kong Lupa -- when, mistakenly, sanitary hats were not delivered for the kitchen staff -- Zach Allen, the restaurant's executive chef, asked workers to wrap table napkins around their heads like bandannas, as they would in an American kitchen.
''But they refused to do it, and I was getting upset,'' Mr. Allen recalled. ''So I asked my Chinese sous chef why, and he said, 'You wear a white bandanna on your head only when you are mourning the death of a loved one.' Boy, did I feel stupid.''
Sharp lessons like these were learned decades ago by American fast-food chains and snack-food companies. A mistranslation of KFC's ''finger-lickin' good'' slogan into Chinese characters urged consumers to ''eat your fingers off,'' before the company fixed it and went on to success in China. In Russia, Lay's potato chips fell flat until the company added a fishy ''crab flavor.''
Brands can be tweaked for foreign consumption, but only up to a point.
''The perception in Hong Kong about Mario was that he was upscale, but we started Lupa as a family-style trattoria,'' Mr. Sekhri said. ''So we made it more Babbo.''
Mr. Bastianich explained that ''in a brand-new, $300 million building, the Hong Kong Lupa couldn't be as rustic as New York's. But it must still offer our menu of authentic Italian food and wine.''
In Kuwait, the Shake Shack menu posed a quandary.
''Bacon won't fly, nor any pork,'' said David Swinghamer, the company's chief development officer. But his team found a beef-based bacon in Europe ''that has a smoky flavor and high quality.''
Cultural challenges do not stop many of these restaurateurs, however.
''We plan to open at least another six Shake Shacks over the next 12 months,'' said Ms. Baker of the Alshaya company, which operates more than 20 restaurant brands in the Middle East, Turkey, Russia and Eastern Europe, including Le Pain Quotidien, Starbucks, Dean & DeLuca and the Cheesecake Factory.
Locating authentic menu ingredients can be a concern abroad, though not in Hong Kong.
''You can get it all here,'' said Mr. Allen, the Lupa chef.
But even in Hong Kong, replicating the New York experience isn't easy. Mr. Tourondel said he made the 16-hour flight here from New York to ''taste more than 50 different formulations of prime Black Angus'' to design an Asian BLT burger similar to the American original.
There is also a 12-hour time difference between New York and Hong Kong.
''Early morning and late evening conference calls certainly elongate the workday,'' said Mr. Swinghamer of Shake Shack. ''We try not to interfere with family and personal time.''
Distance can also provide a useful buffer in partnership disputes or disasters. Mr. Tourondel created his Hong Kong restaurants with Mr. Haber, but after they broke up their American operations in March 2010, the Chinese restaurants were jointly owned by the two through Mr. Sekhri's company. And they will continue to share management, despite the settlement of their ugly legal struggle in November.
Mr. Sekhri said he first approached Mr. Haber and Mr. Tourondel in 2009 about locating in Hong Kong, after local developers told him ''it would add to the value of their real estate if I brought in the right brand names.'' He then approached Mr. White and his partner Ahmass Fakahany -- both of whom declined to be interviewed for this article -- and in May 2011, their 180-seat Al Molo opened here, with an average dinner check of $70.
In many of these deals, the loose network that has developed among New York chefs offered a sounding board.
''Sandeep was chasing us, but I didn't return his phone calls for two years,'' Mr. Bastianich said. ''Finally I got on the phone with him and he was here the next day -- wow! So I checked him out with Michael White, and he said thumbs up.''
Still, New York chefs haven't welcomed every foreign manifestation of their brands. Tom Colicchio, whose holdings in the United States include two Craftsteaks, was surprised a few years ago to find out that Mr. Sekhri had named his own Hong Kong restaurant Craftsteak.
''The guy never called me,'' he said of Mr. Sekhri. ''I never had a conversation with him.''
Mr. Sekhri denies knowing about Mr. Colicchio's restaurants when he chose the name. Their restaurants ''are different,'' he said, adding that ''we are supported by the trademark and intellectual property laws in Hong Kong. If you register the name, you own that brand, under Hong Kong law.''
Mr. Colicchio said, ''We called our trademark people, and they said we'd spend a lot of money but we weren't going to get anywhere.''
Yet surprisingly, Mr. Colicchio was conciliatory. Mr. Sekhri is ''by all accounts good at what he does,'' he said. ''I'm not bitter, and I wouldn't be against working with him'' on a future project.

HEADLINE: Chinese Manufacturing Sector Expands for a 3rd Month

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
An important gauge of China's giant manufacturing sector published Tuesday showed a third successive month of expansion in December and underlined the view that the world's second-largest economy has settled into a mild rebound that is likely to extend into 2013. 
A survey of purchasing managers in the manufacturing sector, released by the national statistics bureau on the first day of the new year, produced a reading of 50.6 points for December. Figures above 50 mean the sector is growing, while those below suggest contraction.
A similar survey released by HSBC on Monday painted a similar picture of solidifying recovery. That index, which is more focused on smaller, privately held businesses than its official counterpart, came in at 51.5 - a full point above the November reading, and the highest in 19 months.
After a marked slowdown during much of 2012, the Chinese economy began to regain some momentum during the last few months of the year. A modest increase in exports, combined with government-induced infrastructure spending and other economy-supporting measures, dissipated fears of a ''hard landing'' during the final quarter of 2012. Analysts widely expect the economy to have expanded about 8 percent in 2012, and to record similar or even slightly stronger growth in 2013.
At the same time, however, analysts caution that the Chinese economy will need to grapple with a host of major challenges and that growth is likely to slow by several percentage points over the next decade.
''Looking forward, China's cyclical rebound still faces strong headwinds,'' Li-Gang Liu and Louis Lam, economists at ANZ, commented in a research note on Tuesday. ''Economic and policy uncertainties in the U.S. and the E.U. suggest that external demand for Chinese exports will remain sluggish.''
Domestically, the government is grappling with rampant corruption and environmental degradation, a widening gap between rich and poor, and the need to reduce the dominance of state-owned enterprises. For growth to be sustainable, the economy will also need to become more driven by domestic demand, rather than government-induced investment and exports, analysts believe.
China's rapidly changing demographics -- an aging population will cause the proportion of non-earners to soar in the coming years -- is adding considerable time pressure.
''The problem is not so much how to maintain short-term growth momentum, but how to prepare China for the demographic challenge ahead,'' Yao Wei, an economist at Société Générale in Hong Kong, said at a media briefing in last month. ''Within ten years, China will have worse demographics than South Korea or Japan. The window of opportunity for policymakers is closing very quickly,'' she added.

HEADLINE: For Brooklyn Entrepreneur, Bolivian Jail and an Actor's Aid

BYLINE: By JOSEPH BERGER; A correspondent for The New York Times contributed reporting from Bolivia.

 BODY:
Jacob Ostreicher was a flooring contractor and father of five from Borough Park, Brooklyn, who, like more than a few entrepreneurs battered by the recession, decided to seek his fortune abroad. In his case, he went into rice farming in Bolivia.
But Mr. Ostreicher's venture has landed him in what, by his account, is a nightmare that has included 18 months in a notorious Bolivian prison and a lengthy battle with corrupt Bolivian prosecutors bent on stealing his business. 
His arrest has turned into an international affair that has drawn in the State Department and the actor-director Sean Penn, who traveled to Bolivia to make a public appeal for Mr. Ostreicher's release from prison in December.
Mr. Penn's lobbying appeared to persuade the Bolivian authorities to relent, at least partly. Mr. Ostreicher was allowed out of prison on bail, but he remains under house arrest in Bolivia.
At the same time, more than a dozen Bolivian officials -- including prosecutors and the chief legal counselor in the Interior Ministry -- have now themselves been thrown into prison, charged with trying to extort Mr. Ostreicher's assets.
In a telephone interview from his home in Santa Cruz, Bolivia, Mr. Ostreicher, 54, professed his innocence and criticized Bolivian and American authorities. His voice was often weak from the effects of a lengthy hunger strike during which he lost 70 pounds.
The Bolivian prosecutors, he said, saw an opportunity to steal at least $16 million in equipment and $20 million in rice from his business. He said prosecutors had trumped up accusations that he laundered drug money.
''They put me in jail without a single shred of evidence,'' Mr. Ostreicher said. ''I felt like a lost soul, a dog.''
The Bolivian government insists that despite the subsequent corruption allegations against the prosecutors, investigators had valid suspicions about Mr. Ostreicher's activities.
Carlos Romero, the interior minister, said Mr. Ostreicher had been arrested because of his involvement in a land deal with a convicted Brazilian drug trafficker. ''Surely this made the entities charged with investigating these matters believe that it was very possible that there was some illegal link with Mr. Ostreicher,'' Mr. Romero said.
By Bolivian standards, Mr. Ostreicher's treatment may not be all that unusual.
Roberto Desogus, an official with the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, told American diplomats last July that Mr. Ostreicher was ''yet another victim of a brutally slow, inefficient, underfunded and corrupt judicial system,'' Mr. Desogus's office said.
Still, Mr. Ostreicher's supporters, including Dov Hikind, a Democratic New York State assemblyman from Borough Park, and Christopher H. Smith, a Republican United States representative from New Jersey, have assailed the State Department for what they said was its indifferent response.
Elizabeth A. Finan, a department spokeswoman, said consular officials had visited Mr. Ostreicher in prison more than 20 times and frequently pressed Bolivian officials for ''a prompt and fair hearing of the facts.''
Mr. Ostreicher, an Orthodox Jew, said that as far as he knew, anti-Semitism did not play a role in how Bolivian prosecutors handled his case.
Mr. Penn intervened after the Aleph Institute, an organization that aids Jewish prisoners, contacted him. He is known for his outspoken left-wing views, including his championing of President Hugo Chávez of Venezuela, a fierce opponent of the United States. The Bolivian president, Evo Morales, a socialist, is a close ally of Mr. Chavez.
After speaking with Mr. Morales, Mr. Penn was able to visit Mr. Ostreicher in Palmasola Prison.
A few days before Mr. Ostreicher's release on Dec. 18, Mr. Penn held a news conference, with Mr. Ostreicher at his side, connected to an intravenous feeding tube. ''There is a cancer attacking at Bolivia's heart,'' Mr. Penn declared, referring to official corruption.
''Jacob and his family are living a nightmare of human abuse,'' he said. ''And this is a moment for me to call on my Bolivian brothers and sisters to lend their courage and compassion on behalf of a man known by all parties -- known by all parties -- to be totally innocent of any criminal activity.''
Mr. Penn did not explain why he decided to get involved in Mr. Ostreicher's case.
In the telephone interview, Mr. Ostreicher praised Mr. Penn, saying: ''Not too many people love Americans more than Sean Penn. Sean Penn helped me because I'm an innocent American.''
Mr. Ostreicher, a grandfather of 11, is the son of Holocaust survivors. He said that around the World War II era, his parents and extended family were able to transfer assets to Switzerland, where Andre Zolty, a lawyer in Geneva, was most recently handling their investments.
In 2008, Mr. Zolty, who has a specialty in agriculture, was convinced by a Colombian lawyer who had worked for him, Claudia Liliana Rodriguez, that there was money to be made in farming rice in Bolivia's lowlands. He urged Mr. Ostreicher to invest.
Mr. Ostreicher traveled to Bolivia periodically to check on the enterprise and became suspicious that Ms. Rodriguez was skimming money. He reported her to the Bolivian authorities, and she is now in jail.
But one of the farmland parcels she had bought belonged to Maximiliano Dorado, who had been convicted in Brazil on drug charges and had escaped to Bolivia. Prosecutors investigating Ms. Rodriguez said they concluded that Mr. Ostreicher could be entangled in the laundering of ''capital of dubious origin.''
The prosecutors never produced evidence to charge him formally. Nevertheless, Mr. Ostreicher ended up in June 2011 as the only American in Palmasola Prison, an experience he described as ''sheer terror.''
It is a huge complex with 3,500 prisoners and is run internally by an inmates' committee, although guards ring the perimeter.
Those close to him say Mr. Ostreicher was assaulted and humiliated until he paid money to committee functionaries. Before his hunger strike, he was able to obtain kosher food, and his wife took him matzos for Passover.
Mr. Ostreicher, who does not know when he will be able to return to the United States, said he was grateful to have survived.
''When I was in prison, I was thinking about Sean Penn's movie 'Dead Man Walking,' '' he said. ''When they dragged me like a dog into the courtroom, I felt like a dead man walking.''

HEADLINE: Malls Blossom in Russia, With a Middle Class

BYLINE: By ANDREW E. KRAMER

 BODY:
MOSCOW -- Shoppers who find that 250 stores aren't enough can go ice skating, watch movies or even ride a carousel, all under a single roof.
While it sounds like the Mall of America, this mall is outside Moscow, not Minneapolis.
''I feel like I'm in Disneyland,'' Vartyan E. Sarkisov, a shopper toting an Adidas bag, said recently while making the rounds of the Mega Belaya Dacha mall.
Instead of bread lines, Russia is known these days for malls. They are booming businesses, drawing investments from sovereign wealth funds and Wall Street banks, most recently Morgan Stanley, which paid $1.1 billion a year ago for a single mall in St. Petersburg.
One mall, called Vegas, rose out of a cucumber field on the edge of Moscow and became, its owners say, larger than the Mall of America if the American mall's seven-acre amusement park is not counted in the calculation of floor space. 
A few offramps away on the Moscow beltway, another mall scored a different kind of victory: the Mega Tyoply Stan shopping center drew 57 million visitors at its peak in 2007, well ahead of the 40 million annual visits reported by the Mall of America.
As American malls dodder into old age, gaptoothed with vacancies, Russia's shopping centers are just now blossoming into their boom years, nourished by oil exports that are lifting wages.
''It's 1982 all over again in Russia,'' said Lee Timmins, the country representative of Hines, a Texas-based real estate group that is opening three outlet malls in Russia, referring to the heyday of the American mall experience. Russians, he said, love malls.
The mall boom illustrates an extraordinarily important theme in Russian economics these days. The growing crowds at malls, and the keen interest in Russian malls on the part of Wall Street banks, are signs that the emerging middle class that made up the street protests against Vladimir V. Putin in Moscow last winter is becoming a force in business as well as politics.
Investors, who with money at stake are a bellwether of the new trends, are not waiting for the next round of protests; they are already placing bets on the rise of a broad affluent class in Russia.
''Over the past 10 years, Russia has turned into a middle-class country,'' Charles Slater, a retail analyst at Cushman & Wakefield, a commercial real estate consulting firm, said in an interview. ''What better to do than go to an enclosed, warm environment with many things on offer, whether that be bowling, cinema or food courts, things the customers have not been used to in the past?''
Moscow now has 82 malls, including two of the largest in Europe, according to the International Council of Shopping Centers, a New York-based trade association. Both are owned by Ikea Shopping Centers Russia, the branch of the Swedish assemble-it-yourself furniture franchise that manages 14 malls here. In Russia, malls are still novel; the first Western-style suburban mall opened in 2000. They are now changing hands as developers sell to institutional investors, like Morgan Stanley, shedding light for the first time on their eye-popping values.
At the core of the attraction for investors is the rising disposable income of Russians, nudged along by policies favoring the middle class, lest their challenge to President Putin's rule intensify.
Russia has a flat 13 percent income tax rate. Most Russians own their homes, a legacy of post-Soviet privatizations, and so pay no mortgage or rent. Health care is socialized.
Not surprisingly, then, Russians have become fanatical shoppers. Russians spend 60 percent of their pretax income on retail purchases, a category that includes food, according to Jones Lang LaSalle, a real estate consulting firm. The country in second place in Europe is Sweden, where retailing accounts for 40 percent of total private spending. Germans, by comparison, spend 28 percent of their salaries shopping, according to Jones Lang LaSalle.
Malls, where the secrets of Western capitalism were finally peeled open and laid bare, with fast food, clothes, ice rinks, electronics and appliances wherever the eye falls, have mesmerized shoppers here -- much as they did in their early years in the United States, from the 1960s to the 1980s.
Olga N. Zaitsova, 55, who was in the Mega Belaya Dacha mall with her granddaughter Anastasia, said she came every weekend, drawn by the warm play area for toddlers. ''It's just not comfortable to be outside when it's so cold,'' she said.
When she shops, she said, ''now we buy things we want, not things we need.''
So, more malls are going up. The essayist Joan Didion, who wrote of malls as they first opened in Southern California in the 1960s, said that they were ''like pyramids to the boom years.'' They were cities, sparkling and ideal, ''in which no one lives but everyone consumes.''
A megamall built for Russians, not surprisingly, is subtly distinct from the idealized urban environment preferred by Americans, a result of careful analysis of consumer behavior and Russian retailing desires.
Most Russian malls have a huge grocery store as an anchor tenant, rather than a department store. Russians are still struggling to find groceries in their neighborhoods. And the sight of row upon row of groceries, stacked to the ceiling, surely soothes a lingering sore spot in the soul of Russian women who were compelled, just two decades ago, to serve their children such items as canned seaweed and powdered milk.
Moscow, the new capital of malls, has more floor space in malls than any other European city, with 34 million square feet.
And as if to drive home the point that the Russian capital has long since moved on from the deprivation and hardship its name still evokes, it has shattered other shopping center records recently.
Belaya Dacha was one of the largest malls in Russia from 2007 until 2010, when it was overtaken by Vegas. The interior space of Vegas is 4.15 million square feet, larger than the Mall of America excluding the Nickelodeon Universe amusement park.
''This is a big world with a lot of people in it,'' Dan Jasper, the spokesman for Mall of America, said. ''I think it's great they are building these things in Russia, too.''
And a new record-setter is going up. Avia Park in northwest Moscow will have five million square feet of interior space including covered parking, which will make it the largest mall in the world outside Asia.
So, the market is buzzing. Morgan Stanley is in talks to buy another mall, the Metropolis in Moscow, for more than $1.2 billion, according to real estate professionals close to the negotiations who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The seller is Capital Partners, a Kazakh developer that opened the mall in 2009.
Malls in Russia appear to be following a familiar course. While some American malls continue to flourish decades after opening, the arc of a mall from buzz to blight has been established in the United States. But it is not here yet.
Hines, which built one of the first megamalls in the United States, the Galleria in Houston, has made a big bet on outlet malls -- one of the categories of retail space that have undercut the classic anchor-tenant model for malls in the United States. Others are strip malls and big-box parks, known as power centers.
For owners of traditional malls, it is an ominous development.
Hines opened an outlet mall a short drive from Mega Belaya Dacha on the territory of the same former collective farm, sharing the name -- and, it hopes, some customers. It is called Belaya Dacha Outlet Village.
It was so cold on a recent weekend that the few visitors at the site of the outlet mall cupped their mittens over their faces, and, puffing and stamping their feet, browsed the shop windows.
Dmitry Razzhevajkin, a property manager with a doctorate in economics, watched intently, noting the monumental stakes of the experiment, a ''first real test of street retail in Russia.''
In retailing, Russia could well be where the United States was in the 1990s. Now, the United States has 685 class-A, superregional malls, the large-scale type flourishing in Russia today. But it also has 65,840 strip malls.

HEADLINE: On the Left, Seeing Obama Giving Away Too Much, Again

BYLINE: By PETER BAKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For President Obama, the fiscal deal passed by Congress on Tuesday finally ends four years of debate with Republicans about raising tax rates on the wealthy. But it seemed to reopen a debate within his party about the nature of his leadership and his skills as a negotiator.
While Mr. Obama got most of what he sought in the agreement, he found himself under withering criticism from some in his liberal base who accused him of caving in to Republicans by not taxing the rich more. Just as Speaker John A. Boehner has been under pressure from his right, Mr. Obama faces a virtual Tea Party of the left that sees his compromise as capitulation.
The main difference is that in the Obama era, the Democratic establishment has been less influenced, or intimidated, by the left than the Republican establishment has been by the right. Liberals have not mounted sustained primary challenges to take out wayward incumbents the way conservatives have. All but three Democrats voting in the Senate and 16 in the House supported the compromise on Tuesday, even as most House Republicans balked, giving Mr. Obama more room to operate than Mr. Boehner. 
But the wave of grievance from liberal activists, labor leaders and economists suggested that the uneasy truce between Mr. Obama and his base that held through the campaign season had expired now that there was no longer a threat of a Mitt Romney victory. It also offered a harbinger of the president's next four years.
The criticism has irritated the White House, which argued that Mr. Obama held true to principle by forcing Republicans to raise income tax rates on the wealthy and extend unemployment benefits and targeted tax credits. Mr. Obama also quashed Republican demands to trim the growth of entitlement benefits. Aides dismissed armchair criticism from those who have never had to negotiate with intractable opposition.
''There's some frustration that over time you would think everybody would have a better understanding of the parameters of this,'' said Robert Gibbs, a longtime adviser to Mr. Obama who once called such critics ''the professional left.'' ''But he understands now probably better than at any other point in his presidency what it means to be a leader, what it means to have to do things that are good not just for one party but good for the country.''
The criticism from the left mirrors past complaints when Mr. Obama included tax cuts in his stimulus package, gave up on a government-run option in health care negotiations and temporarily extended Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy two years ago. Liberals said Mr. Obama should have capitalized on his re-election victory and the expiration on New Year's Day of all of the Bush tax cuts to force Republicans to accept his terms.
''The president remains clueless about how to use leverage in a negotiation,'' said Adam Green, a co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, a liberal advocacy organization. ''Republicans publicly admitted they lost the tax debate and would be forced to cave, yet the president just kept giving stuff away.''
Robert B. Reich, the former labor secretary, said that Mr. Obama ''has stiffened his tactical resolve'' but that ''he's still the same President Obama who wants a deal above all else and seems willing to compromise on even the most basic principle.''
Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said in a Twitter message on Monday that the agreement was ''not a good fiscal cliff deal if it gives more tax cuts to 2 percent.'' Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, said on the floor on Monday that ''this looks like a very bad deal.''
Still, most Democratic lawmakers accepted it, however reluctantly, concluding that voting against it could cause greater economic disruption. Many liberals grew more comfortable once they learned more about the deal, and the revolt on Tuesday by House Republicans seemed to rally them behind the plan and against a common adversary. Mr. Trumka released a new statement hailing elements of the deal, while blaming ''Republican hostage taking'' for its flaws.
Mr. Obama succeeded in forcing Senate Republicans to raise the top income tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent despite their adamant opposition, although he agreed to apply that to household income above $450,000, instead of $250,000. He also won an increase in taxes on wealthy estates to 40 percent from 35 percent, though it was not as high as liberals wanted.
The bill will extend unemployment benefits for two million Americans; renew tax credits for child care, college tuition and renewable energy production; raise capital gains taxes; and phase out deductions for the wealthy. Mr. Obama also insisted that a two-month postponement of automatic spending cuts be financed by $1 in tax revenue for every $1 in spending reductions.
''When the dust settles, there will be a lot of important elements in this for progressives,'' Mr. Gibbs said. The deal can be evaluated only in combination with the result of the next fiscal talks, to be concluded by the end of February, he said, adding, ''We won't know the final score on that until you look at both of those negotiations together.''
Defenders of the White House said it was ludicrous to expect that the president would not have to compromise, given that Republicans control the House and have enough votes in the Senate to filibuster a bill. Without an agreement, economists warned that the country would have been pushed back into recession.
Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, said Mr. Obama had secured important victories like the one on unemployment benefits and stood firm against paring entitlement benefits. ''The president was strong there,'' he told CNN. ''And I think he'll continue to be strong. I think, you know, I notice a different president since he won this election.''
Jared Bernstein, a former economics adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., said Mr. Obama had done what he thought he had to, but he expressed concern that the president might have squandered leverage unless he holds firm in the debate over the debt ceiling. Republicans want to use a vote to raise the ceiling to force Mr. Obama to accept deeper spending cuts, but the president has vowed not to negotiate over the borrowing limit.
''While some appear to think his team folded in the cliff debate, I don't see it that way,'' Mr. Bernstein said. ''They saw a plausible path forward, and they took it. My point is it's only plausible if they really don't get derailed on the debt ceiling debate.''

HEADLINE: Bigger Tax Bite for Most Under Fiscal Pact

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM and CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Only the most affluent American households will pay higher income taxes this year under the terms of a deal that passed Congress on Tuesday, but most households will face higher payroll taxes because the deal does not extend a two-year-old tax break.
The legislation, which was forged in the Senate and overcame resistance in the House late Tuesday will grant most Americans an instant reversal of the income tax increases that took effect with the arrival of the new year. Only about 0.7 percent of households will be subject to an income tax increase this year, according to the Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington. The increases will apply almost exclusively to households making at least half a million dollars, the center estimated in an analysis published Tuesday. 
But lawmakers' decision not to reverse a scheduled increase in the payroll tax that finances Social Security, while widely expected, still means that about 77 percent of households will pay a larger share of income to the federal government this year, according to the center's analysis.
The tax this year will increase by two percentage points, to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent, on all earned income up to $113,700.
Indeed, for most lower- and middle-income households, the payroll tax increase will most likely will equal or exceed the value of the income tax savings. A household earning $50,000 in 2013, roughly the national median, will avoid paying about $1,000 more in income taxes -- but pay about $1,000 more in payroll taxes.
Sabrina Garcia, a 35-year-old accounting assistant from Quincy, Mass., who together with her husband made about $102,000 last year, said the payroll tax increase equated to ''about $200 a month for my family.''
''That's a lot of money for us,'' Ms. Garcia said. ''It means we will have to cut back.'' She said in an e-mail exchange that she will most likely will postpone buying a new computer. ''And forget about being able to save money,'' she added.
The deal will impose larger tax increases on those who make the most. It will raise taxes in two ways: by restoring limits on the amount of income affluent Americans can shelter from federal taxation, and by returning to a top marginal tax rate of 39.6 percent. The current rate is 35 percent.
For married couples filing jointly, the deduction limits apply to income above $300,000, while the top tax rate kicks in above $450,000. But both numbers are somewhat misleading, because ''income'' in this context is a technical term, referring only to the portion of income subject to taxation after exemptions and deductions.
Few households with actual incomes of less than half a million dollars will face a tax increase. The Tax Policy Center calculated that less than 5 percent of families earning $200,000 to $500,000 will actually pay more.
The size of those increases will be much smaller than President Obama originally proposed. The net effect, according to the center's estimates, is that the top 1 percent of households will see an average income tax increase this year of $62,000 rather than $94,000. ''The high-income people really are doing very well in this compared to what the president wanted to do,'' said Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center.
The deal passed by the Senate and the House will impose fewer limits on deductions than the White House plan. It will also tax income from dividends at a flat rate of 20 percent, rather than the same marginal rate as earned income. And there is another important point, often misunderstood: Affluent households will pay the new 39.6 percent rate only on income above $450,000. They and everyone else will still will pay lower rates on income below that threshold.
Households making $500,000 to $1 million will pay an additional $6,700 in taxes on average. Those making more than $1 million will pay an additional $123,000 on average.
Changes in the estate tax will also benefit affluent families. The tax will not apply to the first $5 million of an inheritance, extending the current exclusion rather than reverting to the $3.5 million threshold that President Obama initially favored. However, wealth above that amount will be taxed at a rate of 40 percent rather than the previous rate of 35 percent.
The Obama administration did win a five-year extension of tax breaks for lower-income families, including the child tax credit and earned-income tax credit. Those credits eliminate income tax liability for many lower-income families. In many cases, the government actually makes a direct payment to the family to help offset the burden of payroll taxation -- up to $1,000 a child under the child credit and up to $5,900 total under the earned income credit.
The deal will also restore unemployment benefits for about two million Americans. People who can't find work, and have already received government checks for the standard period of 26 weeks, have been able to stay on the rolls for up to an additional 47 weeks. But financing for that program, which is aimed at the states with the highest unemployment rates, expired Saturday. Under the terms of the deal, people who are eligible will receive any missed benefits retroactively.
The deal also includes new rules for the alternative minimum tax, which threatened this year to impose higher taxes on roughly 30 million households. The tax was created in the 1960s to set a lower limit on the taxes paid by the most affluent households, but the eligibility threshold was not indexed to inflation, so it theoretically encompasses a larger share of households with each passing year. Congress has repeatedly passed short-term increases in the threshold; the deal will make those increases automatic, obviating the annual ritual.
That is small consolation for middle-income Americans like Joe Interlandi, 61, a long-haul trucker who on Tuesday was driving a load of tomatoes from Florida to Los Angeles.
Mr. Interlandi, writing from a rest stop, said he understood the need for higher taxes. He will rather pay more now than impose higher taxes on his children and grandchildren, he said.
But Mr. Interlandi, who estimated that he worked 100 hours many weeks, added that the payroll tax increase still meant he will need to spend even more time on the road. Describing things he will have to cut back on, he wrote, ''Family outings like vacations, and time together.''

HEADLINE: Even With Fiscal Agreement, Investors Facing Imminent Obstacles

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
With the House of Representatives approval of a fiscal agreement late Tuesday, investors were expecting a rally in the markets to start the New Year. But the surge was not expected to last long, with investors and economists quickly shifting their focus to several hurdles the economy faces in the coming months.
''We could see an early lift in the markets because of relief the deal went through,'' said Gary Thayer, the chief macro strategist at Wells Fargo Advisors. ''The response may be muted because the deal left out many long-term issues.'' 
Market strategists were forecasting that even the deal approved by the Senate early Tuesday and by the House late Tuesday night would reduce economic growth by as much as 1 percent in the first quarter of 2013. Much of this would come from a rise in payroll taxes on incomes under $113,700 that would affect about 77 percent of American households.
Then there are the fiscal disagreements that Congress did not try to address in its negotiations this week. Spending cuts of $110 billion were delayed for two months, and politicians have not come up with a long-term solution that would allow the government to get past the borrowing limits reached at the end of the year -- known as the debt ceiling.
''We keep stumbling from patchwork solution to patchwork solution, without getting us to the longer term solutions we need,'' said Michael Gapen, the head of economic research for the United States at Barclays.
Technically, the country went over the so-called fiscal cliff on Tuesday, when markets were closed for the holiday. But the compromise reached later Tuesday should retroactively cancel the tax increases that began.
American stock indexes saw their biggest jump in over a month on Monday in anticipation of a deal moving swiftly through Congress. In early trading on Wednesday, leading indexes rose 2.6 percent in Hong Kong and 1.2 percent in Australia.
''If Congress just comes close to their most modest expectations, investors tend to cheer that,'' said Ed Yardeni, the founder of Yardeni Research. ''A lot of investors are suffering from battered investor syndrome.''
Many economists say that if politicians are ultimately able to reach a more lasting budget agreement, it could allow the focus to turn to signs of improvement in both the United States and global economies. Asian markets have been propelled higher in recent days by data showing that China's manufacturing sector was continuing to expand. In the United States, housing prices have been moving higher and unemployment rates lower.
This has led many economists to forecast stronger growth for the second half of 2013 -- around 2.5 percent -- but only after the weight of the tax increases and budgetary debates are out of the way. In the last few weeks, signs of economic strength have allowed investors to respond with a bit of a shrug to the impasse in Washington. The benchmark Standard & Poor's 500-stock index ended the month of December up, and finished the year 13.4 percent higher.
Many investors are also likely to be happy with the portions of the Congressional agreement that deal with tax rates on dividends, which are now set to rise to 20 percent from 15 percent, less than President Obama had proposed. This could produce some demand for dividend-paying stocks, particularly given then the rates will be put in place permanently.
Congress also surprised some economists by agreeing to extend unemployment benefits for more than 2 million people, and by making changes to the Alternative Minimum Tax that will avert higher tax bills for middle-income households.
But, as expected, Congress decided to allow the payroll tax to rise to 6.2 percent from 4.2 percent. That is likely to immediately crimp the spending power of American consumers, and take about $120 billion out of the economy in 2013.
In the longer term, investor uncertainty heading into the new year underscored the degree to which Wall Street has become consumed by a seemingly never ending series of battles in Washington, in which one budget dispute bleeds into another.
The most severe crisis came in the summer of 2011, the last time the government reached its borrowing limit. Congress ultimately came up with a solution that allowed the government to continue taking on more debt, but only by pushing off the hardest decisions to the end of 2012. The Senate and House votes on Tuesday night put off many of those same decisions until March. At that point, the Treasury Department says it will no longer be able to use extraordinary measures to borrow enough money to operate the government.
The compromise this week also delayed $110 billion in cuts to the defense budget and other government programs until March. If there is no further agreement at that point, those cuts will begin to be phased in, amounting to another hit to the economy.
Even if the debt ceiling and budget cuts are resolved in March, politicians could put off again any long-term answer to the ballooning government deficit and debt problems that are most worrisome to many economists.
''The markets are very quickly going to appreciate that this does not remove this cloud of fiscal uncertainty, it just briefly defers it,'' said Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors. ''I can see no reason that debate should be less divisive than the debate we've just had.''

HEADLINE: Tech Giants Brace for More Scrutiny From Regulators

BYLINE: By SOMINI SENGUPTA. 
Eduardo Porter, whose Economic Scene column normally appears on this page, is off.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Silicon Valley lobbied hard in Washington in 2012, and despite some friction with regulators, fared fairly well. In 2013, though, government scrutiny is likely to grow. And with this scrutiny will come even greater efforts by the tech industry to press its case in the nation's capital and overseas.
In 2012, among other victories, the industry staved off calls for federal consumer privacy legislation and successfully pushed for a revamp of an obscure law that had placed strict privacy protections on Americans' video rental records. It also helped achieve a stalemate on a proposed global effort to let Web users limit behavioral tracking online, using Do Not Track browser settings.
But this year is likely to put that issue in the spotlight again, and bring intense negotiations between industry and consumer rights groups over whether and how to allow consumers to limit tracking. 
Congress is likely to revisit online security legislation -- meant to safeguard critical infrastructure from attack -- that failed last year. And a looming question for Web giants will be who takes the reins of the Federal Trade Commission, the industry's main regulator, this year. David C. Vladeck, the director of the commission's Bureau of Consumer Protection, has resigned, and there have been suggestions that the chairman of the commission itself, Jon Leibowitz, will step down.
The agency is investigating Google over possible antitrust violations and will subject Facebook to audits of its privacy policy for the next 20 years. Its next steps could serve as a bellwether of how aggressively the commission will take on Web companies in the second Obama administration.
''Now that the election is over, Silicon Valley companies each are thinking through their strategy for the second Obama administration,'' said Peter Swire, a law professor at Ohio State University and a former White House privacy official. ''The F.T.C. will have a new Democratic chairman. A priority for tech companies will be to discern the new chair's own priorities.''
In early 2012, an unusual burst of lobbying by tech companies helped defeat antipiracy bills, which had been backed by the entertainment industry. Silicon Valley giants like Facebook and Google feared that the bills would force them to police the Internet.
At the end of the year, Silicon Valley also got its way when the Obama administration stood up against a proposed global treaty that would have given government authorities greater control over the Web.
The key to the industry's successes in 2012 was simple: it expanded its footprint in Washington just as Washington began to pay closer attention to how technology companies affect consumers. ''Privacy and security became top-tier important policy issues in Washington in 2012,'' said David A. Hoffman, director of security policy and global privacy officer at Intel.
''Industry has realized it is important to be engaged,'' he continued, ''to make sure government stakeholders are fully informed and educated about the role that new technology plays and to make sure any action taken doesn't unnecessarily burden the innovation economy while still protecting individual trust in new technology.''
At the end of 2012, tech companies were on track to have spent record amounts on lobbying for the year. In the first three quarters, they spent close to $100 million, which meant that they were likely to surpass the $127 million they spent on lobbying in 2011, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, a Washington-based nonpartisan group that tracks corporate spending. Even the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz hired a lobbyist in Washington: Adrian Fenty, a former mayor of the city.
Technology executives and investors also made generous contributions in the 2012 presidential race, luring both President Obama and Mitt Romney to Northern California for fund-raisers and nudging them to speak out on issues like immigration overhaul and lower tax rates.
In a blog post in November, the center said Silicon Valley's lobbying expenditures have ballooned in recent years, even as spending by other industries has fallen.
Facebook more than doubled its lobbying outlay in the year, reporting close to $2.6 million through the third quarter of 2012. Google spent more than any other company in the industry, doling out more than $13 million in the same period and more than double its nearest competitor, Microsoft, which spent just over $5.6 million in the same period.
Among Google's advocates on Capitol Hill is a former Republican congresswoman, Susan Molinari, who heads Google's office in Washington.
Google has particular reason to be engaged. It faces a wide-reaching antitrust investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, just as Microsoft did a decade ago. At issue is whether Google's search engine results favor Google products over its rivals'.
Although the agency was ready to settle that case before the holidays, without harsh remedies, late last month it shelved the inquiry and put stronger penalties back in play. A resolution is expected in January.
The commission has already fined Google on a separate matter. In 2012, the company paid $22.5 million to settle charges that it had bypassed privacy settings in Apple's Safari browser to track users and serve them targeted advertisements.
Facebook has vastly expanded its Washington presence in recent years. It has set up a political action committee, hired a stable of seasoned, well-connected insiders from both parties and offered tips to lawmakers in an effort to make its site indispensable to politicians seeking re-election.
Facebook scored a win on Capitol Hill in late 2012 when it nudged Congress to amend a 1988 law, the Video Privacy Protection Act, that had protected the privacy of Americans' video rental records. Facebook and its partner, Netflix, the video streaming service, advocated for changes in the law so that movies watched on Netflix could be shared on Facebook. That kind of data can be valuable for behavioral advertising, a principal source of revenue for Web services like Facebook.
The company also attracted increased scrutiny from the F.T.C. The agency negotiated a consent order with Facebook to settle charges that it had engaged in ''unfair and deceptive practices'' when changes in its settings revealed personal information that Facebook users had regarded to be private. As part of the settlement, Facebook agreed to audits of its privacy policies for 20 years.
Facebook faced renewed public outcry last month when its subsidiary, Instagram, proposed to deploy users' pictures to serve targeted advertisements. The company has backtracked on that proposal, but the outcry, say consumer privacy advocates, is an indication of public sentiment.
''Yes, the industry managed to hold off privacy legislation this year,'' said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. ''But if the end-of-year protests over the Facebook and Instagram changes are any indication, users will be pressing for better privacy protections in the next Congress.''
Silicon Valley's lobbying efforts are also likely to expand across the Atlantic in 2013. Both Facebook and Google have faced off with European regulators over privacy issues. Now, the European Parliament is weighing an overhaul of data protection laws that apply across the Continent.
One of the proposed changes requires Web companies to ask European Union citizens for their explicit consent before collecting personal data for targeted Web advertising. Web companies vigorously oppose that and other proposals.

HEADLINE: Beate Gordon, Long-Unsung Heroine Of Japanese Women's Rights, Dies at 89

BYLINE: By MARGALIT FOX

 BODY:
Beate Sirota Gordon, the daughter of Russian Jewish parents who at 22 almost single-handedly wrote women's rights into the Constitution of modern Japan, and then kept silent about it for decades, only to become a feminist heroine there in recent years, died on Sunday at her home in Manhattan. She was 89.
The cause was pancreatic cancer, her daughter, Nicole Gordon, said.
A civilian attached to Gen. Douglas MacArthur's army of occupation after World War II, Ms. Gordon was one of the last living members of the American team that wrote Japan's postwar Constitution. 
Her work -- drafting language that gave women a set of legal rights pertaining to marriage, divorce, property and inheritance that they had long been without in Japan's feudal society -- had an effect on their status that endures to this day.
''It set a basis for a better, a more equal society,'' Carol Gluck, a professor of Japanese history at Columbia University, said Monday in a telephone interview. ''By just writing those things into the Constitution -- our Constitution doesn't have any of those things -- Beate Gordon intervened at a critical moment. And what kind of 22-year-old gets to write a constitution?''
If Ms. Gordon, neither lawyer nor constitutional scholar, was indeed an unlikely candidate for the task, then it is vital to understand the singular confluence of forces that brought her to it:
Had her father not been a concert pianist of considerable renown; had she not been so skilled at foreign languages; and had she not been desperate to find her parents, from whom she was separated during the war and whose fate she did not know for years, she never would have been thrust into her quiet, improbable role in world history.
Nor would she have been apt to embark on her later career as a prominent cultural impresario, one of the first people to bring traditional Asian performing arts to audiences throughout North America -- a job, pursued vigorously until she was nearly 70, that entailed travel to some of Asia's most remote, inaccessible reaches.
The daughter of Leo Sirota and the former Augustine Horenstein, Beate (pronounced bay-AH-tay) Sirota was born on Oct. 25, 1923, in Vienna, where her parents had settled.
When she was 5, her father was invited to teach at the Imperial Academy of Music in Tokyo, and the family moved there for a planned six-month stay. Mr. Sirota soon became revered in Japan as a performer and teacher, and they wound up living in Tokyo for more than a decade.
Beate was educated at a German school in Tokyo and, from the mid-1930s on, after the school became far too Nazified for her parents' liking, at the American School in Japan. In 1939, shortly before her 16th birthday, she left for Mills College in Oakland, Calif. Her parents remained in Japan.
In December 1941, after the attack on Pearl Harbor, it became impossible to contact Japan. Beate had no word from her parents, and no money.
She put her foreign language prowess to work: by this time, she was fluent in English, Japanese, German, French, Spanish and Russian.
Obtaining permission from Mills to take examinations without having to attend classes, she took a job at a United States government listening post in San Francisco, monitoring radio broadcasts from Tokyo. She later worked in San Francisco for the United States Office of War Information, writing radio scripts urging Japan to surrender.
Beate Sirota received her bachelor's degree in modern languages from Mills in 1943 and became a United States citizen in January 1945. At war's end, she still did not know whether her parents were alive or dead.
For American civilians, travel to Japan was all but impossible. She went to Washington, where she secured a job as an interpreter on General MacArthur's staff. Arriving in a devastated Tokyo on Christmas Eve 1945, she went immediately to her family's house. Where it had stood was only a single charred pillar.
She eventually found her parents, who had been interned in the countryside and were malnourished. She took them to Tokyo, where she nursed them while continuing her work for General MacArthur.
One of MacArthur's first priorities was drafting a constitution for postwar Japan, a top-secret assignment, begun in February 1946, that had to be finished in just seven days. As the only woman assigned to his constitutional committee, along with two dozen men, young Beate Sirota was deputized to compose the section on women's rights.
She had seen women's lives firsthand during the 10 years she lived in Japan, and urgently wanted to improve their status.
''Japanese women were historically treated like chattel; they were property to be bought and sold on a whim,'' Ms. Gordon told The Dallas Morning News in 1999. ''Women had no rights whatsoever.''
Commandeering a jeep at the start of that week in February, she visited the libraries in Tokyo that were still standing, borrowing copies of as many different countries' constitutions as she could. She steeped herself in them and, after seven days of little sleep, wound up drafting two articles of the proposed Japanese Constitution.
One, Article 14, said in part, ''All of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin.''
The other, Article 24, gave women protections in areas including ''choice of spouse, property rights, inheritance, choice of domicile, divorce and other matters.''
The new Constitution took effect in 1947; the next year, Beate Sirota married Joseph Gordon, who had been the chief interpreter for American military intelligence in postwar Japan.
In the 1950s, Ms. Gordon joined the staff of the Japan Society in New York, becoming its director of performing arts. In that capacity, she introduced many Japanese artists to the West, including masters of traditional music, dance, woodblock printing and the tea ceremony.
In 1970, she became director of performing arts at the Asia Society in New York. She scoured Asia for talent, bringing Balinese gamelan ensembles, Vietnamese puppeteers, Mongolian dancers and many others to stages throughout the United States and Canada. She retired in 1991 as the society's director of performances, films and lectures.
Ms. Gordon's husband, who became a real estate developer, died last August. Besides her daughter, she is survived by a son, Geoffrey, and three grandchildren.
For decades, Ms. Gordon said nothing about her role in postwar Japan, at first because the work was secret and later because she did not want her youth -- and the fact that she was an American -- to become ammunition for the Japanese conservatives who have long clamored for constitutional revision.
But in the mid-1980s, she began to speak of it publicly. The release of her memoir, ''The Only Woman in the Room,'' published in Japanese in 1995 and in English two years later, made her a celebrity in Japan, where she lectured widely, appeared on television and was the subject of a stage play and a documentary film, ''The Gift From Beate.''
In recent years, amid renewed attacks on the Constitution by Japanese conservatives, Ms. Gordon spoke out ardently in its defense.
Ms. Gordon was awarded the Order of the Sacred Treasure, a high honor bestowed by the Japanese government, in 1998. But perhaps the greatest accolade she received came from Japanese women themselves.
''They always want their picture taken with me,'' Ms. Gordon told ABC News in 1999. ''They always want to shake my hand. They always tell me how grateful they are.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Lines of Resistance

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Just a few years ago, the tax deal pushed through Congress on Tuesday would have been a Republican fiscal fantasy, a sweeping bill that locks in virtually all of the Bush-era tax cuts, exempts almost all estates from taxation, and enshrines the former president's credo that dividends and capital gains should be taxed equally and gently.
But times have changed, President George W. Bush is gone, and before the bill's final passage late Tuesday, House Republican leaders struggled all day to quell a revolt among caucus members who threatened to blow up a hard-fought compromise that they could have easily framed as a victory. Many House Republicans seemed determined to put themselves in a position to be blamed for sending the nation's economy into a potential tailspin under the weight of automatic tax increases and spending cuts.
The latest internal party struggle on Capitol Hill surprised even Senate Republicans, who had voted overwhelmingly for a deal largely hashed out by their leader, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky. The bill passed the Senate, 89 to 8, at 2 a.m. on Tuesday, with only 5 of the chamber's 47 Republicans voting no. 
Twenty-one hours later, the same measure was opposed by 151 of the 236 Republicans voting in the House. It was further proof that House Republicans are a new breed, less enamored of tax cuts per se than they are driven to shrink government through steep spending cuts. Protecting nearly 99 percent of the nation's households from an income tax increase was not enough if taxes rose on some and government spending was untouched.
A party that once disputed that there was any real ''cost'' of tax cuts encountered sticker shock when the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated that enacting them in place of the ''fiscal cliff'' provisions would cost $4 trillion over 10 years.
''I personally hate it,'' Representative John Campbell, a Republican from California, said of the bill. ''The speaker the day after the election said we would give on taxes, and we have, but we wanted spending cuts. This bill has spending increases. Are you kidding me?''
By all accounts, the tax deal negotiated by Mr. McConnell and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is one of the most sweeping fiscal policy changes in a decade, a measure that would bring a certainty to the tax code long demanded by the financial community and taxpayers.
The bill's heft was confirmed on Tuesday by the Congressional Budget Office, which said the income and business tax cut extensions; new capital gains, dividend and estate tax rates; and unemployment compensation would add an estimated $4 trillion to the federal deficit compared with where the government would be if Congress did nothing to halt the tax increases and spending cuts that were triggered at the start of the year.
The independent Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget said that measured against extending all 2012 policies, the deal would cut the deficit by $650 billion over 10 years. The group said the biggest cost, a ''patch'' to the alternative minimum tax to prevent it from suddenly affecting much of the middle class, should not be considered a cost at all because Congress has adjusted it each year anyway.
But the Congressional Budget Office's estimate gave even some Democrats pause, especially since the bill would make permanent virtually all of the Bush tax cuts -- a goal that Mr. Bush chased through the rest of his presidency. ''For four years in my town hall meetings across the state, Coloradans have told me they want a plan that materially reduces the deficit,'' said Senator Michael Bennet, one of three Democrats who voted against the bill. ''This proposal does not meet that standard and does not put in place a real process to reduce the debt down the road.''
The bill would do much more than head off the automatic tax increases and spending cuts. It would fix in place a tax code that for more than a decade has caused struggles over regular sunset provisions, temporary solutions and fleeting incentives. The bill would finally make permanent five of the six income tax rates created in 2001 by the first Bush tax cut. It would codify Mr. Bush's successful push, in 2003, to make tax rates on dividends and capital gains equal so that one form of investment income is not favored over the other.
But it would let lapse a two-percentage-point cut in the payroll tax, one of the recent tax policy changes most squarely aimed at the working class, meaning take-home pay may be less even if higher income taxes are headed off. The Tax Policy Center, a nonpartisan research group in Washington, estimated that 77 percent of Americans could pay more over all to the federal government this year.
''For me, this is very much an 'on the one hand, on the other hand' thing,'' said Ari Fleischer, the White House press secretary in the years of Mr. Bush's tax fights. ''As a Bush loyalist, it's fantastic that the Bush tax cuts, which now have to be seen inarguably as overwhelmingly for the middle class, are being made permanent. On the other hand, it's inarguable that this adds $4 trillion to the federal debt.''
The 10-year price includes $762 billion to lock in the Bush tax rates of 10 percent, 25 percent, 28 percent and 33 percent, along with some of the Bush-era 35 percent bracket; $354 billion to continue Mr. Bush's expanded child credit; and $339 billion to secure Mr. Bush's 15 percent capital gains and dividend rates for families earning less than $450,000. Fixing the alternative minimum tax would cost the Treasury $1.8 trillion, according to the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation.
Democrats say they had little choice. The Bush White House and Republican Congresses structured the tax cuts so that letting them expire would be politically difficult. Add the across-the-board spending cuts if Congress did nothing, and President Obama felt he had to extend most of the tax cuts or watch the economy sink back into recession.
''New occasions make for new truths,'' said Representative Danny K. Davis, a Democrat from Illinois and a veteran of the partisan wars over the Bush tax cuts. ''New situations make ancient remedies uncouth.''
Most galling for Republicans are provisions projected to add $330 billion in spending over 10 years, including $30 billion in unemployment compensation and $21 billion in payments to Medicare health providers. None of those provisions are objectionable on their own, but collectively they almost proved impossible for Republicans to accept.
Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts, R. Glenn Hubbard, a Columbia University economist, was not crowing about their potential enshrinement. He said some Bush-era policies were no longer relevant to the task of tailoring a tax code to a properly sized government.
The 2001 and 2003 tax cuts ''are not the best anchoring point'' for that debate, he said. ''We need a tax system that can promote economic growth and raise the revenue the American people want to devote to government.''

HEADLINE: Senate Passes Tax Increases on Wealthy Americans

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN; Jennifer Steinhauer and Robert Pear contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Senate, in a predawn vote two hours after the deadline passed to avert automatic tax increases, overwhelmingly approved legislation on Tuesday that would allow tax rates to rise only on affluent Americans while temporarily suspending sweeping, across-the-board spending cuts.
The deal, worked out in furious negotiations between Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and the Republican Senate leader, Mitch McConnell, passed 89 to 8, with just three Democrats and five Republicans voting no. Although it lost the support of some of the Senate's most conservative members, the broad coalition that pushed the accord across the finish line could portend swift House passage as early as New Year's Day.
Quick passage before the markets reopen on Wednesday would be likely to negate any economic damage from Tuesday's breach of the ''fiscal cliff'' and largely spare the nation's economy from the one-two punch of large tax increases and across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts in the New Year.
''This shouldn't be the model for how to do things around here,'' Mr. McConnell said just after 1:30 a.m. ''But I think we can say we've done some good for the country.'' 
Mr. Biden, after a late New Year's Eve meeting with leery Senate Democrats to sell the accord, said: ''You surely shouldn't predict how the House is going to vote. But I feel very, very good.''
The eight senators who voted no included Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida and a potential presidential candidate in 2016, two of the Senate's most ardent small-government Republicans, Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mike Lee of Utah, and Senator Charles E. Grassley of Iowa, who as a former Finance Committee chairman helped secure passage of the Bush-era tax cuts, then opposed making almost all of them permanent on Tuesday. Two moderate Democrats, Thomas R. Carper of Delaware and Michael Bennet of Colorado, also voted no, as did the liberal Democrat Tom Harkin, who said the White House had given away too much in the compromise. Senator Richard C. Shelby, Republican of Alabama, also voted no.
The House Speaker, John A. Boehner, and the Republican House leadership said the House would ''honor its commitment to consider the Senate agreement.'' But, they added, ''decisions about whether the House will seek to accept or promptly amend the measure will not be made until House members -- and the American people -- have been able to review the legislation.''
Even with that cautious assessment, Republican House aides said a vote Tuesday was possible.
Under the agreement, tax rates would jump to 39.6 percent from 35 percent for individual incomes over $400,000 and couples over $450,000, while tax deductions and credits would start phasing out on incomes as low as $250,000, a clear victory for President Obama, who ran for re-election vowing to impose taxes on the wealthy.
Just after the vote, Mr. Obama called for quick House passage of the legislation.
''While neither Democrats nor Republicans got everything they wanted, this agreement is the right thing to do for our country and the House should pass it without delay,'' he said.
Democrats also secured a full year's extension of unemployment insurance without strings attached and without offsetting spending cuts, a $30 billion cost. But the two-percentage point cut to the payroll tax that the president secured in late 2010 lapsed at midnight and will not be renewed.
In one final piece of the puzzle, negotiators agreed to put off $110 billion in across-the-board cuts to military and domestic programs for two months while broader deficit-reduction talks continue. Those cuts begin to go into force on Wednesday, and that deadline, too, might be missed before Congress approves the legislation.
To secure votes, Senator Harry Reid, the Senate Democratic leader, also told Democrats the legislation would cancel a pending Congressional pay raise -- putting opponents in the politically difficult position of supporting a raise -- and extend an expiring dairy policy that would have seen the price of milk double in some parts of the country.
The nature of the deal ensured that the running war between the White House and Congressional Republicans on spending and taxes would continue at least until the spring. Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner formally notified Congress that the government reached its statutory borrowing limit on New Year's Eve. Through some creative accounting tricks, the Treasury Department can put off action for perhaps two months, but Congress must act to keep the government from defaulting just when the ''pause'' on pending cuts is up. Then in late March, a law financing the government expires.
And the new deal does nothing to address the big issues that Mr. Obama and Mr. Boehner hoped to deal with in their failed ''grand bargain'' talks two weeks ago: booming entitlement spending and a tax code so complex that few defend it anymore.
Though the deal ultimately passed the Senate, it was greeted with skepticism on Capitol Hill when it was first outlined on Monday. Republicans accused the White House of ''moving the goal posts'' by demanding still more tax increases to help shut off across-the-board spending cuts beyond the two-month pause. Democrats were incredulous that the president had ultimately agreed to around $600 billion in new tax revenue over 10 years when even Mr. Boehner had promised $800 billion. But the White House said it had also won concessions on unemployment insurance and the inheritance tax among other wins.
Still, Democrats openly worried that if Mr. Obama could not drive a harder bargain when he holds most of the cards, he will give up still more Democratic priorities in the coming weeks, when hard deadlines will raise the prospects of a government default first, then a government shutdown. In both instances, conservative Republicans are more willing to breach the deadlines than in this case, when conservatives cringed at the prospects of huge tax increases.
''I just don't think Obama's negotiated very well,'' said Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa.
With the legislation now headed to the House, Republicans there signaled that enough of them, in combination with Democrats, could most likely pass the legislation, just weeks after Republicans shot down Mr. Boehner's proposal to raise taxes only on incomes over $1 million.
''I don't want to say where I am until I read the legislation, but it is certainly better than the alternative,'' said Representative Charlie Dent, Republican of Pennsylvania.
With the threat of huge cuts agonizingly close, official Washington was prepared for the worst. The Defense Department prepared to notify all 800,000 of its civilian employees that some of them could be forced into unpaid leave without a deal on military cuts. The Internal Revenue Service issued guidance to employers to increase withholding from paychecks beginning Tuesday to match new tax rates at every income level.
''No deal is the worse deal,'' said Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, independent of Connecticut, rejecting the assertions of liberal colleagues that no deal would be better than what they would see as a bad deal.
Despite grumbling among Republicans and Democrats, it was clear that a deal hashed out through intense talks between Mr. Biden and Mr. McConnell had given both sides provisions to cheer and to jeer.
Under the deal, tax rates on dividends and capital gains would also rise, to 20 percent from 15 percent, on income over $400,000 for single people and $450,000 for couples. The deal would reinstate provisions to tax law, ended by the Bush tax cuts of 2001, that phase out personal exemptions and deductions for the affluent. Those phaseouts, under the agreement, would begin at $250,000 for single people and $300,000 for couples.
The estate tax would also rise, but considerably less than Democrats had wanted. The value of estates over $5 million would be taxed at 40 percent, up from 35 percent. Democrats had wanted a 45 percent rate on inheritances over $3.5 million.
Under the deal, the new rates on income, investment and inheritances would be permanent, as would a provision to stop the alternative minimum tax from hitting middle-class families.

HEADLINE: Under Pressure, House Approves Senate Tax Deal

BYLINE: By JENNIFER STEINHAUER; Robert Pear and Peter Baker contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Ending a climactic fiscal showdown in the final hours of the 112th Congress, the House late Tuesday passed and sent to President Obama legislation to avert big income tax increases on most Americans and prevent large cuts in spending for the Pentagon and other government programs.
The measure, brought to the House floor less than 24 hours after its passage in the Senate, was approved 257 to 167, with 85 Republicans joining 172 Democrats in voting to allow income taxes to rise for the first time in two decades, in this case for the highest-earning Americans. Voting no were 151 Republicans and 16 Democrats.
The bill was expected to be signed quickly by Mr. Obama, who won re-election on a promise to increase taxes on the wealthy. 
Mr. Obama strode into the White House briefing room shortly after the vote, less to hail the end of the fiscal crisis than to lay out a marker for the next one. ''The one thing that I think, hopefully, the new year will focus on,'' he said, ''is seeing if we can put a package like this together with a little bit less drama, a little less brinkmanship, and not scare the heck out of folks quite as much.''
In approving the measure after days of legislative intrigue, Congress concluded its final and most pitched fight over fiscal policy, the culmination of two years of battles over taxes, the federal debt, spending and what to do to slow the growth in popular social programs like Medicare.
The decision by Republican leaders to allow the vote came despite widespread scorn among House Republicans for the bill, passed overwhelmingly by the Senate in the early hours of New Year's Day. They were unhappy that it did not include significant spending cuts in health and other social programs, which they say are essential to any long-term solution to the nation's debt.
Democrats, while hardly placated by the compromise, celebrated Mr. Obama's nominal victory in his final showdown with House Republicans in the 112th Congress, who began their term emboldened by scores of new, conservative members whose reach to the right ultimately tipped them over.
''The American people are the real winners tonight,'' Representative Bill Pascrell Jr., Democrat of New Jersey, said on the House floor, ''not anyone who navigates these halls.''
Not a single leader among House Republicans came to the floor to speak in favor of the bill, though Speaker John A. Boehner, who rarely takes part in roll calls, voted in favor. Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader, and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 3 Republican, voted no. Representative Paul D. Ryan, the budget chairman who was the Republican vice-presidential candidate, supported the bill.
Despite the party divisions, many Republicans in their remarks characterized the measure, which allows taxes to go up on household income over $400,000 for individuals and $450,000 for couples but makes permanent tax cuts for income below that level, as a victory of sorts, even as so many of them declined to vote for it.
''After more than a decade of criticizing these tax cuts,'' said Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, ''Democrats are finally joining Republicans in making them permanent. Republicans and the American people are getting something really important, permanent tax relief.''
The dynamic with the House was a near replay of a fight at the end of 2011 over a payroll tax break extension. In that showdown, Senate Democrats and Republicans passed legislation, and while House Republicans fulminated, they were eventually forced to swallow it.
On Tuesday, as they got a detailed look at the Senate's fiscal legislation, House Republicans ranging from Midwest pragmatists to Tea Party-blessed conservatives voiced serious reservations about the measure, emerging from a lunchtime New Year's Day meeting with their leaders, eyes flashing and faces grim, insisting they would not accept a bill without substantial savings from cuts.
The unrest reached to the highest levels as Mr. Cantor told members in a closed-door meeting in the basement of the Capitol that he could not support the legislation in its current form.
Mr. Boehner, who faces a re-election vote on his post on Thursday when the 113th Congress convenes, had grave concerns as well, but he had pledged to allow the House to consider any legislation that cleared the Senate. And he was not eager to have such a major piece of legislation pass with mainly opposition votes, and the outcome could be seen as undermining his authority.
Adding to the pressure on the House, the fiscal agreement was reached by Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Senate Republican leader, and had deep Republican support in the Senate, isolating the House Republicans in their opposition. Some of the Senate Republicans who backed the bill are staunch conservatives, like Senators Patrick J. Toomey of Pennsylvania and Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, with deep credibility among House Republicans.
The options before the House Republicans were fraught with risks. Senate Democrats said they would not brook any serious amendments to their bill -- one that was hard fought and passed in the dark of night with many clenched teeth on either side of the aisle. Senate Democratic leaders planned no more votes before the new Congress convenes Thursday afternoon.
An up-or-down House vote on the Senate measure presented many Republicans with a nearly impossible choice: to prolong the standoff that most Americans wished to see cease, or to vote to allow taxes to go up on wealthy Americans without any of the changes to spending and benefit programs they had fought for vigorously for the better part of two years.
''I have read the bill and can't find the spending cuts -- even with an electron magnifying glass,'' said Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina. ''It's part medicinal, part placebo, and part treating the symptoms but not the underlying pathology.''
But with their options shrinking just two days before the beginning of a new Congress, the House leadership made one of the biggest concessions of their rebellious two years and let the measure move forward to avoid being seen as the chief obstacle to legislation that Mr. Obama and a bipartisan Senate majority said was necessary to prevent the nation from slipping back into a recession.
The measure, while less reflective of Mr. Obama's fiscal agenda than Senate Democrats had wished, still provided fewer concessions than the president initially offered in a, tentative agreement with Mr. Boehner last month, and it was a far cry from what was on the table in 2011 when negotiators tried to reach a so-called grand bargain. ''I thank all of you who will vote for it,'' said Representative Darrell Issa of California. ''I cannot bring myself to vote for it.''
Still, many Republicans, in light of the broad party support for the bill in the Senate and the unwavering, rare discipline they faced from Democrats, concluded that they had little room to maneuver. They decided they would save their fire for the coming rounds -- the effort to increase the nation's debt ceiling again in another month or two and an expiring governmentwide spending bill.
''We can and will pursue comprehensive tax reform,'' Representative Camp said.
Republicans hope to fight for more spending cuts in the debt-ceiling vote, but Mr. Obama warned against that tactic.
''While I will negotiate over many things,'' he said, ''I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills they've already racked up through the laws they have passed. Let me repeat: we can't not pay bills that we've already incurred.''
The last time the House voted on New Year's Day, according to Congressional staff members on the Rules Committee, was in 1951, on a measure concerning money for the Korean War.

HEADLINE: Asked & Answered | Scoot McNairy

BYLINE: ABBY AGUIRRE


HIGHLIGHT: The actor, who appears in "Killing Them Softly" and "Argo," talks to T about his "slow, slow break" 

 BODY:
When Scoot McNairy's voice first came over the phone, I was startled to hear a Texan accent. I should not have been - I had read that he grew up outside of Dallas - but I had just watched him act in two films, "Killing Them Softly" and "Argo," in which he disappears so fully into two very different characters, I had all but forgotten he came from anywhere. You don't expect a chameleon to speak with a twang. In "Killing Them Softly," directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Brad Pitt, McNairy plays one of three guys who rob a mob-protected card game. In "Argo," directed by and starring Ben Affleck, and based on real events, he plays one of six American diplomats who were extracted out of revolutionary Iran in an outlandish C.I.A. scheme that had them pretending to be a Canadian film crew. McNairy, 34, shifts shapes again in "Promised Land," a Gus Van Sant movie that opened Dec. 28, and, if these films are any indication, he'll do so again in "Twelve Years a Slave," directed by Steve McQueen and due out this year. 
But don't call him an overnight success. Between long days of shooting yet another major feature, "Non-Stop," starring Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson, McNairy spoke to T about muddying accents, the art of riding mechanical bulls and what he terms his "slow, slow break."
 Q. 
 You've got three major films in theaters in one month. Is it safe to say this is a first for you? 
 A. 
Absolutely. Yes, indeed. It is definitely a first. I've been doing independent films for 10 years, but one out of five didn't see the light of day. To have three movies coming out at the same time - I probably will never have that again in my life.
 One of your first big jobs was a Levi's commercial in which you were thrown from a mechanical bull. As a native Texan, can you in fact ride a mechanical bull better than that? Were you holding out on us? 
Yes. But that was the thing - I also knew how to pitch myself a good ways off of that thing. So when I went into the casting, I said, "You know, if you stick your foot in the stirrup, you can really throw yourself off of there." Growing up, my friends and I would ride barrels that you tied to four trees with springs on them. A guy would get on each rope and rock the barrel back and forth, and it would simulate riding the bull.
 You recently moved back to Texas from Los Angeles. Was Hollywood not for you? 
I love L.A. It was an awesome place to spend my 20s, full of creative people, but I never wanted to stay there. It wasn't necessarily Texas that I wanted to move to; I just knew I wanted to live in the country somewhere. My wife and I found this place in Texas that we really liked, so we packed up our stuff and moved. We live off of a dirt road. Our closest neighbors are a half a mile away. You can be as loud as you want.
 Are you glad in a way to have hit your stride now, having had a decade of experience, rather than in your early 20s? 
I can't say that enough. I've been asked, "What was your big break?" I don't feel like I've had a big break. It's been a slow, slow break. I want my career to grow gradually. There's still so much for me to learn. I'm just trying to take these opportunities to get better at what I'm doing.
 In "Killing Them Softly," you co-star alongside quite a lineup - Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, Ray Liotta. What was it like to walk onto that set? 
I was excited about getting the job, but I didn't really have time to think about it too much. I was just focused so much on the work and doing a good job. I really love Andrew Dominik's movies. When you work with someone whose movies you really love and who you have a lot of admiration for, you turn into putty in their hands.
 The film, about a kind of money crisis in the crime world, is presented as a parable of the financial crisis. You play a low-level stickup guy, Frankie. Did you have a real-life corollary in mind? Or was that theme more of an undertone for you? 
For me, it was a hundred percent undertone. Frankie's world was separate from all that. He was just trying to survive. He had gone into prison at the height of the economy and the boom and come out at the bottom, but the character himself wasn't so conscious of it.
 Your accent in that film seems very distinct. Where exactly are you supposed to be from? 
The film is based on a novel ["Cogan's Trade" by George V. Higgins]. In the book, my character is from Boston. And the dialogue, the way that Andrew [Dominik] wrote it, he wrote certain words to sound very Boston. But the film is set in New Orleans. My take it on it was, yes, this kid is from Boston, but it's a contemporary piece, and I found it interesting to muddy it - to make the accent more distinct as a sound rather than a particular Boston dialect. If anything, he's a sick, malnutritioned kid from South Boston who's lived all over.
 Frankie could not be more different than the tense diplomat you play in "Argo." At one point there is a scene where you speak almost entirely in Farsi. Did you take Farsi lessons for that? 
I have two lines in Farsi in the beginning of the movie, and initially that was it. But throughout the shooting of the movie I was trying to learn different things to improvise in Farsi. There was a P.A. on set who spoke Farsi, and I was hanging out with him a lot. Then Ben [Affleck] told me, "All that stuff at the airport, I think we should do it in Farsi." That was thrown at me three or four days before we shot it. I posted the words on a wall, and I would just stare at them and say them over and over again. I was like, "Oh my God, dude. This is the end of my career."
 Were you familiar with this little-known chapter of the hostage crisis before reading the script? 
I was familiar with the hostage crisis but not this specific story. It was classified. They didn't declassify it until, I believe, 1997 or so. As far as the story is concerned, it's all pretty accurate.
 There is a cooped-up, cramped feeling to the scenes, many of which take place in one house where your character and the other five diplomats are hiding out. Did the cast do anything special to prepare for this? 
We all spent a week in the house we shot the movie in. No cellphones, no computers, just board games and magazines, all from 1979. We would sit around and have dinner and hang out. It was incredibly beneficial, I think, for all the actors to create our own organic chemistry.
 You've got a pretty serious mustache in "Argo." Did you grow it yourself? 
That's my mustache. It grows like a weed if you don't take care of it.
 You are writing a screenplay at the moment. What can you tell us about it? 
It's a film about redemption. And it's kind of a "Drugstore Cowboy" story, but set in the South.

HEADLINE: Polk Forecasts Increased U.S. Vehicle Sales and Production in 2013

BYLINE: CHERYL JENSEN


HIGHLIGHT: New light vehicle registrations in the United States in 2013 are expected to rise 6.6 percent over 2012 levels to 15.3 million vehicles. 

 BODY:
The auto industry is expected to continue to recover in 2013 and 2014 in a positive sign for the American economy, according to Polk, a global automotive market intelligence firm. 
New light vehicle registrations in the United States in 2013 are expected to rise 6.6 percent over 2012 levels to 15.3 million vehicles, Polk said. And North American production volumes are expected to increase to about 15.9 million units, which would be a 2.4 percent increase from 2012.
The numbers are driven by an improving economy and capacity expansion in the region.
Analysts at Polk do not expect recovery to pre-recession levels, which were about 17 million vehicles, for many years.
There is an asterisk accompanying the forecast: It hinges on Washington's ability to draft a budget plan that will avoid $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases, according to a statement released by the company on Wednesday.
Polk expects new vehicle introductions in 2013 to be up nearly 50 percent over 2012, with 43 introductions in the United States this year. Sixty vehicle redesigns are expected as well.
However, analysts don't expect a return to 16 million units in the United States, last seen in 2007, until 2015.
Segments to watch include:
 Although the large pickup truck segment has declined over the last five years, it is expected to grow with General Motors, Toyota and Ford planning redesigns during the next 18 to 24 months.
 The midsize sedan segment will continue to grow.
 The luxury segment will see new compact sedans, which accounts for 2.9 percent of the overall industry.
 Hybrid models, which comprise about 2.9 percent of the overall market, will see only slight growth, even though the number of models being offered will increase. The reasons include the significant price difference between hybrids and traditional gas-powered vehicles and that gas-engine vehicles are starting to achieve similar fuel economy ratings to hybrids.

HEADLINE: The Cliff is Dead. Long Live the Cliff.

BYLINE: ANDREW ROSENTHAL


HIGHLIGHT: The last-minute compromise set the stage for yet more fighting in Washington. 

 BODY:
Now that the Republicans in the House have stopped playing games with the economy and allowed passage of the fiscal-cliff compromise, we can all stop worrying about how firmly President Obama will stand on his principles and just how irresponsibly the Republican caucus will behave to appease its most right-wing members.
And once we've caught our breath we can start worrying about how firmly Mr. Obama will stand on his principles just how irresponsibly the Republican caucus will behave to appease its most right-wing members. 
Because the next fight is already taking shape over taxing and spending.

Mr. Obama, having backed away from his campaign red line - he was going to preserve tax cuts ONLY for the middle class and lower while making everyone else pay a bigger share - has now set two more red lines.
The first is that Congress has to match spending cuts with revenue increases. The second is that he will not take part in another manufactured crisis over the debt ceiling. "While I will negotiate over many things," Mr. Obama said, "I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills they've already racked up through the laws they have passed."

The president has significantly less leverage on these matters than he did on the Bush tax cuts (since they were set to expire). So it seems wildly improbable that he'll stay true to his word.
Meanwhile, the Republican caucus is out of control-not just metaphorically but actually out of the control of its purported leader, John Boehner. It's never been entirely clear whether Mr. Boehner negotiates in bad faith with Mr. Obama (evidence includes the fact that he tried to double-cross the White House with his "Plan B"), or whether he means well and can't deliver (evidence includes the fact that he couldn't get his own caucus to agree to his "Plan B").
Ultimately he did manage to get the fiscal-cliff compromise through the House. He and 84 other Republicans voted for it. But most Republicans (151) did not. The naysayers included House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who publicly denounced the deal his party made with the White House.
What's truly maddening is that, as both Jennifer Rubin, writing from the right, and Greg Sargeant, writing from the left, pointed out this morning, the Republicans should have been happy with the deal. Not only did they extend most of the Bush tax cuts, they made them permanent. And they held back increases in the estate tax.
And while they didn't achieve cuts in entitlement programs, they'll soon have the opportunity to hold the country hostage over the debt ceiling, at which point they can demand reckless and economy-wounding cuts in government spending.
Anyone looking for a quick encapsulation of Washington's low, degraded state should look no further than Politico's behind-the-scenes recap of the negotiations that led to the anti-Grand Bargain (the petty bargain?). In one particularly tense moment, Harry Reid accused Mr. Boehner of running a "dictatorship" in the House, and Mr. Boehner- just a few steps from the Oval Office-responded with an obscenity not fit for publication in a family newspaper.

HEADLINE: Why 49 Is a Magic Number

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Heavy regulation in France may provide a basis for assessing the cost of regulation in the United States, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
The aggregate amount of regulation is difficult to quantify, but we learn something about it from the number of businesses that choose to have exactly 49 employees.
I noted last week that government regulations are not as easily quantified as taxes and spending, because regulation has no budget and no obvious accounting method. Some laws are not enforced, while others have little impact because people would follow them even without the force of a law. The most useful regulatory budget would put a lot of weight on the laws that actually matter. 
The economists Luis Garicano, Claire Lelarge and John Van Reenen are developing a method to quantify the aggregate importance of employer regulations. They note that small employers are naturally more common than medium-size employers, which are themselves more common than large employers.
Moreover, the frequency of employers of various sizes appears in many situations to follow a "power law" of statistics. If you tell these economists how many employers in a given region have, say, 22 employees, the authors can, with the power law, accurately predict the number of employers with 23 employees.

The chart below, reproduced from their paper using data on employers in France, shows the number of employers of various sizes. For example, about 10,000 employers in their sample have four employees. Their paper confirms the statistical power law with one glaring deviation: the exceptional number of employers with exactly 49 employees and far fewer with 50 employees (another lesser deviation occurs on the margin between 9 and 10 employees).
The chart shows a couple of odd patterns at the 50-employee mark. First, there are sharply fewer employees (by more than a factor of two) with exactly 50 employees than with exactly 49 employees. Second, although the number of companies usually falls with the number of employees, there are actually more employers with 49 employees than with 45 employees.
The authors show how this pattern reflects deliberate efforts by employers to stay below the 50-employee threshold where several employment and accounting regulations take effect. For example, they note that French companies employing 50 or more workers are, among other things, obligated "to establish a committee on health, safety and working conditions and train its members," whereas companies with 49 employees are not. France also has regulations kicking in at employment levels of 10, 11, 20 and 25.
Presumably, companies would not adjust their size to avoid regulations that are not enforced or regulations that require an employer to take actions that he already takes. Moreover, mandates that create costs for employers but create nearly equal benefits for employees should not induce companies to change their size, because (barring minimum-wage regulations) employers can pass on the costs of those regulations to their employees in the form of lower cash wages.
The primary reason for size adjustments is regulations that impose costs on an employer significantly higher than the benefits they create for the employees. The larger the net costs, the more company size should deviate from the statistical power law, which is why Professors Garicano, Lelarge and Van Reenen can use their power-law analysis to quantify the private costs of the regulations that kick in at the 50-employee threshold.
This is not to say that the regulations imposed on 50-employee companies are necessarily excessive, because they can create public benefits that more than justify their net costs for an employer and his employees, just as taxes and government spending can. For example, an air-pollution regulation might kick in at 50 employees that creates a significant cost for the employer and little aggregate benefit for his employees but creates a significant benefit for the people of France.
The authors show how, so far, employer sizes in the United States deviate less from the statistical power law, which implies that French regulations kicking in at 50 are more costly (from the point of view of an employer and his employees) than the United States regulations kicking in at that threshold.
But the United States has added some major regulations with its Affordable Care Act and its Dodd-Frank regulations. Beginning this time next year, for example, the Affordable Care Act will put new requirements on businesses with 50 or more full-time employees, whereas businesses with 49 or fewer employees will be exempt. Businesses with fewer than 26 employees may already be eligible for Affordable Care Act tax credits for providing health insurance, whereas larger businesses are not.
Perhaps we should thank the French for their heavy regulation, as it is already helping us account for the impact of regulation in the United States.

HEADLINE: Beyond the Myth: The Bounteous Mekong

BYLINE: JEFF OPPERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: At first glance, the river may seem a near-wilderness. On closer inspection, the Mekong and its banks are more like an unruly linear farm. 

 BODY:
Seventy-two hours after leaving Cleveland, I slipped away from Christmas Eve dinner with my family, walked down a dimly lighted path and crossed a rickety bamboo bridge to an island. I knelt down and dipped my hand into the Mekong River.
Actually, in the dark I misjudged the distance to the water's surface and wound up putting my arm in up to the elbow. It felt like warm water. As if I'd stuck my arm into my son's aquarium back home, 10,000 miles away.
Party music thumped from the hotel across the river, with a spotlight dancing through the dark tropical sky. It wasn't quite the Mekong but rather the Kok River, one of its tributaries in northern Thailand.
Dramatic beginnings aside, I was grateful to finally be in the Mekong's basin.

Grateful to have completed multiday air travel with two children, of course, but beyond that I felt a huge rush of relief that our trip was still on track. We almost hadn't made it out of Cleveland, where we live. The day of our departure, a storm named Draco bore down on northeastern Ohio. We're quite used to winter storms, but I can't remember one that had a name, let alone the name of a villain. 
Our departure plane couldn't land in Cleveland's airport and had been rerouted to Detroit. The jet bridge jutted vacantly into the driving snow, and months of planning and commitments - with a tight time line of flights, guides and boats for our three-week journey here - seemed in jeopardy.
The plane eventually made it to Cleveland, and we took off only three and a half hours late. Four flights and three days later we arrived in Chiang Rai, Thailand, on the banks of the Kok.
Until tonight, the Mekong for me existed only in words and pictures, a mythical place, both culturally and biologically. It is the haunted river of the movie "Apocalypse Now" and legendary for its aquatic life - unsurpassed in the staggering dimensions of its megafish and tons of its fish harvest, and surpassed only by the Amazon for its diversity of fish species.
The Mekong is also the site of the planet's most contentious debate about the future of great rivers.
Its fish harvest provides the primary source of protein for at least 50 million people and jobs for millions spread across the region's rural villages. But several of the lower-basin countries, particularly Laos and Cambodia, are very poor. Nearly one-third of the people in the region lack sanitation, and in Laos, half of the rural population lacks electricity.
Although the percentage of people in the region living in poverty has declined considerably in the last two decades, the Mekong's countries still have rapidly growing and urbanizing populations, and energy is needed to drive those cities and economic development.
The region's governments are now looking to the Mekong as a key source of that needed power. A total of 11 hydroelectric dams are proposed or planned for the main-stem river, and this has set off a fierce debate over the river's future.
The Mekong River Commission recently released a report highlighting the various benefits and costs of building these dams. (The commission, which includes representatives of Thailand, Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, is a forum for dialogue and research but has no decision-making authority.)
The report estimated that full construction of the dams would meet 6 to 8 percent of the region's projected energy demand in 2025 and, although there are questions about the distribution of economic benefits, Laos in particular would see a substantial increase in its gross domestic product.
But this energy would come at a price. The dams will hinder or block the migration of fish, and because most of the important species migrate long distances to spawn, fish harvests could decline by nearly half; proposed dams on tributaries would cut harvests further. Laos and Cambodia could lose one-third of their protein supplies.
These are the statistics that have defined the Mekong for me as I prepared for the trip. Standing on the banks of the Kok, I knew I could finally begin to complement my reading with actual experience.
I'm a river scientist with the Nature Conservancy, part of a team that collaborates with governments, communities and companies to develop solutions for more environmentally sustainable river management. Yet I can't pretend that I'm on this trip to offer answers to the Mekong's tangled challenges. There's far too much to learn, far too much complexity, and the region is full of experts and organizations that have committed decades to finding solutions for the Mekong.
At least I could offer some solutions for my children's Christmas. After dinner, they collapsed in exhaustion, and my wife, Paola, had since also fallen asleep. So, like Santa, I reached deep into my pack and retrieved two stockings, some very small gifts and one short strand of Christmas lights. I dragged a potted plant in from the corridor, draped it with lights, and fell asleep.
Still jet-lagged, we all woke before dawn, and the children opened their gifts in front of the glowing plant, a tropical version of Charlie Brown's sorry little Christmas tree.
After breakfast, we left Chiang Rai and took a bus north for Chiang Khong, on the banks of the Mekong. There we crossed the river into Laos and boarded a boat for a three-day trip down to Luang Prabang, the home of Laos' recently extinguished monarchy and the center for Buddhism in Laos.
On its way to Luang Prabang, the Mekong winds through remote gorges flanked by steep and lush mountains. When I could put aside my analytical filters, I just soaked in the experience as someone who loves rivers. We motored unhurriedly through an idyllic tricolored world -- brown river, green mountains, blue sky.
But my brain continually cut in on the dreamlike slow dance down the river. This was just our introduction, but the major elements of controversy over the Mekong's future were already obvious: the river was an organic machine for producing food, flowing through a region that clearly needed development and improved living standards.
On first glance, the boat floated through a verdant near-wilderness. On closer inspection, the Mekong and its banks were more like an unruly linear farm. For nearly the entire length of our trip, the river was producing food.
Bamboo poles were jammed into rock crevices at various angles, securing nets just below the surface to strain fish from the fast currents. In eddies and still water, curving lines of floating plastic bottles functioned as buoys marking drift nets. Slender green bamboo sticks lined the water's edge like a skinny forest, each one holding a small fish trap or baited hook. Along the beaches, men coiled their bodies and then heaved nets that hit the surface like circular spider webs.
This is the dry season, and the river has been dropping for months, exposing sand bars and moist banks. The banks have been planted in corn and green beans, with peanuts planted on the sand bars. Highest on the bars, where the peanut plants were oldest, they grew in a thick emerald carpet. Moving down the bars was a series of sequentially younger bands. The lowest band, land the river had most recently vacated, was a grid of newly planted seedlings.
We slept in villages both nights. Power lines had reached the first village just two years ago, while the second still lacked electricity. The roads between the villages could only be used during the dry season.
Over dinner the first night, we talked with the village headman, who was hosting us in his house. The topic of the proposed dams came up; the two proposed dams that would be farthest upstream are within the stretch of river we were traveling.
He said his main concerns were about the movement of fish and boats up and down the river, but that he had heard that the dams would be built to allow passage of both. He seemed confident that this was true.
"Roads, bridges, electricity, dams, clinics -- all of these, we need all of these," he said as he gestured at the dirt streets around us, the darkness pushed back by only a handful of light bulbs.
I thought back to the moment two nights earlier when I reached down from the dark bank of the Kok to touch the river with my hand and inadvertently stuck my arm in up to my elbow. That seemed an apt metaphor. Even though I'm now deeper in than simply touching the surface, I still feel pretty much in the dark.

HEADLINE: Below the Line: The Sets of 'Argo'

BYLINE: MEKADO MURPHY


HIGHLIGHT: Sharon Seymour, the production designer of "Argo," discusses her process. 

 BODY:
The production designer Sharon Seymourhas collaborated with Ben Affleck on all three films he has directed, creating gritty contemporary Boston sets for "Gone Baby Gone" and "The Town." But "Argo," Mr. Affleck's thriller set amid the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis, presented a new challenge for the team. She and Mr. Affleck wanted to recreate the looks of the period, without drawing attention to them and making the film feel like an episode of "That '70s Show."
"There was a lot of anxiety in America at the time, both political and economic," Ms. Seymour said during a recent interview in New York, "and we didn't want this movie to feel glossy and fantasylike. It needed to have a reality base, but also needed to touch on the color and the world of the '70s, which is really different than how we live now." 
To start, Mr. Affleck sent Ms. Seymour some documentaries and a box of books about the hostage crisis. Then she researched the locations in the script -- like what the Warner Brothers studio lot looked like at the time and the differences between government buildings in Washington. She and her team also found former Iranian students who shared photographs from their school years in the '70s. With every set, the team looked for one element that grounded it in the period, whether a specific kind of carpet or a particular color of wall. Below, Ms. Seymour discusses some of her design ideas for "Argo."
 Washington 
"In the Washington scenes, we were looking for more monotones and more repetition, in set decorating and color and props," Ms. Seymour said. "The C.I.A. wasn't moving completely up to date to 1979 at the time. Government functions 15 years behind in terms of what you can get allocated." This was reflected in the more simple, streamlined sets for these scenes.
Some of the C.I.A. footage was shot in Washington, but the C.I.A. offices, in the image above, were created in a basement room at The Los Angeles Times. Ms. Seymour and her team spent nearly two weeks dressing the space, repainting the walls and adding period-appropriate desks. "The one thing I left was the carpet," she said.

 Tehran 
The Tehran exteriors were shot in Istanbul. The crew scheduled the shoot around a Turkish holiday, which meant access to the grand bazaar used in a sequence.
But many of the Tehran interiors, including the Canadian ambassador's residence where the Americans were hiding, was shot in Los Angeles. "We wanted that space to feel really claustrophobic," Ms. Seymour said. "So we dressed it as if Ken and Pat" -- the ambassador and his wife -- "had a lot of things they brought with them from their various postings. They had layers of curtains because the houseguests couldn't open the curtains." The room was filled with paintings and furniture to contribute to the closed-in feel. The images above show the space before it was dressed and after.
 Hollywood 
For the scenes in Hollywood, many of which were shot on the Warner Brothers lot, Ms. Seymour was aiming for a lighter mood. "The color palette was more of what we were classically thinking of as '70s colors," she said.
Ms. Seymour was able to have a little more fun in these scenes, including a sequence in which the makeup artist John Chambers (John Goodman) is working on a low-budget science fiction film set. Ms. Seymour's team created the set-within-a-set, using the bright colors of movies from the era. 
The production office, however, was more traditional. "It was a very standard production office that you can still rent on the Warner Brothers lot to this day," she said.

HEADLINE: The Fiscal Riff

BYLINE: DAVID BROOKS and GAIL COLLINS


HIGHLIGHT: Brooks and Collins on some other cliffs we might fall off and the overlooked virtues of constitutional monarchy. 

 BODY:
 Gail: Happy New Year, David! How do you think we're doing so far? I guess if you're going to plunge over a cliff, it's better to hop back up again before the end of the long holiday weekend.
 David: I would say so far the start of 2013 has given new meaning to the word inauspicious. If I'd been in the House I would have been sorely tempted to vote against the fiscal cliff bill. The measure was supposed to improve our fiscal situation. It was supposed to be balanced between tax hikes and spending cuts, like the president promised. It has some tax hikes but effectively no spending cuts. In other words the law fails to fulfill both of its primary objectives. When a law fails to achieve its objectives, aren't you supposed to vote against it?
 Gail: Well, not if you're on a cliff. I was disappointed that the White House rolled over on the $250,000 bar for tax cuts. Give me a break. It should have been $75,000 from the beginning. But we're all supposed to make compromises, right? 
I must admit that my evil side was hoping for a House rebellion. Partly because it would confirm my longstanding theory that no matter how great the political divide between the parties, the biggest hate-hate relationship in Washington is the chasm of loathing between the House and the Senate. Also, it would have been nice to see the entire nation joining in the conviction that the House Republican majority is composed of crazy people. But instead we have a triumph of reason and another disaster averted.
 David: Not averted. Postponed. We've got another catastrophe coming in a couple of months with the return of sequestration. And by the way how is anybody in government actually supposed to plan a budget when the whole thing may blow up again in 60 days?
 Gail: Wow, you really are unhappy. To be honest, I haven't seen much serious budget planning since the Republicans took control of the House after the 2010 elections and grabbed onto the Senate filibuster. It's not the White House's fault that John Boehner couldn't deliver on a bigger deal. So they'll handle the next crisis when they get to it.
 David: And by the way, the calamity for liberalism is permanent. As Ross has pointed out, liberalism now has a cataclysmic problem. Liberals need revenue to fund existing government programs, let alone any future ideas they might have. And yet at this moment, with a newly re-elected president and with Republicans in utter disarray, they could only come up with an extra $60 billion a year. They ended up with less than half of the revenue Obama hoped for and much less than Boehner reportedly offered.
The events of the past week show that even at their most powerful, Democrats cannot tax the middle class. That means no money for any future liberal projects. Republicans looked awful this week, but Democrats suffered the biggest defeat.
 Gail: Sorry, that speaks to me more of the current state of the Republicans, who can't even approve a farm bill reform their agriculture committee liked. But tell me who you think were the heroes and non-heroes of this adventure. I know you don't like to call people villains.
On the hero side, I have to give props to Vice President Biden, who worked out the Senate deal.
 David: Biden was outstanding. He was certainly more effective than President Obama, whose public announcement on Monday lobbying for a deal that was very much in doubt in the House was one of the most inept bits of governance I've seen in a long time. Who holds a pep rally insulting Congress at the very moment you are trying to work out a deal with them?
Biden wins points because he understands that disdain is not really the greatest negotiating technique.
 Gail: It makes me think that we should have national political tickets that always include one statesman and one pol. A little like the British with their king/queen plus prime minister.You want one great national figure - that would be President Obama. And one guy who works the legislature. I am prepared to admit that when it comes to dealing with the House and Senate leaders, Obama is terrible. But he's great with the public. Which hates the House and Senate as much as he does. And then there's Biden, who absolutely adores all the lifetime pols, being one himself.
 David: The weird thing is that Obama is a lifetime pol, too. He seems to have chosen a profession he doesn't intrinsically love.
 Gail: And double weird that he seemed to discover he loathed politics only after he left the Illinois state legislature.
 David: He's actually a bit like a senior cabinet member, who does the policy but disdains the politics. I'm reminded again of Peggy Noonan's line that he sometimes seems to regard politics as an unpleasant duty on his path to greatness.
 Gail: What does all this say about the Republicans in the House? For a minute it looked as if Eric Cantor, the deeply irritating Majority Leader, was trying to overthrow Speaker John Boehner by dramatically announcing he was opposed to the cliff-averting bill. And for a while there, Boehner did seem to be screwing up everything. But in the end, Boehner got it done - admittedly with Democratic votes.
 David: The core thing it says about them is that they want to reform entitlements and cut spending, but they can't actually propose any plans to do these things because it would be politically unpopular. This is a terrible problem for them.
 Gail: My nominee for non-hero is Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. One of the tiny handful of senators who voted against the compromise. And you know it was because he thought it was safer for his presidential aspirations. He's probably right - everybody knows you don't get in trouble for things you vote against. But as a leader, he looked like a total weenie.
 David: I have a lot of sympathy for people like him and Democratic Senator Michael Bennet, whom Maureen wrote about. At least they have their eye on the big picture, which is the country's economic survival. If this posture helps Rubio in the primaries, sign me up.
 Gail: Well, it's only the first week of the new year. In comes a new House and Congress. On to the debt ceiling crisis and the will-the-government-shut-down crisis. By the time warm weather comes, will we feel as if the country is ungovernable? Or that we've turned the corner and learned how to make this thing work again? Or maybe just that we've gotten really good at disaster avoidance?
 David: Again I'm much more glum. I'd say we've accelerated our trip to disaster. My big puzzle is why young people are not in the streets. They are really being hosed, sentenced to a living standard much lower than their parents because of boomer greed. I guess it's hard when you are 25 to imagine the tax bill and the benefit cuts that will hit when you are 40, but someday interest rates will return to their normal levels and it will all come crashing down.
 Gail: For years I've been hearing 20-somethings say they don't expect Social Security to be around when they hit 65. Eventually, I came to realize that they really mean that they just don't expect to be 65. Or 40. Neither did I, when I was 22. So I'm afraid it's something that we're going to have to work out on their behalf. Give global warming to the youth and let the creakier part of the population figure out the entitlement problem. We'll create an entitlement cliff! Something to look forward to next New Year's Eve.

HEADLINE: How the Deal on the Fiscal Cliff Affects Financial Aid

BYLINE: TANYA ABRAMS


HIGHLIGHT: Mark Kantrowitz, an expert on paying for college, explains how the new legislation affects financial aid for current and prospective college students. 

 BODY:
Welcome back from winter break, students, and happy new year. A couple of notable items since school was last in session:

        
Most seniors have finished their college applications, many of which were due on Jan. 1.
        
The country did not hurtle off the fiscal cliff.
 
That second item is of particular importance to current and prospective college students, as the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which passed late Tuesday night, will affect student financial aid.
We've asked Mark Kantrowitz, an expert on financial aid and the founder of Finaid.org, to discuss some of the details of the legislation that affect how students pay for college.
Here are some provisions of the bill that affect financial aid, as highlighted by Mr. Kantrowitz:

        
TheAmerican Opportunity Tax Credit, which helps defray undergraduate college education expenses by allowing a tax credit of up to $2,500, has been extended for five years, through the end of 2017.

        
The Tuition and Fees Deduction, which allows taxpayers to claim up to $4,000 in tuition expenses, has also been extended. The deduction, which was set to expire at the end of 2011, will continue through the end of 2013.
        
Some changes to the Coverdell Education Savings Accounts have been made permanent. This means that the contribution limit has been increased to $2,000 from $500 and that the account may be used for elementary and secondary school expenses. Higher income phaseouts have also been made permanent.
        
The deal permanently repeals a five-year limit for deducting up to $2,500 via the Student Loan Interest Deduction. This means that students and families can claim on their tax forms student loan interest beyond 60 months.
More reverberations on financial aid could be on the horizon, Mr. Kantrowitz told The Choice in an e-mail. The new legislation includes a two-month delay in sequestration, he said, and "across-the-board spending cuts would mean an 8.2 percent reduction in student aid funding."
Unless Congress acts before March 1, Mr. Kantrowitz said, fewer students will be able to get work-study jobs and Federal Supplemental Educational Opportunity Grants, as these programs would experience cuts. Fees for federal education loans would go up, he added, and the maximum Pell Grant would be cut by as much as $400.
"If past is prologue," Mr. Kantrowitz writes, "there will be more brinksmanship on Feb. 28."
 We encourage you to read more about the fiscal deal and to share your thoughts about its impact on financial aid in the comments box below.

HEADLINE: Ryan, Rubio and Paul Place Their Bets

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: Does the Republican base crave pragmatism, or purity? With their fiscal cliff votes, three likely 2016 candidates indicated which way they think the wind is blowing. 

 BODY:
Last February, during the Republican primary, Rick Santorum said "politics is a team sport" and explained that "sometimes you've got to rally together and do something." This bland postulate was widely described as a "gaffe" that undermined the candidate's credibility with a Tea Party movement enamored of combative opposition. 
Paul Ryan, Marco Rubio and Rand Paul, all possible presidential candidates for 2016, just signaled whether or not they think that mood will continue into the next cycle.
Mr. Ryan was one of 85 Republicans in the House who voted for the fiscal-cliff compromise. Mr. Rubio and Mr. Paul were two of five Republican Senators who voted against it. All three staked out a minority position relative to their caucuses.
In a statement, Mr. Ryan explained that elected officials "have a duty to apply our principles to the realities of governing" and suggested that "the American people will be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative."

Compare his pragmatism with Mr. Paul's absolutism: "It's impossible to get to any deal on the fiscal cliff when Majority Leader Reid and President Obama refuse to consider meaningful cuts in spending." Or with Mr. Rubio's: "Rapid economic growth and spending reforms are the only way out of the real fiscal cliff our nation is facing."
Mr. Ryan essentially (if unintentionally) echoed Mr. Santorum. The Senators bet on ideological purity.

HEADLINE: Deferring Six Figures on Wall Street for Teacher's Salary

BYLINE: SCOTT EIDLER


HIGHLIGHT: Teach for America, the nonprofit organization that recruits high-achieving college graduates to teach in some of the nation's poorest schools for two years, has garnered renewed interest among would-be finance professionals. 

 BODY:
Four years after the financial crisis, Wall Street hiring has remained weak, and many college graduates have searched for jobs and even careers in other fields. In the last several years, hundreds of such would-be finance professionals and management consultants have taken their high-powered ambitions and spreadsheet modeling skills to the classroom.
Teach for America, the 22-year-old nonprofit organization that recruits high-achieving college graduates to teach in some of the nation's poorest schools for two years, in particular has garnered renewed interest among the business-oriented set. Teach for America says that its 2012 class contained about 400 recent graduates with a major in business or economics. Of those with professional experience, about 175 worked in finance.
Those participants include Zachary Dearing, 23, a recent graduate of M.I.T. Two summers ago, he was an intern at McKinsey & Company, and the year before, Goldman Sachs. 
Yet, he was one of 21 teachers in this year's class who had deferred job offers from a Wall Street bank, a management consulting firm or another corporate partner to join Teach for America.
"If somebody had told me I was going to be a high school math teacher in Dallas, Texas, when I entered college, I'd be like, 'No, there's no chance of that being true,' " said Mr. Dearing, who has deferred an offer from McKinsey. The teaching skills easily translate to office environments, he said. "I'm effectively the leader, every day, for 46 minutes, in front of seven different groups," Mr. Dearing said.
Teach for America also became a sought-after option for students like Eric Rodriguez, who was a senior at Harvard when the financial crisis hit. Mr. Rodriguez had completed two internships at Lehman Brothers and was fully expecting to work at the firm after he graduated. But as he started his senior year in September 2008, Lehman Brothers collapsed and Wall Street was in a free fall.
But that fall, Teach for America began its to woo him to join its ranks.
"At Harvard, they harass you: 'I'm going to be at this place, come meet me,' " he said. "It wasn't until I was desperate that I said 'I'll check this out and speak to this person.' " In 2009, Mr. Rodriguez joined Teach for America and taught in an elementary school in San Francisco for two years. Afterward, he landed a job at Facebook in its user operations department.
At least a dozen other teaching programs also compete to attract talented college graduates and professionals. NYC Teaching Fellows, a 12-year-old program that is run by the city's education department, said that nearly 7 percent of its applicants in 2012 were business majors. It is similarly selective and had nearly 12,000 applicants last year for about 1,400 spots, mostly for positions in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
Other publicly and privately run teaching enterprises, like Chicago Teaching Fellows and City Year, a one-year service program, attract applicants from across the country. But among most graduates, Teach for America holds a higher profile, said Monica Wilson, acting co-director of Dartmouth College's office of career services.
"As Teach for America has been around longer and hired very smart people, it's gotten even better at how they recruit students, while the financial services industry has slowed down and experienced negative publicity in the media," Ms. Wilson said. Many regard earning a spot in Teach for America a "badge of success."
Teach for America in particular said that its applicant pool had swelled during the recession and lackluster recovery. More than 48,000 applied for 5,800 spots in 2012, nearly twice as many as those who had sought positions for the 2008 class.
The relationship between the teachers in the program and those outside the program has often been tense. Critics of the Teach for America program say teachers, in general, aren't at their best until they've been working for at least five years.
Teach for America contends that many of its teachers last beyond the required two years. Of its 28,000 alumni, two-thirds remain in education roles, including as principals and superintendents (about half of those educators are in classroom settings).
"It wouldn't have the same appeal if it were for a longer period of time," said Kaitlin Gastrock, a spokeswoman for Teach for America. "Two years is a reasonable ask to make of folks who are just finishing up their college experience."
Teach for America participants receive the same starting salary as first-year teachers in their districts, which is about $25,500 to $51,000 a year. That pales in comparisons to the six-figure salary and bonus structures that many elite college graduates can expect in finance.
The program fully expects that it will not keep all of its recruits. Mr. Dearing, for one, said he intended to work at McKinsey after his commitment was over. But the teaching program could lead to a career in public service one day, he said.
In many ways Teach for America was modeled on the success of top Wall Street firms, which seek to recruit the best and the brightest college graduates. In her 2001 memoir, the program's founder, Wendy Kopp, wrote that she hoped to both improve the stature of the profession and give the recruitment process a much-needed jolt. In the book, she said she envisioned creating "a teachers corps that would recruit as aggressively as the investment banks and management consulting firms that were still swarming all over campus."
Indeed, some of Teach for America's outreach is taken straight from Wall Street's recruiting book. On campuses, career advisers and applicants say, the program's presence is large, with ambassadors compiling lists of impressive candidates from the recommendations of professors, academic advisers and alumni. Now, the number of teachers who joined this year from Ivy League schools is nearly 50 percent higher than it was in 2008.
"They take the time to visit campus, to get to know our students, our student groups, where and when they should present," said Patricia Rose, director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania. "Most of the other people who use this model are for-profit organizations."
The previous internships in finance have proved to be effective teaching aids for some of the participants. Ross Peyser, a 2011 graduate of Cornell and a second-year teacher in New Orleans, was once an intern at Oliver Wyman, a financial services consulting firm. As a teacher, he still plays the role of data analyst, creating Excel spreadsheets to diagnose his students' learning needs.
At the end of day, he administers a five-question quiz to students to assess who understood the lesson. When class is over, he performs exhaustive data pulls in Excel, just as he did as a finance intern.
"I had a stronger basis to do my data analysis compared to all the other teachers in my school," Mr. Peyser said. "It came more naturally just based on that one summer in finance."
And more important, he and others do regard the program as one that provides essential job skills.
"T.F.A. is a really strong name," he said. "It seems as if going to work for McKinsey or something like that; they hold the same value."

HEADLINE: Why It's Hard to Score the Fiscal Deal

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: A suggestion, after Washington's latest fiscal deal, that liberals and conservatives might do well to spend more time considering what their strategic objectives really are. 

 BODY:
I've been on vacation for the past week and have been following the fiscal negotiations with less attention than I normally would. But perhaps that distance gives me a different perspective on the deal.
Most of the observations that I was reading about the deal were highly concerned with tactical considerations: Who had moved most from their previous offers? What precedents were being established for future negotiations?
As news about the negotiations evolved on a daily (or hourly) basis, the attitude of liberals and conservatives in my Twitter feed seemed to change along with it. Liberals seemed considerably happier about the deal on Tuesday night, for example - after the House of Representatives nearly scuttled the deal and then passed it with mostly Democratic votes - than they were early Tuesday morning, after the deal had passed through the Senate with an overwhelming bipartisan majority. But there had been no change to the policy terms of the deal. 
I do not mean to suggest that these tactical considerations are of no importance. It could matter that the House of Representatives violated the Hastert rule -- the idea that that a bill should receive a majority of votes from members of the majority party in the House - in passing the bill. It could matter that President Obama, at an earlier point in the negotiation, capitulated on his demand that the federal debt ceiling be raised as part of a deal, setting up another confrontation in a few months.
But I would argue that the attention paid to these tactical considerations is a bit disproportionate. They seem to make it easy to declare "winners" and "losers" at every turn in the negotiations - whereas evaluating the deal in terms of the actual policy impact is much trickier.
 Why is this so? Because each side has a variety of plausible strategic imperatives when it comes to fiscal policy - and they don't necessarily yield the same policy preferences.
Take the deal from the Democratic or liberal perspective, for example. What were Democrats' major strategic goals? For some liberals, the goal might be redistribution: to adopt a series of policies that result in a net transfer of wealth from high-income earners to middle- or low-income earners.
Other Democrats (and Republicans) might view the deal from the standpoint of taxes vs. spending: what is the ratio of tax increases to spending cuts?
Finally, there is the paradigm of expansionary or contractionary fiscal policy. Since the economic recovery is still tepid, many liberals would prefer that the government continue to stimulate the economy in the near-term at the expense of increasing the debt in the long term. (This consideration may have a political component as well, since a better economy will tend to improve President Obama's popularity and perhaps increase his ability to achieve future fiscal and nonfiscal policy goals in the months and years ahead.)
Take one component of the deal: that the cuts to the payroll tax, which had been in place for the past several years were not extended and will now expire. If increasing tax revenues is the major Democratic goal, the expiration of the payroll tax cut helped to achieve that. But it also represented contractionary fiscal policy. And the impact will mostly be realized upon the middle class and the working poor, which pay a higher percentage of their income in payroll taxes.
Most Democrats, I assume, would have preferred that the payroll tax cut had been extended: doing so would have achieved two Democratic goals (expansionary policy and redistribution), outweighing the one that it contradicted (increasing tax revenues).
But when the overall deal is considered - not just the payroll tax, but all the other components, like the extension of unemployment benefits, or the increase in income and capital gains taxes for high-income earners - it becomes much trickier to evaluate because of the different criteria that might be reasonably be applied to evaluate success or failure.
My objective here is not to advocate for any one set of metrics, or to "score" the deal that was struck on Tuesday - so much as to suggest that liberals and conservatives might do well to spend more time considering what their strategic objectives really are. Just as is the case during election campaign, an obsessive focus on the latest developments in the news cycle can cause one to lose sight of the bigger picture.

HEADLINE: Car Sharing Catches On as Zipcar Sells to Avis

BYLINE: ANDREW MARTIN


HIGHLIGHT: The Avis Budget Group said on Wednesday that it had agreed to acquire the car-sharing pioneer Zipcar for $500 million in cash. 

 BODY:
 8:51 p.m. | Updated 
Last year, Lane Becker and his wife, Courtney Skott, plotted out the costs of owning a car versus renting one through Zipcar, the popular car-sharing service.
They ultimately decided to give away their car. Mr. Becker, who is 39 and lives in San Francisco, said he had few regrets, despite some difficulty securing a Zipcar on weekends, when he competes with other customers.
"It's a lot easier to rent than to own in a city these days, and Zipcar is an easy way to do it," he said. 
But on Wednesday, Avis Budget Group, the car rental conglomerate, announced that it was buying Zipcar for about $500 million. And that has Mr. Becker and some other "Zipsters," as Zipcar customers are known, worried that the company's communal cachet could be tarnished by a corporate behemoth.
"Please don't let them screw it up," Mr. Becker said.
For Zipcar, based in Cambridge, Mass., the deal represents perhaps an inevitable evolution for a company that has been more successful as a collectivist concept than as a profit-making venture (though it announced in November that it would post an annual profit for the first time).
Zipcar, which will operate as a subsidiary of Avis, should realize significant savings on things like vehicle purchases and insurance, while being able to tap Avis's fleet to meet demand on weekends, when it is often short of cars.
For Avis, the purchase represents a new direction in a fiercely competitive car rental market, and an about-face for Ronald L. Nelson, the company's chairman and chief executive, who had resisted entering the car-sharing segment.
"I've been somewhat dismissive of car sharing in the past," Mr. Nelson said Wednesday morning in a phone call with analysts. He said he had come to the realization that car sharing could complement Avis's more traditional car rental business and help it unlock new business opportunities abroad and with younger consumers. Avis's rivals, Hertz Global and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, already offer hourly rental services that compete with Zipcar.
Shares of Avis Budget Group closed up about 5 percent on Wednesday, at $20.77. Shares of Zipcar closed up nearly 48 percent, at $12.18.
Avis said it expected savings of $50 million to $70 million a year from combining the two companies.
"Avis Budget's existing infrastructure, scale and experience with managing multiple brands make it uniquely positioned to accelerate the growth and profitability of Zipcar," Mr. Nelson said in prepared remarks. "At the same time, we are committed to retaining the elements of the Zipcar brand and culture that have allowed Zipcar to achieve such rapid growth and success."
Avis paid $12.25 a share in cash, a 49 percent premium over the closing price of Zipcar on Monday. (The price, however, is well below Zipcar's value in April 2011, when it went public at $18 a share.)
Among the beneficiaries will be Zipcar's early investors, including the tech titan Steve Case. He and his investment fund own about 19 percent of Zipcar's outstanding shares.
The idea for Zipcar dates to 1999, when a 42-year-old woman named Robin Chase learned about car sharing from a friend who had just returned from Berlin. A mother of three with an M.B.A. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ms. Chase wrote up a business plan and secured financing. Zipcar was started in 2000.
Environmentalists have embraced the idea of car sharing from the start, but Ms. Chase marketed Zipcar more on the idea of convenience, with the slogan "Wheels When You Want Them." The company grew quickly but fitfully, and Ms. Chase was forced out in 2003.
Her successor as chairman and chief executive, Scott Griffith, expanded Zipcar across the country and into Europe. A flat, hourly rate that covers gas and insurance for customers proved to be alluring: the service now has more than 760,000 members, with locations in 20 metropolitan areas in the United States, Canada and Europe, as well as on many college campuses.
"Since the founding, I knew that Zipcar would end up being the winning model for drivers, and that car rental companies would eventually have to come around and adopt our technology and approach," Ms. Chase said in an e-mail on Wednesday.
She said she expected the deal to improve Zipcar's profitability, but added, "Like all big company acquisitions of small companies, there is worry that they won't be able to do what it takes to succeed in the new economy: more innovation, more customer participation, more thinking outside of the box."
Zipcar fans praise its convenience, its plentiful urban locations and its friendly customer service. Victor Neufeld, a media executive who lives in Manhattan, said renting a car in New York City was always an annoyance before Zipcar came along.
"Every time I need a car for two hours, I go online and get a car within two blocks of my home," said Mr. Neufeld, who declined to give his age. "I also like it because originally I heard about it through word of mouth. I did not learn about it through advertising or some other marketing. It was very organic."
Maggie Marquis, 31, who lives with her husband in Chicago, said she started using Zipcar about six months ago and was generally pleased. "Just today, I decided that I wanted to run out and do some errands, and decided it would be easiest and cheapest to get a Zipcar," she said.
But Ms. Marquis said she was surprised by "small hints of disorganization." The company sent her multiple membership cards and would not allow her to sign her husband up for the same account, and she said she often received text messages about her rentals even after she had returned a car.
She said she hoped the influence of a larger corporation would "take their service to a new level of sophistication."
Several other Zipcar fans said they, too, hoped there would be benefits to the Avis deal, particularly more cars available on weekends.
Claire Frisbie, 31, who lives in Brooklyn, said she liked Zipcar for many reasons, but that one of the biggest was the ability to avoid the bureaucracy of traditional car rental companies: the waiting, the insurance, the added fees.
"I wouldn't want it to make it more difficult," she said of the deal. "I would be worried that the easy breeziness of it would be gone."

HEADLINE: Simple Living (The Formula Is Complex)

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRA JACOBS

 BODY:
THE temperature was in the low 30s, but the door of West Elm Market in the Dumbo neighborhood of Brooklyn was propped lavishly open, urging visitors in alongside a chalked promise of that now-ubiquitous urban enticement: ''Coffee and Tea All Day.''
This corporate disregard for heating bills (the market, like the furniture store that begot it, is owned by Williams-Sonoma) seemed curiously at odds with a philosophy of old-fashioned thrift and conservation that West Elm is trying to appropriate, not without strain, from the Etsy generation. 
I had arrived at the market under something of a misapprehension, thinking it was going to be a rusticated reincarnation of the late Hold Everything (a competitor of the Container Store also owned by Williams-Sonoma). I was hoping to find attractive cedar-lined storage solutions for everything I'd been unable to divest myself of at the end of 2012: aging spices, children's artwork, torn clothing.
This neatening impulse had struck not because of the calendar, I think, but in reaction to the recent spate of terrible news events. When the world seems completely out of control, restoring order in the home is a common reflexive response that can soothe, if not solve. (I remember frantically and uncharacteristically scrubbing down countertops the morning of 9/11 as scraps of office paper from the fallen towers swirled outside the windows of my railroad apartment in Cobble Hill.)
But aside from some modular shelving, West Elm Market is not devoted to crisp organization so much as the squishy new improvisational economy. It denies the droning existence of cubicle life, imagining instead a can-do customer with endless unsupervised hours to devote to backyard chickens and victory gardens, pie crusts and piles of laundry. Even the preprinted list pads on offer read ''Do Your Chores,'' as if that customer lived in a sod house on the banks of Plum Creek rather than in a $1,000-per-square-foot loft apartment overlooking the East River.
Upon entering the store, whose floors are the unfinished concrete de rigueur to the neighborhood, my nostrils were filled with a possibly piped-in but not unpleasant piney scent.
''Oh, it smells so great in here,'' breathed a male customer wearing purple corduroy pants tucked with a certain boldness into yellow Wellies, as he examined a $65 bottle of beard oil -- one of many archaic personal hygiene products for sale, including Botot toothpaste, invented for King Louis XV of France, and Huberd's Shoe Grease.
A woman with a kerchief tied around her head was stacking a shelf with soy-wax candles made in Charleston, S.C., packaged in repurposed wine bottles and in flavors including chardonnay and merlot: varietals unfashionable since the Alexander Payne movie ''Sideways'' came out in 2004, but maybe due for a comeback.
Candles, in fact, make up a large chunk of the market's stock. There are candles in hollowed-out logs, smelling of wood smoke; there are creamy-looking Francophile candles; there are affirmatively American candles housed in Mason jars or swathed in cheesecloth. Next to one locally handcrafted, organic candle there was a little personal testimonial scrawled on an index card, presumably by a member of West Elm's staff: ''Smells amazing! I have it right next to my desk and it's a source of Zen amidst the chaos. -- Lisa.''
There are no desks to be found here, though there is a long communal table in unfinished wood toward the back, where one can enjoy with the all-day coffee and tea a sticky bun ($2.50) from Roberta's, the pizzeria in Williamsburg that slices the idea of Brooklyn cool so thin that online reviewers complain about patrons who take a car service there from Park Slope. Later this month, there are classes planned on D.I.Y. room spray and Japanese cookery.
But though it carries four different kinds of mortar and pestle, do not confuse West Elm Market with its parent company, as perhaps did the hapless shopper I observed clapping a lid onto a pan and asking a passing clerk, ''Is something like this for a frittata?'' with a pronounced roll of her ''r.''
''I don't think so,'' he said, taking a nervous step back. ''We only carry very basic kitchen items.''
The señora could be forgiven her inquiry, as another table nearby was piled high with specialty cookbooks, including one about lard; another with the subtitle ''How to Harvest Your Livestock and Wild Game.''
Anyone else miss the nice civilized lunch at Le Côte Basque?
Moving on to the Care & Repair section, meanwhile, I'll just say that there is no domestic urge powerful enough to entice me to flit around wielding an ostrich-feather duster ($20).
For about $10 more, though, I did spring for a blue doormat printed with a large white anchor. Maybe the guests of 2013 will use it to wipe their well-greased feet, or maybe it will just be a source of zany amidst the chaos.
West Elm Market
50 Washington Street, Brooklyn, (718) 522-3498; westelm.com
HOMEY The furniture store West Elm, owned by the kitchen-supply behemoth Williams-Sonoma, has spawned a motley general-goods emporium that pays tribute to simpler times.
FOAMY The place is awash in sponges, scrubbers and cleansers (J. R. Liggett's Shampoo Bar, $6.95): convenient, because there is also a preponderance of gardening necessities (Brooklyn Blend potting soil, $7) and compost equipment (stainless steel pail, $44.95).
SHOW ME The sales staff is cheerful, if a little unseasoned. There is a cafe where members of Skillshare, the online learning community network, will offer classes, but so far it's just a place where people flop down with Vanity Fair and cappuccinos.

HEADLINE: A Gym for People Who Don't Like Gyms

BYLINE: By ANDREW ADAM NEWMAN

 BODY:
COMMERCIALS for gyms tend to feature actors who look like Calvin Klein underwear models, with physiques that most will not achieve no matter how long they spend on an elliptical machine.
Planet Fitness, a national chain of about 600 fitness clubs, is introducing a campaign that mocks fitness fanatics, especially those whose devotion infringes on others.
A new commercial opens with a slight woman who is curling small dumbbells in a drab gym as a brawny man berates her like a drill sergeant. 
''If you can't handle a big girl's workout, the little girl's gym is right across the street!'' shouts the man, a whistle hanging around his neck and his hands balled into fists, as the woman appears to be on the brink of tears. ''If you were committed to this workout the way you committed to that morning doughnut, you'd be puking out your ears right now!''
The spot cuts to a flashing light and siren and the words ''Lunk Alarm,'' and then to the same woman in street clothes being given a tour of a Planet Fitness facility.
''And that's why I don't like gyms,'' she says.
''Well,'' begins the employee showing her around, ''we're not a gym -- we're Planet Fitness.''
The ad closes with a voice-over, which says: ''No gymtimidation. No lunks. Just $10 a month.''
The ad, by Red Tettemer & Partners in Philadelphia, will be introduced widely on Jan. 10. Three other spots in the campaign follow the same structure, opening with overbearing gym rats and closing with assurances that Planet Fitness is more laid back.
Planet Fitness will spend an estimated $10 million to $12 million on the campaign. It spent $15.8 million on advertising in the first nine months of 2012, more than the $14.9 million it spent in all of 2011, according to Kantar Media, a unit of WPP.
Rather than being just a narrative device in the spots, lunk alarms have actually been fixtures at Planet Fitness gyms. Members who exhibit lunk behavior, which the company defines on posters in its facilities as grunting, dropping weights loudly and being judgmental, are subject to a public shaming when a manager at the facility sounds the alarm.
In some cases, Planet Fitness even revokes memberships, as it did at a location in Wappingers Falls, N.Y., in 2006. Albert Argibay, a bodybuilder whose exertions were considered grunting by Planet Fitness, but which Mr. Argibay countered in news accounts as merely heavy breathing, kept lifting after he was told to leave, and was eventually escorted from the premises by police officers.
While the slogan ''No Gymtimidation'' is being introduced with the new campaign, the company has for years promised what it calls a ''judgment-free zone.'' That, in the words of the Planet Fitness Web site, ''means members can relax, get in shape, and have fun without being subjected to the hard-core, look-at-me attitude that exists in too many gyms.''
Jamie Medeiros, director of marketing at Planet Fitness, said that only about 15 percent of Americans belonged to gyms, and that the company was focused not on trying to lure consumers from other facilities but on enticing those who had avoided gyms altogether.
''We go after the 85 percent who don't belong to a gym now or who have never belonged to a gym,'' Ms. Medeiros said.
While many chains sell protein powders and a wide range of supplements, Planet Fitness takes the counterintuitive approach of serving the type of food that dieters typically avoid.
Every month members are treated to pizza on the first Monday night and bagels on the second Tuesday morning, while Tootsie Rolls are handed out daily.
''The common person doesn't have time to work out every day, and they may not aspire to the type of person who has six-pack abs and eats egg whites,'' Ms. Medeiros said. ''But we want to be the type of facility that people want to go to as opposed to, 'Oh my god, I have to go to the gym today!' ''
The company has thrived even during the economic downturn, growing to four million members today from about 3.2 million a year ago, according to Ms. Medeiros. About 60 percent of its members are women, much higher than what Ms. Medeiros said is the national average of 20 percent.
Health clubs, like cellphone carriers, tend to sell one- or two-year contracts, but Planet Fitness instead has a month-to-month plan, at $10 monthly, which the company believes knocks down a barrier to joining.
Among consumers who exercise, 71 percent agreed with the statement that fitness clubs were too expensive, according to a survey by Mintel, a market research firm. As for the atmosphere, only 27 percent said that they enjoyed the social aspects of gyms.
When brands hire celebrity endorsers and attractive models, marketers typically refer to the advertisements as aspirational, meaning that consumers do not see themselves reflected in the ad as much as an ideal to which they aspire. But Steve Red, the chief creative officer of Red Tettemer & Partners, said the aspirational approach can backfire when it comes to promoting health clubs.
''I'm never going to get to be that washboard-stomach, super-cut guy that I see in the Equinox ads,'' said Mr. Red, referring to the chain of upscale gyms. ''There are a ton of gym brands that are all about being cut and sinewy and having a six-pack, but I would argue that approach is not aspirational -- it's inaccessible.''

 Planet Fitness's new ad campaign promises members a ''judgment-free zone'' while making sport of the pretensions and excesses at rival clubs.

HEADLINE: Cliff After Cliff

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
We have a deal. But please hold your applause, indefinitely.
We momentarily went over the fiscal cliff but clawed our way back up the rock face. Unfortunately, we are most likely in store for a never-ending series of cliffs for our economy, our government and indeed our country. Soon we'll have to deal with the sequester, a debt-ceiling extension and possibly a budget, all of which hold the specter of revisiting the unresolvable conflicts and intransigence of the fiscal cliff. Imagine an M. C. Escher drawing of cliffs.
Be clear: there is no reason to celebrate. This is a mournful moment. We -- and by we I mean Congress, and by Congress I mean the Republicans in Congress -- have again demonstrated just how broken and paralyzed our government has become, how beholden to hostage-takers, how vulnerable to extremism. 
A fiscal cliff deal was cut at the last possible minute, covering a minimal number of issues. It was far from perfect and barely palatable. It was a compromise, and compromises are inherently imperfect. No one likes the whole of it, but they balance the bad parts against the good and see beyond dissension.
As the fiscal cliff votes came down to the wire, many repeated the aphorism: don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good. But sadly, we are beyond even that. Now the perfunctory has become the victim of the grueling.
The American people suffered through another moment of manufactured suspense brought on by political malpractice. There was no grand bargain. There was only a begrudging acquiescence.
Not only is the era of grand bargains ''over,'' as Jennifer Steinhauer wrote in The Times on Tuesday, I believe that the era of basic governance is screeching to a halt.
As Steinhauer pointed out in September:
''The 112th Congress is set to enter the Congressional record books as the least productive body in a generation, passing a mere 173 public laws as of last month. That was well below the 906 enacted from January 1947 through December 1948 by the body President Harry S. Truman referred to as the 'do-nothing' Congress, and far fewer than even a single session of many prior Congresses.''
That's an abominable shame. The one function of a lawmaker is to make laws. They can no longer seem to do that in any meaningful way.
It is no wonder that Gallup finds Congress's approval rating stuck in the teens.
We have moved from a type of governance where the art of the compromise was invaluable to one where adherence to ridiculous pledges is inviolable. (By approving this fiscal cliff deal, many Republicans voted to broadly raise taxes for the first time in decades and many are still grousing about it.)
The change has taken place primarily among Republicans, who have struggled to balance the responsibilities and prerogatives of minority-party status with the anxiety of losing their long-held power at the expense of the growing influence of minority and historically marginalized constituencies like women and gays.
Smaller federal government! Out-of-control federal spending! States' rights! Defense of Marriage! Defund Planned Parenthood! There is an individual argument (merit not withstanding) to be made about each of these issues in its own right. But only a person who is willfully blind or hopelessly ignorant would not acknowledge the common thread that runs through them: the fear of a future in which income, wealth and cultural inequalities dissipate and traditional power structures dissolve.
The country's debt and solvency are real and legitimate concerns, but the true crux of the friction lies in the implicit arguments about the cause of our troubles. It is the tired and worn takers vs. makers argument just slathered in lipstick -- Resistance Red, I suppose.
And since some of these Republicans are from safely gerrymandered districts, they have little to lose and something to gain by holding the line even if it continually pushes the country to the brink.
House Republicans like to say that Americans voted for a divided government and this gridlock is what becomes it. But that's not entirely correct. As The Economist pointed out in November:
''The Democrats won 50.6% of the votes for president, to 47.8% for the Republicans; 53.6% of the votes for the Senate, to 42.9% for the Republicans; and... 49% of the votes for the House, to 48.2% for the Republicans (some ballots are still being counted). That's not a vote for divided government. It's a clean sweep.''
Republicans control the House in part because of the geography of ideology -- cities tend to have high concentrations of Democrats and rural areas have high concentrations of Republicans -- and because of the way district lines were redrawn, in many cases by Republican-led state legislatures.
So we will be soon be pushed back into a state of panic because Republican members of Congress demand a state of paralysis.
We are stuck with this reckless, whining and ultimately dangerous gaggle of wounded spirits. As many people can attest, an animal is often at its most dangerous when it's sick, wounded or afraid. Brace yourselves.

HEADLINE: Our Absurd Fear of Fat

BYLINE: By PAUL CAMPOS. 
Paul Campos is a professor of law at the University of Colorado, Boulder, and the author of ''The Obesity Myth: Why America's Obsession With Weight Is Hazardous to Your Health.''

 BODY:
ACCORDING to the United States government, nearly 7 out of 10 American adults weigh too much. (In 2010, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categorized 74 percent of men and 65 percent of women as either overweight or obese.)
But a new meta-analysis of the relationship between weight and mortality risk, involving nearly three million subjects from more than a dozen countries, illustrates just how exaggerated and unscientific that claim is. 
The meta-analysis, published this week in The Journal of the American Medical Association, reviewed data from nearly a hundred large epidemiological studies to determine the correlation between body mass and mortality risk. The results ought to stun anyone who assumes the definition of ''normal'' or ''healthy'' weight used by our public health authorities is actually supported by the medical literature.
The study, by Katherine M. Flegal and her associates at the C.D.C. and the National Institutes of Health, found that all adults categorized as overweight and most of those categorized as obese have a lower mortality risk than so-called normal-weight individuals. If the government were to redefine normal weight as one that doesn't increase the risk of death, then about 130 million of the 165 million American adults currently categorized as overweight and obese would be re-categorized as normal weight instead.
To put some flesh on these statistical bones, the study found a 6 percent decrease in mortality risk among people classified as overweight and a 5 percent decrease in people classified as Grade 1 obese, the lowest level (most of the obese fall in this category). This means that average-height women -- 5 feet 4 inches -- who weigh between 108 and 145 pounds have a higher mortality risk than average-height women who weigh between 146 and 203 pounds. For average-height men -- 5 feet 10 inches -- those who weigh between 129 and 174 pounds have a higher mortality risk than those who weigh between 175 and 243 pounds.
Now, if we were to employ the logic of our public health authorities, who treat any correlation between weight and increased mortality risk as a good reason to encourage people to try to modify their weight, we ought to be telling the 75 million American adults currently occupying the government's ''healthy weight'' category to put on some pounds, so they can move into the lower risk, higher-weight categories.
In reality, of course, it would be nonsensical to tell so-called normal-weight people to try to become heavier to lower their mortality risk. Such advice would ignore the fact that tiny variations in relative risk in observational studies provide no scientific basis for concluding either that those variations are causally related to the variable in question or that this risk would change if the variable were altered.
This is because observational studies merely record statistical correlations: we don't know to what extent, if any, the slight decrease in mortality risk observed among people defined as overweight or moderately obese is caused by higher weight or by other factors. Similarly, we don't know whether the small increase in mortality risk observed among very obese people is caused by their weight or by any number of other factors, including lower socioeconomic status, dieting and the weight cycling that accompanies it, social discrimination and stigma, or stress.
In other words, there is no reason to believe that the trivial variations in mortality risk observed across an enormous weight range actually have anything to do with weight or that intentional weight gain or loss would affect that risk in a predictable way.
How did we get into this absurd situation? That is a long and complex story. Over the past century, Americans have become increasingly obsessed with the supposed desirability of thinness, as thinness has become both a marker for upper-class status and a reflection of beauty ideals that bring a kind of privilege.
In addition, baselessly categorizing at least 130 million Americans -- and hundreds of millions in the rest of the world -- as people in need of ''treatment'' for their ''condition'' serves the economic interests of, among others, the multibillion-dollar weight-loss industry and large pharmaceutical companies, which have invested a great deal of money in winning the good will of those who will determine the regulatory fate of the next generation of diet drugs.
Anyone familiar with history will not be surprised to learn that ''facts'' have been enlisted before to confirm the legitimacy of a cultural obsession and to advance the economic interests of those who profit from that obsession.
Don't expect those who have made their careers on fomenting panic to understand that our current definition of ''normal weight'' makes absolutely no sense.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Gird for Next Clash, on the Debt Ceiling

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the resolution of the year-end fiscal crisis just hours old, the next political confrontation is already taking shape as this city braces for a fight in February over raising the nation's borrowing limit. But it is a debate President Obama says he will have nothing more to do with.
Even as Republicans vow to leverage a needed increase in the federal debt limit to make headway on their demands for deep spending cuts, Mr. Obama -- who reluctantly negotiated a deal like that 18 months ago -- says he has no intention of ever getting pulled into another round of charged talks on the issue with Republicans on Capitol Hill.
''I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they've already racked up through the laws that they passed,'' the president said Tuesday night after he successfully pushed Republicans to allow tax increases on wealthy Americans. On Wednesday, he signed the legislation. 
The president's position is sure to appeal to his liberal allies, who fear another round of compromises by Mr. Obama. But it once again sets the stage for a nail-biting standoff that economists warn could lead to a damaging financial default and doubt from investors about the ability of the country to pay its obligations.
Moody's, the rating agency, warned on Wednesday that the looming political battles over the nation's debt could lower the group's rating of American debt.
''We're in for another round of brinkmanship and uncertainty,'' said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics, who predicted weeks of ''angst, discussion and hand-wringing'' in Washington. ''I don't think the economy can really find its footing and jump to a higher level of growth until we get to the other side of this.''
Joel Prakken, senior managing director of Macroeconomic Advisers, an economics forecasting firm, said bluntly, ''This is kind of a mess.''
The financial imperative for an increase in the debt limit comes at a time of increasingly sour relations between the president and his Republican adversaries in the House. To secure a deal to avert automatic tax increases and spending cuts on Jan. 1, Mr. Obama was forced into last-minute talks with Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, after weeks of negotiations with Speaker John A. Boehner in the House collapsed amid acrimony and internal Republican dissension.
Now, the president and Mr. Boehner are signaling a fresh round of take-it-or-leave it stands that are in sharp opposition: The president says increasing the borrowing limit is nonnegotiable, while Republicans say the House is all but certain to pass a bill that raises the debt limit only in exchange for significant cuts -- a challenge to Mr. Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate.
Smarting from the president's victory on taxes over the New Year's holiday, Republicans in Congress are betting that their refusal to raise the $16.4 trillion debt ceiling will force Mr. Obama to the bargaining table on spending cuts and issues like changes in Medicare and Social Security.
But doing so would inevitably reprise the bitter debate over the debt ceiling that took place in the summer of 2011, when the government came close to defaulting on its debt before lawmakers and the president agreed to a 10-year package of spending cuts in exchange for Republican agreement to raise the debt ceiling by about the same amount.
And that is exactly what Republicans want -- again.
''If they want to get the debt limit raised, they are going to have to engage and accept that reality,'' said Brendan Buck, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner. ''The president knows that.''
Senator Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, said flatly that his party should risk the possibility of default -- including interruptions in federal benefit checks and paychecks for government workers -- if it was the only way to compel the president to support deep spending cuts that will reduce the deficit.
''That's disruptive, but it's a hell of a lot better than the path that we're on,'' Mr. Toomey said Wednesday on MSNBC. ''We absolutely have to have this fight over the debt limit.''
The Republican Party's caucus in the House will discuss a debt ceiling strategy at a private retreat in Williamsburg, Va., this month, according to a top Republican aide, who said they were determined to insist again on spending cuts that equal the amount of increase in how much the country can borrow.
''The speaker told the president to his face that everything you want in life comes with a price,'' the aide said. ''That doesn't change here. I don't think he has any choice.''
White House officials say Mr. Obama is equally determined to avoid letting the debt ceiling become a regular Republican tool for extracting concessions on spending on programs popular with Democratic constituents.
''It means that he won't negotiate on it,'' a senior administration official said Wednesday about the president's comments. ''He's not entertaining offers about it. We're not having meetings about it.''
The official, who asked for anonymity to discuss legislative strategy, said the debt limit ''was never used as a policy leverage tool before.''
''This is them paying the bills for the spending that they racked up,'' the official said. ''They need to do that.''
Some people in both parties questioned why Mr. Obama would so emphatically vow not to negotiate over the debt limit, a promise he may ultimately be forced to break if necessary to avoid economic shock waves.
''It's bizarre,'' said one veteran Democratic senator who would not be named, citing the proven willingness of Republicans to force a fiscal crisis unless the president makes a deal for additional spending cuts.
Mr. Obama resolved immediately after the 2011 debt crisis, privately and publicly, that he would not be drawn again into negotiations over the borrowing limit. He has said that presidents and Congresses have a fundamental, shared responsibility to ensure that the government pays bills that it owes to its citizens and creditors.
In saying he will refuse to bargain over the debt limit, Mr. Obama is counting on help from the business community, given its traditional ties to Republicans. Recently, for example, the head of the Business Roundtable, John Engler, a Republican and former governor of Michigan, called for extending the debt limit for five years.
''You don't put the full faith and credit of the United States' finances at risk,'' said David M. Cote, chairman of Honeywell and a Republican member of the 2010 Simpson-Bowles fiscal commission. ''The whole idea of using debt ceiling that way or saying 'I'll do this horrible thing to all of us unless you give in' just doesn't make any sense for anybody. It makes me very nervous. It's not a smart way to run the country.''
Mr. Obama might also take to the road again, using the power of his office in an effort to convince the public that another fight over the debt ceiling risks another economic crisis. Public polls after the last debt ceiling fight suggested that more people blamed Republicans for the threat of a shutdown.
''If Congress refuses to give the United States government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic -- far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff,'' Mr. Obama said Tuesday.

HEADLINE: Together a Century, City and Oil Giant Hit a Rough Patch

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
RICHMOND, Calif. -- The Chevron refinery's massive oil storage tanks sit on the hills overlooking this small, impoverished city in San Francisco's East Bay. Painted earthen red to blend with the natural surroundings, the tanks cannot help dominating the city's skyline, much the way the oil giant itself has long shaped Richmond's identity, economy and politics.
But Chevron's grip on Richmond's politics began to loosen a few years ago after left-wing anticorporate activists seized control of the City Council and mayor's office. In an area of the country where high-tech companies tend to coexist peacefully with affluent municipalities, perhaps nowhere have locals and a giant corporation rubbed shoulders with such intensity as in Richmond.
If city leaders likened themselves to anti-oil-company fighters in Nigeria, Ecuador and other developing oil-rich nations, Chevron's response would not have been out of place in the Niger Delta. It has spent millions of dollars on social programs and community-building here, as well as on friendly politicians. 
Now, Chevron will get an inkling of whether its new strategy is working as the city weighs the company's plans to rebuild a critical unit damaged in a major fire in August. Chevron says it wants to complete repairs this month at the refinery, where production has been cut in half since the fire.
Not so fast, the city says.
At a recent raucous public hearing, Mayor Gayle McLaughlin stood up to criticize Chevron, leaning on a pair of crutches after knee surgery. The mayor pointed out that the company had yet to provide documents requested by federal regulators, who are expected to release a report on the cause of the fire early this year. To applause, the mayor said, ''In terms of response and transparency, I have concerns.''
At issue is Chevron's choice of metal to replace a 5-foot-long, 8-inch carbon-steel pipe that became corroded and sprang a leak in August. The resulting fire sent plumes of black smoke into the air, spewing emissions of sulfur dioxide, as the authorities warned Richmond residents to stay indoors. Thousands went to emergency rooms with various health complaints. Chevron says it will compensate residents with valid claims for medical and property expenses, although it has not said how many of the 23,700 claims it has received will qualify.
The selection of a metal alloy called 9 Chrome will make the new pipe resistant to the kind of corrosion that affected the carbon-steel pipe, Chevron says; while the city's own metal consultants confirm that the material meets industry standards, critics say there could be better choices.
The larger issue is the trust between Chevron and Richmond, which has deteriorated since the fire.
For most of the past century, Richmond was a loyal company town. As Chevron officials invariably point out, the refinery was built 110 years ago, three years before Richmond was incorporated as a city. Richmond grew around the refinery, which has remained the city's biggest employer and taxpayer.
Then in the 1990s, transplants from nearby Berkeley and San Francisco began gravitating here, drawn to Richmond's affordable rents and adding a radical tinge to the city's traditionally moderate Democratic leanings. Ms. McLaughlin, a member of the Green Party, was elected in 2006, making Richmond the largest American city to be led by an official from her party; like-minded candidates grabbed seats on the City Council.
Not surprisingly, Richmond and Chevron became locked in lawsuits over the payment of various taxes. More significant, with the help of allies in environmental groups, Richmond has blocked Chevron's plans for a major upgrade that the company says is essential to the refinery's future.
''They went through a period of time when they took a very hard-line, confrontational position with the City of Richmond, and I don't think it was working for them very well,'' said Tom Butt, a councilman who has been critical of Chevron and who won re-election in November, despite the oil company's support for three other candidates. ''They were facing a situation where the majority of the City Council were not their friends, and so they decided to try a different position.''
Sean Comey, a Chevron spokesman, said the company felt the need to adopt a new strategy toward Richmond, though he did not go as far as to acknowledge that it was a direct response to the city's changing politics.
''Probably about four, five years ago, we sat down to really reassess what the state of our relationship was with the community where we had been for more than 100 years -- and it wasn't where we wanted it to be,'' Mr. Comey said.
Chevron began increasing its social investments in Richmond, in everything from community gardens and holiday events to safety and educational programs. Next year, the company is planning to start a five-year, $15.5-million economic development and educational initiative on top of its social investments, which totaled $5 million this year.
''Richmond kind of gets into your blood,'' said Andrea Bailey, Chevron's manager of community engagement in Richmond. ''There's so much going on, and there's this precipice of greatness. It's exciting.''
Many, though, remain skeptical. Chevron's community spending, they say, shares the same goal as its political contributions: buying support.
In November's election for three City Council seats, Chevron funneled $1.2 million into committees supporting three pro-Chevron candidates and opposing the company's two most vocal critics, including Mr. Butt. Two of the three Chevron-backed candidates won.
Mr. Butt did not face direct opposition from Chevron's committee but said he still harbored ''hard feelings'' about Chevron's political involvement.
''They want a City Council loyal to them,'' he said. ''I think it's wrong for a corporation to pour that kind of money into a local election. Nobody can match that.''
Nathaniel Bates, a longtime councilman strongly supported by Chevron in the recent election, said that the company's critics ''just want to use it for political purposes.''
Mr. Bates praised the company's increasing community spending. ''They're trying to be good neighbors,'' he said.
It is too soon to tell whether Chevron's new strategy of winning over Richmond will pay dividends. But in a recent tour of some locations where Chevron had focused its community spending, company officials sounded upbeat.
''I think we're making some headway in this community,'' said Mr. Comey, the spokesman.
Ms. Bailey, the manager of community engagement, added: ''It's interesting. After the fire, we've done some polls, and we still have a favorability with over 50 percent of the residents. That says a lot, especially after an incident like that.''

HEADLINE: Tax Deal Shows Possible Path Around House G.O.P. in Fiscal Fights to Come

BYLINE: By JONATHAN WEISMAN

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With the contentious 112th Congress coming to a close, the talks between the White House, Senate Republicans and Senate Democrats that secured a path around a looming fiscal crisis on Tuesday may point the way forward for President Obama as he tries to navigate his second term around House Republicans intent on blocking his agenda in the 113th.
For two years, the president has seen House Republican leaders as the key to legislative progress, and he has pursued direct talks with Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio and Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia, the majority leader. That avenue of negotiation proved fruitless, in large part because House Republicans were deeply divided about any compromise that Mr. Obama would accept. The failure led Mr. Boehner to tell his colleagues this week that he would not be engaging in any more one-on-one negotiations with the president. 
But negotiations over the fiscal impasse pointed to a new and unlikely path as more fiscal deadlines approach. In this case, Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader and a veteran legislative dealmaker, initiated negotiations with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., which instigated talks between them and the Senate majority leader, Harry Reid of Nevada. That produced sweeping tax legislation that averted large tax increases for most Americans and across-the-board spending cuts.
Then both Senate leaders worked hard to deliver the votes of a vast majority of their reluctant members, isolating House Republican leaders, who found themselves with no way forward other than to put the bill before the House and let Democrats push it over the finish line.
''I think this is the fourth time that we've seen this play out, where Boehner finally relents and lets the House consider a measure, and Democrats provide the votes to pass it,'' said Senator Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, the Senate's second-ranking Democrat. ''When they reach the point where their hand is forced, where there's no other place to turn, they'll do the right thing.''
That realization may lead to a more formalized process to begin bipartisan negotiations in the Senate to put pressure on the House. The deal that passed on Tuesday lifted the threat of tax increases that could have crippled the economy, but in other ways it compounded near-term fiscal threats. The government reached its statutory borrowing limit on Monday, giving Congress at best two to three months to raise the debt ceiling or risk a debilitating default on federal debt.
Around the same time, a two-month delay in the institution of across-the-board military and domestic spending cuts will lapse. Then, by the end of March, the current stopgap spending law financing the federal government will end, raising the specter of another government shutdown.
If House Republicans believe they can use those deadlines to extract concessions from the president on spending cuts, the White House may go elsewhere for a deal, Democrats say.
An official knowledgeable about the last negotiations said on Wednesday that the president would use such a strategy only if he was convinced that House Republican leaders would not or could not compromise. But in meeting with Senate Democrats on Monday and House Democrats on Tuesday, Mr. Biden labored to convince lawmakers that the White House had a way forward that would avoid last-minute theatrics and would not entail a stream of compromises on party principles, according to lawmakers who were there.
''One of the main concerns is, where do we go from here?'' said Representative Elijah E. Cummings, Democrat of Maryland, adding that Democrats feared that compromises on tax increases for the rich in the deal approved on Tuesday would lead to cuts in Social Security and Medicare in the next round of talks. ''He has a game plan for that.''
A senior Democrat said that game plan would start in the coming weeks, when Mr. Obama addresses his agenda in his State of the Union address and lays out his budget for the 2014 fiscal year, due in early February.
That opening bid should restart talks with Congress on an overarching agreement that would lock in deficit reduction through additional revenue, changes to entitlement programs and more spending cuts, to be worked out by the relevant committees in Congress. But this time, those talks might start in the Senate.
House Republican aides said the past few weeks were unique and not indicative of anything going forward. The president won re-election on a pledge to raise taxes on income over $250,000. His mandate does not extend beyond that, one aide said. Besides, officials in both parties warn, neither Mr. Reid nor Mr. McConnell will want to lead on the difficult issues now in view. Mr. Reid was reluctant, at best, about joining the Biden-McConnell talks.
And Mr. McConnell has made it clear that future deficit deals should be done through ''regular order'' -- Congressional committees, Senate and House debates and open negotiations, not private talks. Officials in both parties worry that as his 2014 re-election campaign gets closer, Mr. McConnell will be increasingly reluctant to have his fingerprints on deals with the president.
Even if a Senate route can be institutionalized, Mr. Durbin said he doubted that it would smooth the passage of bipartisan deals, given the difficulties Mr. Boehner has getting his troops in line. ''His anguish has a timetable. It goes through phases and places that I don't understand,'' Mr. Durbin said of the speaker. ''And I am afraid every scary chapter has to play out every step of the way before anything is resolved.''
Michael Steel, a spokesman for Mr. Boehner, said the last-minute crunch that produced the tax accord was necessary only because the Senate refused to act earlier. The House passed legislation months ago to extend all the expiring Bush-era tax cuts and to stop automatic military cuts by shifting them to domestic programs.

HEADLINE: Some Industries Retain Their Breaks

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Nearly $250 million for Hollywood. Over $330 million for the railroad industry. More than $220 million for rum producers. And $62 million for doing business in American Samoa.
While taxes are expected to increase for most Americans as a result of the deal between the White House and Congress to end the fiscal impasse in Washington, corporate America was more fortunate. A bevy of tax breaks and credits that had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 will be extended for another year, costing taxpayers $46.1 billion over the next decade, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation.
The preservation of these subsidies and deductions has become a perennial Washington ritual in recent years, with lobbyists and companies and their allies on Capitol Hill securing their survival in the fine print of the tax code. Washington's inability to close many of these loopholes is a sign of just how reluctant business is to sacrifice prized subsidies despite loud calls from many chief executives in recent months to raise taxes, cut spending and deal with huge budget deficits. 
''Except for the people who like it, it's a giveaway,'' said Eric Toder, co-director of the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. ''It's hard to mobilize opposition, but the people who benefit from it benefit a lot.''
Many of the provisions survive because they are so obscure. A $62 million tax credit for employers in American Samoa benefits StarKist, which is the largest private employer in the South Pacific island chain, with nearly 2,000 workers there. The tax break was supported by Jeff Bingaman, Democrat of New Mexico, who as former chairman of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee was an advocate for American territories that lack formal Senate representation.
''We support the development credit, and it's a key factor in our ability to maintain competitive operations in American Samoa,'' said Mary Sestric, a spokeswoman for StarKist. ''This is a big priority for us.''
Corporations were keenly sensitive to changes in broader tax policy, in addition to benefiting from direct tax breaks. For example, Goldman Sachs distributed $65 million in stock to 10 senior executives in December instead of January, when the firm typically makes such awards. That move helped them avoid the higher tax rates that will now be imposed on income of $400,000 or more.
The chief executive of Goldman, Lloyd C. Blankfein, was among the most prominent corporate executives who backed higher taxes as part of a broader deficit-reduction package. He and other business leaders also met with President Obama late last year as the White House sought support from corporate America during negotiations with Republicans in Congress.
Some subsidies, like a break for research by companies, can actually have long-term benefits for the economy, defenders argue.
Others, like the one that allows filmmakers to deduct the first $15 million in production expenses for movies made in the United States, are much more narrowly focused but have loyal supporters that manage to keep them alive year after year. Another beneficiary of Congressional largess is Nascar, which will enjoy a $78 million subsidy for racetrack construction over the next 10 years.
''Once they get in, they tend to stay in,'' said Alan Auerbach, director of the Robert D. Burch Center for Tax Policy and Public Finance at the University of California, Berkeley.
Besides the $46.1 billion in corporate incentives over the next 10 years, there is another $18.1 billion in breaks for alternative energy, much of that going to companies as well. Producers of biodiesel, for example, will reap more than $2 billion in tax breaks. And while it may not exactly be an alternative source of energy, producers of coal on Indian lands retained $1 million in tax breaks -- a provision backed by Max Baucus, the Montana Democrat who is chairman of the Finance Committee.
The wind industry, a chief beneficiary of support from Washington, will get $12 billion in subsidies over the next decade. In fact, the benefits that were included for the wind sector are slightly broader now than in previous years.
Under the new rules, contained in the legislation that Mr. Obama signed on Wednesday, new wind farms will be covered by a production tax credit or an investment tax credit similar to the ones that just expired, but the projects will not need to be finished by the end of this year to qualify; they simply must have been started in 2013.
The American Wind Energy Association, a trade group, said in an e-mail to its members that the change was made by Congress ''specifically in order to accommodate the business timelines of our industry.'' The business has been in a tax-driven boom-and-bust cycle.
The renewal of the tax benefits was pushed strongly by Mr. Bingaman, Mr. Baucus and Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa. When the Senate began considering ''tax extenders,'' or continuations of various tax breaks, wind advocates pushed to have all of them included.
''There always seemed to be some bipartisan support for this,'' said Philip D. Tingle, a lawyer who specializes in energy taxes. ''The element, the issue was, how they were going to pay for it.'' The renewal will probably cost the Treasury about $12 billion, although the wind industry insists that it will generate so much taxable activity that total tax revenue, including those at the state and local level, will exceed the tax expenditure.
The industry undertook a large lobbying campaign and says it generated more than 750,000 letters, e-mails and other communications with Congress. It took nearly 100 members of Congress on tours of wind farms and factories where components are built. The issue may be more regional than partisan; according to the American Wind Energy Association, 80 percent of wind farms are in Congressional districts represented by Republicans, as are 67 percent of the factories.
The tax credits were also extended to cover electricity made from biomass, tides and ocean waves, landfill methane and improvements to hydroelectric stations.

HEADLINE: U.S. Manufacturing Increased Slightly in December

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- American manufacturing grew slightly last month and factory hiring increased. The modest gains suggested that the economy entered the new year with some momentum. 
The Institute for Supply Management, a trade group for purchasing managers, said on Wednesday that its index of manufacturing activity rose in December to 50.7. That is up from a reading of 49.5 in November, which was the lowest reading since July 2009, one month after the recession ended.
A reading above 50 indicates growth, while a reading below signals contraction.
A measure of employment increased last month to 52.7. That is up from 48.4 in November, which was the first time the employment gauge fell below 50 in three years.
Factories have cut jobs in three of the four months through November, according to government data. The increase in employment in the I.S.M. survey suggests manufacturers may have stepped up hiring last month.
The Labor Department is scheduled to report on December employment on Friday.
A gauge of new orders was unchanged and production grew more slowly, the survey found. Manufacturers also cut back on stockpiles, a sign of concern about future demand.
The closely watched manufacturing survey was completed before Congress reached a deal to avoid the impending expiration of Bush era tax cuts.
The last-minute deal passed Tuesday averts widespread tax increases and delays deep spending cuts that had threatened to push the country back into recession. But most Americans will see some increase in taxes this year, which will most likely slow consumer spending.
A gauge of export orders rose above 50 for the first time in six months, according to the I.S.M. survey. That is a hopeful sign that overseas economies are improving, raising demand for American goods.
A survey in China on Monday found manufacturing activity in that country expanded for the third consecutive month. That adds to evidence that its economy is improving after a slowdown last year.
Growth in the American economy is being driven by other sectors, like housing. The Commerce Department reported Wednesday that construction companies spent more on home building in November, rising 0.4 percent for its eighth monthly increase.
Overall construction spending, however, slipped 0.3 percent because of a 5.5 percent drop in spending on federal government projects. Spending on commercial buildings, like office buildings and shopping malls, also fell. This was the first decline in overall construction spending since March and followed a 0.7 percent increase in October, which was revised lower.
There have been some positive signs for factory production. In November, companies substantially increased their orders for a category of large equipment that reflects their investment plans. That followed a big increase in the same category in October.

HEADLINE: Wide Relief as Tax Uncertainty Is Lifted

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Even though Congress's last-minute deal means higher taxes for almost all Americans, businesses and consumers are relieved that some of the uncertainty about what they will owe the government this year is gone.
''Once something gets settled, even if it's not the most popular settlement option, it still gives you a sense of what the rules are and what you need to do to readjust,'' said Sam Ramey, the owner of Sultan Mediterranean Cafe in North Andover, Mass., who says he hopes the deal will bolster the spirits of his customers.
''It's not that you say 'Today I'm not buying a sandwich because of all the uncertainty,' but if you don't feel that ease of mind that lets you go out and buy a sandwich, you don't go out and buy a sandwich,'' he said. 
Congress's compromise on taxes eliminates some uncertainty. But there's no getting around the outcome that it will also reduce how much consumers have available to spend on dining out and other discretionary expenses.
Altogether, the end of the payroll tax holiday, the income tax increase on the wealthiest Americans and other provisions will probably shave 0.7 to 1.5 percentage points off economic growth in 2013, estimate many economists. They are forecasting growth in output this year of just over 2 percent, almost identical to that of 2012.
The housing rebound, the natural gas boom, looser credit for small businesses, pent-up demand for new cars and other encouraging trends will be tempered by the fiscal tightening, though not nearly as much as if taxes had risen as they were scheduled to do without a deal.
''We've definitely averted the worst-case recession scenario,'' said Jay Feldman, an economist at Credit Suisse. ''We're still looking at some fiscal drag, but it's an amount the economy can absorb.''
The tax deal is also expected to result in hiring growth at last year's pace, meaning the creation of 150,000 to 160,000 payroll jobs a month, according to Michael Gapen, senior United States economist and asset allocation strategist at Barclays.
Without the tax increases, employers would probably be adding more than 200,000 jobs a month.
Altogether, that means the economy will ''create 600,000 fewer jobs in 2013 -- leaving the unemployment rate 0.4 percentage point higher -- than it would have if the 2012 tax policies had been kept in place,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics.
Congress's tax deal will be felt most keenly in the beginning of the year, since workers around the country immediately have to start paying an additional 2 percent in taxes on their wages and salaries as a result of the end of the temporary payroll tax holiday.
''That may surprise a lot of people as Christmas shopping bills come due and they find they have less in their paychecks,'' said Mr. Feldman.
Most analysts' estimates for the fiscal bargain's effects on the economy do not take into account remaining negotiations over major spending cuts and an increase in the debt ceiling. Congress seems unlikely to resolve either of these issues until March.
''Only part of the poison pill that gave us the fiscal cliff has been addressed,'' said Bernard Baumohl, chief global economist at the Economic Outlook Group. ''What Congress did in the last 48 hours is effectively strap on a bungee cord to the economy. That is, we fell off the cliff briefly on Jan. 1, then bounced back safely onto the cliff after both houses passed tax accord.''
Congress decided to pause for two months on the $110 billion in mandated spending cuts set to take effect in 2013. These cuts would be evenly divided between defense and nondefense federal spending, and military contractors and other companies that rely heavily on federal money are expected to pull back some in the coming months, said Michael Feroli, the chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.
It remains unclear how much of these cuts will materialize when Congress is done haggling. Neither the Republicans nor the Democrats want them to take effect in full, a result that would shave around a half to a full percentage point off output growth this year.
The across-the-board reductions may be swapped out at least in part for other, unknown kinds of spending cuts or tax increases, which has left some Americans concerned about whether they might be in the cross hairs themselves.
Republicans have been pushing for a new formula that would curb Social Security benefits, for example.
''Hopefully Congress has at least some compassion left buried in their minds and hearts and will step up to the plate and make sure our benefits aren't cut,'' said Terry Grigg, 63, of San Diego. His only income is about $12,000 from Social Security and disability benefits while he undergoes treatments for invasive skin cancer and a hernia. ''That would really be a slap in the face to the common man, to seniors, to vets.''
Medicare would be the primary target for cuts if Congress wanted to address the country's long-term debt problems, many economists say. So far, though, most politicians have been reluctant to do so.
''From a political standpoint we've got this tax deal done,'' said Steve Blitz, director and chief economist at ITG Investment Research. ''Then we need to get this debt ceiling and spending piece done. And I think if we can get the second piece done, however minimal it ends up being, that allows the process to begin a serious discussion on the obvious: medical costs.''

HEADLINE: The Next Chernobyl?

BYLINE: By KHOSROW B. SEMNANI and GARY M. SANDQUIST

 BODY:
SALT LAKE CITY, UTAH -- The showdown over Iran's nuclear program is likely to accelerate in 2013 as sanctions tighten, Israel threatens military strikes, and the centrifuges keep spinning. While most attention will be focused on the two most oft-discussed sites of uranium enrichment -- Natanz and Fordow -- a third site on the gulf could prove to be this year's most dangerous nuclear wild card.
Tucked between two sleepy coastal fishing villages, the Bushehr nuclear power plant has long been seen as the ''acceptable'' face of Iran's nuclear program. Built by Russian engineers and monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency, it is already producing electricity, and most nuclear experts agree that it does not merit the same level of concern over weaponization as Iran's other nuclear sites. 
Bushehr, however, could turn out to be the most dangerous piece of Iran's nuclear puzzle for another reason: haphazard planning and ongoing technical problems mean it could be the next Chernobyl, igniting a humanitarian disaster and explosive economic damage across the oil-rich region.
Technical problems in the past 12 months have raised serious concerns about Iran's capacity to competently operate the facility. The plant was shut down in October to limit potential damage following the discovery of stray bolts found beneath its fuel cells, the Reuters news agency reported, citing a Russian industry source. Western officials expressed concern about the plant after an I.A.E.A report in November stated that Iran had informed the agency about unexpected fuel transfers. Last week, the emir of Kuwait, Sheik Sabah al-Ahmad al-Sabah, called upon Tehran to work more closely with the I.A.E.A. ''to ensure the safety of the region's state and its people.''
Meanwhile, Russian scientists have delayed the transfer of operations to their Iranian counterparts. That is now expected to occur in March.
Also troubling is the fact that Bushehr sits on an active fault line, raising the risks of a Fukushima-type catastrophe. Unless action is taken, the likelihood of an accident is far too high for the international community to ignore.
A Chernobyl-type nuclear meltdown in Bushehr would not only inflict severe damage in southern Iran, but also in the six oil and gas-rich Gulf Cooperation Council countries of Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Indeed, the capitals of those states are closer to Bushehr than Tehran. Nuclear radiation in the air and water would disrupt the Strait of Hormuz shipping, the world's most important oil choke point. Oil prices would skyrocket. The world economy would face a hurricane.
With prevailing winds blowing from east to west in the gulf, and coastal currents that circle counterclockwise, radiation fallout would contaminate oil fields and desalination plants that provide fresh water for local inhabitants. This would be an unmitigated disaster for the gulf states that rely on desalination plants for water, and would also threaten the U.S. Navy's Fifth Fleet, stationed in Bahrain.
We cannot ignore this simmering problem. While all eyes are fixated on Iran's other key nuclear sites -- Fordow and Natanz -- Bushehr requires more attention. The I.A.E.A. should promptly initiate a comprehensive assessment of the safety vulnerabilities at the Bushehr nuclear power plant. Both the Chernobyl disaster in 1986 and the Fukushima accident in 2011 reinforce the reality that the unexpected can occur at nuclear power plants. These events also reinforce the importance of having an integrated emergency response capability in place at local, national and regional levels.
The history of Bushehr is troubling. Begun in 1975 with German engineers, halted after the 1979 revolution, and restarted with the assistance of the Russian Atomic Energy Agency, known as Rosatom, it has been plagued with delays and technical problems from the beginning.
In August of 2010, after several years of delay, the plant became officially operational when fuel rods were transported to the reactor. After no more than six months of operation, the reactor had to be shut down due to problems with the cooling system, which were blamed on German-made components. According to Gholamreza Aghazadeh, the former head of Iran's Atomic Energy Organization, the problems were design anomalies. He stated that 24 percent of the parts and equipment used at the Bushehr plant are German, 36 percent Iranian and 40 percent Russian.
This is not how you make a safe nuclear power plant.
Moreover, there are serious questions about the Iranian regime's capability to respond to a major nuclear disaster. Iran simply lacks the civil preparedness capabilities to respond to a tragedy on the scale of Chernobyl or Fukushima.
Iran is the only country operating a nuclear power plant that hasn't signed the 1994 Convention on Nuclear Safety. The international community should push Iran to sign the treaty with the same vigor that it pushes Iran to disclose information about its suspected weapons sites. Even countries like Israel, India and Pakistan -- none of which have signed the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty -- have signed the Convention on Nuclear Safety.
Treaties are important, of course, but they are not enough. Iran's neighbors should work with the United States and other major powers on rapid response efforts to mitigate a potential disaster. The United Nations should form a Bushehr committee to study problems at the plant and offer technical assistance to minimize the risk of an accident. Moreover, it should design its own emergency response strategy to deal with a possible nuclear accident at Bushehr.
The I.A.E.A. should focus on the safety of the Bushehr plant with the same eye for detail that it uses to detect any weaponization program. Hundreds of thousands of lives depend on it, as do world oil markets, the global economy, and the world's collective security.

HEADLINE: Singapore Dodges an Expected Recession

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
SINGAPORE -- Singapore's economy grew in the past three months of 2012, avoiding an expected recession as services put in a strong showing and gross domestic product figures for the first three quarters of the year were revised downwards, data released Wednesday showed. 
Singapore, whose trade is equal to about three times its G.D.P., has been badly hit by the weakness in Western economies, which has crimped demand for many of its exports. The city-state's electronic manufacturers have also failed to tap surging demand for smartphones, unlike rivals in South Korea and Taiwan.
But while manufacturing contracted faster in the fourth quarter than in the third quarter, services rebounded, growing 7 percent in the fourth quarter at a seasonally adjusted and annualized rate. The sector had contracted 3.9 percent in the third quarter.
''The momentum in service sector activity is, of course, not spectacular, but there are at least traces of evidence that conditions are gradually improving,'' said Leif Eskesen, HSBC's chief economist for India and Southeast Asia.
Singapore's G.D.P. expanded an annualized 1.8 percent in the fourth quarter from the third quarter after seasonal adjustments, advanced estimates from the Ministry of Trade and Industry showed Wednesday, reversing a 6.3 percent contraction in the July-September period.
Compared with a year earlier, Singapore grew 1.1 percent in the fourth quarter, bringing growth for 2012 to 1.2 percent, down from 4.9 percent in 2011. In November, the government had predicted growth of about 1.5 percent.
The surprise growth in G.D.P. during the fourth quarter was primarily the result of downward revisions to data for the first nine months of 2012.
Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong said in his New Year's address that the city-state's economy had been dampened by weakness in the United States, Europe and Japan.
''But some industries have also had difficulty hiring the workers they need to grow,'' he added. Singapore has been making it harder for companies to employ low-cost workers from abroad, under pressure from an increasingly assertive electorate that has blamed increasing numbers of foreigners over the past decade for soaring property prices, stagnant wages and increasingly crowded trains and buses.
Most economists had forecast that Singapore's economy would contract in the fourth quarter, sinking into recession like that of Japan, but their estimates were based on earlier numbers.
According to the advance G.D.P. numbers, Singapore's manufacturing sector shrank 10.8 percent sequentially in the fourth quarter on an annualized and seasonally adjusted basis, worsening from the 9.9 percent contraction in the third quarter.
The ministry said the recovery in services was helped by a rebound in wholesale and retail trade and finance and insurance.
Manufacturing contributes to a quarter of Singapore's G.D.P. while services account for about two-thirds of economic activity.
''In the near term, it's hard to see any improvement in manufacturing,'' said Selena Ling, head of treasury research at Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp. ''Hopefully, services can continue to provide a lift going forward.''

HEADLINE: Cheap Meth! Cheap Guns! Click Here.

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
BEIJING
Want to buy illegal drugs in China? No problem -- just go to the wild and woolly Internet here and order a $50 or $100 package of methamphetamines, ecstasy or cocaine. It'll be delivered to your door within hours!
''Our company has delivery stations in every part of China,'' boasts one Chinese-language Web site, with photos of illegal narcotics it sells. ''We offer 24-hour delivery service to your door, and we have long-term and consistent supplies. If you just make one phone call, we'll deliver to your hands in one to five hours.'' 
Another Chinese Web site offers meth wholesale for $19,700 a kilo, or deliveries to your door of smaller quantities in hundreds of cities around China. Even in remote Anhui Province, it delivers drugs in 21 different cities.
All this is completely illegal in China, where narcotics traffickers are routinely executed. But it doesn't seem to be a top government priority, because these Web sites aren't even closed down or blocked. Tens of thousands of censors delete references to human rights, but they ignore countless Chinese Web sites peddling drugs, guns or prostitutes.
Doesn't it seem odd that China blocks Facebook, YouTube and The New York Times but shrugs at, say, guns?
Chinese law tightly restricts gun ownership, but it takes just a few minutes of Chinese-language searching on the Internet to find commercial sites selling, say, an illegal Springfield XD-9 9 millimeter handgun for $1,120. Or a Type 54 semiautomatic Chinese military handgun for $640, or rifles or many more. And that's not all.
''For prices of silencers, contact our customer service department,'' the Web site advises.
(American gun enthusiasts often argue that we need firearms to protect ourselves from government. But the situation in China suggests that what autocrats actually fear isn't so much people with guns as citizens armed with information and social media accounts.)
In fairness, China is far more sane than the United States about firearms. At least the Chinese authorities don't tolerate gun stores openly selling assault rifles and high-capacity magazines. I invite Chinese journalists to write about the fecklessness of American politicians who make no serious effort to reduce the toll of guns in the United States.
If your interests run in more prurient directions, the Internet here is also chockablock with sex and prostitution. GHB, better known as the date-rape drug, is widely sold with chilling descriptions.
''If she drinks this, she'll be yours,'' promises one Internet seller, describing it as ''obedience liquid.'' Another says: ''Only two pills will send her into a deep sleep, so that however you move her she won't wake up. Afterward, she'll have no memory.''
The upshot is that most Chinese won't be able to access this column, but can easily go to the Web to purchase firearms or narcotics.
From afar, Westerners sometimes perceive China as rigidly controlled, but up close it sometimes seems the opposite. There are rules, but often they are loosely enforced, or negotiable.
Yet the authorities choose priority areas where they do keep the pressure on, and one is curbing information that might cause political instability. So the authorities block mainstream social media Web sites and, lately, The New York Times and Bloomberg, after reports about family members of Chinese leaders becoming fabulously wealthy.
It's a tribute to China's stunning economic development that the country now has some 540 million Internet users, more than any other country. It's sad to see current leaders reverting to a tighter vision of the Internet. ''How can we develop our skills,'' one Chinese friend asked me rhetorically, ''if we can't even visit some of the most popular Web sites around the world?''
Many Chinese vault over the Great Firewall of China to get to banned sites with a virtual private network or VPN. But, in the last month China, has rolled out new software that interferes with VPNs, even ones used by American corporations to access their internal networks. The government is also trying to crack down on Sina Weibo, the Chinese version of Twitter, by making users register with their real names.
These Internet crackdowns annoy many young Chinese, who may not think much about multiparty democracy but do want to be able to see YouTube videos.
My hope is that the new Chinese leader, Xi Jinping, will recognize that China's economic competitiveness and ability to fight corruption depend upon openness. Deng Xiaoping used to compare reform to opening a window, admitting a few flies along with fresh air. During Deng's watch, China embraced potentially troublesome communications technologies -- photocopiers, cellphones, fax machines -- because they are also indispensable to modernization. So is a free Web.
So to the new Politburo, a suggestion: How about cracking down on Web sites that sell guns and drugs, while leaving alone those that traffic in ideas and information?

HEADLINE: Big Gains on Wall Street After the Fiscal Deal

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Wall Street cheered an agreement that ended the fiscal impasse in Washington, sending the Standard & Poor's 500 to its biggest gains in more than a year on Wednesday.
After being restrained for much of the last three months by the political squabbling over an array of tax increases and spending cuts known as the fiscal cliff, investors demonstrated their new willingness to take risks in a broad array of financial markets around the world.
Shares in more speculative investments rose much faster than blue chips, sending the Russell 2000 index of smaller companies up 2.8 percent to 873.42, its highest level ever. The benchmark S.& P. 500-stock index rose 2.5 percent, or 36.23 points, to 1,462.42. One more day of the same magnitude will bring the index to its highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. 
''You've just removed a huge worry from the market,'' said Jonathan Lewis, the chief investment officer at Samson Capital Advisors. ''We've been in a never-never land where markets have not been able to take their attention off Washington.''
Congress signed off on the deal late Tuesday night, and it immediately sent stocks soaring first in Asia and then in Europe. Leading indexes rose 2.6 percent in France, 2.2 percent in Germany and 2.9 percent in Hong Kong. Markets in Japan and mainland China were closed for holidays.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 2.4 percent, or 308.41 points, to 13,412.55. The Nasdaq composite index increased by 3.1 percent, or 92.75 points, to 3,112.26.
Only 31 stocks in the S.& P. 500 dropped on Wednesday. Technology and financial stocks did particularly well, as did stocks that offer generous dividends. The agreement on Tuesday raised the tax rate on dividends to 20 percent from 15 percent, less than President Obama had proposed.
In the United States, share prices gained most in the first 30 minutes of the day and then plateaued before a brief spike just before trading closed.
Many market strategists were worried that Wednesday's rally would not last long because of the questions that were not addressed by the fiscal accord. While the deal provides a long-term settlement on tax rates, it delayed for only two months $110 billion of spending cuts that were supposed to start on Jan. 1. Congress also put off a decision about limits on government borrowing, known as the debt ceiling.
The Treasury Department has said that the government hit the ceiling at the end of 2012 and it will be able to finance the budget only by using extraordinary measures until March. Republican leaders in the House of Representatives have said they will raise the borrowing limit only if Democrats agree to more spending cuts.
That debate may well be more fractious than what has taken place in recent weeks, analysts said.
Leon LeBrecque, the founder of the asset management firm LJPR, said that Wednesday's rally would not last long as investors turned their attention to the unanswered questions.
''We're in a three-act play, but we're only through with Act 1,'' said Mr. LeBrecque. ''Everyone is happy about the first act. The real question is what happens next.''
The last time the government reached its borrowing limit, in 2011, Congress approved an increase at the last minute. This led Standard & Poor's ratings services to strip the United States of its triple-A credit rating. There is widespread concern that one of the other two major credit ratings agencies will lower their rating of American government debt in the coming months.
On Wednesday, Moody's Investors Service said that the fiscal pact did not help the nation's debt and deficit problems and ''will likely be a constraint on growth in coming quarters.'' It said the looming negotiations over spending cuts and lifting the debt ceiling add ''uncertainty to the outcome of negotiations.''
''The debt trajectory resulting from this process is likely to determine whether the Aaa rating is returned to a stable outlook or downgraded'' by one notch to Aa1, the Moody's report said.
But there is hope in some quarters of Wall Street that with each new crisis, and each last-minute fix, the risks to the markets grow less severe as investors become convinced that politicians eventually find solutions to their disagreements. Michael Purves, the chief global strategist for Weeden & Company, compared the debates in Washington to horror movies: ''Once you see the first movie, the sequels are never as scary.''
He said that at least for the near term, the resolution in Washington should allow investors to focus on the growing signs of improvements in the American economy.
The Institute for Supply Management said on Wednesday that manufacturing in the United States expanded slightly in December. Its manufacturing activity index rose to 50.7 points in December, up from 49.5 in November. Even more important data will come on Friday, when the monthly jobs report is released.
In the bond market, investors sold off the longer-dated Treasuries that have been used as safe havens in recent years. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note fell 22/32, to 98 4/32, while its yield rose to 1.84 percent, from 1.76 percent late Monday.

HEADLINE: For Obama, A Victory That Also Holds Risks

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT; Jonathan Weisman contributed reporting.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The deal significantly raises taxes on the rich, with no expiration date. It extends tax credits for the poor and the middle class. It provides more jobless benefits. Largely overlooked, it extends an alternative-energy tax credit that has helped create a clean-energy boom.
And it includes almost no spending cuts.
For President Obama and his Democratic allies in Congress, the fiscal deal reached this week is full of small victories that further their largest policy aims. Above all, it takes another step toward Mr. Obama's goal of orienting federal policy more toward the middle class and the poor, at the expense of the rich. 
Yet the deal, which the Senate and the House have passed and Mr. Obama is expected to sign soon, also represents a substantial risk for the president.
Throughout the negotiations of the last two months, Mr. Obama pushed for a larger agreement, one that would have canceled other looming budget deadlines, starting with one on the debt ceiling. He and his aides saw the so-called fiscal cliff, with its trillions of dollars in scheduled tax increases that Republicans abhorred, as leverage to start fresh in a second term and avoid more deadline-driven partisan fights.
''I want a big deal. I want a comprehensive deal,'' Mr. Obama said almost two months ago, at his first post-election news conference. ''I want to see if we can, you know, at least for the foreseeable future provide certainty to businesses and the American people.''
When House Republicans made it clear that they opposed a big deal, however, Mr. Obama decided to take the smaller deal, bank a series of victories and wait to fight another day. The alternative -- debated inside the White House, but not ultimately a close call -- would have been to go over the cliff in the hope of forcing Republicans into a larger deal.
Without that larger agreement, Mr. Obama will be left to find solutions to future budget deadlines without the leverage that came with the prospect of automatic tax increases.
''The best world would have been a bigger agreement,'' an administration official acknowledged. ''This is a big win in a second-best world.''
Perhaps the best prism through which to see the Democrats' gains is inequality. In the 2008 campaign, Mr. Obama said that his top priority as president would be to ''create bottom-up economic growth'' and reduce inequality.
He has governed as such. In the 2009 stimulus, he insisted on making tax credits ''fully refundable,'' so that even people who did not make enough to pay much federal tax would benefit. The 2010 health care law overhaul was probably the biggest attack on inequality since it began rising in the 1970s, increasing taxes on businesses and the rich to pay for health insurance largely for the middle class.
As part of this week's deal, Mr. Obama did make several major compromises. He accepted much less in overall tax revenue than the government would have received absent any deal. He allowed a payroll-tax cut, which applied to most households, to expire. And he yielded both on aspects of the estate tax and on the level at which the top marginal income-tax rate would start, moving it to $450,000 for couples, from $250,000.
Still, using inequality as a yardstick, he won much of what he had wanted. By holding firm to a top rate of 39.6 percent -- up from 35 percent -- he locked in a substantial tax increase for the very richest, who have received the biggest pretax raises in recent years.
On average, the top 0.1 percent of earners -- whose incomes start at $2.7 million and go much higher -- will pay $444,000 more in taxes in 2013 than they otherwise would have, according to the Tax Policy Center. The increases stem from both the fiscal deal and the new taxes in the health care law.
In effect, the deal preserves the ''compassionate conservative'' part of President George W. Bush's tax agenda -- reducing federal income taxes on the working poor, sometimes to zero -- while limiting the parts that most helped the affluent.
Even one of the chief architects of the Bush tax cuts, R. Glenn Hubbard, now dean of Columbia Business School, did not celebrate the enshrinement of most of them. He said in an interview that the deal would amplify the tax code's distortions on the economy.
Former President Bill Clinton, by contrast, has told people that he considers the deal a good one, according to two people who have spoken to him.
Beyond income tax code, the deal continued jobless benefits for two million long-term unemployed who otherwise would have lost them immediately. And it extended, for one year, an energy tax credit that has reduced alternative-energy costs and increased use.
The question that hangs over the deal for Democrats is whether they will have to play defense on the budget for the rest of Mr. Obama's presidency.
When Republicans stepped back from a larger deal last month, one that would have resolved the debt ceiling, Mr. Obama faced a choice. He could have worked toward a smaller deal, as he did, or insisted that the debt ceiling had to be part of any package.
White House officials took the path they did because they feared that a hardened stance on the debt ceiling would result in no deal at all: taxes would have risen on nearly everyone; automatic spending cuts would have begun; jobless benefits would have ended for many; and markets may have reacted badly.
In the chaos that could have followed, the officials believed, a grand bargain would have been unlikely. If anything, Democrats -- worried they would be blamed for the economy's troubles, as the party holding the White House -- might have struggled to get a deal as good as this week's. Having won this round, Democrats still have compromises to offer Republicans in the next one, like changes to Social Security.
But some of Mr. Obama's allies wonder if he should have taken the risk of a confrontation now. A stalemate next time will bring no threat of higher taxes, and Republicans may stand firmer, demanding cuts that undo Mr. Obama's recent gains.
''I now fear that we are heading toward a crisis that can dwarf what we've just been through,'' said Robert Greenstein, president of the liberal-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. ''We really won't know how best to view the deal, and how well the White House has done, until the debt limit is done.''
The wait for a fuller answer will not last too long: The federal government is on pace to need a higher debt limit by March.

HEADLINE: Governor Sues Over Penalties To Penn State

BYLINE: By STEVE EDER

 BODY:
Perhaps no Pennsylvania public official has been more involved with the Penn State child sexual abuse scandal than Gov. Tom Corbett.
In 2009, when he was the state's attorney general, Corbett began an investigation into allegations that the former assistant football coach Jerry Sandusky had abused young boys. Later, as governor, Corbett took a seat on Penn State's board of trustees, serving in that post as his former office brought charges against Sandusky and three top university officials, and as the N.C.A.A. levied severe penalties against the university and its football program.
Now, Corbett has sued the N.C.A.A. on behalf of the people of Pennsylvania, alleging that it was ''overreaching and unlawful'' in how it punished the university, and that it broke antitrust laws and harmed residents in the process.
''These sanctions did not punish Sandusky, nor did they punish the others who have been criminally charged,'' Corbett said Wednesday at a news conference in State College, Pa. ''Rather, they punished the past, the present, the local businesses and the citizens of Pennsylvania.'' 
The lawsuit, a straightforward challenge to the N.C.A.A.'s authority, asks a federal court to throw out all of the penalties against Penn State's football program, including a $60 million fine, the vacating of a decade's worth of victories, and a four-year ban on postseason play. However, some legal experts, including ones who have litigated against the N.C.A.A. on antitrust matters, said the governor would probably face difficulty in building a successful case, considering that the university accepted the penalties when they were announced in July.
Penn State is not a party to the lawsuit. It said Wednesday that it planned to continue to comply with the N.C.A.A.'s punishment, which began this season. The team finished 8-4 but was not eligible to play in a bowl game.
''The school has agreed to be bound by the N.C.A.A. rules; the school has accepted this penalty,'' said Steve Berman, a Seattle-based lawyer who has sued the N.C.A.A. in matters unrelated to the Sandusky case. ''Outsiders are going to have a tough time claiming they have standing to challenge what is going on.''
Another lawyer who has litigated against the N.C.A.A., Stephen Morrissey, said there could be potential weaknesses in Corbett's assertion that he brought the case on behalf of aggrieved businesses and residents. Such legal theory, he said, is typically applied in cases in which consumers are hurt financially.
''The harm to consumers here, I guess, is that they don't get to watch Penn State football play in bowl games they might have qualified for,'' Morrissey said.
More than two decades ago, courts rejected a similar lawsuit by supporters of Southern Methodist after the N.C.A.A. shut down the university's football team -- delivering the so-called death penalty -- when it was found that players had been paid from a slush fund.
But in the case of Penn State, Corbett said, the N.C.A.A. violated its own bylaws and forced university officials to accept the punishments under the threat of worse consequences as they were reeling from the public shame of the Sandusky scandal.
Sandusky, a former top assistant to the longtime coach Joe Paterno, is serving 30 to 60 years in prison after being found guilty in June of 45 counts of abuse. Three university officials, including the former president Graham B. Spanier, have been criminally charged with taking steps to cover up his misconduct and are facing trials.
In the 43-page lawsuit filed in the Middle District of Pennsylvania, Corbett described the N.C.A.A. as an embattled organization, facing criticism for not being tough enough on universities with elite athletic programs when it came to compliance matters.
The suit said that the N.C.A.A.'s president, Mark Emmert, saw the ''indictment of a despicable child predator'' as ''the opportunity he needed to signal emphatically that the N.C.A.A. -- his N.C.A.A. -- would never again be regarded as soft on disciplining its member institutions.''
The lawsuit alleged that the N.C.A.A. violated antitrust laws, saying Emmert and the organization ''exercised their power through a never-before-used process, one specifically designed to cripple a member institution's football program.'' The lawsuit said that N.C.A.A. leaders, rather than traditional investigators, imposed the penalties, putting aside rules and asserting unusual authority in punishing the university.
''While what occurred at Penn State was both criminal and heinous, it is unclear, at best, that the conduct violated any of the rules as written in the N.C.A.A.'s voluminous rulebook and policed by its enforcement staff,'' the lawsuit said.
When imposing its punishment of Penn State, the N.C.A.A. relied largely on an investigation by Louis J. Freeh, a former F.B.I. director, that had been commissioned by the university. The investigation found that top university officials had shown a disregard for the welfare of children and actively concealed Sandusky's assaults because they feared that the publicity would hurt the football program.
In the lawsuit, Corbett called the Penn State football program ''an important economic engine supporting Pennsylvanians across the Commonwealth,'' saying that the program earned more than $50 million a year. He said the N.C.A.A.'s actions hurt Pennsylvanians who depended on the football program for their livelihood, while also dampening ticket sales, diminishing state revenue and harming ''current Penn State students, in the form of diminution of the Penn State educational and community experience to which they and their families made a significant and long-term financial commitment, relying in part on the prominence of the Penn State football program.''
The N.C.A.A. said in a statement that it was ''disappointed'' by the lawsuit and called it a ''setback to the university's efforts'' after the scandal.
''Not only does this forthcoming lawsuit appear to be without merit, it is an affront to all of the victims in this tragedy -- lives that were destroyed by the criminal actions of Jerry Sandusky,'' Donald Remy, the organization's general counsel, said. ''While the innocence that was stolen can never be restored, Penn State has accepted the consequences for its role and the role of its employees and is moving forward.''
Corbett, a Republican, had faced criticism from some who said he did not move quickly enough with the initial investigation into the allegations against Sandusky because of concerns about alienating Penn State alumni as he ran for governor. He is up for re-election next year. During her recent campaign, Kathleen Kane, the state's incoming Democratic attorney general, said she would investigate Corbett's handling of the case.
If Pennsylvania's case gains traction, it could potentially undermine the N.C.A.A.'s handling of enforcement issues with other universities.
''The N.C.A.A.'s authority comes in large part from its membership,'' said Tyrone Thomas, a Washington lawyer who advises universities in N.C.A.A. compliance matters. ''These institutions are agreeing by their membership and signing off on this. You'd now have a third party involved.''
That, he said, ''could change how the dynamic works.''

HEADLINE: Debt Ceiling Doubt and Its Costs

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - Even as President Obama prepares to sign the hard-won tax deal that Congress passed Tuesday, another manufactured deadline with a colorful name is threatening to hamstring the government and undermine the economy.
Goodbye, fiscal cliff. Hello, debt ceiling.
The federal government has exhausted its legal authority to borrow money, and in about two months it will no longer have enough cash to meet all of its obligations, the Treasury Department said Monday. 
Congress could vote to let the government borrow more, as it has done 11 times since 2001, most recently in August 2011. But some Congressional Republicans say they are willing to do so only as part of an agreement to reduce federal spending, while Mr. Obama said Tuesday that he would not accept any conditions, even as he warned of disastrous consequences.
"We can't not pay bills that we've already incurred," Mr. Obama said. "If Congress refuses to give the United States government the ability to pay these bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy would be catastrophic - far worse than the impact of a fiscal cliff."
While it remains difficult to imagine that the federal government would default on its obligations, doubts may grow as the deadline approaches, and the cost of that uncertainty could be significant. The belief that lending money to the United States government is virtually risk-free is a basic tenet of the global financial system. The risks of other investments are measured by comparison, and priced accordingly.
Doubts also could cost the government directly. The scale of federal borrowing means that even small increases in the interest rates that the government pays to investors add billions to the federal debt. The slightly higher rates on debt issued during the last debt ceiling standoff, in 2011, will cost taxpayers about $18.9 billion in additional interest payments, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center.
"Last-minute agreements to raise the debt ceiling undermine confidence in the sovereign's willingness to pay," Fitch Ratings, which evaluates risks for bond investors, said in a report last month. It added that it still saw little chance of defaulting, describing the very idea as "incredible."
The debt ceiling was created, ironically enough, to make it easier for the government to borrow. The Treasury once required Congressional approval each time it issued debt. The ceiling, which evolved from an initial version created in 1917 to facilitate the government's wartime borrowing binge, replaced those individual authorizations with an upper limit, like the limit on a credit card.
There is an important difference, however: This credit card can be used only for spending that Congress has separately authorized.
That might seem to obviate the need for a limit, or at least create a ready justification for the necessary increases. Instead, over the last century, Congress has repeatedly authorized more spending than borrowing, creating a long-running series of crises that have grown more frequent in recent years.
The ceiling is now set at roughly $16.4 trillion and, as of Monday, that is the amount of the federal debt, too. The government has enough money to pay its debts until "mid-February or early March," the Congressional Budget Office estimated in November. The government needs to borrow about $100 billion a month, and the Treasury estimated last week that it could use bookkeeping tricks to borrow about $200 billion more without increasing the total amount of its debts.
These "extraordinary measures" mostly involve government pension funds that invest their holdings in special federal debt to earn interest. The money that the Treasury borrows from the funds, however, cannot be used to pay other bills. So over the next two months, as about $175 billion in debt held by those funds comes due, the Treasury will repay the money it borrowed and then borrow the same amounts from external investors to pay its bills. Once the debt ceiling is raised, the Treasury will then compensate the pension funds for the lost interest.
The tax deal that passed Congress on Tuesday also cuts into the time remaining to deal with the debt ceiling because it reduces revenues while postponing spending cuts.
Falling off the cliff, for all of its downsides, could have delayed hitting the ceiling.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Bringing Exclusivity To Dogs, and Owners

BYLINE: By BOB MORRIS

 BODY:
IS your dog Ruff Club material? I wasn't so sure about mine when I took her in for temperament testing the other day.
The sleek ''contemporary pet care hub,'' which opens this week on Avenue A in the East Village, and aims to be a social spot for humans too, accepts only dogs it deems properly mannered. Like the Soho House and Norwood clubs, it is members only, and while the $149 annual fee isn't daunting, the screening process had me cowering. The interview takes about an hour and is almost as rigorous as any for private school.
When I walked into the dog club -- with its old-fashion wooden bar, artisanal Brooklyn-made toile wallpaper and leather club chairs -- I was gripping Zoloft's leash, certain that she wouldn't pass muster. While she is mostly as good as her name, there are times when my Zoloft needs a Xanax. It isn't her piercing bark when strangers come to the door. It's her growling at other dogs, absurdly low for a longhaired miniature dachshund. She also has intense separation anxiety.
Divine as she is, at times I feel as if I have a maladjusted teenager on my hands. 
Would she be accepted? Danny Frost, 29, a downtown public interest lawyer who owns and runs the place with Alexia Simon Frost, his wife, was hoping to reassure me. ''We're not trying to create a master race of dogs,'' said Mr. Frost, who is fit and well-groomed. ''We're just trying to screen out certain issues that are deal breakers.''
Those include ''toy aggression'' and the inability to share treats; not allowing a handler to put on a collar or take her for a walk; excessive cowering and barking; and showing the intense separation anxiety that Zoloft shows when left with friends.
''We want dogs to enjoy it here and if one is fearful and anxious it causes anxiety in others,'' said Ms. Simon Frost, 29, who wore a chic black-on-black ensemble that would not do well with shedding dogs in lighter shades. ''We want them to thrive.''
She added that the Ruff Club, which offers scholarships and community programs, does not screen humans for hipness.
''And for dogs like yours, we provide a generous separation anxiety window,'' Mr. Frost said, reassuringly. The behavioral data is entered into an iPad-ready database so that any staff member, whether a concierge or handler, knows what to expect. If an otherwise lovely dog loses its cool around, say, balls, it will be noted.
''It's very situational,'' Mr. Frost said. ''All dogs are different.''
While the owners chatted with me, a dog handler named Lisa Lane (who has an advanced degree in animal behavior) had taken Zoloft downstairs to a playroom to test whether she could be easily handled. She was now whisking Zoloft past me for a walk outside.
I ran after them as fast as a helicopter parent chasing a teacher down the hall at an open house. I wanted to warn Ms. Lane that Zoloft sometimes growls and lunges at other dogs. Ms. Lane looked at me with what seemed to be amused concern. ''If you stop tensing up and yanking her leash when you see other dogs, she'll relax,'' she said.
''Do you think I'm being overprotective?'' I asked.
''I do,'' she replied. ''But dogs are like our babies.''
''Don't worry,'' Ms. Simon Frost added when we were back inside, where other dogs were undergoing interviews. ''Your dog will get into a good college.''
Yes, but would she get into the Ruff Club?
OVER-THE-TOP dog spas are not all that new, of course. And the focus on exclusivity suggests the same competitive urges of urban parents obsessed with getting their toddlers into the right schools. And just as the nursery-school-age population in Manhattan has surged since 2000, particularly among wealthy white families, the pet population in New York City is now estimated at 1.1 million, according to the New York City Economic Development Corporation, with a 30 percent increase in the pet care industry from 2000 to 2010.
At any rate, it wouldn't be the first time that dog care has been compared to child-rearing. ''Treating your dog as a person can be a kind of aesthetic error, albeit one that's becoming ever more common,'' writes John Homans in ''What's a Dog For?'' which explores the history and sociology of human-canine relationships.
The Ruff Club seizes upon this zeitgeist. ''But we won't infantilize dogs the way other spas do,'' Ms. Simon Frost said. ''We won't give out report cards or talk in high-pitched voices.'' She makes a point of calling her place ''dog'' day care not ''doggy.'' And unlike other high-end dog spas, the Ruff Club, which costs a competitive $29 for day boarding and $49 for overnight, doesn't offer yoga, massage or any forms of coddling.
''We just don't think that's appropriate for the East Village,'' she said.
To be honest, I was the one in need of coddling. Zoloft was now halfway through the screening, and because seeing me would disrupt things, I hid behind a door while a handler tested other dogs in the clinical, white downstairs playroom.
I could hear Zoloft's anxious barking as she was brought down to socialize with others, including a Boston terrier so mild mannered and playful that I felt jealous that my own wasn't nearly as social. In fact, all the dogs seemed to be equally playful. The only time I see Zoloft so carefree is at home, when she is playing with me.
I stood in the dark, waiting to catch a glimpse of her through a small window, expecting to see her in a corner, tail between her legs, avoiding the other dogs.
To my surprise, what I saw was her getting sniffed and then sniffing right back without lunging or cowering. And her mouth was open in a way that most trainers consider an indication of ease. ''You're a little cutie,'' I heard a handler tell her.
I'm embarrassed to admit that I was choking up, like a protective parent watching the little one go off to school. Could my fur-child (as some call pets these days) function happily without me? Was it possible that my dog wasn't as maladjusted as I had thought?
She did fantastically, the handler told me when I accosted him in the next room. ''She played with another dog and wasn't nervous at all.''
''But she didn't play with all the other dogs,'' I said.
''So she's not as social and likes to do her own thing -- nothing wrong with that,'' he said. ''If it's not a big deal to you, it won't be a big deal to her.''
It was becoming clear that Zoloft was Ruff Club material after all. She looked so comfortable with a half-dozen other dogs in the large playroom upstairs (with its high definition webcam -- one of many tech features) that I wondered if our visit had a therapeutic effect on the both of us.
''She was nervous when she came in,'' Ms. Lane, the chief handler, said. ''But in a short time she's improved so much. It would be nice to see her here again.''
Then she looked down at Zoloft and said, ''You really came out of your shell.''
A moment later, other owners were coming in to pick up their dogs. They all tested well, and Ms. Simon Frost was telling them, with great pleasure, that they had been accepted. One owner said he was especially relieved because his dog was hyperactive from being cooped up after surgery. And the owner of that preternaturally perfect Boston terrier, who looked and sounded as self-possessed as his dog, had concerns as well.
''Her one issue is that she's obsessed with balls,'' he said. ''I have to put them away or it leads to trouble at the dog run.''
Ms. Simon Frost said that balls often cause the worst fights at dog parks.
''The dog run should be ball free,'' he said.
I had to smile. Even top dogs have their issues, I guess, and so do their owners.

HEADLINE: As Taxi Fares Increase, Tips By Riders Fail To Keep Pace

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
Detractors have long cast a yellow taxi ride in New York as something of an urban surrender -- a necessary expense when the subway is too crowded, the walk is too cumbersome, the burden of car ownership in the city is too much to bear.
Four months after cab fares increased by roughly 17 percent, it is perhaps not surprising to learn how New Yorkers have been greeting the news: They will always ride, it seems, but they do not have to be happy about it. 
According to data compiled by the city's Taxi and Limousine Commission, overall ridership has remained remarkably stable since the increase, falling just 1.67 percent compared with the same period in 2011.
A review of tips for cabbies, however, introduces a wrinkle. For riders who pay by credit card, tips have fallen, as a percentage of the fare, to 15.5 percent. An earlier review by the commission found that credit card tips exceeded 20 percent in fall 2009. Data from October and November of 2010 and 2011 placed average credit card tips closer to 17 percent. Data is not available for tips made in cash.
''Some people know about the hike, and just don't like it and just don't tip,'' said Chrishna Sooknanan, 27, a taxi driver from Flatbush, Brooklyn. ''People see the 50-cent surcharge from the M.T.A. and figure it's a tip.'' (The surcharge went into effect in 2009 to aid the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which is perennially short on cash.)
David S. Yassky, the city's taxi commissioner, cautioned that any change in tipping patterns might have more to do with math than rider resentment. In purely monetary terms, average tips are up 8 percent to $2.29, from $2.12, on fares paid by card. It is the tip percentage that has fallen, because fares have increased at a far greater rate.
If passengers are accustomed to tipping, say, $3 on their daily rides, Mr. Yassky reasoned, they might continue to do so even as the fare rises.
''It's behavior staying the same,'' he said. ''That drop is just an artifact of the pre-existing behavior.''
But there may be another explanation. Perhaps drivers' tips have become less tethered to the metered fare itself. (Just as deliverymen might expect the same fistful of $1 bills whether they are carrying $10 worth of food or $50 worth.)
Graham Hodges, a taxi historian and former driver, said the question of how to define cabbies within the service industry had long influenced tips.
''There's always a tension of whether to perceive the cabdriver as an independent-business man who has costs like you and me, or as a servant,'' Mr. Hodges said. ''I think people would like to see the cabdriver as a servant'' -- someone perhaps more entitled to a tip -- ''but they're unable to.''
Expanded use of credit cards may have also changed the dynamic. During the period studied this year, 49.9 percent of riders used cards, compared with 38.7 percent for the same dates in 2010 and 44.1 percent in 2011.
''There's simply less human interaction: you swipe the card and you're out the door,'' said Bhairavi Desai, the executive director of the New York Taxi Workers Alliance. ''If you're paying in cash, you make eye contact with the driver. You feel more compelled to give them a better tip.''
Mr. Yassky noted that most credit card users ignore the suggested tip amounts on the back-seat monitor, which lists options for tips of 20 percent, 25 percent or 30 percent. He said the amounts that riders put in themselves sometimes exceeded the suggested totals.
''I was shocked when I found this out,'' he said. New Yorkers, he concluded, ''don't like to be pushed around.''
Interviews with taxi riders yielded myriad justifications for tipping decisions: Drivers choose the wrong route. The economy is weak. Fares are too high as it is.
Others insisted they would never dream of shortchanging drivers but offered tales of less virtuous friends.
''They've started to skimp on tips,'' Kira Shalom, from Hell's Kitchen, said of her clan. ''It was a protest -- 'If I have to pay more for this fare, he's getting less.' ''
Francesca Mixco, 29, from Astoria, Queens, allowed that she had become ''horrible'' to cabdrivers, tipping ''maybe a dollar'' on a typical ride. She should know better, she said. She is a bartender.
Some expected tips to rebound, as a percentage, once the novelty of the new fares had worn off. Emma Hulse, 30, from Washington Heights, said she had begun tipping 20 percent, rather than 25 percent, in a bid to keep her final fare closer to what it was before.
''You kind of set up in your mind what it's going to be,'' she said. ''You still want to be around that certain mark.''
But Ms. Hulse said she had taken to using livery cabs more often as a way to get home -- a service with fares that are more open to negotiation.
''I guess I do tip less,'' she said. ''And I get in a lot more arguments.''

HEADLINE: After College, Deferring Six Figures on Wall Street for Teacher's Salary

BYLINE: By SCOTT EIDLER

 BODY:
Four years after the financial crisis, Wall Street hiring has remained weak, and many college graduates have searched for jobs and even careers in other fields. In the last several years, hundreds of such would-be finance professionals and management consultants have taken their high-powered ambitions and spreadsheet modeling skills to the classroom.
Teach for America, the 22-year-old nonprofit organization that recruits high-achieving college graduates to teach in some of the nation's poorest schools for two years, in particular has garnered renewed interest among the business-oriented set. Teach for America says that its 2012 class contained about 400 recent graduates with a major in business or economics. Of those with professional experience, about 175 worked in finance.
Those participants include Zachary Dearing, 23, a recent graduate of M.I.T. Two summers ago, he was an intern at McKinsey & Company, and the year before, Goldman Sachs. 
Yet, he was one of 21 teachers in this year's class who had deferred job offers from a Wall Street bank, a management consulting firm or another corporate partner to join Teach for America.
"If somebody had told me I was going to be a high school math teacher in Dallas, Texas, when I entered college, I'd be like, 'No, there's no chance of that being true,' " said Mr. Dearing, who has deferred an offer from McKinsey. The teaching skills easily translate to office environments, he said. "I'm effectively the leader, every day, for 46 minutes, in front of seven different groups," Mr. Dearing said.
Teach for America also became a sought-after option for students like Eric Rodriguez, who was a senior at Harvard when the financial crisis hit. Mr. Rodriguez had completed two internships at Lehman Brothers and was fully expecting to work at the firm after he graduated. But as he started his senior year in September 2008, Lehman Brothers collapsed and Wall Street was in a free fall.
But that fall, Teach for America began its to woo him to join its ranks.
"At Harvard, they harass you: 'I'm going to be at this place, come meet me,' " he said. "It wasn't until I was desperate that I said 'I'll check this out and speak to this person.' " In 2009, Mr. Rodriguez joined Teach for America and taught in an elementary school in San Francisco for two years. Afterward, he landed a job at Facebook in its user operations department.
At least a dozen other teaching programs also compete to attract talented college graduates and professionals. NYC Teaching Fellows, a 12-year-old program that is run by the city's education department, said that nearly 7 percent of its applicants in 2012 were business majors. It is similarly selective and had nearly 12,000 applicants last year for about 1,400 spots, mostly for positions in Brooklyn and the Bronx.
Other publicly and privately run teaching enterprises, like Chicago Teaching Fellows and City Year, a one-year service program, attract applicants from across the country. But among most graduates, Teach for America holds a higher profile, said Monica Wilson, acting co-director of Dartmouth College's office of career services.
"As Teach for America has been around longer and hired very smart people, it's gotten even better at how they recruit students, while the financial services industry has slowed down and experienced negative publicity in the media," Ms. Wilson said. Many regard earning a spot in Teach for America a "badge of success."
Teach for America in particular said that its applicant pool had swelled during the recession and lackluster recovery. More than 48,000 applied for 5,800 spots in 2012, nearly twice as many as those who had sought positions for the 2008 class.
The relationship between the teachers in the program and those outside the program has often been tense. Critics of the Teach for America program say teachers, in general, aren't at their best until they've been working for at least five years.
Teach for America contends that many of its teachers last beyond the required two years. Of its 28,000 alumni, two-thirds remain in education roles, including as principals and superintendents (about half of those educators are in classroom settings).
"It wouldn't have the same appeal if it were for a longer period of time," said Kaitlin Gastrock, a spokeswoman for Teach for America. "Two years is a reasonable ask to make of folks who are just finishing up their college experience."
Teach for America participants receive the same starting salary as first-year teachers in their districts, which is about $25,500 to $51,000 a year. That pales in comparisons to the six-figure salary and bonus structures that many elite college graduates can expect in finance.
The program fully expects that it will not keep all of its recruits. Mr. Dearing, for one, said he intended to work at McKinsey after his commitment was over. But the teaching program could lead to a career in public service one day, he said.
In many ways Teach for America was modeled on the success of top Wall Street firms, which seek to recruit the best and the brightest college graduates. In her 2001 memoir, the program's founder, Wendy Kopp, wrote that she hoped to both improve the stature of the profession and give the recruitment process a much-needed jolt. In the book, she said she envisioned creating "a teachers corps that would recruit as aggressively as the investment banks and management consulting firms that were still swarming all over campus."
Indeed, some of Teach for America's outreach is taken straight from Wall Street's recruiting book. On campuses, career advisers and applicants say, the program's presence is large, with ambassadors compiling lists of impressive candidates from the recommendations of professors, academic advisers and alumni. Now, the number of teachers who joined this year from Ivy League schools is nearly 50 percent higher than it was in 2008.
"They take the time to visit campus, to get to know our students, our student groups, where and when they should present," said Patricia Rose, director of career services at the University of Pennsylvania. "Most of the other people who use this model are for-profit organizations."
The previous internships in finance have proved to be effective teaching aids for some of the participants. Ross Peyser, a 2011 graduate of Cornell and a second-year teacher in New Orleans, was once an intern at Oliver Wyman, a financial services consulting firm. As a teacher, he still plays the role of data analyst, creating Excel spreadsheets to diagnose his students' learning needs.
At the end of day, he administers a five-question quiz to students to assess who understood the lesson. When class is over, he performs exhaustive data pulls in Excel, just as he did as a finance intern.
"I had a stronger basis to do my data analysis compared to all the other teachers in my school," Mr. Peyser said. "It came more naturally just based on that one summer in finance."
And more important, he and others do regard the program as one that provides essential job skills.
"T.F.A. is a really strong name," he said. "It seems as if going to work for McKinsey or something like that; they hold the same value."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Kids in the Block

BYLINE: By JOYCE WADLER

 BODY:
THERE are renovations so ambitious and flawless you can almost see the contractors leaving the property carrying buckets of money.
So it is with the home built by Anthony Goicolea in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, on a street in the throes of gentrification. It's striking, if conspicuous, standing a story higher than the row houses it used to be a part of, a dazzling white block with many windows, the architectural equivalent of the cousin who made good and returns to visit his working-class relations.
The two-story row house originally in this space, which was demolished down to the basement and common walls that it shares with the neighbors, was 1,200 square feet. The new building is 2,000 square feet. The entrance level, an open kitchen and living space, has 20-foot ceilings; the wide stairs have thick glass banisters; the master bedroom, on the top floor, has sliding doors of translucent glass between master bedroom and bath, which can be opened so the claw-foot tub is part of the bedroom. 
Mr. Goicolea, who shares the house with his partner, Paul Kelterborn, paid $625,000 for the building in 2006. Then, working with the Manhattan architect Janet Cross, he spent what he estimated as $950,000 to $1 million on the three-year renovation.
''It was supposed to be $750,000, and everybody told me it would take twice as long and cost twice as much,'' says Mr. Goicolea, an artist, who is 41 but looks like a kid in his 20s and is charming and self-deprecating about what he spent. ''I stopped building once for six months because I ran out of money.''
Where does an artist even get that kind of money? ''I was doing pretty well before the recession,'' Mr. Goicolea says, good-naturedly.
How well? ''I have works in the permanent collection at MoMA, the Whitney, the Guggenheim and the Brooklyn Museum -- all of them except the Met,'' he says. O.K. he is told, that should do it.
He shows at Postmasters Gallery in Chelsea; his art -- his Web site is anthonygoicolea.com -- is eclectic. He draws, paints and does video and photography.
His partner, Mr. Kelterborn, 34, who stayed for part of the interview but then had to leave for work, is the programs manager for the Municipal Art Society of New York. They have been a couple for two years and laugh when asked how they got together -- best to just say it was a social-networking site, they agree. Most of the furnishings in the home came from Mr. Goicolea. He is as open and amusing when discussing his profligate purchases as he is when talking about the house.
The slipcovered navy blue sofa in the open kitchen/living room, what did he pay for that? he is asked. Mr. Goicolea playfully lowers his voice. ''Six thousand dollars,'' he says, as if confessing to a threesome one intoxicated night in Istanbul.
''The thing that happened with the sofa, I was still paying gargantuan checks to finish the house, and I had a skewed perspective of what things cost,'' he adds. ''Now when I hear myself say that, I think I would never pay that. We want a chest of drawers, we saw one for $400, we're saying, 'Do we really need that?' But then I was writing checks every other week for $30,000 and $40,000. I was just hemorrhaging and bleeding money, making work and trying to sell it to pay for it all.''
Checking his records, Mr. Goicolea learns that, when it comes to the couch, he was not as debauched as he thought. His Giovanni Erba couch, called the Something 98 Sofa, had originally been priced at $6,000 at ABC Carpet & Home in Manhattan, but he got it for $4,500 at a 25-percent-off sale.
And much of his furnishings are inexpensive, long owned and freshened up, or cleverly repurposed.
He's found a way to make the house help pay for itself: he rents the basement studio to an artist friend. It looks out on a beautifully designed backyard, created by the couple, that has a wood deck and slabs of bluestone, interspersed with river stone. ''You would think rocks would be cheap,'' Mr. Goicolea says dryly. ''These were, like, $1,000. There's a stone yard in Bushwick and we drove down there and loaded up the car. We almost busted an axle trying to get them home.''

GRAPHIC: PHOTOS: HIGH AND MIGHTY: It took three years and nearly $1 million to convert a Bro oklyn row house into a striking modern home. It's also easy for visitors to spot. (D1)
1. The renovation of the artist Anthony Goicolea's row house cost nearly $1 million, but the furnishings include thrift-shop pieces, like the 16-year-old sofa in the mezzanine living area, next to a Restoration Hardware armchair.
2. To help pay for the renovations, Mr. Goicolea, shown here, turned the master bedroom into a studio and rented the ground-level studio space to a friend.
3. The guest room has deep gray walls, which Mr. Goicolea, who shares his home with his partner, Paul Kelterborn, finds restful. Over the bed is a Wayne White painting.
4. The master bathroom is sectioned into shower, toilet and tub areas.
5. The 20-foot-high kitchen looks out on a pocket park across the street. The cabinets are Ikea. The Crate & Barrel table, left outside when Mr. Goicolea had a country house, was sanded and oiled and brought indoors.
6. Quarter-inch glass alongside the stairs acts as both banister and wall. Installing the glass, Mr. Goicolea said, was one of the most difficult parts of the renovation.
7. Mr. Goicolea sits at the mezzanine desk built by his contractor, Kendrick Thurston, with Mr. Kelterborn across the room. The coffee-table base is from a table Mr. Goicolea's mother had.
8. The guest bathroom is on the mezzanine, a floor down from the guest room. The sliding door doubles as a blackboard. The woman in the painting is Mr. Goicolea's grandmother.
9. The multilevel house has a basement studio
an open kitchen and sitting room (shown here)
a mezzanine living room and office
 and two bedrooms above that. Levels of windows and a glass partition between the mezzanine and kitchen flood the place with light. (PHOTOGRAPHS BY EMILY ANDREWS) (D7)

HEADLINE: Looking for a Match

BYLINE: By ABBY ELLIN; Alain Delaquérière contributed research.

 BODY:
ANITA ADAMS was born with one green eye and one brown eye. While differently colored irises, a condition otherwise known as heterochromia, may look exotic on David Bowie and Kate Bosworth, Ms. Adams did not like them on herself.
''I wanted my irises to match,'' said Ms. Adams, 41, who works as a caretaker for at-risk adolescents in Grand Junction, Colo.
In mid-2008, she began looking online to see if there was any solution other than colored contact lenses (which comprised about 20 percent of the $7.8 billion global contact lens market in 2011, according to a January 2012 report published by BCC Market Research). She found a company, New Color Iris, marketing a device invented by a Panamanian ophthalmologist, Dr. Alberto Delray Kahn, that could apparently implant an artificial or prosthetic iris over her natural one. 
The device was not approved by the Food and Drug Administration, nor were there any clinical studies or peer-reviewed publications about it. But Ms. Adams found Facebook posts and YouTube testimonials from patients whose eyes had gone from drab brown to an icy blue and were thrilled with the results. On his Web site, Kahnmedical.com, Dr. Kahn wrote that he supported ''programs for the prevention of blindness in the Kuna and Embera Indians of Panama,'' who have high rates of ocular albinism, which makes them sensitive to light.
Ms. Adams was impressed. At the company's request, she went for routine tests to her ophthalmologist, who told her he had never heard of the procedure and advised against it. She didn't listen. ''I went, 'Oh, whatever,' '' she said. ''I don't think anything was going to convince me not to do it. At that point my mind was made up.''
Ms. Adams is not alone in her quest for symmetry, whatever the risk.
Dr. Gregory J. Pamel, a corneal and refractive surgeon in Manhattan and a clinical assistant professor of ophthalmology at New York University, said that for the last two years he has received about three inquiries a month from patients who have learned from his Web site that he implants artificial irises for medical reasons. ''They'd want to enroll in the clinical trial, and I would say, 'There's nothing available in the U.S.,' '' he said. ''There are no approved devices in the U.S. to change the eye color cosmetically. There are no clinical trials to date that are looking into this. There's nothing on the horizon.''
There are, however, iris implants for patients with serious conditions like aniridia, a rare hereditary absence or partial absence of the iris, that are available under a special ''compassionate use'' F.D.A. provision. The provision allows patients with serious or life-threatening medical conditions to be treated with devices that have not been approved by the F.D.A., but ''we can only use it for people with trauma,'' Dr. Pamel said. ''I would be very hesitant and skeptical about any technology that purports to change the iris color for cosmetic reasons.''
Dr. Kenneth Steinsapir, an oculofacial surgeon and ophthalmologist in Los Angeles, also received calls from patients wanting their eye color changed, so he began investigating New Color Iris. He found no positive reports, but he did find a number of studies reporting serious complications. In July 2010, he blogged about it on his Web site, lidlift.com. ''The colored disk that is put in the eye has been shown to cause harm,'' he wrote. ''If you are not albino and missing iris pigment or have part of the iris missing either from a birth defect or from trauma, then there is no compelling medical reason for this surgery.''
But Ms. Adams was determined to fix her perceived imperfection. In September 2008, she wired nearly $2,000 to New Color Iris, and a month later flew with her mother (paying their airfare) to Panama. She was told the surgery would present no complications other than a slight risk of glaucoma. She signed a consent form, paid an additional $5,000 and underwent the 15-minute procedure.
For two days, Ms. Adams's vision was blurry, which she was told was normal. By the third day, she could see well enough to tour around the city. ''I was happy with the experience at the time,'' she said.
She appeared on ''Inside Edition'' to talk about how delighted she was, for which she said New Color Iris paid her $500, promising an additional $500 for every future media appearance she did. She also allowed the company to use her likeness on its Web site and on YouTube.
Ms. Adams was pleased with her matching irises for about two years. But in fall 2010, she said, her vision grew ''spotty,'' and she was ''scared to death I was going blind.'' She repeatedly tried to contact Dr. Kahn as well as the company in New York, but said she received no response. She started a Facebook page (now dismantled) highlighting her negative experience, noticing that other people had shared similar stories.
And when she returned to the New Color Iris Web site, she was redirected to another site, Brightocular.com, which was marketing another implant to cosmetically change eye color and offering more glowing testimonials.
Ms. Adams said she contacted it using a fake name and was told that the procedure was being offered in Istanbul and soon ''in all of Europe'' and that the company was not affiliated with New Color Iris. Convinced this was untrue, she contacted Dr. Steinsapir in February 2011, and he began blogging about a possible relationship between the two companies. On Aug. 16, 2011, Dr. Steinsapir received a certified letter from Kevin J. Abruzzese, a lawyer in Mineola, N.Y., representing Stellar Devices, which owns the trademark for Brightocular, that denied that any association existed between the two companies. The letter also asserted that Stellar Devices was working with Minnesota Eye Consultants, in Minneapolis, to obtain ''F.D.A. compassionate approval for a patient with aniridia,'' and ordered the doctor to remove ''any and all defamatory content'' about Brightocular.
Still skeptical, Dr. Steinsapir found a registered trademark for Brightocular, originally filed March 18, 2010 and granted registration on April 19, 2011.
But the company to which the trademark was registered was not Stellar Devices, but New Color Iris. What's more, New Color Iris and Stellar Devices shared the same Midtown Manhattan address. Dr. Steinsapir later published his findings. He said he also arranged surgery for people who had iris color surgery and needed urgent help.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Abruzzese said that he did some intermittent work with Brightocular, but would not comment further. In a later e-mail he wrote that, ''The letter sent to Dr. Steinsapir from my office answers all of your questions.''
David Kaiser, the customer relations manager for Brightocular in New York, said on the phone that the company was not affiliated ''in any way'' with New Color Iris and, he wrote in an e-mail, is ''currently in the process of'' receiving F.D.A. approval. (Synim Rivers, a spokeswoman for the F.D.A., said the agency could not confirm the existence of or comment on any pending product applications.)
But a search of online trademark records found that New Color Iris registered the Brightocular trademark to Stellar Devices on July 24, 2012. And David Hardten, director of the research department at Minnesota Eye Consultants, said he had never used Stellar Devices and was not working with it.
Still, some people report positive experiences with the company. On May 14, 2012, Angel Santiago, 46, an unemployed freight worker in Chicago, flew to Rio to have Dr. Edigezir Gomes, another surgeon, change his eyes from dark brown to gray, after about a year's deliberation.
''I did my background check with them and they seem to be really good at what they do,'' he said of Brightocular, which arranged the procedure, adding that he did not receive any payment for this testimonial. ''I see a new man in the mirror.''
But surgeons treating patients with severe complications from cosmetic iris implants urge a longer view.
Dr. Mohammed ElMallah, an ophthalmologist in Ocala, Fla., specializing in glaucoma and cataract surgery, said he'd recently removed New Color Iris implants from a patient who would have gone blind otherwise. ''Maybe not within a month, but probably within a year or two,'' he said. ''She is most likely going to have to use glaucoma drops for the rest of her life.''
Dr. James Tsai, an ophthalmologist and a glaucoma specialist at Yale University, has published articles about negative results from this type of surgery. ''Some online discussions say the procedure is safe, claiming that 'the technology used is similar to that used to treat cataracts'; this is inaccurate as well as misleading,'' he said.
Dr. Tsai has been working with the American Academy of Ophthalmology and the American Glaucoma Society to try to educate consumers about the risk of the procedure. On its Web site, the American Academy of Ophthalmology cautions that cosmetic iris implant surgery -- which was originally devised to treat people whose iris did not develop normally, not for cosmetic reasons -- can cause elevated pressure inside the eye that can lead to glaucoma, cataracts and corneal injury, as well as reduced vision or blindness.
As for Ms. Adams, who was found to have glaucoma and cataracts, her implants were removed in early 2011 at a cost of $5,000, which was not covered by insurance. She said her sight is better but not the same as it once was. ''My pupils are kind of oblong instead of round now, and my corneas are scratched, so I can't wear contact lenses,'' she said. And her eyes are back to their original different colors.
But she learned one lesson from the experience. ''If there's no F.D.A. approval, there's a reason,'' she said. ''I'm grateful I didn't lose my vision.''

HEADLINE: Germany's Downward Trend

BYLINE: By JOHN VINOCUR

 BODY:
THE newspaper headline said: ''German Economy to Become a Midget.'' Sure, and Elvis is alive and well in Berchtesgaden, learning to yodel and secretly preparing an album of Bavarian lullabies.
But the accompanying article in Die Welt was not without substance. It reported on a survey by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development which projects German growth falling to an average of 1.1 percent over the period from 2011 to 2060 [pdf]. That's at the bottom of a sample pile of the world's critical industrial and emerging economies, about half the rate of the United States' or Britain's expansion, behind France, Italy and even Greece, and left in the dust by India, China, Indonesia and Mexico.
Angela Merkel, who faces re-election this fall, could well shrug and say to herself, I'll be 106 before I'm accountable in the face of that piece of computerized clairvoyance -- however estimable the source. 
Still, starting now, the O.E.C.D. considers that the German economy will trend downward over a half century at levels increasingly under 1.5 percent growth, which, while not total stagnation, means little more than marking time. That doesn't work as a credible perspective for a country that wants to call the shots in Europe. If this is where austerity in lifetime-doses leads you, then where's the justification of the German blueprint for the rest of the European Union?
Germany in 2013 is also a country whose banks are in notoriously risky condition; whose population is expected to lose 17 million inhabitants by 2060; and whose domestic automobile industry is reported to have produced 500,000 fewer cars in 2012 than the previous year.
In the short term, the Bundesbank asserts real G.D.P. growth will top out at 0.7 percent in 2012 and 0.4 percent in 2013. Not good. After a return to levels of around 1.5 percent, the O.E.C.D. said in another assessment that, without significant reform programs, Germany's rate of expansion would dip under 1 percent from 2020.
Doubting voices are becoming louder. Alain Minc, a former economic adviser to President Nicolas Sarkozy, now describes Deutsche Bank as a ''world problem'' and said, ''I'm convinced Germany will be worse off in five years. Its demography is bad. It has no significant gains in competitiveness. It's at its apogee and will start to decline.''
Why is this so counterintuitive? Because Germany has been brilliantly sold with the help of Merkel's placid, elevator-music manner. Der Spiegel has written she dispenses the truth to Germans in ''homeopathic doses.'' Indeed, those sparing spoonfuls are what the external world has often swallowed. Example: In autumn 2011, talking about the German economy's world role, she bragged: ''We're the locomotive again.''
A few days later, Wolfgang Franz, chairman of the chancellor's committee of economic advisers, contradicted her. He said that there were no more economic locomotives in the world, and insisted that there was nothing in the German economy to signal a long sweep of growth since Germany had basically ''spent its structural reforms of 2005.''
Who listened to what turned out to be the truth? The fact is, once she took office in 2005, Merkel never felt she had to pay attention to her own campaign rhetoric favoring further labor market streamlining. Her Germany certainly did not listen when the G-20 group of economic powers signaled in 2009 for the country to cut its export surpluses by increasing domestic demand. Following through with real effort would have meant opening new markets to its European neighbors and encouraging German consumer spending.
Now, the O.E.C.D. identifies the decline in Germany's working population as a central factor in the projection of its economic shrinkage. Sure, the circumstances help provide relatively low unemployment numbers (6.9 percent). Yes, retirement at 67 has been voted into law -- but it is only scheduled to come into full effect in 2030, when it might have to be upped again to age 70.
And those German banks, described in 2010 by a German member of the European Commission as ''the world's riskiest''? The O.E.C.D. last year reported the ''high vulnerability'' of the system and found that ''a reform of the sector is still lacking.''
Taken together, since Merkel likes little steps, and not big, legible plans for Europe, her overall vision for its future still represents a very German outline. Under the E.U.'s planned banking supervisory system, Germany's insistence has resulted in its officials, not European ones, being designated to oversee the country's rickety public banks.
It's a consistently stubborn approach. In 2060, according to the O.E.C.D.'s long-range calculations, Germany will still be running a current account surplus -- an imbalance hardly marked by selflessness and generosity -- while the biggest players like China and India are projected over time to have moved into current account deficit status.
This fall, Merkel's Social Democratic opponent will be Peer Steinbrück, an abrasive man who served as her finance minister during the 2005-2009 grand coalition, and initially rejected the notion of Europe-wide bailout packages (he couldn't trust the neighbors).
Whatever the realities of Germany's diminishing momentum, the poll numbers and the S.P.D.'s similarities to Merkel in defining her country's self-interest say she will be re-elected.

1913 Storm in English Politics
LONDON -- Lord Northcliffe does not like food taxes. Mr. Bonar Law, the leader of the Unionist party in the House of Commons, in a speech at Ashton-under-Lyne, favored them. Whereupon Lord Northcliffe, father of all-British Standard bread, promoter of all-British dolls and distributor of all-British Christmas puddings, in his ''Times,'' ''Daily Mail,'' ''Evening News,'' ''Daily Mirror'' and ''Weekly Dispatch'' declared ''war'' upon Mr. Bonar Law, calling upon him to recant, and giving him until January 24 to come into line with ''the whole-wheat bread'' section of the party.

PALM BEACH, Fla. -- President Kennedy will give top priority in the new Congress to a tax program that would cut between $5 and $10 billion from the nation's personal and corporate tax bill in stages. While the President is optimistic about the business outlook for 1963, he wants a tax cut as insurance against a recession later on. He also believes that if taxes are cut, unemployment will drop, but that if taxes are not cut the number of jobless will rise. Mr. Kennedy also will again ask Congress to pass his bill for medical care for the aged and an aid-to-education bill.

HEADLINE: Car Sharing Catches On In Avis Deal To Buy Zipcar

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN. 
David Pogue, whose State of the Art column normally appears on this page, is on vacation.

 BODY:
8:51 p.m. | Updated
Last year, Lane Becker and his wife, Courtney Skott, plotted out the costs of owning a car versus renting one through Zipcar, the popular car-sharing service.
They ultimately decided to give away their car. Mr. Becker, who is 39 and lives in San Francisco, said he had few regrets, despite some difficulty securing a Zipcar on weekends, when he competes with other customers.
"It's a lot easier to rent than to own in a city these days, and Zipcar is an easy way to do it," he said. 
But on Wednesday, Avis Budget Group, the car rental conglomerate, announced that it was buying Zipcar for about $500 million. And that has Mr. Becker and some other "Zipsters," as Zipcar customers are known, worried that the company's communal cachet could be tarnished by a corporate behemoth.
"Please don't let them screw it up," Mr. Becker said.
For Zipcar, based in Cambridge, Mass., the deal represents perhaps an inevitable evolution for a company that has been more successful as a collectivist concept than as a profit-making venture (though it announced in November that it would post an annual profit for the first time).
Zipcar, which will operate as a subsidiary of Avis, should realize significant savings on things like vehicle purchases and insurance, while being able to tap Avis's fleet to meet demand on weekends, when it is often short of cars.
For Avis, the purchase represents a new direction in a fiercely competitive car rental market, and an about-face for Ronald L. Nelson, the company's chairman and chief executive, who had resisted entering the car-sharing segment.
"I've been somewhat dismissive of car sharing in the past," Mr. Nelson said Wednesday morning in a phone call with analysts. He said he had come to the realization that car sharing could complement Avis's more traditional car rental business and help it unlock new business opportunities abroad and with younger consumers. Avis's rivals, Hertz Global and Enterprise Rent-A-Car, already offer hourly rental services that compete with Zipcar.
Shares of Avis Budget Group closed up about 5 percent on Wednesday, at $20.77. Shares of Zipcar closed up nearly 48 percent, at $12.18.
Avis said it expected savings of $50 million to $70 million a year from combining the two companies.
"Avis Budget's existing infrastructure, scale and experience with managing multiple brands make it uniquely positioned to accelerate the growth and profitability of Zipcar," Mr. Nelson said in prepared remarks. "At the same time, we are committed to retaining the elements of the Zipcar brand and culture that have allowed Zipcar to achieve such rapid growth and success."
Avis paid $12.25 a share in cash, a 49 percent premium over the closing price of Zipcar on Monday. (The price, however, is well below Zipcar's value in April 2011, when it went public at $18 a share.)
Among the beneficiaries will be Zipcar's early investors, including the tech titan Steve Case. He and his investment fund own about 19 percent of Zipcar's outstanding shares.
The idea for Zipcar dates to 1999, when a 42-year-old woman named Robin Chase learned about car sharing from a friend who had just returned from Berlin. A mother of three with an M.B.A. from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Ms. Chase wrote up a business plan and secured financing. Zipcar was started in 2000.
Environmentalists have embraced the idea of car sharing from the start, but Ms. Chase marketed Zipcar more on the idea of convenience, with the slogan "Wheels When You Want Them." The company grew quickly but fitfully, and Ms. Chase was forced out in 2003.
Her successor as chairman and chief executive, Scott Griffith, expanded Zipcar across the country and into Europe. A flat, hourly rate that covers gas and insurance for customers proved to be alluring: the service now has more than 760,000 members, with locations in 20 metropolitan areas in the United States, Canada and Europe, as well as on many college campuses.
"Since the founding, I knew that Zipcar would end up being the winning model for drivers, and that car rental companies would eventually have to come around and adopt our technology and approach," Ms. Chase said in an e-mail on Wednesday.
She said she expected the deal to improve Zipcar's profitability, but added, "Like all big company acquisitions of small companies, there is worry that they won't be able to do what it takes to succeed in the new economy: more innovation, more customer participation, more thinking outside of the box."
Zipcar fans praise its convenience, its plentiful urban locations and its friendly customer service. Victor Neufeld, a media executive who lives in Manhattan, said renting a car in New York City was always an annoyance before Zipcar came along.
"Every time I need a car for two hours, I go online and get a car within two blocks of my home," said Mr. Neufeld, who declined to give his age. "I also like it because originally I heard about it through word of mouth. I did not learn about it through advertising or some other marketing. It was very organic."
Maggie Marquis, 31, who lives with her husband in Chicago, said she started using Zipcar about six months ago and was generally pleased. "Just today, I decided that I wanted to run out and do some errands, and decided it would be easiest and cheapest to get a Zipcar," she said.
But Ms. Marquis said she was surprised by "small hints of disorganization." The company sent her multiple membership cards and would not allow her to sign her husband up for the same account, and she said she often received text messages about her rentals even after she had returned a car.
She said she hoped the influence of a larger corporation would "take their service to a new level of sophistication."
Several other Zipcar fans said they, too, hoped there would be benefits to the Avis deal, particularly more cars available on weekends.
Claire Frisbie, 31, who lives in Brooklyn, said she liked Zipcar for many reasons, but that one of the biggest was the ability to avoid the bureaucracy of traditional car rental companies: the waiting, the insurance, the added fees.
"I wouldn't want it to make it more difficult," she said of the deal. "I would be worried that the easy breeziness of it would be gone."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Supreme Court and the Next Fiscal Cliff

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: More disputes, and more disruptive ones to the economy, loom despite the fiscal-cliff settlement, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
The end of the 2012 fiscal cliff drama was largely predictable. Faced with the prospect of large and immediate tax increases, Congress acted to raise income tax rates only on relatively well-off people -- and also to allow payroll taxes to increase for all working Americans. The messy compromise raises revenue, although it does not bring our medium-term deficits under control, and it is unlikely to push the economy back into recession. 
Unfortunately, the legislation that passed the Senate late on New Year's Eve and the House on Jan. 1 sets up another fiscal-cliff-type experience - with a fight over extending the debt ceiling looming in about two months. And the outcome then could well be a significant slowdown in the economy and a struggle that might end up in front of the United States Supreme Court.
About the end of February, the Treasury Department will have exhausted its legal authority to borrow. Congressional authorization will be needed to allow additional federal government debt to be issued; this is the debt ceiling.
The last time the United States came close to hitting the debt ceiling, in summer 2011, a game of chicken was played on Capitol Hill and with the White House - with many Congressional Republicans insisting that the debt ceiling would not be extended unless there were matching spending cuts. 
This led to the Budget Control Act of 2011, which created the now-infamous sequester mechanism: if politicians could not agree on ways to limit spending (and raise taxes), automatic spending cuts would kick in for both domestic and military programs of the government.

Under the New Year's Day legislation, this sequester was postponed until the end of February.
So the next fiscal cliff includes both hitting the debt ceiling and carrying out the sequester. By itself, the sequester will cause government spending to fall in an arbitrary and inefficient manner. This will slow the economy to some extent.
But the greater danger is that world markets will be plunged into chaos when the debt ceiling is not extended, because this creates the prospect that the United States government will be unable to make payments on its existing obligations unless it breaks the law or makes vast spending cuts.
Using the debt ceiling in budget negotiations is a dangerous and irresponsible tactic. In summer 2011, financial markets were severely strained by the prospect that the United States would not pay its debts. This pushed up yields on risky debt around the world (including in Europe) and caused the stock market to fall almost everywhere.
Yet House Republicans seem willing to play the same card again unless they get large cuts to domestic discretionary spending by the federal government (or perhaps big cuts to Medicare, which is part of what they were asking for in 2012). The Obama administration and most Democrats will refuse to agree. Another showdown will loom.
In think about likely scenarios, you need to assess what the Supreme Court might do if it were to take center stage on the debt ceiling.
While the Tea Party movement is greatly weakened, it may still be strong enough to block any extension of the debt ceiling. If that were the case, an impasse with a great deal of impassioned rhetoric would result. 
At the end of the day, the administration would probably break the debt ceiling and take its case to the Supreme Court. While the court's ruling on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act was a significant moment in summer 2012, any decision on the debt ceiling would be much more important. We haven't seen a court decision with that kind of potential macroeconomic impact since the 1930s (when the legality of suspending the gold standard was reviewed).
Many legal arguments will be heard, and in the end the Court is likely to be swayed by an assessment of the potential implications. If the government has already broken the debt ceiling, determining that this is unconstitutional would cause chaos for the United States and the global economy. As in the 1930s, the court would not want to second-guess the macroeconomic decisions of the administration, I hope.
Whatever the Supreme Court outcome, going down that route would create a great deal of uncertainty - and is likely to affect some investment and consumption decisions and to slow the economy enough to create a new recession.
For a specific quantitative measure and a great deal of helpful thinking on this issue, I recommend the work of Nicholas Bloom of Stanford University (with Scott R. Baker of Stanford and Steven J. Davis of the University of Chicago) on their general Web site and in their most recent paper, updated this week. 
Their Economic Policy Uncertainty Index shows a big spike on the debt ceiling dispute in August 2011. We will face a comparable or even larger effect in early 2013. So the question for our politicians will be: whom do they think will be blamed for creating such an uncertainty-induced recession?
Based on its experience in 2012, the Obama administration will feel that it does well by standing up to the Republicans on fiscal issues (although some Democrats, of course, wanted to take an even stronger line). I do not see the two sides coming together on spending issues, so I expect a version of the sequester.
The Republicans are obviously divided on fiscal policy and many other issues; one is how extreme they want to be perceived to be relative to mainstream opinion.
Most likely the Tea Party faction will dig in deeply, as it did on Jan. 1, when the fiscal legislation passed the House with support from most Democrats and enough Republicans who were willing to vote with the administration (and the Senate). This is, of course, a sharp contrast to what happened at the start of President Obama's first term, when all the House Republicans, without exception, voted against the fiscal stimulus package.
The Republicans will split, but more of them are likely to side with the Tea Party movement than was the case this week. We are headed directly for another fiscal-cliff confrontation - and this one could be much more damaging.

HEADLINE: Bracing for the Next Political Standoff

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: A sense of relief among businesses is tempered by the anticipation of political battles to come. | Sophisticated investors increasingly are wary of big banks. | Al Jazeera is gaining a larger foothold in the United States with a deal for Current TV. | The Avis Budget Group's deal for Zipcar is a new direction for the company. 

 BODY:
One fiscal showdown drew to a close this week, as the president signed a bill to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans. But the sense of relief among businesses was tempered by the anticipation of political battles to come. Next month, Congress is set to negotiate over raising the debt ceiling.
"We're in for another round of brinkmanship and uncertainty," said Mark Zandi, the chief economist at Moody's Analytics. "I don't think the economy can really find its footing and jump to a higher level of growth until we get to the other side of this." President Obama has vowed to stay out of the debt ceiling debate, but his position "sets the stage for a nail-biting standoff that economists warn could lead to a damaging financial default and doubt from investors about the ability of the country to pay its obligations," The New York Times writes. The ratings agency Moody's issued a warning on Wednesday, saying a "lack of further deficit reduction measures could affect the rating negatively," and that the "need to raise the debt limit may affect the outcome of future budget negotiations." 
The deal reached this week preserved tax breaks for a range of industries, The New York Times reports. "A bevy of tax breaks and credits that had been scheduled to expire at the end of 2012 will be extended for another year, costing taxpayers $46.1 billion over the next decade, according to Congress's Joint Committee on Taxation."
Some companies moved to avoid coming changes in tax policy. Goldman Sachs, for instance, distributed $65 million in stock to 10 senior executives in December instead of January. "That move helped them avoid the higher tax rates that will now be imposed on income of $400,000 or more. The chief executive of Goldman, Lloyd C. Blankfein, was among the most prominent corporate executives who backed higher taxes as part of a broader deficit-reduction package."
WHEN A BANK IS A 'BLACK BOX' | Sophisticated investors increasingly are wary of big banks, Frank Partnoy and Jesse Eisinger write in the cover story of The Atlantic. Some say that bank disclosures leave out or obscure crucial information, a view that has become more widespread since the financial crisis. "Several financial executives told us that they see the large banks as 'complete black boxes,' and have no interest in investing in their stocks. A chief executive of one of the nation's largest financial institutions told us that he regularly hears from investors that the banks are 'uninvestable,' a Wall Street neologism for 'untouchable.'"
The list of skeptics includes some prominent Wall Street names. Paul Singer of Elliott Management recently wrote to his partners, "There is no major financial institution today whose financial statements provide a meaningful clue" about its risks, according to The Atlantic. William A. Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management told the magazine about his troubled bet on Citigroup. Mr. Ackman bought a stake of almost $1 billion in the bank in 2010 but sold it last spring at a loss approaching $400 million. "For the first seven years of Pershing Square, I believed that an investor couldn't invest in a giant bank. Then I felt I could invest in a bank, and I did - and I lost a lot of money doing it."
AL JAZEERA TO BUY CURRENT TV | 
The pan-Arab news giant Al Jazeera is gaining a larger foothold in the United States with a deal to take over Current TV, the low-rated cable channel founded by Al Gore and his business partners. The price was not disclosed, "but people with direct knowledge of the deal pegged it at around $500 million, indicating a $100 million payout for Mr. Gore, who owned 20 percent of Current," Brian Stelter reports for The New York Times Media Decoder blog.
Al Jazeera, which is viewed with some skepticism in this country, plans to shut down Current and start an English-language channel that will be available in more than 40 million homes. The acquisition is a "coming of age moment" for the news operation, which is financed by the government of Qatar, Mr. Stelter writes. "Mr. Gore and his partners were eager to complete the deal by Dec. 31, lest it be subject to higher tax rates that took effect on Jan. 1, according to several people who insisted on anonymity because they were not authorized to speak publicly. But the deal was not signed until Wednesday."
ON THE AGENDA | Peter Orszag, vice chairman of global banking at Citigroup, is on CNBC at 7 a.m. Jeffrey Gundlach of DoubleLine Capital is on CNBC at 11:45 a.m. The Federal Reserve's policy-making committee releases minutes from its recent meeting at 2 p.m.
AVIS'S BET ON CAR SHARING | The deal by the Avis Budget Group to buy Zipcar for about $500 million "represents a new direction in a fiercely competitive car rental market, and an about-face for Ronald L. Nelson, the company's chairman and chief executive, who had resisted entering the car-sharing segment," Andrew Martin reports in DealBook. Mr. Nelson said on Wednesday, "I've been somewhat dismissive of car sharing in the past." But he said he had realized that car sharing could complement Avis's traditional rental car business and give the company access to younger customers. Zipcar, which has been "more successful as a collectivist concept than as a profit-making venture," should realize savings from the deal while tapping Avis's fleet to meet demand on weekends, Mr. Martin writes.

HEADLINE: Seen From China: Fiscal Cliff Shows Democracy's Weakness

BYLINE: DIDI KIRSTEN TATLOW


HIGHLIGHT: With warnings about tripping over cans kicked down roads and bungee jumping into abysses, reactions from China to the U.S. "fiscal cliff" budget deal are colorful - and critical. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - With warnings - and mixed metaphors - about tripping over cans kicked down roads and bungee jumping into abysses, reactions from China to the just-struck United States' "fiscal cliff" budget deal have been colorful - and critical.
Get it together, is the message: American democracy isn't working if politicians can't pass national budgets on time. And the mess reduces the attractiveness of the American Model to the world. 
One story on People's Daily online, the state news agency, compared U.S. politicians to bungee jumpers, pointing out that the term "fiscal cliff" wasn't actually right since the country did fall off a cliff, as 2012 turned into 2013 without a deal, but bounced back when agreement came on Wednesday, Asia time.
Such a fall should have been deadly, Xinhua said. "So describing this finance crisis as 'bungee jumping' may be more appropriate."
"Still, to other countries, the United States' increasingly serious decision-making problems reduces the attractiveness of the American Model and trust in the American economy," Xinhua said.
China's views matter for all sorts of reasons, including geopolitics, but also because it is one of the biggest creditors of the U.S. government via its huge U.S. Treasury purchases. This makes China vulnerable - and concerned.
America is in decline, Xinhua implied in a commentary.
"The American people were once better known for their ability to make tough choices on difficult issues," ran a separate Xinhua story - this one a commentary - by a person named Ming Jinwei. (Such commentaries are not official statements by the government but are believed to reflect high-level government opinion.)
"The Americans may be proud of their mature Democracy, but the political gridlock in Washington really looks ugly from an outsider's view," the commentary said.
Americans may regard the cliffhanger deal as their own private business, but, "As the world' s sole superpower, U.S. domestic failures to reach deals on critical issues have implications for the whole world," it said.
"For the Americans, their government has been in the red for too long. Since 2002, Uncle Sam has not tasted any government surplus in over a decade as it borrows heavily to support costly wars in the Middle East and to stimulate the economy out of a recession in the wake of the global financial crisis," ran the commentary.
The theme continued in another Xinhua story: "In a democracy like the United States, tax increases and spending cuts, the exact dose of medicine needed to cure its chronic debt disease, have long proved hugely unpopular among voters. So the politicians have chosen to kick the can down the road again and again," it said, reflecting widespread concern in China at the size of the United States' $16 trillion debt - which will continue to grow even with this week's deal.
"But as we all know, the can will never disappear. Sometime and somewhere, you might trip over it and fall hard on the ground, or in the U.S. case, into an abyss you can never come out of," Xinhua warned.
Still, China has its own challenges, as this Bloomberg story makes clear, chiefly the threat of its own domestic debt and "cotton candy" growth.
Some of the factors that plunged the U.S. into economic crisis in 2008, adding to debt and shrinking the space within which to solve fiscal problems, are shared by China, warned David Loevinger, a former senior coordinator for China affairs at the U.S. Treasury Department.
"The U.S. got into trouble because institutions like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were too big to fail and had a toxic mix of private shareholders and implicit government guarantees. China's financial system is full of Freddies and Fannies," said Mr. Loevinger, now an Asia analyst in Los Angeles at TCW Group.
China's risk is mostly domestic, with its holdings in U.S. debt carried by the Ministry of Finance and the state banks it runs, unlike the U.S. debt, which is held by parties around the world.
But China's new leader, Xi Jinping, has inherited an economy with much more debt than the one President Hu Jintao took over in 2003, Bloomberg wrote, with government, corporate and consumer debt at an estimated 206 percent of gross domestic product, it said, citing a report by Standard Chartered Bank. In March 2003, when Mr. Hu became president, it stood at 150 percent, Bloomberg reported.

HIGHLIGHT: Betting on disaster in Thailand; yet another showdown looms in Washington; Ferdinand Marcos's still-elusive assets; Spain's thriving Chinese immigrants. 

 BODY:
 NEWS With the resolution of the U.S. fiscal crisis barely a day old, the next confrontation is already taking shape as Washington braces for a fight in February over raising the nation's borrowing limit. But it is a debate President Barack Obama says he will have nothing more to do with. Michael D. Shear and Jackie Calmes report from Washington. 
Thailand's favorite topic of conversation is probably food. But a close second is the underground lottery, an illegal yet tolerated black market numbers game played by nearly one third of the population. And the search for lucky numbers to play can be confusing to outsiders -- calamity can beget good fortune; tragedy can give rise to powerful ghosts who offer guidance on winning numbers. There is nothing too horrible to be a source of good luck: plane crashes, massacres or murders. Thomas Fuller reports from Bangkok.
President Vladimir V. Putin has ordered a major change in the rules for parliamentary elections, a move that could help solidify his power and influence toward the end of his current term and insulate him from dwindling public support for United Russia, the party that nominated him and currently holds a majority in Parliament. David M. Herszenhorn reports from Moscow.
A commission that has been pursuing the assets of the late Philippine dictator Ferdinand E. Marcos should be abolished, despite the fact that much of his allegedly ill-gotten wealth has not been recovered, the panel's chairman said on Wednesday. Floyd Whaley reports from Manila.
Many of Spain's 170,000 Chinese immigrants have managed not only to weather a tough economy but indeed to thrive, buoyed by an intense work ethic and a strong Confucian model of family loyalty, even as joblessness and cuts to government services have left other Spaniards struggling. Dan Bilefsky reports from Barcelona.
 ARTS Between 1964 and 1968, Henry Grossman took more than 7,000 photos of the Beatles, though only a few dozen - whatever magazine editors needed for the articles at hand - were published at the time. His new book, "Places I Remember," goes a long way toward remedying that; a boxed, 528-page, silver-edged brick of a volume, it weighs 15 pounds, includes about 1,000 photographs and costs $495. Allan Kozinn reports.
 SPORTS After Stanford's first Rose Bowl win since 1972 - and Wisconsin's third Rose Bowl loss in three years - the grass was worn, marked with fresh divots, and the ground was lumpy, somewhat like Play-Doh. For Stanford, at least, it had been fun. Tim Rohan reports from Pasadena, California.

HIGHLIGHT: This and that on an off day. 

 BODY:
Sorry about the failure to post anything earlier. It was a combination of family responsibilities and, to be frank, sheer weariness over the folly of our public life. And I really don't feel up to any extended discussion even now. Instead, just a few short takes on things that caught my eye: 
 Chaos Theory: Politico reports that Democrats are planning to run against Congressional Republicans by portraying them as incapable of acting responsibly, of creating "chaos".
This line of attack has the virtue of being true; the 112th Congress was the Worst Congress Ever, and it wasn't because of the Democrats. But it will be an uphill struggle, essentially because the news media still, after all these years, can't bring themselves to abandon "balanced" reporting in which every GOP sin must be matched with an equal Democratic sin, even if the latter has to be invented out of thin air. Can the message break through that fog of confusion?
 The decline of Pimco macro, continued:A while back I noted that macroeconomic analysis at the bond giant Pimco seemed to have gone downhill after Paul McCulley left; a firm that had shown a keen appreciation of the special problems of a deleveraging economy started making really bad analyses based on the notion that the Fed's quantitative easing was driving everything -- and lost a lot of money as a result.
I guess I shouldn't be surprised to see Bill Gross doubling down on his mistakes. Still, it's sad.
 Geithner going: Bloomberg reports that Tim Geithner will leave before the debt ceiling crisis hits. I hate to say this, but I find this reassuring. While I have no insider information here, I've had the sense that Geithner has consistently been a voice urging the president to cave in for fear of upsetting the markets, with no real concern for the dangers of giving in to blackmail. His departure makes it at least somewhat more likely that Obama will stand his ground.
That's all my substantive stuff for today. Off to the economics meetings in San Diego!

HEADLINE: Swiss Bank Pleads Guilty to Tax Law Violations

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN


HIGHLIGHT: In Federal District Court in Manhattan, Switzerland's oldest private bank, Wegelin &#038; Company, admitted to helping Americans to evade United States taxes, the first time a foreign financial institution has pleaded guilty to tax-law violations. 

 BODY:
Switzerland's oldest private bank on Thursday admitted to helping Americans evade United States taxes, the first time a foreign financial institution has pleaded guilty to tax law violations.
Representatives for Wegelin & Company, a Swiss bank founded in 1741, appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan and acknowledged that for nearly a decade the firm helped dozens of wealthy American customers dodge taxes by hiding more than $1.2 billion in secret accounts.
As part of guilty plea, Wegelin agreed to pay $74 million in fines, restitution and forfeiture proceeds to the United States government. Several Wegelin executives appeared at the hearing before Judge Jed S. Rakoff, including one of its managing partners, Konrad Hummler, a well-known figure in the Swiss private banking industry.
 "From about 2002 through 2010, Wegelin agreed with certain U.S. taxpayers to evade the tax obligations of these U.S. taxpayer clients, who filed false tax returns with the I.R.S." Otto Bruderer, another Wegelin partner, said in court. "Wegelin was aware the conduct was wrong." 
Mr. Bruderer said that Wegelin assisted the American clients because it believed that it would not be prosecuted in the United States because it had no offices here, and had acted in accordance with Swiss law. He also noted that the conduct was common practice in the Swiss banking industry.
Although Wegelin ceases to exist as a business, the firm's partners sold its non-American client accounts last January to the Raiffeisen Group, an Austrian bank, just before its indictment. That move was sharply criticized by Judge Rakoff in a court hearing last year as a "fraud upon fraud."
Nevertheless, Wegelin's admission of guilt represents a victory for the Obama administration in its sweeping crackdown on Americans using offshore banks to evade taxes. It also demonstrates the long arm of the Justice Department, extracting a guilty plea from a foreign company with no business operations in the United States.
The case strikes another blow at Swiss banking secrecy, a shadowy world that United States authorities have penetrated recently after decades of looking the other way. For years, secrecy has been a hallmark - and an attractive selling point - of Switzerland's private banks, which, alongside chocolate and watchmaking, are one of the country's best-known businesses.
In 2009, UBS avoided criminal charges by striking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement in which it paid a $780 million fine and turned over the names of about 4,500 clandestine accounts believed to hold the assets of American taxpayers. Around the same time, the Internal Revenue Service initiated an amnesty program that allowed Americans to avoid criminal liability by divulging offshore accounts. The program was a success, yielding more than $2.7 billion in taxes and penalties from about 30,000 taxpayers.
As part of the push to eliminate tax cheats, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Wegelin last February. The firm's elaborate scheme involved its Swiss bankers' opening secret accounts for American clients using code names and setting up sham entities to avoid detection in far-flung locales, including Panama and Liechtenstein.
"There is no excuse for wealthy Americans flouting their responsibilities as citizens of this great country to pay their taxes, and there is no excuse for foreign financial institutions helping them to do so," said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. "Today's guilty plea is a watershed moment in our efforts to hold to account both the individuals and the banks - wherever they may be in the world - who are engaging in unlawful conduct that deprives the U.S. Treasury of billions of dollars of tax revenue."
Mr. Bharara's office had also brought an indictment against three Wegelin executives last year, but they are expected to avoid facing the charges because a treaty between Switzerland and the United States does not provide for extradition of Swiss individuals for tax crimes.
The Justice Department said that Wegelin had lured clients away from larger Swiss financial institutions like UBS after those banks came under investigation. As of December 2010, Wegelin had about $25 billion in assets under management.
From its headquarters in St. Gallen, a quiet mountain town in northeast Switzerland, Wegelin pitched itself as a safe haven for American taxpayers because it had no operations in the United States. A Web site marketing Wegelin's services said, "Neither the Swiss government nor any other government can obtain information about your bank account."
Included in the $74 million in penalties is about $16 million in forfeited proceeds that Wegelin held in a UBS bank account in Stamford, Conn. The account, prosecutors said, was used to launder money from Switzerland to American clients and conceal that money from United States tax authorities.
The balance of the penalties is more than $20 million in restitution for taxes evaded, about $16 million in fees on American taxpayer client accounts and a fine of about $22 million. Wegelin was represented by Richard M. Strassberg of the law firm Goodwin Procter.
Just two months after the case was brought against UBS, Wegelin raised the hackles of the Justice Department. In April 2009, Mr. Hummler, the Wegelin partner, wrote an eight-page note titled "Farewell America." The memo by Mr. Hummler, who served as chairman of the Swiss Private Bankers Association, championed Swiss banking laws and said that Wegelin was in the process of recommending that its clients exit all direct investments in United States securities. Mainly, though, the note was a rambling jeremiad against the United States.
"The U.S.A. has fought by far the largest number of wars, sometimes with, but mostly without a U.N. mandate," Mr. Hummler wrote. "It has broken the international laws of war, maintained secret prisons, and fought an absurd war against drugs."
"A country," he continued, "whose underclass enjoys neither the benefits of an adequate education, nor a halfway functional health care system; a country whose economic system is increasingly inclined to overconsumption, and in which saving and investing have increasingly become alien concepts, a situation that has undoubtedly been one of the driving forces behind the current recession, with all its catastrophic consequences for the whole world."
After representatives of Wegelin failed to appear in federal court at the time of its indictment last February, federal prosecutors labeled the Swiss bank a "fugitive."
The typically colorful Judge Rakoff was subdued during Thursday's hearing. But in a court session last January, he blasted Wegelin for selling its non-United States business just before an indictment, suggesting that it was a blatant effort to shield its assets from the United States government.
If an American partnership had taken those actions, Judge Rakoff said, "the government would be here saying with perhaps considerable force that this was a fraud upon fraud compounding the prior alleged crime with patent evasions and consciousness of guilt."
Daniel Levy, a federal prosecutor, did not disagree. "That would be one reasonable view of the facts," he said.
An earlier version of this post gave an incorrect name for the managing partner at Wegelin & Company who served as chairman of the Swiss Private Bankers Association. It is Konrad Hummler, not Karl.

HEADLINE: Tax Break That Helps Private School Parents Is Made Permanent

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: A little-known tax break for families sending children to private and religious secondary schools was made permanent by the latest fiscal legislation. 

 BODY:
The fiscal legislation just passed by Congress, known as the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, makes permanent a little-known tax break for people who send their children to private or religious schools for kindergarten through 12th grade. 
The break comes via the Coverdell Education Savings Account, a vehicle my colleague Ron Lieber wrote about last summer.
The Coverdelllets you deposit up to $2,000 each year in an investment account. The contributions are not tax deductible, but you do not pay taxes on the earnings you take out, as long as you use them for tuition or other qualified expenses - including those for elementary or secondary education at independent and religious schools, as well as college tuition. Although the contribution limit is low, the tax savings can add up to thousands of dollars for diligent savers.
The tax break was scheduled to expire on Dec. 31. But it was retained, as part of the fiscal legislation's permanent extension of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-16), according to the financial aid expert Mark Kantrowitz.
Would you make use of such an account for private school tuition?

HEADLINE: Better, if Not Cheaper, Care

BYLINE: EZEKIEL J. EMANUEL


HIGHLIGHT: It's a myth that a majority of our health care spending goes to the final year of life. 

 BODY:
IT is conventional wisdom that end-of-life care is an increasingly huge proportion of health care spending. I've often heard it said that people spend more on health care in the year before they die than they do in the entire rest of their lives. If we don't address these costs, the story goes, we can never control health care inflation.
Wrong. Here are the real numbers. The roughly 6 percent of Medicare patients who die each year do make up a large proportion of Medicare costs: 27 to 30 percent. But this figure has not changed significantly in decades. And the total number of Americans, not just older people, who die every year - less than 1 percent of the population - account for much less of total health care spending, just 10 to 12 percent. 
The more important issue is that just because we spend a lot on end-of-life care does not mean we can save a lot. We do know that costs for dying patients vary widely among hospitals, which suggests that we can do better. And yet no one can reliably say what specific changes would significantly lower costs. There is no body of well-conducted research studies that has proved how to save 5, 10, much less 20 percent.
Recent studies find that hospice may reduce costs in the last year of life for cancer patients by 10 to 20 percent. But they find no savings from hospice care for patients who die of other conditions, like emphysema or heart failure. No one is sure why hospice care doesn't save more. It may be because patients are enrolled in hospice care too late, or because hospice services themselves are labor-intensive and not cheap.
Even if we can never save a dime, however, there are good reasons to think about changing end-of-life care practices. While end-of-life care has improved considerably over the last 30 years, many Americans still die in hospitals when they would rather die at home. Nearly 20 percent of deaths occur in an intensive care unit or immediately after discharge, and too many patients experience symptoms like pain that are controllable with appropriate palliative care.
Here are four things the health care system should do to try to improve care for the dying, even if they won't save money.
First, all doctors and nurses should be trained in how to talk to patients and families about end-of-life care. When I was starting out, I was lucky enough to be able to witness how a great oncologist communicated with patients and their families when it was clear they were going to die, but I received no formal training whatsoever. It is hard to improve care for the dying if health professionals don't know how to talk about it. Fortunately, there are excellent communication techniques and training programs available - they don't have to be invented from scratch.
A related intervention - an idea that never actually was in the Affordable Care Act but inspired the death panel accusation - is that physicians should be paid a one-time fee to talk with patients about their preferences for end-of-life care. Even if physicians are well trained in communication, these conversations take time and are emotionally draining. This should be recognized through compensation.
Third, every hospital should be required to have palliative care services available both in the hospital and at the homes of dying patients who are discharged. Over 40 percent of hospitals with more than 50 beds do not have palliative care services. And we don't know how many actually have palliative care services once patients are sent home. These services should be delivered by trained experts in diagnosing and managing common symptoms of the dying, like pain, nausea, insomnia, shortness of breath, fatigue and depression.
Finally, we need to revise eligibility for hospice care. Right now doctors must certify that patients have six months or less to live and patients must agree to forgo life-sustaining treatments. The decision about whether to put a patient in hospice care should not be based on unreliable predictions about how long he has left to live but rather on his needs for specialized care, like morphine infusions.
These changes could be made in at least two ways. The Joint Commission - the nonprofit group that certifies health care organizations - could make training physicians and nurses to talk about end-of-life care and having palliative care available a requirement for hospital accreditation. Alternatively, Medicare, private insurers and, after 2014, state exchanges could require hospitals to provide communication training and palliative services as a condition for payment.
Unfortunately, there is no evidence that these interventions will save money. And I can't definitively prove they will make the care of dying patients better. But doing nothing to try to help the dying when the rest of the health care system is improving care is not an option.

HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 

        
The 113th Congress will convene in a few hours, but lawmakers are already bracing for the next fiscal fight over the debt ceiling. Jackie Calmes and Michael D. Shear write that President Obama has no plans to negotiate with Republicans, who are demanding spending cuts as part of a deal to raise the debt ceiling in February, setting the stage for another standoff that could imperil the economic recovery.
 

        
Negotiations over the so-called fiscal cliff may have provided President Obama a new avenue for negotiating with Congress, which begins its 113th session today with several fiscal deadlines approaching. Jonathan Weisman explains that as House Republicans seek to block the president's agenda, Mr. Obama may be able to overcome their opposition by getting party leaders in the Senate to forge bipartisan deals. Mr. Obama is set to begin executing his "game plan" in the coming weeks with a goal of reaching a broad agreement with Congress on revenues and spending.

        
A relief package for victims of Hurricane Sandy will become a priority for the House, as Speaker John A. Boehner moves to quiet the bitter uproar from Northeast Republicans that followed his decision to quash an existing aid bill. Raymond Hernandez reports that Mr. Boehner plans to bring the aid to a vote in two steps, a $9 billion relief package on Friday and a $51 billion package on Jan. 15.

        
David Leonhardt writes that the fiscal deal reached this week is full of small victories for President Obama and his Congressional allies, but that it cost them some leverage in future fiscal battles. While the fight helped Mr. Obama steer federal policies to help the poor and the middle class, it failed to provide the certainty of a long-term agreement, which would have helped him avoid some coming battles.

        
Gen. John Allen, the top American commander in Afghanistan, has come up with plans to keep as many as 20,000 American troops there after the scheduled troop withdrawal in 2014. Elisabeth Bumiller and Eric Schmitt report that President Obama is expected to discuss a range of options for the American military when he meets with the Afghan president, Hamid Karzai, next week.

        
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton is out of the hospital and expected to make a full recovery after receiving treatment for a blood clot in her head.

HEADLINE: Inquiry Into Tech Giants' Tax Strategies Nears End

BYLINE: By CHARLES DUHIGG and DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
Congressional investigators are wrapping up an inquiry into the accounting practices of Apple and other technology companies that allocate revenue and intellectual property offshore to lower the taxes they pay in the United States.
The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations inquiry now drawing to a close began more than a year ago and involves at least a half dozen technology companies, according to people with firsthand knowledge of it, who declined to be identified.
Those people said the subcommittee had subpoenaed or otherwise asked the companies to explain methods they used to avoid domestic taxes. They said Apple had become a focus of the inquiry and was cooperating with the subcommittee, which is expected to issue wide-ranging recommendations that are likely to play a significant role in Congressional tax code negotiations. 
Apple's domestic tax bill has drawn the interest of corporate tax experts and policy makers because although the majority of Apple's executives, product designers, marketers, employees, research and development operations and retail stores are in the United States, in the past Apple's accountants have found legal ways to allocate about 70 percent of the company's profits overseas, where tax rates are often much lower, according to corporate filings.
Apple, in a statement on Thursday, said the company was ''one of the top corporate income taxpayers in the country, if not the largest.'' The statement said the company ''conducted all of its business with the highest of ethical standards, complying with applicable laws and accounting rules.''
It is unclear how broadly Senate investigators are looking into the technology industry, if any laws are thought to have been broken and how many companies are involved. The subcommittee is also known to be looking at Google, Hewlett-Packard, Microsoft and firms in such fields as biotechnology.
The subcommittee, which is overseen by Senator Carl Levin, a Michigan Democrat, has been interested in the impact on the budget deficit of offshore tax strategies. Representatives from Microsoft and Hewlett-Packard testified at a subcommittee hearing on the subject in September. Both companies were criticized sharply by Senator Levin for using accounting rules to allocate revenue to other nations to avoid paying taxes in the United States.
''This subcommittee has demonstrated in hearings and comprehensive reports how various schemes have helped shift income to offshore tax havens and avoid U.S. taxes,'' Senator Levin said at that hearing. ''The resulting loss of revenue is one significant cause of the budget deficit, and adds to the tax burden that ordinary Americans bear.''Apple has long been a pioneer in developing innovative tax strategies that lessen its domestic taxes. At the September hearing, Senator Levin said the investigation indicated that Apple had deferred taxes on over $35.4 billion in offshore income between 2009 and 2011.
Tech companies are able to easily shift ''intellectual property, and the profit that goes along with it, to tax havens,'' said a former Treasury Department economist, Martin A. Sullivan. ''Apple went out of its way to try and ensure that its tax savings didn't attract too much public attention, because tax avoidance of that magnitude -- even though it's legal and permissible -- isn't in keeping with the image of a socially progressive company.''
In its statement, Apple said it paid ''an enormous amount of taxes'' to local, state and federal governments. ''In fiscal 2012 we paid $6 billion in federal corporate incomes taxes, which is 1 out of every 40 dollars in corporate income taxes collected by the U.S. government,'' it said. In the 1980s, Apple was a pioneer of an accounting technique known as the ''Double Irish With a Dutch Sandwich,'' which reduces taxes by routing profits through Irish subsidiaries and the Netherlands and then to the Caribbean. Today, that tactic is used by hundreds of other corporations -- some of which directly imitated Apple's methods, say accountants at those companies. More recently, Apple has moved revenue to states like Nevada and overseas nations where the company pays less, or in some cases no, taxes.
Almost every major corporation tries to minimize its taxes. However, technology companies are particularly well positioned to take advantage of tax codes written for an industrial age and ill-suited to today's digital economy.
Some profits at companies like Apple, Google, Amazon, Hewlett-Packard and Microsoft emerge from royalties on intellectual property, like the patents on software. At other times, products are digital, such as downloaded songs or movies. It is much easier for businesses with royalties and digital products to move profits to low-tax countries than it is, say, for grocery stores or automakers.
Although technology is now one of the nation's largest and most highly valued industries, many tech companies are among the least taxed, according to government and corporate data. Over the last two years, the 71 technology companies in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index -- including Apple, Google, Yahoo and Dell -- reported paying worldwide cash taxes at a rate that, on average, was a third less than other S.& P. companies', according to a New York Times analysis. (Cash taxes may include payments for multiple years.)
Companies report their cash outlays for income taxes in their annual Form 10-K, but it is impossible from those numbers to determine precisely how much, in total, corporations pay to governments.

Museums
American Folk Art Museum: 'Foiled: Tinsel Painting in America' (through Jan. 13) Might tinsel painting, a decorative and resourceful form of picture making that was all the rage during the second half of the 19th century, be due for a comeback? Possibly, to judge from this cluttered but charming show, which seems tailor-made for the Etsy set. It includes some 150 works made by placing crinkly metallic foil under a protective surface of reverse-painted glass, most of them by unidentified artists. 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg) 
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collagelike paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 17) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Mantegna to Matisse: Master Drawings From the Courtauld Gallery' (through Jan. 27) This show of 58 drawings from a London museum and institute of art history covers a lot of ground -- namely, the Renaissance, Baroque and Modern periods. The installation, which spills over from the lower-level galleries into the Cabinet Room off the lobby, encourages much back-and-forth between works of similar subject or virtuosity; Pontormo is paired with Michelangelo, Rubens with Rembrandt, and Goya with Daumier. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Frick Collection: 'Vincent van Gogh's Portrait of a Peasant (Patience Escalier)' (through Jan. 20) ''You'll shortly make the acquaintance of Mr. Patience Escalier -- a sort of man with a hoe, an old Camargue oxherd,'' Vincent van Gogh wrote to his brother, Theo, from the Provençal city of Arles in 1888. His bracingly vivid portrait the same year of this local character, with his grizzled beard and steely blue eyes offset by a ruddy complexion and bright yellow hat, normally resides at the Norton Simon Museum in Pasadena, Calif. But for the next few months it can be seen at the Frick as part of an exchange program between the two museums. Installed on a temporary wall in the Oval Room, it shocks the neighboring Whistler portraits with its feral gaze and forthright celebration of hard labor. 1 East 70th Street, (212) 288-0700, frick.org. (Rosenberg)
Guggenheim Museum: 'Gabriel Orozco: Asterisms' (through Jan. 13) For one-half of this two-part exhibition, Mr. Orozco and his team collected about 1,200 pieces of flotsam and jetsam that washed up on the beach of a nature preserve in Mexico. All are displayed by type in a color-coordinated rectangle on the floor along with framed grids of photographs of each item. A playing field on Pier 40 in Manhattan was similarly combed for detritus. The two presentations resemble exhibitions in a natural history museum. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through April 14) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'George Bellows' (through Feb. 18) Organized by the National Gallery in Washington, this exhibition starts strong with the lush early paintings of New York City and its residents for which Bellows is justifiably well known. It then devotes more than half its space to a disorganized reprise of his restless but steady artistic decline, which ended with his death in 1925 at 42 from a ruptured appendix. It does little to clarify his achievement, partly because of the short shrift given to his plein air oil studies and late landscape paintings. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (through Jan. 13) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Extravagant Inventions: The Princely Furniture of the Roentgens' (through Jan. 27) The first in-depth survey of the brilliant artistry and engineering of Abraham and David Roentgen, a father-and-son team of genius German cabinetmakers, features roll-top desks, writing tables, chairs and clocks. Rife with intricate inlay and marquetry, gilded mounts and hidden compartments revealed by the touch of a button, these objects were among the supreme status symbols of late-18th-century Europe. Video animations show seven of the desks in action. The show is, over all, a stealth blockbuster. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Matisse: In Search of True Painting' (through March 17) This stunning exhibition skims across the great French modernist's long, productive career with a mere 49 stellar, often pivotal paintings arranged in pairs or groups according to subject. Examining his penchant for working in series and copying his own canvases, they shed new light on the arduous evolution of Matisse's seemingly effortless art, forming one of the most thrillingly instructive exhibitions about the artist, or painting in general, that you may ever see. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Huma Bhabha: Unnatural Histories' (through April 1) In this midcareer survey, long-enduring forms from the ancient world lend some gravity to the throwaway materials that are now commonplace in contemporary sculpture. You could also say that the precariousness of recent assemblage and installation art haunts Ms. Bhabha's monstrous, totemic figures, which are typically made of Styrofoam, clay, rubber, wood scraps and wire mesh; either way, the juxtaposition is arresting. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt: Tender Love Among the Junk' (through April 1) Mr. Lanigan-Schmidt makes luminous art out of trash: candy wrappers, cling wrap, reflective plastics, aluminum foil, plastic bottles, beer cans and too many other kinds of cheap refuse to list. As this four-decade retrospective reveals, his devotion to his materials and hobbylike processes has yielded an oeuvre of transcending beauty, eroticized religiosity and poignant autobiography. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, momaps1.org. (Johnson)
MoMA PS1: 'Now Dig This! Art & Black Los Angeles 1960-1980' (through March 11) This exhibition of works by black artists who lived and worked in Los Angeles during a time of revolutionary changes happening in art and society had its debut at the Hammer Museum last year as part of the citywide extravaganza ''Pacific Standard Time: Art in L.A. 1945-1980.'' Focusing mainly on assemblage, the show includes pieces by Melvin Edwards, Betye Saar, David Hammons and nearly 30 others. It contributes a valuable chapter to the American art history of the last 50 years. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Fantasy and Invention: Rosso Fiorentino and Sixteenth-Century Florentine Drawing' (through Feb. 3) With just under 30 works, including an unfinished Rosso painting on loan from the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore, a Rosso drawing from the Metropolitan Museum and a smattering of drawings and letters by other Italian masters in the Morgan's collection, this small exhibition is a fine little introduction to the eccentricities of Florentine Mannerism and to one of the style's quirkiest practitioners, who was lauded by Vasari as ''bold and well grounded in draftsmanship, graceful in manner, sublime in the highest flights of the imagination.'' 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Artist's Choice: Trisha Donnelly' (through April 8) The 10th artist invited to select an exhibition from the Modern's collection does the series proud. Installed in three far-flung galleries within the museum's vaunted painting and sculpture collection, her effort disturbs the march of masterworks by concentrating on photographs, drawings and other works on paper as well as several kinds of design. At every turn it asks what is art, who is an artist and what makes for greatness? (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910-1925' (through April 15) This dizzying yet magisterial cornucopia covers a period when abstraction was the holy grail of modern art, feverishly pursued in numerous new styles and all mediums by creative types in Europe, Russia and elsewhere. Displaying some 350 artworks by 84 artists, including works of poetry, music and dance, it portrays with new accuracy the advent of western abstraction as a grand enterprise carried out by a heady, sometimes volatile mix of personalities, ideas and mediums. Bravi. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Inventing Abstraction: 1910 -- 1925' (through April 15) The pursuit of the holy grail of early modernism at its most feverish is presented as a multiple-medium, multinational effort in this dizzying, magisterial cornucopia. The 350-plus works by 84 artists encompass painting, sculpture, music, poetry, dance, film and photography; alternate between the tentative and the prescient; and capture something of both the terrors and thrills of the project, with clusters of paintings by Kazimir Malevich and Piet Mondrian among the high points. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Edvard Munch: The Scream' (through April 29) A version of Edvard Munch's ''Scream'' is on view at this museum for the next six months, having come almost straight from the auction block. Protected by a Plexiglas box, like the Mona Lisa, it has been given a prominent perch opposite van Gogh's ''Starry Night'' in the fifth-floor painting and sculpture galleries. There is talk of timed tickets. But if you can put up with all the pageantry, you'll have a rare chance to get acquainted with ''The Scream'' in person and in context. The museum has built a mini-exhibition around the work, surrounding it with Munch paintings and prints that amplify its motifs and mood. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
Museum of Modern Art: 'New Photography 2012' (through Feb. 4) In her pellucid photographs, Anne Collier contemplates old record album covers and an Edward Weston photograph in an old MoMA date book. In montages by Michele Abeles we see the bodies of naked men through spaces between grids and stripes cut from other printed materials. Shirana Shahbazi's abstractions picture alluring colors and light of photography itself. Zoe Crosher recycles amateur snapshots by a woman who worked as an escort in the 1960s, '70s and '80s. The two members of a team known as Birdhead use nondigital cameras and black-and-white film to shoot scenes in their hometown, Shanghai. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Alina Szapocznikow: Sculpture Undone, 1955-1972' (through Jan. 28) This small but intense exhibition is the museum's second show of an Eastern European female artist in less than a year, following the Conceptual performance and photography of ''Sanja Ivekovic: Sweet Violence.'' For many Americans it will be their first look at Ms. Szapocznikow's precocious Pop-Surrealist sculpture, much of which parallels work made on these shores by Lynda Benglis, Eva Hesse and Hannah Wilke. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Tokyo 1955-1970: A New Avant-Garde' (through Feb. 25) Modernist art, insurgent and utopian, ignited like a firecracker cluster in cities across the globe in the early 20th century, and Tokyo was one of them. Rising from the ashes after World War II, it produced huge amounts of new art, feisty, fantastic, often politically subversive. And a wave of it comes surging out at you like a blast of sound -- half noise, half music -- in this surprising exhibition made up of loans from Japan and little-seen material from MoMA's collection. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Cotter)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
&#x2605; National Academy Museum: 'John Cage: the Sight of Silence' (through Jan. 13) This solo show of John Cage's lambent late watercolors, produced in the decade or so before his death in 1992, is a superb, late addition to the 2012 Cage centenary year. It's a sort of companion to the Philadelphia Museum of Art's ''Dancing Around the Bride: Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp,'' which focuses on a transformative moment in American modernism when a heroic view of art ended, and another view, cool, wry and brainy, began. (That Philadelphia show runs through Jan. 21.) 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Cotter)
New Museum: 'Judith Bernstein: ''HARD'' ' (through Jan. 20) Ms. Bernstein is well-known for the giant drawings of phallic screws that she began making in the late 1960s. Two from the '70s are the main attractions in this much-abbreviated, 40-year retrospective, her first show in a museum. In these bravura performances of draftsmanship on vast sheets of paper, the screws extend horizontally as if they were drilling tunnels through mountains. Rendered by sweeping strokes of charcoal, they appear wildly hairy and scarily purposeful: biomechanical monstrosities of testosterone-fueled fury. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; New Museum: 'Rosemarie Trockel: A Cosmos' (through Jan. 20) This elegant, mind-expanding exhibition sidesteps the standard retrospective format and a linear, canonical version of art history. Ms. Trockel emphasizes her recent work in numerous mediums -- most impressively ceramics, photography and drawing, sharing the spotlight with outsider artists, botanical illustrations and zoological models and even natural specimens. The result is completely entrancing, a celebration of nature and also of human nature -- its curiosity, ingenuity and yearning for expression -- encapsulated by the artist's magnanimous vision. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Smith)
New-York Historical Society: 'John Rogers: American Stories' (through Feb. 18) The sculptor John Rogers (1829-1904) was the Norman Rockwell of his time. For a few decades following the Civil War, his lively, anecdotal, figurative tableaus known as Rogers Groups sold by the tens of thousands to middle- and upper-middle-class folks for about $15 apiece. Including examples of the technically impressive bronze masters from which the multiples were cast in plaster, this exhibition showcases an artist who was as remarkable for his entrepreneurial savvy as for his idealistic vision of life in America. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Radical Terrain' (through April 29) The third and last of three beautifully produced, back-to-back mini-surveys in the series Modernist Art From India, this exhibition combines landscape painting done in India in the years following independence in 1947 with recent work by young artists -- some South Asian, most not -- that corresponds to or comments on the older art. Small in size and unfamiliar in content, the show is large with history. Rubin Museum of Art, 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Feb. 3) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Studio Museum in Harlem: 'Fore' (through March 10) In 2001 the Studio Museum in Harlem opened a dynamite group exhibition called ''Freestyle,'' which turned out to be the first in a series of shows introducing emerging artists of African-American descent. In the latest edition, ''Fore,'' organized by three young staff curators, Lauren Haynes, Naima J. Keith and Thomas J. Lax, covers the waterfront in terms of media, which it samples and mixes with turntablist flair, and in its contents, ranging from abstract to personal to political, sometimes combining all three. Firelei Báez, Sadie Barnette, Crystal Z. Campbell, Zachary Fabri, Yashua Klos, Akosua Adoma Owusu, Valerie Piraino and Nikki Pressley are some of the names to look for. 144 West 125th Street, (212) 864-4500, studiomuseum.org. (Cotter)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Richard Artschwager!' (through Feb. 3) Mr. Artschwager had his first career retrospective at the Whitney Museum in 1988, and now, at 88, he is having his second. Much of the work -- the furniturelike sculptures covered with wood-grain Formica and the paintings that appeared to be done with smudged soot -- is familiar. His recent portraits of George W. Bush and Osama bin Laden, and his high-color landscapes of the American Southwest are not. An installation of his famous ''blps'' (pronounced blips), abstract lozenge forms, usually black and shaped like the uprights in an exclamation point, is in place on and around the High Line near the site of the Whitney's future home at Gansevoort and Washington Streets. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Sinister Pop' and 'Dark and Deadpan: Pop in TV and the Movies' (through March 31) The dark and truculent mood of this collection show is conversant with recent presentations of Warhol's death-and-disaster paintings, but the curators make plenty of room for other artists (including photographers). The point is not to cast a pall over Pop as we know it; it's to find common ground between the winking consumerism of early-1960s art and the antiwar, anti-corporate sentiment of work made later in the decade and into the 1970s. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Plymouth Rock 2' (through Jan. 27) ''Plymouth Rock 2,'' a single-room installation by a young up-and-comer consists of seemingly random video scenes projected on one wall and banal, shadow-casting objects on the floor. Images of heaving ocean swells shot from a swimmer's point of view and of a beachcomber with a metal detector imply some kind of quest like a search for the Holy Grail, which turns out to be Plymouth Rock, the boulder whereon, legend has it, the Pilgrims first alighted in the New World, now a sadly nondescript tourist attraction.

Galleries: Uptown
&#x2605; 'Calder: The Complete Bronzes' (through Feb. 9) The ingenious master of spare, levitating modern sculpture in wire, wood and sheet metal turns out to have been almost as adept with the ancient dead-weight staple of bronze, as demonstrated by 35 examples and some dozen plaster models in this eye-opening show. They run the gamut from figurative to abstract; dabble in Surrealism; achieve their own kind of levitation; and delve into art history while enabling the artist to use his hands and amazing tactile sense in a different way. L&M Arts, 45 East 78th Street, (212) 861-0020, lmgallery.com. (Smith)
Bob Dylan: 'Revisionist Art' (through Jan. 12) Bob Dylan may be a genius but he's no polymath. His music is great. His attempts at visual art have gone from bad to worse. From paintings based on photographs, he has turned to full-on appropriation with silk-screened works that rejigger the words and pictures on the covers of magazines like Time, Life, Playboy and Rolling Stone. Alternately obscure or obvious, these attempts at social satire suggest that the line between naïveté and cynicism is sometimes very thin. Gagosian Gallery, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 744-2313, gagosian.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Where is Jack Goldstein?' (through Jan. 15) Jack Goldstein, who died a suicide at 57 in 2003, was one of contemporary art's mystery men. He made his mark in New York in the late 1970s and 1980s as one of group of artists working with media-inspired imagery. Then in the 1990s, he more or less disappeared, personally and professionally. This show of 13 paintings -- with images lifted from photographs of lightning strikes, unexplained explosions and aerial bombardments -- makes a strong case for a continued interest. Venus Over Manhattan, 980 Madison Avenue, at 76th Street, (212) 980-0700, venusovermanhattan.com. (Cotter)
Galleries: Chelsea
&#x2605; Trisha Baga: 'The Biggest Circle' (through Jan. 12) Trisha Baga creates transporting, frowzy installations of video projections, paintings, sculptures and scattered objects. For one, you don 3-D glasses and headphones, through which you hear the popular art historian Sister Wendy lecturing on canonical painters while shifting configurations of vividly dimensional abstract shapes play on the wall. ''Bag's Circle'' centers on a floor-to-ceiling projection of the revolving, circular mouth of a much-used paper bag, a symbol, perhaps, of a wide-open mind. Greene Naftali, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 463-7770, greenenaftaligallery.com. (Johnson)
'Cellblock I' and 'Cellblock II' (through Feb. 2) This pair of strenuously cerebral group shows, both organized by the scholar Robert Hobbs, envision the artwork as a kind of prison (formalist and otherwise). ''Cellblock I,'' in the main gallery, includes large paintings by Peter Halley, plans for underground mazes by Alice Aycock, works from Robert Motherwell's ''Open'' series and Kelley Walker's canvases printed with images of brick walls. The livelier ''Cellblock II,'' in the gallery's new project space down the street, gathers smaller works by some of the same artists in ''Cellblock I,'' along with others like Robert Morris, Bruce Nauman and Nancy Holt. Andrea Rosen, 525 West 24th Street, Chelsea, (212) 627-6000, andrearosengallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Agnes Denes: 'Sculptures of the Mind: 1968 to Now' (through Jan. 19) By the end of the 1960s, art's final frontier was mind itself, and Agnes Denes has been one of its brainiest and far-ranging explorers. This much abridged retrospective includes a miniature tableau of skeletons in philosophical conversation, diagrams of a system of symbolic logic that Ms. Denes thought up, and photographs of outdoor works like the wheat field she planted on a parcel of landfill near the World Trade Center in 1982. Leslie Tonkonow, 535 West 22nd Street, (212) 255-8450, tonkonow.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Carroll Dunham' (through Jan. 19) All nine of Mr. Dunhams big, comical and exhilarating paintings represent landscapes resembling a South Pacific paradise, with chunky, fat-leafed trees and colorful, spongy flowers. Six feature the figure of a naked woman of heroic proportions with chalk-white skin and untamed black hair drawn in thick black lines, bathing, swimming and cavorting in this Edenic setting. She might be the artist's own inner wild woman. Gladstone, 515 West 24th Street, (212) 206-9300, gladstonegallery.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; 'Keltie Ferris' (through Jan. 12) Keltie Ferris's big, scintillating paintings feel fresh, direct and very much of this moment. That's partly because they seem to picture a kind of visual experience that did not exist before the advent of digital forms of visualization. Made with lively immediacy on canvases up to nearly nine feet in their longest dimensions, they give the impression of computer-screen imagery breaking up into pixels and blurs. Mitchell-Innes & Nash, 534 West 26th Street, (212) 744-7400, miandn.com. (Johnson)
Alicja Kwade: 'The Heavy Weight of Light' (through Jan. 12) Elegantly understated works by this Berlin artist are as much thought experiments as sculptures. A folding screen of clear glass panels with electric globe lights on the floor on either side becomes a puzzle about perceptions and reflections. Clocks on the walls run faster and slower than normal. Pieces of pipe and lumber apparently have become rubberized. It gives pause to consider a world so arbitrarily variable. Harris Lieberman, 508 West 26th Street, (212) 206-1290, harrislieberman.com. (Johnson)
Chris McCaw: 'Marking Time' (through Jan. 19) In Chris McCaw's haunting yet matter-of-fact photographs, the sun has burned crispy-edged lines across the skies of spectral land- and seascapes. Mr. McCaw constructs his own large-format cameras, which he equips with military surveillance lenses. Traveling to remote places, he exposes sheets of photo paper for durations from 15 minutes to 24 hours. The lens concentrates the sun into an inflammatory dot, which cuts through the paper like a welder's torch slicing through steel. Yossi Milo, 245 10th Avenue, near 24th Street, (212) 414-0370, yossimilo.com. (Johnson)
John A. Parks: 'Paint and Memory' (through Jan. 19) The strange, seemingly innocent paintings that dominate this show are small, based on the artist's childhood memories and painted with his fingers. The loosely Pointillist, somewhat Vuillardian hazes of color, light and form that result demarcate trees, gardens, brick buildings, puffy clouds and, above all, scrambling children, whose feral energy and natural subversiveness are vividly conveyed. The distinction between illustration and painting is rendered moot by the teeming quality of both surface and subject. 532 Gallery Thomas Jaeckel, 532 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (917) 701-3338, 532gallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Charles Ray' (through Jan. 12) This striking show features the sculptor's latest forays into post-Conceptual realism, namely two male nudes -- one standing and one crouching -- and a clothed, homeless woman sleeping on a bench. Oddly luminous, finely detailed, 10 percent larger than life and carved by computer-driven machines in solid stainless steel, they form a beautifully spare arrangement and a cat's cradle of ricocheting ideas that both update and disrupt longstanding sculptural motifs, techniques and traditions. Matthew Marks Gallery, 522 West 22nd Street, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarks.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Ed Ruscha' (through Jan. 12) Derived from a larger exhibition that appeared at the Kunsthaus Bregenz in Austria in the fall, this reading-themed show includes three marvelous new ''vanitas'' paintings that subject a blank, open book to the ravages of time. Also here are found-object works made by scratching and bleaching books, and painted works that foil or assault would-be readers with meaningless palindromes, redacted texts and profane titles. Mr. Ruscha, unlike other artists of his generation, does not seem inclined to brood over the death of print; if anything, he is cracking wise at its funeral.

Galleries: Other
'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info.

Out of Town
&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best. On the National Mall, at Independence Avenue Southwest and Seventh Street, Washington, (202) 633-4674, hirshhorn.si.edu; free. (Smith)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh, Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
National Gallery of Art: 'Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' (through Jan. 13) The first major survey of this Pop artist's career work since his death, at 73, in 1997, is a big show and has some slow spots, but on the whole it moves right along. As always, Lichtenstein's large-featured images, with their Ben-Day dot patterns; thick, black contours; and flat, bright colors are almost ergonomically comfortable to the eye. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Philadelphia Museum of Art: 'Dancing Around the Bride: Cage, Cunningham, Johns, Rauschenberg and Duchamp' (through Jan. 21) The Philadelphia show, an ensemble performance composed of entirely stars, with an elusive sun, Marcel Duchamp, at the center, focuses on a transformative moment in American modernism when a heroic view of art ended, and another view, cool, wry and brainy, began. In Manhattan, the most radical of all those stars, John Cage, gets a solo show of his lambent late watercolors in honor of his 2012 centenary year. (That Manhattan show, ''John Cage: The Sight of Silence'' at the National Academy Museum, runs through Jan. 13.) Benjamin Franklin Parkway at 26th Street, (215) 763-8100, philamuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; The Walters Art Museum: 'Revealing the African Presence in Renaissance Europe' (through Jan. 21) This history-rattling exhibition is a visual gift, with marvelous things by artists familiar and revered -- Durer, Rubens, Veronese -- along with images most of us never knew existed. Together, they map a history of art, politics and race that few museums have addressed in full-dress style. Like the best scholarship, the Walters show, organized by Joaneath Spicer, the museum's curator of Renaissance and Baroque art, is as much about questions as answers. It takes a prized piece of art history, one polished to a glow by generations of attention, and turns it in an unexpected direction, so it catches the searching, scouring rays of new investigative light. (From Feb. 16 to June 9 it will be at the Princeton University Art Museum in Princeton, N.J.) 600 North Charles Street, Baltimore, (410) 547-9000, thewalters.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Yale University Art Gallery (continuing) In a museum era dominated by vying forces of bad economics and compulsive building, it's a miracle when something comes out right, which makes the opening of the splendidly renovated and expanded Yale University Art Gallery a happy event. The angels of art, design and budgetary planning were on duty. Everything worked. The country's oldest university art museum has arrived at a kind institutional ideal of opposites in balance: an encyclopedic teaching museum, big enough to get lost in, small enough for intimate art encounters. New galleries of Indo-Pacific art are a particular attraction, but so are other collections, including one of the countries premier holdings in American art and a small, matchless display of very early Italian Renaissance painting. A special exhibition, ''Societe Anonyme: Modernism for America,'' made up of Yale-owned material, is on view through July 14. 1111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu.

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (closes on Sunday) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, (212) 992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Ann Hamilton: 'the event of a thread' (closes on Sunday) Art as thought-provoking playground, this elaborate installation-performance piece centers on 42 large swings to be enjoyed by viewers, and the enormous silk curtain hanging among them, from the rafters, that their swinging agitates. A kind of weaving together of language and sound, movement and stillness, form and behavior, public and private, it is the artist's most interactive work yet and a big improvement over her fastidious previous efforts, which often resembled esoteric window displays. Park Avenue Armory, 643 Park Avenue, at 67th Street, (212) 616-3930, armoryonpark.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (closes on Sunday) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help being overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)' (closes Sunday) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with Japan Society's show giving us a more concentrated view of the style. 333 East 47th Street, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (closes on Sunday) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (closes on Sunday) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Colors of the Universe: Chinese Hardstone Carvings' (closes on Sunday) In the good-things-come-in-small-packages sweepstakes, this show can't have much competition. Each of the exhibition's 60 miniature sculptures, dating from the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), is a nugget of show-off virtuosity and doesn't pretend to be much else, though at least a few have ostensible functions. A tight cluster of lotus leaves carved from Chalcedony doubles as a cup, but good luck trying to sip tea from its lobed rim. A carnelian vase in the form of a gourd could hardly be less vaselike; its real purpose is to draw attention to the ingenious way the artist has turned a natural pattern of light-color rock veins into a network of creeping vines. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Haroon Mirza: 'Preoccupied Waveforms' (closes on Sunday) Haroon Mirza, who recycles and reprograms old electronics in his site-specific sound-and-light installations (one of which earned him the Silver Lion at the 54th Venice Biennial), seems to have too much space on his hands in his solo show at the New Museum's adjacent project gallery. The scattered videos playing on boxy analog televisions, the low beeps emanating from the speakers and the flashing strings of LED lights looped around the floor and ceiling come across as a series of isolated incidents, though they are connected by wires and code. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Durer to de Kooning: 100 Master Drawings From Munich' (closes Sunday) A few years ago the Morgan lent a cache of drawings to the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. Now it's payback time, and 100 choice drawings from that venerable German museum are in New York. Mantegna, Michelangelo and Raphael are among the serious marquee names, nicely balanced with cartoon heads by Sigmar Polke. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 686-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (closes on Sunday) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the now two-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (closes on Monday) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (closes on Monday) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine Godé-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
'Arpita Singh' (closes on Saturday) Arpita Singh, who was born in West Bengal in 1937 and has long lived in New Delhi, makes an infrequent New York appearance with this small, fine show of recent watercolors. Ms. Singh began her career as an abstract artist, then switched to painting folkloric scenes of daily life in Bengal before settling on the enigmatic, quasi-narrative mode that has become her signature. And that's what we see here: art that isn't precisely topical or allegorical or autobiographical, but partly all of these. DC Moore Gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 247-2111, dcmooregallery.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'Hito Steyerl' (closes on Saturday) The New York solo debut of the Berlin-based artist and writer Hito Steyerl is one of the most stimulating gallery shows of the season. The artist works primarily in video, but broadens the medium to include documentary, staged history, found film images, and the near-equivalent of home movies. And whether dealing with radical politics or personal friendship, the two in some cases inseparable, she refuses to nail down a single idea, or point of view. Instead, we get art as an act of moral thinking-in-progress. e-flux, 311 East Broadway, at Grand Street, Lower East Side, (212) 619-3356, e-flux.com. (Cotter)
Richard Walker: 'House Paintings' (closes on Saturday) The small, mysterious depictions of darkened interiors in this Scottish painter's impressive second New York solo mix the spontaneity of traditional oil studies with aspects of setup photography and installation art. The scenes, painted from life in a slightly Havishamish house, include projections of Mr. Walker's photographs of other parts of the building and its garden. A result is a disquieting mix of spatial ambiguity and emotional resonance. Alexandre Gallery, 41 East 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 755-2828, alexandregallery.com. (Smith)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: GUGGENHEIM MUSEUM: 'PICASSO BLACK AND WHITE': (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's career, this show is as eye opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la ''Guernica'' (''Head of a Horse, Sketch for Guernica,'' from 1937, is above), and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: 38 of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5 have never been on view.

HEADLINE: Automakers End 2012 With Sales at 5-Year High

BYLINE: By BILL VLASIC

 BODY:
DETROIT -- Automakers on Thursday reported their strongest sales year since 2007, posting solid December results in the United States and promising more growth in 2013.
Sales of new cars and trucks increased 9 percent in December, a gain that put total sales for 2012 at about 14.5 million vehicles -- the industry's best performance in five years, according to the research firm Autodata.
That represents a 13 percent increase over 2011, and raises expectations that demand will continue to rise as more Americans need to replace their aging vehicles with new models. 
Auto executives forecast that the United States market would grow to at least 15.5 million this year and possibly higher, if housing starts and other economic factors continue to improve.
''For the industry, 2012 was mission accomplished,'' said Jesse Toprak, an analyst with the auto research site TrueCar.com. ''Companies are hitting their sales goals, and they are doing it with fewer incentives.''
Much of the growth has been concentrated in the comebacks of Toyota and Honda from supply chain disruptions caused by the earthquake and tsunami in Japan two years ago. And while automakers like Chrysler and Volkswagen posted hefty increases throughout the year, the two biggest American companies, General Motors and Ford Motor, lagged the overall gains.
December was a microcosm of the year's results, as G.M. and Ford on Thursday reported smaller sales increases than those of their chief domestic, European and Asian rivals. G.M. said sales in December increased 4.9 percent, compared with the same month a year ago, primarily because of new products like the Cadillac ATS sedan and higher incentives on its Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra pickups.
The company had been losing ground in the high-profit pickup segment until it added discounts to the Silverado, which posted a 6.1 percent sales increase in December, and the Sierra, which was up 13.4 percent. For the year, G.M. sold 2.59 million vehicles, an increase of 3.7 percent from 2011.
G.M.'s head of United States sales, Kurt McNeil, said the company expected significant growth to about 15.5 million vehicles industrywide this year. He noted that Tuesday's pact on the fiscal crisis in Washington removed potential concerns for consumers shopping for new vehicles.
''We are especially pleased that the politicians on both sides of the aisle in Washington were able to compromise,'' Mr. McNeil said in a conference call with analysts on Thursday. ''The short-term crisis has passed.''
Ford reported a slight sales increase of 1.6 percent in December, as safety recalls for its new Escape S.U.V. and Fusion sedan depressed its overall results. Ford said that sales of the Fusion dropped 10.8 percent during the month, and Escape sales slid 21.3 percent. The company has been plagued with multiple recalls on engines and other parts on the new vehicles, which are usually among its strongest sellers.
The drop-off was mitigated by strong results for Ford's two smallest cars, the Focus, which increased in sales by 58.3 percent, and the Fiesta, which was up by 52.8 percent.
For all of 2012, Ford's United States sales increased 4.7 percent, to 2.24 million vehicles. Ken Czubay, head of Ford's United States sales and marketing, said the company's small-car sales were its best in more than a decade.
Ford predicted that industry sales could possibly reach 16 million vehicles in 2013, as more consumers trade in older models and buy new, more fuel-efficient ones. That peak hasn't been reached since sales of 16.1 million in 2007.
Chrysler, the smallest of the Detroit companies, was the star performer in December, with a 10.4 percent increase.
The company's new compact car, the Dodge Dart, gained traction with sales of 6,100 -- its highest monthly total since it was introduced last summer. Much of Chrysler's lineup -- ranging from Jeep S.U.V.'s to the tiny Fiat 500 -- posted sales records for the month of December. For the year, Chrysler said it sold 1.65 million vehicles, a 20.6 percent increase from 2011.
Toyota reported a 9 percent sales gain in December, which was one of the weaker months in its turnaround in 2012. The company said it sold 2.08 million vehicles in the United States for the full year, which was a 26.6 percent gain over 2011. Its three top-selling vehicles -- the Corolla compact car, Camry sedan and Prius gas-electric hybrid -- accounted for nearly half of its overall sales for the year.
Analysts said Toyota appeared poised to outperform the overall market this year as well.
''Fresh products like the all-new RAV4 S.U.V. should help keep the momentum going,'' said Jessica Caldwell, an analyst with the car research site Edmunds.com.
Honda ended the year on a high note, reporting a 26.2 percent jump in sales in December in the United States. Its bellwether cars, the Accord and Civic, led the way, each with increases of more than 60 percent. For the year, Honda said it sold 1.14 million vehicles, a 24 percent gain from 2011.
Other automakers had mixed results. Nissan said its December sales dropped 1.6 percent, but the company ended 2012 with a 9.5 percent gain for the year.
Volkswagen closed the year with another banner month. The German automaker reported a 29.9 percent gain for December and a 30.6 percent increase for the full year.

HEADLINE: Swiss Bank Pleads Guilty to Helping American Tax Dodgers

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN

 BODY:
Switzerland's oldest private bank on Thursday admitted to helping Americans evade United States taxes, the first time a foreign financial institution has pleaded guilty to tax law violations.
Representatives for Wegelin & Company, a Swiss bank founded in 1741, appeared in Federal District Court in Manhattan and acknowledged that for nearly a decade the firm helped dozens of wealthy American customers dodge taxes by hiding more than $1.2 billion in secret accounts.
As part of guilty plea, Wegelin agreed to pay $74 million in fines, restitution and forfeiture proceeds to the United States government. Several Wegelin executives appeared at the hearing before Judge Jed S. Rakoff, including one of its managing partners, Konrad Hummler, a well-known figure in the Swiss private banking industry.
"From about 2002 through 2010, Wegelin agreed with certain U.S. taxpayers to evade the tax obligations of these U.S. taxpayer clients, who filed false tax returns with the I.R.S." Otto Bruderer, another Wegelin partner, said in court. "Wegelin was aware the conduct was wrong." 
Mr. Bruderer said that Wegelin assisted the American clients because it believed that it would not be prosecuted in the United States because it had no offices here, and had acted in accordance with Swiss law. He also noted that the conduct was common practice in the Swiss banking industry.
Although Wegelin ceases to exist as a business, the firm's partners sold its non-American client accounts last January to the Raiffeisen Group, an Austrian bank, just before its indictment. That move was sharply criticized by Judge Rakoff in a court hearing last year as a "fraud upon fraud."
Nevertheless, Wegelin's admission of guilt represents a victory for the Obama administration in its sweeping crackdown on Americans using offshore banks to evade taxes. It also demonstrates the long arm of the Justice Department, extracting a guilty plea from a foreign company with no business operations in the United States.
The case strikes another blow at Swiss banking secrecy, a shadowy world that United States authorities have penetrated recently after decades of looking the other way. For years, secrecy has been a hallmark - and an attractive selling point - of Switzerland's private banks, which, alongside chocolate and watchmaking, are one of the country's best-known businesses.
In 2009, UBS avoided criminal charges by striking a so-called deferred prosecution agreement in which it paid a $780 million fine and turned over the names of about 4,500 clandestine accounts believed to hold the assets of American taxpayers. Around the same time, the Internal Revenue Service initiated an amnesty program that allowed Americans to avoid criminal liability by divulging offshore accounts. The program was a success, yielding more than $2.7 billion in taxes and penalties from about 30,000 taxpayers.
As part of the push to eliminate tax cheats, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Wegelin last February. The firm's elaborate scheme involved its Swiss bankers' opening secret accounts for American clients using code names and setting up sham entities to avoid detection in far-flung locales, including Panama and Liechtenstein.
"There is no excuse for wealthy Americans flouting their responsibilities as citizens of this great country to pay their taxes, and there is no excuse for foreign financial institutions helping them to do so," said Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan. "Today's guilty plea is a watershed moment in our efforts to hold to account both the individuals and the banks - wherever they may be in the world - who are engaging in unlawful conduct that deprives the U.S. Treasury of billions of dollars of tax revenue."
Mr. Bharara's office had also brought an indictment against three Wegelin executives last year, but they are expected to avoid facing the charges because a treaty between Switzerland and the United States does not provide for extradition of Swiss individuals for tax crimes.
The Justice Department said that Wegelin had lured clients away from larger Swiss financial institutions like UBS after those banks came under investigation. As of December 2010, Wegelin had about $25 billion in assets under management.
From its headquarters in St. Gallen, a quiet mountain town in northeast Switzerland, Wegelin pitched itself as a safe haven for American taxpayers because it had no operations in the United States. A Web site marketing Wegelin's services said, "Neither the Swiss government nor any other government can obtain information about your bank account."
Included in the $74 million in penalties is about $16 million in forfeited proceeds that Wegelin held in a UBS bank account in Stamford, Conn. The account, prosecutors said, was used to launder money from Switzerland to American clients and conceal that money from United States tax authorities.
The balance of the penalties is more than $20 million in restitution for taxes evaded, about $16 million in fees on American taxpayer client accounts and a fine of about $22 million. Wegelin was represented by Richard M. Strassberg of the law firm Goodwin Procter.
Just two months after the case was brought against UBS, Wegelin raised the hackles of the Justice Department. In April 2009, Mr. Hummler, the Wegelin partner, wrote an eight-page note titled "Farewell America." The memo by Mr. Hummler, who served as chairman of the Swiss Private Bankers Association, championed Swiss banking laws and said that Wegelin was in the process of recommending that its clients exit all direct investments in United States securities. Mainly, though, the note was a rambling jeremiad against the United States.
"The U.S.A. has fought by far the largest number of wars, sometimes with, but mostly without a U.N. mandate," Mr. Hummler wrote. "It has broken the international laws of war, maintained secret prisons, and fought an absurd war against drugs."
"A country," he continued, "whose underclass enjoys neither the benefits of an adequate education, nor a halfway functional health care system; a country whose economic system is increasingly inclined to overconsumption, and in which saving and investing have increasingly become alien concepts, a situation that has undoubtedly been one of the driving forces behind the current recession, with all its catastrophic consequences for the whole world."
After representatives of Wegelin failed to appear in federal court at the time of its indictment last February, federal prosecutors labeled the Swiss bank a "fugitive."
The typically colorful Judge Rakoff was subdued during Thursday's hearing. But in a court session last January, he blasted Wegelin for selling its non-United States business just before an indictment, suggesting that it was a blatant effort to shield its assets from the United States government.
If an American partnership had taken those actions, Judge Rakoff said, "the government would be here saying with perhaps considerable force that this was a fraud upon fraud compounding the prior alleged crime with patent evasions and consciousness of guilt."
Daniel Levy, a federal prosecutor, did not disagree. "That would be one reasonable view of the facts," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Barnes & Noble's Strategy Is Questioned as Nook Sales Decline

BYLINE: By LESLIE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
For Barnes & Noble, the digital future is not what it used to be.
After a year spent signaling its commitment to build its business through its Nook division, Barnes & Noble on Thursday announced disappointing holiday sales figures, with steep declines that underscored the challenge it faces in transforming from its traditional retail format.
Retail sales from the company's bookstores and its Web site, BN.com, decreased 10.9 percent from the comparable nine-week holiday period a year earlier, to $1.2 billion, the company reported. More worrisome for the long-term future of the company, sales in the Nook unit that includes e-readers, tablets, digital content and accessories decreased 12.6 percent over the same period, to $311 million. 
"They are not selling the devices, they are not selling books and traffic is down," said Mike Shatzkin, the founder and chief executive of Idea Logical, a consultant to publishers. "I'm looking for an optimistic sign and not seeing one. It is concerning."
The results, covering a period that ended Dec. 29, are a sobering development for the nation's largest bookstore chain. The declines occurred during what is supposed to be peak buying season. And the Nook unit's sagging fortunes came despite a 13 percent increase in sales of digital content, suggesting that it is the tepid demand for Nook devices that is dragging down the unit's performance. Over all, the numbers underscore the difficult challenge the company faces in an increasingly competitive e-reading market.
Barnes & Noble has invested heavily in developing a tablet that can compete with offerings from media giants like Google, Apple and Amazon.com. Last April, in announcing a $300 million investment in Nook by Microsoft, the chief executive of Barnes & Noble's chief executive, William J. Lynch, said the company wanted "to solidify our position as a leader in the exploding market for digital content in the consumer and education segments."
A few months after that, the bookseller began breaking out the financial results of the Nook division, In October it completed its strategic partnership with Microsoft by creating Nook Media, a subsidiary and a signal that it was ready to ride its digital business into the future.
But while Barnes & Noble's most recent Nooks have won critical praise, they have failed to gain significant traction with consumers.
Other companies do not break out sales of their digital tablets, but Amazon has been saying sales of its Kindle Fire were strong. Analysts say Apple's iPads also appear to be doing well.
"The problem is not whether or not the Nook is good," said James L. McQuivey, a media analyst for Forrester Research. "What matters is whether you are locked into a Kindle library or an iTunes library or a Nook library. In the end, who holds the content that you value?"
For an increasing number of consumers, he said, the answer is not Barnes & Noble.
Though the company's stock was down only slightly - falling 2 percent to $14.22 - the reaction in the financial world was unsparing. Analysts stopped short of saying that this was a do-or-die moment for the Nook Media division, but they acknowledged that options for a strong digital future were narrowing.
In a note to clients, S&P Capital IQ said, "We think this portends greater market share losses for the Nook over the medium term" and downgraded its recommendation on Barnes & Noble stock from hold to sell. Barclays said in a note that the Nook's precipitous decline was "quite concerning" and "below even our modest expectations."
The declining retail numbers were also troubling when viewed in the context of a rise in sales among independent booksellers. The American Booksellers Association, which has not yet released official holiday sales, estimated Thursday that its members' sales would be up about 8 percent over last year.
Barnes & Noble executives were not available Thursday to discuss the sales numbers. But a statement from Mr. Lynch indicated that the company was searching for a solution.
"Nook device sales got off to a good start over the Black Friday period, but then fell short of expectations for the balance of holiday," Mr. Lynch said. "We are examining the root cause of the December shortfall in sales, and will adjust our strategies accordingly going forward."
The most intriguing, and troublesome, question is whether the company can stay in the digital device business at all over the long run. Nook has been expensive to develop and market and the company does not have the hefty financial resources of its competitors.
Other options are strategic partnerships. Microsoft's investment last spring was seen at the time as a way to promote Nook through a powerful partner. But sales of the Windows 8 operating system have been disappointing and the Nook has been featured as little more than an app among hundreds on the Windows 8 platform.
"It is going to prove to be a missed opportunity," said Mr. McQuivey of Forrester.
Last month, Barnes & Noble announced that Pearson, the British education and publishing conglomerate, was taking a 5 percent stake in Nook for $89.5 million. Analysts said that cash investment was welcome and the partnership with Pearson, a major publisher of educational textbooks, might herald a strategy to move toward dominating an education niche market. Still, that would be a significantly smaller business.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HOW TO THINK MORE ABOUT SEXBy Alain de Botton
Illustrated. 185 pages. Picador. $16.HOW TO STAY SANEBy Philippa PerryIllustrated. 171 pages. Picador. $16.
One of the drawbacks of working in a bookstore, something I did for many years, is that it can be like working in a small-town pharmacy: You learn things about people you might rather not know. What sort of face do you put on when your new girlfriend's mother comes to the counter with a Newt Gingrich novel, a scented candle and a copy of ''The Herpes Survival Guide''?
Self-help books are fraught with peril. There is the peril of being caught with one or having a guest find it in your bathroom, tucked behind back issues of The Economist. There is the peril of taking crackpot advice. There is finally the peril, given the subprimate level of intelligence and wit in most self-help books, of leading millions of your innocent brain cells into the killing fields. 
Alain de Botton, the philosophy-minded Swiss writer (''How Proust Can Change Your Life,'' ''The Pleasures and Sorrows of Work'') who has long resided in England, has begun issuing a new series of books, written by himself and others, titled The School of Life. A better and more aspirational name for this series might be Self-Help Books for the Rest of Us.
These books are small, well under 200 pages. Their publicity material warmly extols their ''French flaps,'' ''deckle edge'' and ''handy, giftable trim size.'' They're damnably cute. To carry one is to announce, ''If I am toting a book this foxy and literate-seeming, how bad can my troubles really be?''
The first two books in the series to be released in America have somewhat contradictory titles: ''How to Think More About Sex,'' by Mr. de Botton, and ''How to Stay Sane,'' by a British psychotherapist and writer named Philippa Perry. Cogitating on sex rarely, in my experience, leads to the sheltered private island of sanity and well-being. Thinking too much about sex tends to get you kicked off that island.
Mr. de Botton's book is by far the better one: It's funnier and rangier, more lucid and more provocative. It's nerdy-dirty, a kind of nonfiction analog to Nicholson Baker's 1992 phone-sex novel, ''Vox.''
Summing up the bummers inherent in sex in a long-term relationship, for example, he declares: ''We may in fact find it easier to put on a rubber mask or pretend to be a predatory, incestuous relative with someone we're not also going to have to eat breakfast with for the next three decades.'' ''So true,'' you pencil in the margins.
It's difficult to synthesize the ground Mr. de Botton covers in ''How to Think More About Sex,'' but at base it's a meditation on how comprehensively disruptive our urges can be. ''Sex will never be simple or nice in the ways we might like it to be,'' he observes. ''It is not fundamentally democratic or kind; it is bound up with cruelty, transgression and the desire for subjugation and humiliation. It refuses to sit neatly on top of love, as it should.''
One of the best things about this book is that Mr. de Botton allows his mind to wander to some strange, counterintuitive places. He proposes new, more accurate language for brides and grooms to employ at the altar: ''I promise to be disappointed by you and you alone. I promise to make you the sole repository of my regrets, rather than distribute them widely through multiple affairs and a life of sexual Don Juanism. I have surveyed the different options for unhappiness, and it is you I have chosen to commit myself to.''
There are other thought experiments. He argues for impotence as ''evidence of an evolved type of kindness'' and ''an achievement of the ethical imagination.'' When spouses cheat, he suggests, the betrayed should consider saying sorry first -- ''sorry for being themselves, sorry for getting old, sorry for being boring sometimes, sorry for forcing their partners to lie by setting the bar of truthfulness forbiddingly high and (while we are at it), sorry for being human.''
You will wince sometimes during ''How to Think More About Sex.'' Mr. de Botton bemoans, for example, the narrow range of fetish Web sites out there. Let's have sites, he argues, ''for people turned on by cardigans, by blushing, by people driving and by people reading.'' Someone introduce this man to the Hallmark Channel.
I've long had a love-hate relationship with Mr. de Botton's prose. I admire his crispness and perceptiveness. I shudder at his preciousness. There seems to be no aspect of human existence, sex included, that he can't tidy up with an apple-cheeked aphorism.
The best in him, however, nearly always trumps the worst. ''How to Think More About Sex'' is an honest book that's on the prowl for honest insight. ''In a world in which fake enthusiasms are rife, in which it is often hard to tell whether people really like us or whether they are being kind to us merely out of a sense of duty,'' Mr. de Botton announces, our brute sexual responses ''function as unambiguous agents of sincerity.''
Ms. Perry's ''How to Stay Sane'' is an intelligent and worthy book, filled with sensible advice about how to understand ourselves more fully. It will surely help people. It contains information about eliminating ''self-sabotaging patterns'' and how to engage in the ''practice of mindfulness'' and how to go about ''rewriting the narratives that define us.''
It's also mostly dead on the page. It's full of sentences like this one: ''I'm not saying that one way of self-referencing is always superior to the other, but I do want to stress the desirability of increasing our awareness of how we reference ourselves so that we can work out how we place ourselves on the internal-external scale.''
In the School of Life, as in any kind of school, it's among a professor's first duties to keep his or her students awake.

HEADLINE: Vanderbeek Buys Out His Fellow Owners of the Devils

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON

 BODY:
After years of financial intrigue and infighting, Jeff Vanderbeek, the controlling owner of the Devils, has bought out his partners and now owns all of the team and its home, the Prudential Center in Newark. 
Vanderbeek had been negotiating simultaneously with his lenders, who were owed about $77 million in overdue debt, and the team's two other owners, Michael Gilfillan who, like Vanderbeek, owned 47 percent of the team, and Peter Simon, who owned the remaining 6 percent.
With the backing of Gary Bettman, the commissioner of the N.H.L., Vanderbeek kept the banks at bay and worked out a deal to refinance part of the team's debt, which is about $178 million over all.
Vanderbeek did not announce the terms of the deal. But with interest rates near record lows, refinancing a chunk of the team's debt most likely freed money to pay down some of it.
It is unclear how much, if any, of that money was used to buy the shares owned by Gilfillan and Simon.
Despite the N.H.L.'s lockout of its players, which is now in its fourth month, the Devils' long playoff run last season and the Prudential Center's busy schedule of nonhockey events, including concerts, helped persuade the banks to proceed with the refinancing.
''The organization believes that its successful refinancing during a work stoppage demonstrates the strength of the Devils' franchise and the Prudential Center, enabling it to continue to execute on its business plan,'' Vanderbeek said in a statement.
The Devils are worth $205 million, the 19th most valuable franchise in the N.H.L., according to Forbes. The team had revenue of $122 million last season and an operating profit of $2.8 million, Forbes said.
While a new collective bargaining agreement between the N.H.L. and its players is still being hammered out, it is almost certain that the Devils and other teams will receive a greater share of the league's revenue, perhaps another reason banks were willing to refinance some of the Devils' debts.

HEADLINE: Job Market Strengthened as the Year Wound Down

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The United States job market showed resilience in three reports released on Thursday, suggesting it may withstand a continuing federal budget battle that threatens more economic uncertainty in coming months. 
One survey showed that private hiring increased last month, while another said that layoffs declined and a third showed that applications for unemployment benefits stayed near a four-year low.
The data led some economists to raise their forecasts for December job growth one day before the Labor Department releases its closely watched employment report.
''The job market held firm in December despite the intensifying fiscal cliff negotiations,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics. ''Businesses even became somewhat more aggressive in their hiring at year end.''
The most positive sign came from ADP. Its monthly employment survey showed businesses added 215,000 jobs last month, the most in 10 months and much higher than November's total of 148,000.
Economists tend to approach the ADP survey with some skepticism because it has diverged sharply at times from the government's job figures.
But some economists were also hopeful after noting that businesses were less inclined to cut jobs last month.
The consulting firm Challenger, Gray & Christmas said that the number of announced job cuts fell 43 percent in December from November, and that overall planned layoffs in 2012 fell to the lowest level since 1997.
The weekly number of people who applied for unemployment figures rose by 10,000, but the four-week average was little changed at 360,000 last week. That's only slightly above the previous week's 359,750, which was the lowest since March 2008.
Most economists expect the Labor Department report will show that employers added about 150,000 jobs last month and that the unemployment rate stayed at 7.7 percent. The economy has added about 150,000 jobs a month, on average, over the last two years. That's too few to rapidly lower the unemployment rate.
Even with modest gains in hiring, the unemployment rate remains high. It fell to 7.7 percent in November from 7.9 percent in October. The number of people receiving jobless benefits fell to 5.4 million in the week ended Dec. 15, the latest data available. That's down about 70,000 from the previous week.
Some economists saw potential for stronger gains after seeing Thursday's data. Joseph LaVorgna, chief United States economist at Deutsche Bank, raised his forecast for job growth in December to 190,000 jobs, from 150,000.
Credit Suisse also raised its forecast to 185,000, from 165,000. Still, economists remained cautious about where the job market is headed.
While Congress and the White House reached a deal this week that removed a threat of tax increases for many Americans, they postponed the more difficult decisions on spending cuts and on raising the nation's $16.4 trillion borrowing limit by late February.

HEADLINE: Better, if Not Cheaper, Care

BYLINE: By EZEKIEL J. EMANUEL. 
Ezekiel J. Emanuel, an oncologist, a vice provost at the University of Pennsylvania and a former White House adviser, is a contributing opinion writer.

 BODY:
IT is conventional wisdom that end-of-life care is an increasingly huge proportion of health care spending. I've often heard it said that people spend more on health care in the year before they die than they do in the entire rest of their lives. If we don't address these costs, the story goes, we can never control health care inflation.
Wrong. Here are the real numbers. The roughly 6 percent of Medicare patients who die each year do make up a large proportion of Medicare costs: 27 to 30 percent. But this figure has not changed significantly in decades. And the total number of Americans, not just older people, who die every year - less than 1 percent of the population - account for much less of total health care spending, just 10 to 12 percent. 
The more important issue is that just because we spend a lot on end-of-life care does not mean we can save a lot. We do know that costs for dying patients vary widely among hospitals, which suggests that we can do better. And yet no one can reliably say what specific changes would significantly lower costs. There is no body of well-conducted research studies that has proved how to save 5, 10, much less 20 percent.
Recent studies find that hospice may reduce costs in the last year of life for cancer patients by 10 to 20 percent. But they find no savings from hospice care for patients who die of other conditions, like emphysema or heart failure. No one is sure why hospice care doesn't save more. It may be because patients are enrolled in hospice care too late, or because hospice services themselves are labor-intensive and not cheap.
Even if we can never save a dime, however, there are good reasons to think about changing end-of-life care practices. While end-of-life care has improved considerably over the last 30 years, many Americans still die in hospitals when they would rather die at home. Nearly 20 percent of deaths occur in an intensive care unit or immediately after discharge, and too many patients experience symptoms like pain that are controllable with appropriate palliative care.
Here are four things the health care system should do to try to improve care for the dying, even if they won't save money.
First, all doctors and nurses should be trained in how to talk to patients and families about end-of-life care. When I was starting out, I was lucky enough to be able to witness how a great oncologist communicated with patients and their families when it was clear they were going to die, but I received no formal training whatsoever. It is hard to improve care for the dying if health professionals don't know how to talk about it. Fortunately, there are excellent communication techniques and training programs available - they don't have to be invented from scratch.
A related intervention - an idea that never actually was in the Affordable Care Act but inspired the death panel accusation - is that physicians should be paid a one-time fee to talk with patients about their preferences for end-of-life care. Even if physicians are well trained in communication, these conversations take time and are emotionally draining. This should be recognized through compensation.
Third, every hospital should be required to have palliative care services available both in the hospital and at the homes of dying patients who are discharged. Over 40 percent of hospitals with more than 50 beds do not have palliative care services. And we don't know how many actually have palliative care services once patients are sent home. These services should be delivered by trained experts in diagnosing and managing common symptoms of the dying, like pain, nausea, insomnia, shortness of breath, fatigue and depression.
Finally, we need to revise eligibility for hospice care. Right now doctors must certify that patients have six months or less to live and patients must agree to forgo life-sustaining treatments. The decision about whether to put a patient in hospice care should not be based on unreliable predictions about how long he has left to live but rather on his needs for specialized care, like morphine infusions.
These changes could be made in at least two ways. The Joint Commission - the nonprofit group that certifies health care organizations - could make training physicians and nurses to talk about end-of-life care and having palliative care available a requirement for hospital accreditation. Alternatively, Medicare, private insurers and, after 2014, state exchanges could require hospitals to provide communication training and palliative services as a condition for payment.
Unfortunately, there is no evidence that these interventions will save money. And I can't definitively prove they will make the care of dying patients better. But doing nothing to try to help the dying when the rest of the health care system is improving care is not an option.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Last Meeting, Fed Officials Debated Length of Program to Stimulate Job Market

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Just a few months after announcing a campaign to reduce unemployment, Federal Reserve officials are already debating how soon to stop it, reflecting persistent internal divisions about the effort's value.
At a meeting in December, several members of the Fed's policy making committee argued that purchases of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities should be reduced or ended ''well before the end of 2013,'' according to an account of the meeting the Fed published Thursday after a customary three-week delay.
The Fed announced after the meeting that it would keep buying assets until the pace of job creation improved substantially, part of an effort to increase the impact of its policies by announcing economic objectives rather than end dates. But the account shows that many members of the 12-person committee continue to think in terms of end dates, partly because they are worried about the potential costs. 
The concerns include the potential disruption of financial markets and the delicate balance between encouraging private borrowing and unleashing speculation. Fed officials professed less concern that the purchases could loosen the Fed's grip on inflation. They noted that inflation remained low, and that they expected it to stay under control.
''While almost all members thought that the asset purchase program begun in September had been effective and supportive of growth, they also generally saw that the benefits of ongoing purchases were uncertain and that the potential costs could rise as the size of the balance sheet increased,'' the meeting account said.
The stock market declined after the Fed released the account of its deliberations, suggesting some investors were surprised by the cautious tone, but the drop was modest. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index lost 0.21 percent of its value at the close of trading.
Joseph LaVorgna, an economist at Deutsche Bank, said investors had expected the Fed to keep buying ''through much, if not all, of this year.'' He said investors would now need to watch more closely for evidence that the recovery was gaining strength, which could lead the Fed to curtail its purchases.
''This should significantly amplify the financial market's sensitivity to upcoming economic data,'' Mr. LaVorgna wrote in a note to clients Thursday.
The government will release its monthly jobs report Friday morning.
But Diane Swonk, chief economist at Mesirow Financial, said investors should keep the account in perspective, as a reflection of modest misgivings in the middle of the most aggressive effort the Fed has ever undertaken to stimulate the economy.
The central bank announced after the December meeting that it planned to hold short-term interest rates near zero at least until the unemployment rate fell below 6.5 percent, provided inflation remained under control, and it estimated that the rate would cross that threshold no sooner than mid-2015.
The Fed also plans to maintain for the foreseeable future the vast portfolio of Treasury securities and mortgage-backed securities it has acquired since 2008 to further reduce borrowing costs for businesses and consumers.
And Ms. Swonk said she saw nothing in the account to alter her conviction that the Fed intended to keep adding to that stockpile through the coming year. She said the reservations of some officials had not prevented the new campaign, and would not force an early conclusion, because the basic argument for the purchases remained compelling: the economy is not growing fast enough, too many people remain unemployed, and the rest of government is not helping.
''I think that they would love to be able to stop,'' Ms. Swonk said, but given the condition of the economy, ''I think there's still a huge bias toward buying.''
She said that four of the 12 members of the Federal Open Market Committee would be replaced in January, and that two new arrivals -- Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, and Eric S. Rosengren, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston -- had been outspoken supporters of asset purchases.
The Fed's current program of asset purchases began in September with the announcement that it would buy $40 billion in mortgage bonds each month until the outlook for the labor market ''improved substantially.''
In December, the Fed said it would also expand its holdings of Treasuries by $45 billion each month, replacing a program in which it acquired that amount of long-term Treasuries each month by selling the same amount of short-term Treasuries, so that the total size of its portfolio remained unchanged.
The account said that a few officials predicted the purchases would need to continue through the end of the year, and a few said it was too soon to make a judgment.
''Several others thought that it would probably be appropriate to slow or to stop purchases well before the end of 2013, citing concerns about financial stability or the size of the balance sheet,'' the account continued, before concluding, ''One member viewed any additional purchases as unwarranted.''

HEADLINE: Bans and Rules Muddying Prospects for Gas Drilling

BYLINE: By MIREYA NAVARRO

 BODY:
In three decades of drilling, John C. Holko said, his oil and gas business has never faced such a hostile environment.
Years after he negotiated leases for gas drilling in upstate New York, strict rules on hydraulic fracturing that state environmental officials proposed threaten to put 20 percent of that land off limits, he estimated. And local drilling bans adopted by town boards could put him out of business altogether, he said.
''Why should I put money in the ground if any one of the towns can say no at the next town meeting?'' said Mr. Holko, the president of Lenape Resources in western New York. ''The issue of home rule is the demise of the industry.''
In November, he sued the State Department of Environmental Conservation and Avon, N.Y., in Livingston County, seeking $50 million in damages for lost business since the town enacted a ban on all drilling last summer. 
By late February, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, a Democrat, is expected to make a decision on whether hydraulic fracturing, a controversial natural gas drilling process that is already under way from Pennsylvania to Texas to North Dakota, will be allowed in New York. Any decision will be made against a backdrop of ferocious opposition from environmental groups, which say the drilling process -- also known as fracking -- poses too high a risk of groundwater contamination, air pollution and other environmental problems.
But a mix of local drilling bans and some of the tightest drilling regulations in the country raise questions about whether the process could flourish here.
Beyond those constraints, natural gas prices have declined sharply in recent years, limiting potential profits even as technology opens the way for the exploitation of vast shale gas resources. Fracking involves pumping millions of gallons of water and chemicals into underground shale to release natural gas.
Gas companies have a long history of conventional drilling in New York, and if prices rise from their current lows and there is money to be made, there is no question that gas companies will want to do business in the state, industry officials say.
''Certainly there are companies that, once they get a green light, will come in and drill,'' said Brad Gill, executive director of the Independent Oil and Gas Association of New York, which represents 400 drillers and drilling-related businesses.
But he and others in the industry argue that New York's proposed rules, which are undergoing public comment until next Friday, would significantly limit opportunities for both companies and the upstate communities that hope for a surge in drilling jobs and an economic boom.
Mr. Gill contends that the drawn-out nature of state deliberations on whether to allow fracking -- the process has been under way for four years -- has allowed many land leases to expire and prompted some companies to walk away and focus their resources on drilling in other states.
Companies like Talisman Energy and Inflection Energy, which have drilled with conventional methods in New York and had hoped to expand into hydraulic fracturing, have moved operations to Pennsylvania, Mr. Gill said. Another company based in New York, Norse Energy, filed for bankruptcy in early December.
Gas industry officials contend that the proposed regulations would block access to up to half the land they might have drilled -- by mandating setbacks, for example, or by prohibiting drilling through aquifers, in grasslands or near streams, private water wells and water supplies used for crops and livestock. (This is in addition to outright bans in the New York City watershed in the Catskills and other sensitive areas.)
Meanwhile, Governor Cuomo has said that towns and cities should have a say in a decision about allow drilling within their boundaries, which companies say raises far too much uncertainty for their business. So far, two of the bans have withstood court challenges.
In a Nov. 19 letter to Mr. Cuomo, Mr. Gill said that his own trade group had lost at least 10 member companies to other states in the last year and that he could not overstate ''the dramatic unattractiveness of New York to our industry.''
Tom S. West, an industry lawyer in Albany, said the proposed rules would add anywhere from $500,000 to more than $1 million more per well in extra fees and planning costs.
But in documents, officials with the State Department of Environmental Conservation have deemed some of the industry's cost estimates ''excessive.'' They predict that fracking in New York would be undertaken by large multinational companies that could afford the costs of drilling in the state.
Studies commissioned by the state project that the drilling process in New York could create 17,600 construction jobs and more than 29,000 indirect jobs. Under a conservative chain of events, state officials say, more than 42,000 horizontal and vertical wells would be developed over 30 years.
Michael A. Levi, an expert on energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations in New York, said too many variables were at work for anyone to predict how many companies would invest in fracking in the state, and how quickly, should the state give the go-ahead.
Companies with leases and other investments in New York will be more likely to drill than companies that are doing business elsewhere and prefer to wait and see what the first wells drilled in New York yield, he said.
''It'll vary from company to company,'' he said. But if there is money to be made, he said, ''that will be done.''
Mr. Holko of Lenape Resources, which has acquired drilling rights on about 100,000 acres of land in more than a dozen towns, said the amount of land actually opened up to drilling would make the difference in deciding whether it was economically viable. ''When you start taking away land mass'' through state regulations, he said, ''everybody will evaluate their individual acreage, and from that they'll decide whether it's worth pursuing in New York.''
To those seeking a ban on hydraulic fracturing, no set of state rules would suffice to safeguard water supplies, public health and the environment.
''We're putting fracking in the same category as smoking,'' said Sandra Steingraber, a distinguished scholar in residence in environmental studies at Ithaca College who leads the coalition New Yorkers Against Fracking. ''The only way to make smoking safe is to not smoke.''
Despite the constraints, Dennis Holbrook, executive vice president of Norse Energy, which is reorganizing under Chapter 11, said he looked forward to the day when the industry could prove the naysayers wrong. He said his company still held drilling rights over 130,000 acres of land and planned to seek new capital by forming a partnership with an investor once hydraulic fracturing is allowed.
''My hope is that if the industry has an opportunity to drill,'' he said, ''the public will be reassured that this can be done safely.''

HEADLINE: Penn State: Lessons Not Learned

 BODY:
If it were possible to compound the reasons for outrage over the serial child rape committed at Penn State, Gov. Tom Corbett took a brazenly misguided step in that direction Wednesday. The governor filed a federal lawsuit to force the N.C.A.A. to revoke the highly deserved sanctions imposed on the school and its powerful football program for a scandal that reached the highest levels of the university.
Governor Corbett barely mentioned the young victims in complaining that the state's economy, its citizens, students and, of course, the all-important Pennsylvania State University football fans were being unfairly penalized for the abuse and rape of children by Jerry Sandusky, the imprisoned former assistant coach who for years used the football program as a lure for his young victims. 
Surrounded by a claque of business leaders, students, politicians and athletes, Governor Corbett held a pep rally to announce the suit. He denounced the N.C.A.A. as unfairly crimping the lucrative football program -- largely ignoring the core finding by a special inquiry last July that ''the most powerful men at Penn State failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who Sandusky victimized.''
The inquiry found concern for the vaunted football program led to a long-running cover-up of Sandusky's behavior by top university officials, including Joe Paterno, the disgraced football coach who died last January. The sanctions were agreed to in July by the university, which is not a party to the governor's lawsuit. They included a $60 million fine, four years' suspension from bowl game participation and the expunging of the university's victory records during the Sandusky years. They were initially endorsed by Governor Corbett, a member of the Penn State board of trustees, as ''part of the corrective process.'' But Mr. Corbett, who is facing re-election next year, said he since concluded the N.C.A.A. violated its own rules and sought to ''pile on'' the university to counteract complaints that it was too often ''soft'' in disciplining misbehavior.
In his foolhardy lawsuit, the governor bypassed incoming state attorney general Kathleen Kane to hire an outside law firm to pursue his case in the name of the state. Ms. Kane declined to comment, but in her election campaign last year she promised to look into why it took so long for the pedophilia scandal to be investigated when Mr. Corbett previously served as attorney general.
In his complaints, the governor only confirmed the inquiry finding that the university's obsession with football predominance helped drive the cover-up of Mr. Sandusky's crimes. Mr. Corbett extolled football's ''economic engine'' and bemoaned the ''diminution in value of the Penn State educational and community experience'' because it relied, he emphasized, ''in part on the prominence of the Penn State football program.''
It would be hard to imagine a more shortsighted misunderstanding of the scandal that continues to shake Penn State. The university is wise to accept the sanctions, whatever the governor hopes to accomplish. The penalties have caused considerable resentment among the more avid Penn State fans, but Mr. Corbett denied politics underlies his complaint. He pictured Penn State caught in the ''eye of a media storm'' and left to ''clean up this tragedy that was created by the few.'' The governor should know better than anyone that the tragedy is all about the outrageous abuse of children at Penn State, not continuing the business of football for Penn State fans.

HEADLINE: An Antitrust Master Plan

BYLINE: By CLAIRE CAIN MILLER and NICK WINGFIELD; Claire Cain Miller reported from San Francisco, and Nick Wingfield from Seattle.

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- For 19 months, Google pressed its case with antitrust regulators investigating the company. Working relentlessly behind the scenes, executives made frequent flights to Washington, laying out their legal arguments and shrewdly applying lessons learned from Microsoft's bruising antitrust battle in the 1990s.
After regulators had pored over nine million documents, listened to complaints from disgruntled competitors and took sworn testimony from Google executives, the government concluded that the law was on Google's side. At the end of the day, they said, consumers had been largely unharmed.
That is why one of the biggest antitrust investigations of an American company in years ended with a slap on the wrist Thursday, when the Federal Trade Commission closed its investigation of Google's search practices without bringing a complaint. Google voluntarily made two minor concessions.
''The way they managed to escape it is through a barrage of not only political officials but also academics aligned against doing very much in this particular case,'' said Herbert Hovenkamp, a professor of antitrust law at the University of Iowa who has worked as a paid adviser to Google in the past. ''The first sign of a bad antitrust case is lack of consumer harm, and there just was not any consumer harm emerging in this very long investigation.'' 
The F.T.C. had put serious effort into its investigation of Google. Jon Leibowitz, the agency's chairman, has long advocated for the commission to flex its muscle as an enforcer of antitrust laws, and the commission had hired high-powered consultants, including Beth A. Wilkinson, an experienced litigator, and Richard J. Gilbert, a well-known economist.
Still, Mr. Leibowitz said during a news conference announcing the result of the inquiry, the evidence showed that Google ''doesn't violate American antitrust laws.''
''The conclusion is clear: Google's services are good for users and good for competition,'' David Drummond, Google's chief legal officer, wrote in a company blog post.
The main thrust of the investigation was into how Google's search results had changed since it expanded into new search verticals, like local business listings and comparison shopping. A search for pizza or jeans, for instance, now shows results with photos and maps from Google's own local business service and its shopping product more prominently than links to other Web sites, which has enraged competing sites.
But while the F.T.C. said that Google's actions might have hurt individual competitors, over all it found that the search engine helped consumers, as evidenced by Google users' clicking on the products that Google highlighted and competing search engines' adopting similar approaches.
Google outlined these kinds of arguments to regulators in many meetings over the last two years, as it has intensified its courtship of Washington, with Google executives at the highest levels, as well as lawyers, lobbyists and engineers appearing in the capital.
One of the arguments they made, according to people briefed on the discussions, was that technology is such a fast-moving industry that regulatory burdens would hinder its evolution. Google makes about 500 changes to its search algorithm each year, so results look different now than they did even six months ago.
The definition of competition in the tech industry is also different and constantly changing, Google argued.
For instance, just recently Amazon and Apple, which used to be in different businesses than Google, have become its competitors. Google's share of the search market has stayed at about two-thirds even though competing search engines are ''just a click away,'' as the company repeatedly argued. That would become the company's mantra to demonstrate that it was not abusing its market power.
To underline these arguments, Google spent $13.1 million on lobbying in the first three quarters in 2012, up from $5.9 million in the same period in 2011. And Google's lobbyist in chief, Eric E. Schmidt, the company's executive chairman and former chief executive, has made himself a Washington insider as a close adviser to President Obama.
Then there were the lessons of the Microsoft case.
''Google had the Microsoft case as a template,'' said Kevin Werbach, an associate professor at the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. ''Google just had to convince the regulators it was sufficiently different from Microsoft.''
One lesson for Google executives was to play nicely with the regulators. Microsoft's executives were known for their uncooperative demeanors during their tangle with the government. But even Mr. Schmidt, known for speaking candidly, was on his best behavior.
Google, and its lawyers and hired experts, also argued forcefully that this case was different than the one against Microsoft. For one, they pointed out again, the technology world is so different. At the time of the Microsoft inquiry, its software was the main on-ramp to the Internet.
''Search today is not a bottleneck monopoly for anything,'' said Tim Bresnahan, an economics professor at Stanford who studies competition in computing and has worked as a paid expert for Google recently and for Microsoft in the past.
''That's not the same as everyone who wants to do mass market computing has to go through Google, like back then everyone who wanted to do mass market computing had to go through Microsoft,'' he added.
Microsoft, leading a chorus of unsatisfied Google competitors, said Thursday that it was disappointed in the F.T.C.'s decision.
In a blog post published Thursday night, Dave Heiner, a Microsoft vice president and deputy general counsel, called the decision a ''missed opportunity.'' ''The F.T.C.'s overall resolution of this matter is weak and -- frankly -- unusual,'' Mr. Heiner wrote. ''We are concerned that the F.T.C. may not have obtained adequate relief even on the few subjects that Google has agreed to address.''
Mr. Heiner added that Microsoft remained hopeful that other antitrust agencies, including those in Europe, would take more forceful action against Google.
Harsh criticism of the decision also came from Gary Reback, an experienced Silicon Valley antitrust lawyer who represents a collection of Internet companies that complained to the F.T.C. about Google's behavior.
''I've been doing this almost 40 years, been involved in scores of antitrust investigations,'' he said. ''I've never seen anything so incomplete and lacking and even incompetent as what happened here.''
Richard Feinstein, director of the F.T.C.'s bureau of competition, dismissed Mr. Reback's comment as ''silly.''
''This was a very thorough, very professional investigation performed by very diligent and dedicated staff,'' he said.
Regulators had anticipated criticism from Google's rivals and tried to answer the complaints in their news conference.
''Some believe the commission should have done more in this case, perhaps because they are locked in a hand in hand combat with Google around the world,'' Mr. Liebowitz said. But, he said, ''We really do follow the facts where they lead.'' He added, ''The focus of our law is on protecting competition, not competitors.''
Tim Wu, a law professor at Columbia who was a senior adviser to the F.T.C. until last summer, said the outcome of the Google case reflected a change in thinking about antitrust enforcement. ''It used to be like the way we dealt with the mob,'' said Mr. Wu, who was involved in the agency's Google inquiry but who emphasized that he was not speaking for the F.T.C.
''I don't believe it's the position of antitrust agencies to invent competition where there isn't any,'' he said. ''People like Google better than Bing. Microsoft is trying to do everything it can to change that, but people still seem to prefer Google.''
Still, some veterans of the technology industry said that even though the agency did not find an antitrust violation, it still was sending a message to Google that it was not off the hook for good.
''There's a long track record of government never really going away,'' said David Farber, a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University and a former chief technology for the Federal Communications Commission who testified as a government witness in the Microsoft case. ''They will come back.''

HEADLINE: Chinese Companies to Invest Billions on Cambodia Projects

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
PHNOM PENH -- Two Chinese companies have reached a deal to build a 400-kilometer rail line, a steel plant and a seaport in Cambodia, worth a combined $11.2 billion, in what would be by far the impoverished country's biggest-ever investments. 
Cambodia Iron & Steel Mining Industry Group has hired China Railway Group to build the 250-mile railroad to link a steel facility in Preah Vihear Province, in the northern part of the country, to a port on the southern commercial island of Koh Kong, Zhang Chuan Li, the Cambodia Iron & Steel chairman, said Wednesday.
The rail link and port are expected to cost $9.6 billion and the steel plant $1.6 billion.
The deal is the latest sign of China expanding its footprint in the frontier economies of a booming Southeast Asia as the United States vies for influence in the region.
Loans and investment have won China some useful political allies in the 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations, which is set to become an integrated trade community by 2016.
All three projects in Cambodia will start this year and will take as long as four years to complete, Mr. Zhang said.
''There is an important demand for transport of mined materials for export to China and to the world,'' he said.
Cambodia Iron & Steel is a Chinese company based in Phnom Penh and established in 2006.
The agreement was made Monday and came three days after Sinomach China Perfect Machinery Industry and Cambodian Petrochemical announced that they would jointly build a $2.3 billion oil refinery, Cambodia's first, capable of processing five million metric tons of crude oil a year.
Chinese companies are also planning to build a separate $7 billion, 400-kilometer high-speed railroad through the neighboring country of Laos and are trying to win contracts to build new lines in Thailand.
Mr. Zhang did not provide details on where the billions of dollars for the Cambodian rail, steel and port projects would come from.
Mr. Zhang said that a groundbreaking ceremony for the railroad would take place by the end of this month and that construction of the steel plant in Preah Vihear Province would start in July.
A three-kilometer bridge will connect an island in the southern coastal province of Koh Kong with the mainland, and the project is expected to bolster the economies of the four provinces the link will pass through, the company said in a news release.
Peter Brimble, senior country economist at the Asian Development Bank, said he was surprised by the size of the rail project.
''It must be the largest-ever project in Cambodia,'' said Mr. Brimble, who has been involved in the bank's rehabilitation work on 650 kilometers of disused railroad lines in Cambodia. ''Perhaps it's easier to build a new one. Let's wait and see.''

HEADLINE: Battles Of The Budget

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
The centrist fantasy of a Grand Bargain on the budget never had a chance. Even if some kind of bargain had supposedly been reached, key players would soon have reneged on the deal -- probably the next time a Republican occupied the White House.
For the reality is that our two major political parties are engaged in a fierce struggle over the future shape of American society. Democrats want to preserve the legacy of the New Deal and the Great Society -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid -- and add to them what every other advanced country has: a more or less universal guarantee of essential health care. Republicans want to roll all of that back, making room for drastically lower taxes on the wealthy. Yes, it's essentially a class war. 
The fight over the fiscal cliff was just one battle in that war. It ended, arguably, in a tactical victory for Democrats. The question is whether it was a Pyrrhic victory that set the stage for a larger defeat.
Why do I say that it was a tactical victory? Mainly because of what didn't happen: There were no benefit cuts.
This was by no means a foregone conclusion. In 2011, the Obama administration was reportedly willing to raise the age of Medicare eligibility, a terrible and cruel policy idea. This time around, it was willing to cut Social Security benefits by changing the formula for cost-of-living adjustments, a less terrible idea that would nonetheless have imposed a lot of hardship -- and probably have been politically disastrous as well. In the end, however, it didn't happen. And progressives, always worried that President Obama seems much too willing to compromise about fundamentals, breathed a sigh of relief.
There were also some actual positives from a progressive point of view. Expanded unemployment benefits were given another year to run, a huge benefit to many families and a significant boost to our economic prospects (because this is money that will be spent, and hence help preserve jobs). Other benefits to lower-income families were given another five years -- although, unfortunately, the payroll tax break was allowed to expire, which will hurt both working families and job creation.
The biggest progressive gripe about the legislation is that Mr. Obama extracted less revenue from the affluent than expected -- about $600 billion versus $800 billion over the next decade. In perspective, however, this isn't that big a deal. Put it this way: A reasonable estimate is that gross domestic product over the next 10 years will be around $200 trillion. So if the revenue take had matched expectations, it would still have amounted to only 0.4 percent of G.D.P.; as it turned out, this was reduced to 0.3 percent. Either way, it wouldn't make much difference in the fights over revenue versus spending still to come.
Oh, and not only did Republicans vote for a tax increase for the first time in decades, the overall result of the tax changes now taking effect -- which include new taxes associated with Obamacare as well as the new legislation -- will be a significant reduction in income inequality, with the top 1 percent and even more so the top 0.1 percent taking a much bigger hit than middle-income families.
So why are many progressives -- myself included -- feeling very apprehensive? Because we're worried about the confrontations to come.
According to the normal rules of politics, Republicans should have very little bargaining power at this point. With Democrats holding the White House and the Senate, the G.O.P. can't pass legislation; and since the biggest progressive policy priority of recent years, health reform, is already law, Republicans wouldn't seem to have many bargaining chips.
But the G.O.P. retains the power to destroy, in particular by refusing to raise the debt limit -- which could cause a financial crisis. And Republicans have made it clear that they plan to use their destructive power to extract major policy concessions.
Now, the president has said that he won't negotiate on that basis, and rightly so. Threatening to hurt tens of millions of innocent victims unless you get your way -- which is what the G.O.P. strategy boils down to -- shouldn't be treated as a legitimate political tactic.
But will Mr. Obama stick to his anti-blackmail position as the moment of truth approaches? He blinked during the 2011 debt limit confrontation. And the last few days of the fiscal cliff negotiations were also marked by a clear unwillingness on his part to let the deadline expire. Since the consequences of a missed deadline on the debt limit would potentially be much worse, this bodes ill for administration resolve in the clinch.
So, as I said, in a tactical sense the fiscal cliff ended in a modest victory for the White House. But that victory could all too easily turn into defeat in just a few weeks.

HEADLINE: Lessons From Europe On Averting Disaster

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Will the United States follow the European path in 2013?
Let's hope so.
A year ago, the world's markets were watching Europe with rising fear. Some expected 2012 to be the year that the euro zone broke up. Germany did not want to pay to bail out its less fortunate neighbors unless they agreed to severe austerity and to what amounted to a surrender of sovereignty -- ideas that other countries were loath to accept.
What ensued during the year was a series of summit meetings that often seemed to do more for the hotel business in assorted European capitals than they did to solve the problem. Agreements in principle were announced, sending markets up, only to stumble back when the details got difficult.
What the naysayers missed was that there really was a common commitment to save the euro, and that in the end politicians and central bankers would do what was needed to avert disaster. Finally, in July, the European Central Bank came up with a plan that assured the euro area banks, and the troubled governments, that they would have access to money at reasonable rates. Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, went along, angering some of her German colleagues, who thought she was straying from basic principles. 
So it could be in the United States Congress. The outgoing Congress went up to the final minutes, amid much angst, before it averted the fiscal crisis. There are reasons to grumble about the details, and more deadlines loom in the new Congress, but the essential point was that in the end the House Republicans allowed a bill to pass even though a majority of them opposed it.
John A. Boehner, the speaker who has often seemed scared to do anything that his Tea Party colleagues might oppose, not only allowed the vote but chose to vote for the proposal. The first indication of whether this is a new dawn, or simply a case of the House Republicans being outmaneuvered, could come when the debt ceiling is addressed. Logically, the debt ceiling is an absurd vote to begin with. Raising it simply allows the government to pay the bills for spending the Congress already approved. To allow the spending bills to pass, but to then refuse to raise the debt ceiling, is equivalent to a family's deciding to refuse to pay the credit card bill while continuing to spend. That will only accomplish destruction of the family's credit.
Perhaps some Republicans will threaten to keep the country from paying its bills to accomplish something they don't otherwise have the votes to accomplish. But if the European precedent holds, the final result will at least avert disaster.
Whether more than that can be hoped for may depend in part on whether those screaming for major cuts in federal spending actually believe their rhetoric -- the talk about the United States becoming another Greece.
The reality is that the current budget deficit largely reflects two things: exceptionally low government revenue and the continuing problems caused by the financial crisis and recession that followed the bursting of the housing bubble. Bringing tax revenue back to historical levels, as well as the growth in revenue and reductions in spending that will automatically follow an improving economy, will make a major difference.
There are issues that must be addressed regarding health care costs and Medicare, as well as the fact that there will be fewer workers for each retiree as the baby boomers retire. But those who see a Greek-type crisis here should ask themselves why the government can borrow at interest rates that remain extraordinarily low. The world's trust in Uncle Sam's ability to pay its debts has remained high.
What are not high are taxes, although a poll would no doubt show that many people think otherwise.
Federal taxes, relative to the size of the economy, are significantly lower than they were after Ronald Reagan cut them. During 2012 federal revenue amounted to around 17 percent of gross domestic product. At the Reagan low point, the figure was a full percentage point higher. In 2009, when the deficit was ballooning, the figure fell below 16 percent, something that had happened only once during the more than 60 years for which comparable data is available.
Back in 2000, federal revenue approached 21 percent of G.D.P. The assumption that such strong collections would continue played a major role in the forecasts of budget surpluses as far as the eye could see. In 2001, aides to President George W. Bush pointed to the figure as proof that Americans were overtaxed. It turned out that tax revenue figures were temporarily inflated in two ways by the bull market in technology stocks. Not only were there a lot of capital gains to be taxed, but soaring share prices also produced a lot of ordinary income for those employees and executives who could cash in stock options.
At the time, it was assumed that such options had no significant impact on tax revenue, because the income that went to the employee provided an offsetting tax deduction for the company that issued the options. That might have been true had the companies been paying taxes, but many of the most bubbly stocks were in companies that never had, and never would, pay a dollar in income taxes.
That revenue would have come down sharply after the technology stock bubble burst, even without the Bush tax cuts. But those tax cuts worsened the situation and are a major cause of the current deficits.
It might be interesting to consider what would have happened in the 2012 presidential campaign had either candidate been willing to, as Adlai Stevenson once said, ''talk sense to the American people.''
In reality, neither candidate would have dreamed of saying, as an economist did a week ago: ''Ultimately, unless we scale back entitlement programs far more than anyone in Washington is now seriously considering, we will have no choice but to increase taxes on a vast majority of Americans. This could involve higher tax rates or an elimination of popular deductions. Or it could mean an entirely new tax, such as a value-added tax or a carbon tax.''
It would have been only a little more likely to hear a candidate say, as another economist said after the fiscal deal was reached, ''We need a tax system that can promote economic growth and raise the revenue the American people want to devote to government.''
The first quote came from a column in The New York Times by N. Gregory Mankiw, a Harvard economist. The second statement was made W. Glenn Hubbard, the dean of the Columbia University business school, who was chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers when the Bush tax cuts were enacted. He went on to say, a Times article reported, that some Bush-era policies were no longer relevant to the task of tailoring a tax code to a properly sized government.
Mr. Mankiw and Mr. Hubbard were among the top economic advisers to Mr. Romney. If they advised him to make similar statements during the campaign, he did not take the advice.
''Fiscal negotiations might become a bit easier if everyone started by agreeing that the policies we choose must be constrained by the laws of arithmetic,'' Mr. Mankiw added.

HEADLINE: Experts Advise Cuomo on Disaster Measures

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- Two panels of experts charged with studying how New York can better prepare for disasters like Hurricane Sandy said Thursday that the state should create a strategic fuel reserve, require some gas stations to install generators and update its building codes. 
The commissions, which Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo appointed in November shortly after the storm hit, offered preliminary recommendations so that the governor could consider including some of them in his State of the State address on Wednesday. The panels did not estimate the cost of any of their proposals.
Mr. Cuomo, at a meeting with his cabinet, noted that unanticipated fuel shortages had significantly disrupted the region's economic life after the hurricane, and said he would address that issue with a proposal to improve the ability of gas stations to function during power failures. He acknowledged that ''money is a factor in all of these decisions,'' given the state's budget constraints, but he added that new emergency-preparedness measures were worth the investment.
''Climate change is dramatically increasing the frequency and the severity of these situations,'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''And as time goes on, we're more and more realizing that these crises are more frequent and worse than anyone had predicted.''
One of the panels, charged with proposing ways to ensure that critical systems and services would be prepared for future emergencies, suggested developing new emergency training for local officials and expanding the use of databases to keep track of vulnerable residents, like the elderly, so that first responders can find and care for them in the event of a crisis. The group was led by Ira M. Millstein, a lawyer, and Irwin Redlener, the director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University.
The other panel focused on the state's ability to respond to a disaster when it hits. It suggested training National Guard soldiers to better assist with power restoration and other emergency duties, establishing a stockpile of emergency equipment and supplies and more widely employing text messaging to communicate with residents. That commission was led by Thad W. Allen, the former commandant of the Coast Guard, and K. Bradley Penuel, the director of the Center for Catastrophe Preparedness and Response at New York University.
Two other panels appointed by the governor after the hurricane, one focusing on infrastructure and another investigating the performance of the state's power utilities, are to release their preliminary findings soon.

Dipping into Shakespeare's life and poetry, the solo piece reflects on Mr. DeVita's journey from being a directionless Long Island fisherman to a classical actor, serving for the past 17 years as a core company member and literary manager of American Players Theater in Spring Green, Wis. Pearl Theater, 555 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 563-9261, pearltheatre.org. (Rooney)
'The Jammer' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Jan. 22) Fresh out of the Yale School of Drama, Rolin Jones turned heads at the Atlantic in 2005 with his play ''The Intelligent Design of Jenny Chow.'' After several years devoted to his busy television writing career (''Weeds,'' ''Friday Night Lights,'' ''Boardwalk Empire''), Mr. Jones returns to the stage with this contemporary urban fable set in the hard-boiled world of professional roller derby in 1950s New York. Jackson Gay directs a nine-member cast led by Patch Darragh. Atlantic Stage 2, 330 West 16th Street, Chelsea, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Rooney)
'Midsummer (A Play With Songs)' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Jan. 15) This lo-fi musical romantic comedy, written and directed by David Greig with songs by Gordon McIntyre, comes from the Traverse Theater, one of Scotland's most fertile incubators of original stage work. Winner of the 2012 Best of Edinburgh Award, the show follows the mismatched lovers Bob and Helena through an eventful lost weekend that prompted a critic for the Guardian to write, ''You float out laughing as if you've just swallowed sunshine on a spoon.'' Clurman Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rooney)
'Opus No. 7' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Jan. 13) Famed for his groundbreaking non-narrative ''theater of painters'' spectacles, the Russian designer-director Dimitry Krymov stages these two one-acts that pay tribute to the victims of totalitarianism. Playing for eight performances only, the production features a multigenre original score performed live onstage, with larger-than-life puppets, dancing pianos, acrobats and a ''living wall'' that erupts with imagery. St. Ann's Warehouse, 29 Jay Street, at Plymouth Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 254-8779, stannswarehouse.org. (Rooney)
'The Other Place' (in previews; opens on Thursday) Sharr White's twisty drama earned Laurie Metcalf an Obie Award in 2011; now it and she are making a somewhat delayed transfer to Broadway, with two new actors (including Daniel Stern) joining them. Ms. Metcalf plays a renowned neurologist whose research may be hitting too close to home -- and that's about all that's safe to divulge about the plot. Joe Mantello directs, as he did in 2011. Friedman Theater, 261 West 47th Street, Manhattan, (800) 432-7250, mtc-nyc.org. (Eric Grode)
'Picnic' (in previews; opens on Jan. 13) Despite being a Pulitzer Prize winner (in 1954) and possibly William Inge's best-known play, ''Picnic'' has only been revived one other time on Broadway, when the Roundabout presented Kyle Chandler and Ashley Judd as the young lovers in 1994. The Roundabout is once again revisiting it; this time the ubiquitous director Sam Gold (''Seminar,'' ''Circle Mirror Transformation'') has surrounded his young leads, Maggie Grace and Sebastian Stan, with a canny blend of theater mainstays (Reed Birney, Elizabeth Marvel) and Hollywood royalty (Ellen Burstyn). American Airlines Theater, 227 West 42nd Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Grode)
Under the Radar Festival (opens on Wednesday) The Public Theater's ninth annual potpourri of innovative theater from around the globe runs through Jan. 20. Acclaimed last season for its production ''Being Harold Pinter,'' Belarus Free Theater returns with ''Minsk 2011: A Reply to Kathy Acker,'' which tours the pansexual underground night life that exists in defiance of the city's oppressive government. Other intriguing entries come via lauded American companies including Pig Iron Theater, Elevator Repair Service, Nature Theater of Oklahoma and the Debate Society, as well as productions from Australia, Iran and the Netherlands. 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org, undertheradarfestival.com.

'Water by the Spoonful' (in previews; opens on Tuesday) It's not often that plays win the Pulitzer Prize before their New York debut, so Quiara Alegría Hudes's 2012 winner is eagerly anticipated. The second play in her Elliot Trilogy, following her 2007 work, ''Elliot, a Soldier's Fugue,'' follows the life of a young Puerto Rican veteran of the Iraq war and the two overlapping worlds -- one online, one real -- that keep him physically and psychologically afloat. Two ''Elliot'' veterans -- the actor Armando Riesco and the director Davis McCallum -- are on board for this one, too. Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Grode)
'When It Rains' (previews start on Thursday; opens next Friday) From the 2b Theater Company of Halifax, Nova Scotia, comes this live-action existential graphic novel written and directed by Anthony Black, whose work ''Invisible Atom'' was seen in the 2010 Under the Radar Festival. This experiment in theatrical storytelling starts with a reflection on the biblical tale of Job, branching out to ponder questions of happiness and unhappiness by considering to what extent we are responsible for our own misfortunes. La MaMa Ellen Stewart Theater, 66 East Fourth Street, East Village, (212) 475-7710, lamama.org. (Rooney)
'Working on a Special Day' (previews start on Thursday; opens on Jan. 16) The Play Company presents this piece inspired by Ettore Scola's 1977 Italian film, ''Una Giornata Particolare,'' which starred Sophia Loren and Marcello Mastroianni. Developed in collaboration with Por Piedad Teatro of Mexico, the play uses minimal props to chronicle the instant bond that develops between a Roman housewife and her homosexual radio broadcaster neighbor on the day in 1938 of Hitler's visit to Mussolini's Italy. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, (212) 279-4200, 59e59.org, playco.org.

Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Katie Finneran and Anthony Warlow (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
'Evita' This just in: Eva Perón is still dead. That, anyway, is on the evidence of Michael Grandage's unsmiling revival of Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice's 1978 bio-musical, which feels about as warm-blooded as a gilded mummy. Elena Roger, Michael Cerveris and Ricky Martin are the stars of this earnest combination of requiem mass and history pageant (2:30). Marquis Theater, 1535 Broadway, at 45th Street, Manhattan, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
'Glengarry Glen Ross' The fight has gone out of the boys from David Mamet's 1984 Pulitzer Prize-winning drama of sharks in a small pond. In Daniel Sullivan's deflated production, which stars an extravagantly gesturing Al Pacino, it's as if all the competitive fierceness has been sucked from them by some cosmic super-vacuum cleaner. It also stars Bobby Cannavale as the hotshot Ricky Roma (1:40). Schoenfeld Theater, 236 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Golden Boy' Bartlett Sher directs a superbly cast revival of Clifford Odets's 1937 drama about a young man (Seth Numrich) torn between a career as a boxer and his first love, the violin. It's a richly atmospheric production that cuts to the emotional quick of Odets's still-vital play (2:45). Belasco Theater, 111 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'The Heiress' Masterpiece Theater on Broadway. Moisés Kaufman's revival of Ruth and Augustus Goetz's sturdy war horse, starring a one-note Jessica Chastain, is lovely to look at, easy to follow -- and aside from a vivid supporting performance from Judith Ivey -- about as full of real life as an Olde New York Christmas window in a department store (2:45). Walter Kerr Theater, 219 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'The Mystery of Edwin Drood' A boisterous, well-cast revival of Rupert Holmes's Tony-winning 1986 musical, which gives the audience the chance to choose the identity of the killer of the titular hero. Chita Rivera lends an air of authentic glamour, Jim Norton is a cutup as the music-hall proprietor, and the young cast sings the lovely score with great skill (2:35). Studio 54, 254 West 54th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundabouttheatre.org. (Isherwood)
'Newsies' This Disney musical -- adapted from the 1992 movie and inspired by the newsboy strike of 1899 -- markets Urchin Appeal with extra! extra! enthusiasm. Jeff Calhoun directs a cast of comely, if overgrown, ragamuffins. The largely interchangeable songs are by Alan Menken and Jack Feldman (2:20). Nederlander Theater, 208 West 41st Street, (866) 870-2717, newsiesthemusical.com. (Brantley)
'Nice Work if You Can Get It' Every now and then a bubble of pure, tickling charm rises from the artificial froth of this pastiche 1920s musical, directed by Kathleen Marshall and featuring songs by George and Ira Gershwin. But mostly the production, starring Matthew Broderick and Kelli O'Hara, registers as a shiny, dutiful trickle of gags and production numbers (2:30). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Once' This gentle musical, set in Dublin, about a love affair that never quite happens -- based on the 2006 movie -- inventively uses songs (by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova) and dance to convey a beautiful shimmer of might-have-been regret. Staged by John Tiffany and Steven Hoggett (''Black Watch''), the production stars the immensely appealing Steve Kazee and Cristin Milioti (2:15). Bernard B. Jacobs Theater, 242 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). Brooks Atkinson Theater, 256 West 47th Street, (800) 745-3000, ticketmaster.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?' Pam MacKinnon's shattering 50th-anniversary revival of Edward Albee's hair-raising drama of marital discord stars an electrifying Tracy Letts (of ''August: Osage County'' fame) as George and Amy Morton (ditto) as Martha, ably supported by Carrie Coon and Madison Dirks as the young couple they use as cannon fodder. Not to be missed (3:05). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Bare' Stafford Arima directs this tragic tale of star-cross'd gay lovers in a Roman Catholic boarding school. While the boys try to keep their romance secret, the truth comes spilling out during a school production of ''Romeo and Juliet.'' Retooled significantly since its first incarnation in 2000, this emo musical has been updated to reflect attitudes toward homophobia and bullying in the ''It Gets Better'' era. But despite touching moments and a committed cast, the material is too painfully earnest and riddled with clichés to connect with audiences not still mired in adolescence (2:30). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, baremusicalnyc.com. (Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Anita Gates)
'Emotional Creature' This collage of songs, monologues and spoken-word pieces by Eve Ensler explore the problems facing young women around the globe, from sex-slavery to the plague of mean girls. Performed with vivifying passion by a talented young cast of six (1:30). Pershing Square Signature Center, 480 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Forbidden Broadway: Alive and Kicking' Gerard Alessandrini's essential satirical cheat sheet to Broadway musicals returns after a three-year absence, packing polished brass knuckles. A precisionist cast of four provides vocal cartoons as evocative as Al Hirschfeld's caricatures. This show not only tickles but also pierces the Achilles' heels of the productions under scrutiny (1:40). At the 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Forever Dusty' If Kristen Holly Smith turned up to your costume party in Dusty Springfield drag and started singing, there would be no mistaking the woman she was channeling. But doing a passable impersonation is a far cry from capturing the essence of one of the most distinctive female vocalists of all time, as this amateurish inflated cabaret act demonstrates. Written in by-the-numbers basics by Ms. Smith and Jonathan Vankin, and directed with minimal finesse by Randal Myler, this misconceived bio-musical is a soulless tribute to the platinum-haired, panda-eyed queen of white soul. She deserves better (1:40). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, foreverdusty.net. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'The Freedom of the City' The masterful contemporary Irish dramatist Brian Friel puts a human face on the Troubles in Northern Ireland with this stirring drama from 1973 about the shooting by British soldiers of three nonviolent civilian protesters at a march, which echoes the tragic events of Bloody Sunday the year before. Staged by Ciaran O'Reilly with a firm handle on the narrative's time-shuffling structure and a stinging clarity that illuminates the play's multiple perspectives, this drama steadily tightens its grip, from its absorbing beginnings through to its shattering conclusion. The standout among the generally solid cast is Cara Seymour as a stubbornly optimistic housewife and mother of 11 children, living in two rooms with a useless husband and no running water (2:00). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-2737, irishrep.org. (Rooney)
&#x2605; 'Fried Chicken and Latkes' Rain Pryor, the daughter of the comedian Richard Pryor (who died in 2005), stars in this effervescent solo show, which recounts her upbringing in a biracial household (her mother is Jewish) in Beverly Hills, Calif. Ms. Pryor, who sings and portrays a range of characters (including, poignantly, her father in a spot-on impression) is an ebullient performer with a robust singing voice. She lives in Baltimore now, but her outsize personality is built for Broadway (1:30). Actor's Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Andy Webster)
'Golden Age' Terrence McNally's comedy-drama, set backstage on the first night of the opera composer Vincenzo Bellini's last opera (''I Puritani''), is sadly hackneyed and contrived. Lee Pace plays the composer, and Bebe Neuwirth the famed singer Maria Malibran (2:30). City Center, 131 West 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 581-1212, manhattantheatreclub.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'The Great God Pan' The new play from the terrific young playwright Amy Herzog (''4000 Miles'') is an oblique but moving drama about a young man (the excellent Jeremy Strong) agonized by the discovery that he may (or, if he can trust his hazy memory, may not) have been sexually abused as a child. Under Carolyn Cantor's direction, an altogether terrific cast, including Becky Ann Baker and Peter Friedman, draws out all the quiet heartbreak in Ms. Herzog's keenly observed writing (1:25). Playwrights Horizons, 416 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Isherwood)
'Job' The professionally confrontational Thomas Bradshaw (''Burning'') revisits the Old Testament's most famously afflicted figure in this short, sharp and joltingly funny work, which lets us see a familiar tale through wise virgin eyes. Benjamin H. Kamine ably steers a bright young cast through Mr. Bradshaw's unsparingly graphic vision of heaven and earth (1:00). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212) 226-2407, theflea.org. (Brantley)
'The Last Seder' Jennifer Maisel's gentle drama -- about an aging family coming together for the annual meal as the father (Greg Mullavey) suffers from Alzheimer's and the old house goes up for sale -- is steeped in themes and sentiments that resonate in any season. The play's numerous subplots are as chaotic and uneven as any homecoming, but the main story benefits greatly from Mr. Mullavey's standout performance (1:40). Theater Three, 311 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 868-4444, rosalindproductions.com. (Daniel M. Gold)
'Mulan the Musical' The Red Poppy Ladies, an all-female percussion troupe from Beijing, tells this Chinese folk tale with drums, pantomime and a bit of dance (1:10). Peter Jay Sharp Theater, 416 West 42nd Street, (212) 279-4200, mulanthemusical.com. (Jaworowski)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place -- the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic community in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)

&#x2605; 'The Piano Lesson' August Wilson's Pulitzer Prize-winning play, set in Pittsburgh in 1936, returns in a galvanizingly beautiful staging by Ruben Santiago-Hudson, featuring memorable performances virtually across the board.

&#x2605; 'Tribes' Nina Raine's smart, lively and beautifully acted play asks us to hear how we hear, in silence as well as speech. This British import considers the passive and aggressive forms of listening within an insular, intellectual family, whose members include a deaf son. David Cromer is the expert director (2:15). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Nomenclature would seem to be fate for the title characters of Christopher Durang's sunny comedy about gloomy people. David Hyde Pierce, Kristine Nielsen and Sigourney Weaver portray three siblings (if not three sisters) whose parents burdened them with Chekovian names. Nicholas Martin directs this surprisingly mild-mannered work from a savage satirist (2:30). Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater, Lincoln Center, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
Off Off Broadway
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00). Duplex Cabaret Theater, 61 Christopher Street, at Seventh Avenue, Greenwich Village, pattiissues.brownpapertickets.com. (Rooney)

Last Chance
'Chaplin: The Musical' (closes on Sunday) Though Rob McClure does a graceful impersonation of the title character of this soppy bio-musical, the off-screen Charlie Chaplin is often missing in action, devoured by a swarm of man-eating clichés. This gray-toned sour-smell-of-success story, featuring vaporous songs by Christopher Curtis and directed by Warren Carlyle, takes those clichés very seriously (2:30). Ethel Barrymore Theater, 243 West 47th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Dead Accounts' (closes on Sunday) As a prodigal son returned to Cincinnati from New York City, Norbert Leo Butz conjures fireworks out of very thin air in Theresa Rebeck's new comedy, directed by Jack O'Brien and featuring Katie Holmes. The play throws out many weighty subjects, but they all blur into a jet stream of semi-snappy dialogue before changing course and evaporating (2:00).

'Elf' (closes on Sunday) This stage musical based on the Will Ferrell movie returns to Broadway with Wayne Knight as the celebrity Santa, though he isn't around much. The production, like all the holiday-themed shows clogging New York theaters, has some funny moments, a couple of decent musical numbers and a lot of generic-feeling songs and synthetic sentiment. Jordan Gelber in the role of Buddy, the human raised as an elf who comes to New York to find his real father, never really finds a comfort zone for the sometimes awkward, sometimes perceptive character (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, elfmusical.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Golden Land' (closes on Sunday) The upbeat six-person acting ensemble in this National Yiddish Theater-Folksbiene production seems game for the two-hour rendition of the entire New York Jewish immigrant experience, from the 1880s to the 1940s. In montages and medleys, partly in Yiddish and partly in English, the audience is transported to Ellis Island, the Lower East Side, the Triangle shirtwaist factory fire, union protests, the Holocaust and more. The characters are more or less generic immigrant archetypes, but the actors do a great job of hiding how exhausted they must be from the constant march of history and costume changes (2:00). Baruch Performing Arts Center, 55 Lexington Avenue, at 25th Street, nationalyiddishtheatre.org. (Catherine Rampell)
'Grace' (closes on Sunday) Craig Wright's cool, strangulated essay of a play about forms of faith isn't as intellectually unsettling as it means to be. But the cast (which includes Paul Rudd, Ed Asner and Kate Arrington) is very good under Dexter Bullard's direction. And Michael Shannon confirms his status as our most convincing interpreter of uneasy American manhood (1:40). Cort Theater, 138 West 48th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Ingenious Nature' (closes on Sunday) The Canadian rapper Baba Brinkman presents his latest foray into educational hip-hop theater by mashing up stories from his love life with studies from the field of evolutionary psychology, which explains gender relations, political beliefs and teenage recklessness through the lens of millions of years of genetic selection. Mr. Brinkman is amiable and energetic, as always.

HEADLINE: Rig Owner Will Settle With U.S. In Gulf Spill

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
The driller whose floating Deepwater Horizon oil rig blew out in 2010, causing a massive oil spill, has agreed to settle civil and criminal claims with the federal government for $1.4 billion, the Justice Department announced Thursday.
The Deepwater Horizon exploded, burned and sank in April 2010. Eleven men were killed and millions of gallons of oil flowed into the Gulf of Mexico and fouled the shores of coastal states. The well, known as Macondo, was owned by British oil giant BP, which settled its own criminal charges and some of its civil charges in November for $4.5 billion.
While this settlement resolves the government's claims against Transocean, that company and the others involved in the spill still face the sprawling, multistate civil case, which is scheduled to begin in February in New Orleans. In a deal filed in federal court in New Orleans, a subsidiary, Transocean Deepwater, agreed to one criminal misdemeanor violation of the Clean Water Act and will pay a fine of $100 million. Over the next five years, the company will pay civil penalties of $1 billion, the largest ever under the act. 
As part of the criminal settlement, Transocean also agreed to pay the National Academy of Sciences and the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation $150 million each. Those funds will be applied to oil spill prevention and response in the Gulf of Mexico and natural resource restoration projects. The agreement will be subject to public comment and court approval. The company agreed to five years of monitoring of its drilling practices and improved safety measures.
In a statement, Transocean Ltd., the Switzerland-based parent of the rig owner, said that the company thought these were ''important agreements'' and called them a ''positive step forward'' that were ''in the best interest of its shareholders and employees.'' Of the 11 men killed on the rig, the company said, ''their families continue to be in the thoughts and prayers of all of us at Transocean.''
The company announced in September that it had set an ''estimated loss contingency'' of $1.5 billion against the Justice Department's claims.
Shares of Transocean Ltd. rose nearly 3 percent on the news, to close at $49.20.
In a statement, Lanny A. Breuer, assistant attorney general for the Justice Department's Criminal Division, suggested that Transocean had played a subservient and lesser role in the disaster to that of BP: ''Transocean's rig crew accepted the direction of BP well site leaders to proceed in the face of clear danger signs -- at a tragic cost to many of them.'' He said that the $1.4 billion ''appropriately reflects its role in the Deepwater Horizon disaster.''
Under a law passed last year, 80 percent of the penalty will be applied to projects for restoring the environment and economies of gulf states.
That fact was applauded by a coalition of Gulf Coast restoration groups, including the Environmental Defense Fund and the National Audubon Society. A joint statement called this ''a great day for the gulf environment and the communities that rely on a healthy ecosystem for their livelihoods.''
Still, the penalty struck some experts in environmental law as somewhat light. David M. Uhlmann, who headed the Justice Department's environmental crimes section from 2000 to 2007, praised the size of the civil settlement, which he said ''reflects the scope of the gulf oil spill tragedy.''
He argued, however, that the criminal penalty should have been at least as onerous, ''given Transocean's numerous failures to drill in a safe manner, which cost 11 workers their lives and billions of dollars in damages to communities along the gulf.'' The settlement, he said, should have included seaman's manslaughter charges, which were part of the BP settlement.
As for the company's role in following the lead of BP, he said, ''following orders is not a defense to criminal charges.''
At the Environmental Protection Agency, Cynthia Giles, assistant administrator for the office of enforcement and compliance assurance, called the settlement ''an important step'' toward holding Transocean and others involved in the spill accountable. ''E.P.A. will continue to work with D.O.J. and its federal partners to vigorously pursue the government's claims against all responsible parties and ensure that we are taking every possible step to restore and protect the Gulf Coast ecosystem,'' she said.
The multistate trial over claims in the Deepwater Horizon cases that have not been settled are scheduled to begin in February. Stephen J. Herman and James P. Roy, lawyers who represent the steering committee of plaintiffs in the cases, said that Thursday's settlement did not change the case, and that the plaintiffs thought that BP, Transocean and Halliburton ''will be found grossly negligent'' at trial.
BP continued its longstanding argument that the accident, in the words of the spokesman Geoff Morrell, ''resulted from multiple causes, involving multiple parties,'' and that other companies had to shoulder their share of the blame.
Transocean, Mr. Morrell said in a statement, ''is finally starting, more than two-and-a-half years after the accident, to do its part for the Gulf Coast.'' He then turned his attention to the other major contractor on the well, and said, ''Unfortunately, Halliburton continues to deny its significant role in the accident, including its failure to adequately cement and monitor the well.''
Beverly Blohm Stafford, a Halliburton spokeswoman, said that the company ''remains confident that all the work it performed with respect to the Macondo well was completed in accordance with BP's specifications for its well construction plan and instructions,'' and so Halliburton, she said was protected from liability through indemnity provisions of its drilling contract.
''We continue to believe that we have substantial legal arguments and defenses against any liability and that BP's indemnity obligation protects us,'' she said. ''Accordingly we will maintain our approach of taking all proper actions to protect our interests.''

HEADLINE: Swiss Gunman Who Killed 3 Was Known to Authorities

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER

 BODY:
PARIS -- As much as many Americans, the Swiss love their guns, seeing them as integral to their national traditions of self-reliance, independence and international neutrality, with a trained and equipped citizen-army capable of deterring any foolish invader. Many Swiss, after serving in the army, keep their service weapons at home, and the country has no national register for firearms.
Only two years ago, in February 2011, the Swiss handily rejected restrictions on gun ownership in a national referendum. 
Those views are unlikely to change soon, even after a mentally imbalanced man shot and killed three women and wounded two men in the southern Swiss village of Daillon on Wednesday evening. The gunman, who was known to the authorities but not thought to be dangerous, was wounded by the police as they arrested him and is now in intensive care.
The gunman, 33, who was not identified, had been placed in a psychiatric ward in 2005, when guns he then owned were taken from him and destroyed, according to the Swiss police in the canton of Valais, about 60 miles east of Geneva. It is not known how he got the arms he used in the killings -- including a hunting gun and a Swiss Army carbine in use in the first half of the last century, a regional public prosecutor, Catherine Seppey, said at a news conference -- but guns are easily available in Switzerland.
According to villagers who spoke to local news agencies, the gunman was unemployed, on welfare and getting psychiatric care, and was a ward of the court. On Wednesday around 9 p.m., he began firing from his apartment toward passers-by in the street and neighboring buildings before going outside and continuing to fire as many as 20 shots. He had been drinking heavily, some villagers told the Swiss Web site 20minutes.ch.
The gunman killed three Daillon women, ages 72, 54 and 32; all were shot at least twice, in the head and chest. The two wounded men were 63 and 33; one is in critical condition. The youngest woman killed was married to the younger wounded man, and they had young children together, Ms. Seppey said.
''We have no words to express ourselves after an event like this,'' Christophe Germanier, head of the Conthey district, said at a news conference.
The gunman's only previous conviction was for marijuana use. The village has only about 200 people and is surrounded by vineyards.
In a separate incident on Wednesday, an armed man in another village stormed into a restaurant and fired into the ceiling, but no one was hurt. In 2001, a local man shot and killed 14 people in the town of Zug.
There are said to be at least 2.3 million weapons among a Swiss population of less than 8 million people. Gun clubs and hunting are popular. Swiss men required to do national service often take their army rifles, now semiautomatic assault rifles, home with them, to be ready for some future invader. But since 2007, according to The Associated Press, the government has required that most ammunition for these weapons be kept at secure army depots.
But thousands of Swiss also own hunting rifles, target rifles and pistols.
Switzerland's firearms laws are minimal. The local debate tends to center more on the high rate of guns used in suicides. In the campaign before the February 2011 referendum, the Swiss Medical Association argued that keeping army weapons in secure arsenals, instead of at home, would reduce suicides and domestic violence. Jacques de Haller, the association president, told the BBC at the time that ''we have statistics which show that young men commit suicide with the military firearm. What's more, you have domestic violence from that.''
He argued that the tradition no longer made sense. ''We're not going to defend Switzerland against the Red Army from the kitchen window or the backyard,'' he said. ''Today, the dangers are different.''
The referendum would have required storage of army rifles in a central, locked store, the screening of gun owners and a national registry of firearms. The proposal was rejected by 56 percent of voters and a majority of cantons.

 BODY:
With New Year's hoopla behind us, we begin to turn a corner on the season of long nights and short days. But there's still a good stretch of darkness ahead, and New York City museums have their lights on bright.
Illumination has been a subject and condition of art since prehistoric painters at the Lascaux caves positioned their images to catch the rays of the sun at winter solstice. Great classical cultures across the globe spun visions of the universe around the presence of solar and lunar deities. To designers of stained-glass church windows in medieval Europe light was divine benevolence in sensible form. To the Muslim creators of lusterware in the Arab world radiance as a decorative property helped bind together the widely dispersed faithful.
Painted dawns and sunsets carried spiritual, political and personal messages for Romantic landscape artists in America and Europe. Light was scientific data to the French Impressionists, the raw material of an optical sublime. In our own era, when art has no center or has centers everywhere, light as a medium has atomized into countless forms and meanings, from fluorescent tubes and video screens to glittering magpie-eye scraps and painted rainbows. 
With the prospect of considerable midwinter indoor time still to come, four art critics for The New York Times recently fanned out into museums in search of art that captured light, or referred to it, or generated it. HOLLAND COTTER
'THE PENITENT MAGDALEN' BY GEORGES DE LA TOUR, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART Reports on the life of Mary Magdalene are sketchy. It seems she enjoyed a wayward existence until she met Jesus, whereupon she became one of his closest associates. She was present at the Crucifixion and was the first to meet him after he emerged from the tomb. At the end of her life she retreated to a cave to meditate on her past. In medieval times she became a Roman Catholic cult figure and was typically depicted naked or partly so and with long hair, signifying her early career of unbridled sensuality.
''Penitent Magdalen,'' from about 1640, gives her traditional image a Baroque update. In a shadowy, cavernous room, Mary sits with a skull in her lap, gazing to her left at a burning candle and its reflection in a fancily framed mirror on a wooden table. In the Bible, Jesus says, ''I am the light of the world.'' Thus the glowing flame stands for the eternal life guaranteed the believer's soul, while the skull represents the inevitable end of the physical body. With remarkable equanimity Mary ponders the gap between.
La Tour rendered this carefully staged scene without recourse to any explicitly metaphysical devices. The painting's nearly photorealistic look arouses suspicion that he, like Vermeer, may have relied on a camera obscura. Whatever else it may be, this is a painting about the waning of an age of faith and the rise of a materialistic era of science. KEN JOHNSON
'MLLE. FIOCRE IN THE BALLET ''LA SOURCE'' ' BY EDGAR DEGAS, BROOKLYN MUSEUM This painting, from 1867-68, put Degas on the art-world map. It led him out of history painting and onto the path of ballet subjects that became his calling card. The painting, with its ambiguous blend of fantasy and realism, is a transitional work but a brilliant one, partly thanks to a technical miscalculation.
The scene shown is from the ballet that inaugurated the Palais Garnier in Paris in 1866. The production was lavish and included real horses, a real pool of water, enchanting woodland décor and one of Paris's hottest dancers, Eugénie Fiocre, in the role of an exotic and imperious Georgian queen.
Degas's queen looks more pooped than imperious. He shows Fiocre fully costumed -- her sky-blue gown glows like a lamp -- but worn out by rehearsals. Her ballet slippers are tossed aside (you can see them between the legs of the horse), and she dips her feet in the onstage pool that turns almost half the picture into a lustrous mirror.
The dominant lighting in the scene is stage lighting, flat, white and focused on Fiocre. At the same time the light in the woodland set reflected in the pool feels nuanced and naturalistic, like the real outdoor thing.
So is Degas giving us reality or artifice? Some of each, and brought together through an accident. Just before delivering the picture to the 1868 Paris Salon, he varnished its surface, which was still wet, saw his mistake and tried to wipe off the varnish, only to remove areas of pigment with it. He later tried to restore it, but the luminous sheet of water that is the picture's most enchanting feature may be a gift of chance. HOLLAND COTTER
'SPECTRUM V' BY ELLSWORTH KELLY, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART We all know that light is made up of colors, but seeing ''Spectrum V,'' from 1969, is like discovering this phenomenon for the first time. It neatly divides the visible spectrum into 13 hues, each covering a single, large-scale panel. A mainstay of the Met's contemporary galleries, it has been a big hit lately with the crowds spilling out of ''Regarding Warhol,'' who are primed for its postpainterly, quasi-Pop approach to color.
The ''Spectrum'' paintings -- there are several, some of them displayed in tight clusters -- build on Mr. Kelly's early-1950s compositions of colored squares arranged by chance. Here the large, evenly spaced canvases seem to be ordered according to the spectrum -- although the first and last panels in the sequence are not, as you might expect, red and violet, but rather two shades of yellow.
It's entertaining to watch viewers puzzle over how best to apprehend the piece (or how best to photograph it). Should they move alongside following its friezelike rhythm or stand back and try to take in the whole rainbow at once? Either way an optical-neural sensation is extended into a full-body experience. KAREN ROSENBERG
'SAINT JOSEPH AND THE CHRIST CHILD,' CUZCO SCHOOL, PERU, BROOKLYN MUSEUM For centuries in European art St. Joseph, husband of Mary, adoptive father of Jesus and a carpenter by trade, was depicted as an elderly man and a mere supporting actor in the salvational drama unfolding around him. Then, in 16th-century Spain and Spain's New World colonies, his status changed. Suddenly he was a star, a leading man, youthful and matinee-idol handsome, which is how he appears in ''Saint Joseph and the Christ Child,'' a radiant picture from late 17th- or 18th-century Peru at the Brooklyn Museum.
Painted by an unknown artist in Cuzco, an ancient Inca city that was later a Spanish one, the picture shows Joseph -- with a trim beard, rosy cheeks and a notable resemblance to the adult Jesus found in many other paintings -- in the role of paternal mentor and guide. That he is still a carpenter and passing his skills on to his son we surmise from the little basket filled with miniature workbench tools the child carries. That the two are as much South American as European is evident from the Inca-style sandals Jesus wears.
But this Joseph is also a majestic, princely figure who will lead, or at least support, his equally princely child through early life. Against a stormy sky they walk hand in hand, resplendent with scintillating halos and all-over gold-stamped robes, a treasury in motion. Seen by candlelight in one of Cuzco's spectacular Baroque churches, they must have been a glittering, glinting sight. In Brooklyn they still are. HOLLAND COTTER
'WOMAN SEWING BY LAMPLIGHT' BY JEAN-FRANÇOIS MILLET, FRICK COLLECTION At first glance this intimate Millet from 1870-72, of a peasant woman working with needle and thread while her child sleeps nearby, fits in well enough with its neighboring genre scene in the Frick's East Gallery: ''The Wool Winder,'' by Jean-Baptiste Greuze, which shows a pretty but distracted girl rolling yarn into a ball. Both works seem to look back at 17th-century Dutch painting, with its moralizing view of the domestic arts.
But the Millet is really just a distant cousin of the Greuze, which predates it by about a century. Consider the light that falls softly on the woman's face, blurring her features, but glints off the needle and thimble in her right hand. As it radiates out from the lamp, it becomes a nimbus of short, stippled brush strokes, which look very similar to the ones that define the pile of nubby fabric on the woman's lap. This connection implies that her sewing isn't just a mindless demonstration of virtue; it's an art or at least a kind of labor on par with the painter's.
Although the subject isn't identified, she might be Millet's wife or one of his daughters. In a letter from the same year he described the industrious women of his household: ''Everyone is at work around me, sewing and darning stockings. The table is covered with bits of cloth and balls of yarn. I watch from time to time the effects produced on all of this by the light of the lamp.'' KAREN ROSENBERG
'MOONLIGHT, STRANDGADE 30,' BY VILHELM HAMMERSHOI, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART You'll find this odd little painting by Vilhelm Hammershoi, a Danish contemporary of Edvard Munch, tucked away in an alcove near the Wisteria Dining Room, one of the Met's period rooms. Hammershoi's ''Moonlight, Strandgade 30'' (1900-5) stands in stark contrast to the swoony Art Nouveau interior, although it was painted just a few years earlier.
The moonlight that falls in neat squares on the floor might be a throwback to the 19th-century Romanticism of Caspar David Friedrich, who influenced many a Northern Symbolist. But there's also a bit of Vermeer, in the severity of the architecture, and Morandi, in the slightly claustrophobic mood. It's not surprising to learn that Hammershoi was a bit of a recluse, or that he painted this same viewless window over and over, at morning, noon and midnight, during a six-year period. (The Met's label also tells us that the window looks out on a loggia, rather than the outdoors.)
I also see the painting as an eerie premonition of Minimalism, not least because Hammershoi actually lived in such austere, minimalist spaces; before moving into the apartment at Strandgade, he and his wife had all the walls painted gray and the trim painted white. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke visited him there, and said of the place, ''Nothing here distracts the visitor from the light.'' KAREN ROSENBERG
'OFF MOUNT DESERT ISLAND' BY FITZ HENRY LANE, BROOKLYN MUSEUM Transcendentalism and pantheism were all the rage for romantic 19th-century intellectuals. As science eroded belief in distinctively embodied gods, poets reconceived divinity as an all-pervading energy. A group of 19th-century American painters known as the Luminists envisioned this in the form of light from sun and sky. Lane (also known as Fitz Hugh Lane), one of the group's best, painted seascapes and landscapes of miraculous lucidity. The son of a sailmaker in Gloucester, Mass., Lane was partly paralyzed in the legs by an early childhood encounter with a poisonous plant, which, it is tempting to theorize, may explain the haunting stillness of his images. The transparent surfaces made by the nearly brushless paint application invite you to see through to the intensely peaceful scenes beyond, as if through a window. Meditating on ''Off Mount Desert Island'' you may feel truly present in one of those moments when the world appears blessed by a light at once natural and supernatural.
Lane made ''Off Mount Desert Island'' in 1856, which is to say, just about five years before the start of the Civil War. It pictures a ship at anchor in far Down East Maine, then relatively unvisited by tourists. With the rising sun dusting the virgin land pink and a small boatload of sailors rowing toward shore, it still seems a place of infinite promise, a beckoning new Eden whose beneficent, effulgent skies will never be troubled by clouds of war. KEN JOHNSON
'UNTITLED' BY DAN FLAVIN, MUSEUM OF MODERN ART The Minimalist Dan Flavin created light by making sculptures out of a common source, commercially available fluorescent tubes. They are, in a sense, ready-mades with benefits: they bridge the gap between the corporeal and the spiritual with breathtaking economy. The untitled 1969 work on view in Gallery 20 at MoMA is not well known and is relatively small, made with just two of the shortest tubes available, which Flavin did not use often and rarely exclusively.
The piece is a concise summation of his tendency to play the diffuse, reflected light given off by the fluorescents against the more linear, intensely colored light of the tubes themselves, usually by having some tubes face the viewer and others face away. Here he uses one of each in a way that also exemplifies another rather brilliant strategy: spanning the corner of a room with an inward-facing fluorescent that tends to obscure this angle with a glow of, in this case, pink light.
A cross is formed by the horizontal of the yellow tube and the vertical of the pink tube's white enamel fixture, which together contrast source and effect. Furthermore, their cast light achieves religious connotations of the Christian kind, with the vertical glow of pink signifying a human presence and the yellow a kind of halo or aura. It is the essence of Flavin's art, mighty and miniaturized. ROBERTA SMITH
'BETWEEN EARTH AND HEAVEN' BY EL ANATSUI, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART Born in Ghana in 1944 but long a part-time resident of Nigeria, Mr. Anatsui has for years made sculptures from castoff materials he finds around him: evaporated-milk cans, worn-down wooden mortars, discarded printing plates and, over the past several years, aluminum liquor bottle caps produced by Nigerian distilleries.
Employing a small army of assistants he gathers thousands of these bottle tops and has them sorted by color, hammered into flat circles or strips and sewn together with copper wire into panel-like sheets. When enough sheets have been formed, he arranges them himself, like pieces of puzzles, into large, sometimes mural-size units to be hung in supple, draped, cascading swags on a wall, as in the 2006 piece ''Between Earth and Heaven,'' on view in the African galleries at the Met.
His stitching-together technique is similar to that found in traditional West African strip weaving, specifically in the making of Ghanaian kente cloth. The big physical difference is that Mr. Anatsui's fabric, being metallic, glints and shimmers with reflected light. The effect is like the display of a great ceremonial textile that still carries the marks of sources in popular culture.
Up close the colonial-sounding brand names of the original bottled spirits -- Bull, Bakassi, Concord, Chairman, Chelsea, Canon, Dark Sailor -- can still be seen printed on the flattened bottle tops. But those names are now subsumed into an African incandescence. So much for dark continents. HOLLAND COTTER
'MISTRESS AND MAID' BY JOHANNES VERMEER, FRICK COLLECTION Vermeer built a career on capturing light with paint, soft sunlight pouring into middle-class Dutch homes. He lived in such a home, though his life there was often clouded.
A slow worker, he produced little, and with a wife and 11 children he struggled to stay afloat. To manage expenses he shared a house in Delft with his mother-in-law, which cannot have been easy. When economic disaster hit the Netherlands in the 1670s, and the bottom fell out of the art market, he became despondent and died suddenly, possibly of a stroke, at 43.
''Mistress and Maid,"one of three Vermeers in the Frick Collection, is among his late works done between 1665 and 1670. It's uncharacteristically dark: no light-filled rooms, just undefined, shadowy space and a mood of uneasy suspense.
A maid appears from out of the gloom holding a letter. Her face has an expectant, almost beseeching look. A well-dressed woman seated at a writing table turns toward her, one hand raised to her chin in a gesture of worried hesitation. We seem to be present at a tense, possibly turning-point moment.
But what's at stake? Is the seated woman sending out a letter that she already regrets? Is she being handed a letter she dreads receiving?
Whatever Vermeer's anxious thoughts, light stayed on his mind. It scintillates in the pearls the woman wears in her hair and shines in the butter-yellow silk of her jacket. And the blacked-out space the women occupy turns out to have sunlit windows after all. We see them reflected in glassware on the writing table as tiny lozenges of light, far in the distance, as if at the end of a tunnel, but there. HOLLAND COTTER
'MARTYRDOM OF SAINT LAWRENCE, ' STAINED GLASS FROM CHRIST CHURCH CATHEDRAL, CANTERBURY, ENGLAND, THE CLOISTERS Window light, seen as an in-flowing of God's grace, is one of the great Christian symbols, and stained-glass windows are one of the great Christian art forms. Nowhere in the city are there finer examples than at the Cloisters, the Metropolitan Museum's outpost in northern Manhattan. A few of those examples survive more or less in their original form, including a suite of six 12-foot-high lancet windows, still together, depicting the Virgin Mary and five saints, made for a Carmelite church near Koblenz, Germany, in the 15th century. Most of the windows here, however, now exist only as fragments, as is the case with a leaded-glass panel, ''Martyrdom of Saint Lawrence,'' (1175-80), thought to be from the cathedral in Canterbury.
At some point in the 19th century the panel underwent revamping: A head from a different window was inserted, a Latin inscription tacked on. But what really mattered stayed: the glass colors, old and rich -- amethyst purple; emerald green; rose-red -- and the saint's S-shaped figure, gracefully tensed and strong.
Technically this is an image of an execution, showing an early Christian martyr being roasted on a grill. But we don't see horror or pain. We see an elegantly robed man, head reverentially bent, hands joined in prayer. Bright red flames lick up from below him but only to tickle his feet. Other flames -- rendered in curiously cool ash-gray and thought to represent internal, spiritual fire -- gather at his waist and shoulders and shoot from his head.
Fire cannot harm, and when sunlight strikes the panel, you understand what the real source of heat in this image is: the ardor of grace blazing -- purple, green, red -- through glass. HOLLAND COTTER
'JALAIS HILL, PONTOISE' BY CAMILLE PISSARRO, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART With its abundance of French oil studies and landscape paintings, the Met is the perfect place to study the evolving depiction of natural light that is one of the great stories of 19th-century painting. And one of the best works with which to begin this study is Pissarro's quietly radiant masterpiece, ''Jalais Hill, Pontoise,'' of 1867, tucked rather unceremoniously in a corner of the all-Pissarro room (Gallery 820) in the 19th-century European painting section. This sweeping vista of French countryside was a hit at the Salon of 1868, which has been called ''the site of the triumph'' of the French realist landscape.
The painting centers on a village and its carefully tended valley, seen from the vantage point of a curving dirt lane on an overgrown hill glimpsed in the canvas's lower right corner. But really the scene has no center; it presents a stunning wholeness.
You see its big bowl of land and sky all at once. The confidence of Pissarro's firm, relaxed brushwork -- unconcerned with detail but seeming to leave out nothing of importance -- reaffirms the solidity of the earth. His shifts in color and tone create the subtle play of light and shade that, like the paint, pulls everything together, from the distant hedgerowed fields to the two women ascending the curving road, one in white, the other in black. The contrast of their garments, starker than almost anything else in the picture, seems to imply that the grand impartiality of light is the painting's main theme. ROBERTA SMITH
'COMPOSITION IN RED, BLUE AND YELLOW' AND 'BROADWAY BOOGIE WOOGIE' BY PIET MONDRIAN, MUSEUM OF MODERN ART Light manifests itself in mysterious ways in abstract painting, but few are as palpable as the ''pings of light'' -- the little yellowish flashes created by the intersecting lines of his black scaffoldings -- in Mondrian's mature works. They are especially evident in his ''Composition in Red, Blue and Yellow,'' from 1937-42, in Gallery 9 at the Museum of Modern Art, intensified perhaps by the close spacing of some of the vertical lines on the right side of the canvas.
Here the pings form a veritable network and far outnumber the rather small blocks of color (four reds, two blues, one yellow). But part of the vitality of Mondrian's art is the way he made everything function as a form of light: his color blocks, his intersecting lines and especially his luminous, beautifully textured white grounds.
Hanging next to ''Composition in Red, Blue and Yellow'' at the Modern is ''Broadway Boogie Woogie,'' which Mondrian began in 1942, the year he finished the earlier work. This tribute to the vitality of Manhattan is the last painting that he completed before he died in New York in 1944. Evidently, the pings of yellow light inspired him to expand them, converting his signature black lines to yellow bands, dotted with squares of red, blue and light gray. In its fascinating rhythms we see the pulsing lights of the city's traffic, signs and buildings distilled into a painting that never sleeps. ROBERTA SMITH
'THE TERRACE AT VERNONNET' BY PIERRE BONNARD, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART Toward the end of his life Bonnard often equated light with color and heat, imbuing the French landscape with a degree of artificiality rarely seen since the Fauves. At least that is the effect he created with ''The Terrace at Vernonnet,'' of 1939, a large painting -- nearly 5 feet high and more than 6 feet across -- that hangs in Gallery 828 at the Met. It emits an unseasonal warmth that strikes your eye almost before you make out the image, which helps explain why Bonnard became a hero of the Color Field painters.
The picture depicts six figures, mostly women, scattered along an L-shaped terrace that they share with a lavender tree, a round, lavender cloth-covered table and an orange bench. Three of these figures, rendered in oranges and pinks, extend the sultriness; three others tend to echo the mostly lavender tones of the garden, trees and distant hills that stretch out behind them.
Although there are shadows, light doesn't so much fall upon the scene as emanate from its forms. Even the lavender tree seems lighted from within. Nonetheless Bonnard depicts a bit of sunlight penetrating the leaves of that tree, dappling the tablecloth with an archipelago of glowing, almost iridescent whiteness and proving that the cloth's lavender tone is shade, not fabric dye.
This scattering of white provides a startling reality check. It proves that the painting's overheated artifice is more naturalistic than first surmised. Bonnard was simply painting what he saw and felt, making sure that we would see, and feel, it too. ROBERTA SMITH
'PLATE DEPICTING A FLOWERING SHRUB IN TWO-TONED LUSTER,' IRAQ, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART There is more than one way to recreate and increase the effect of light in utilitarian objects. In the European period rooms at the Met, for example, you see how glass crystal in chandeliers multiplied the glow of candles, as did strategically placed mirrors on nearby walls. In the Arab Lands galleries there are many examples of luster-decorated ceramics, in which Islamic potters emulated the reflectivity of metalwork by applying metal oxides to white-glazed vessels that were then refired. The technique, first used on glassware in Syria and Egypt as early as the third century, was perfected over the next few centuries on ceramics in several Islamic countries.
That makes it possible to follow a lusterware trail through the Arab Lands galleries, reveling in the soft shimmer of these vessels and also in the variously brilliant drawing styles used in the luster's application. One of my favorites, found in an all-luster vitrine near the main entrance (take a right), is a largish plate from ninth-century Iraq that depicts a flowering shrub in two-toned luster. What first attracts the eye are several dozen fat circles that cover the center of the plate with a casual verve that might be called Matissean. Look closely and you'll see that each circle holds a lightly limned six-petal blossom. These encircled blooms are connected by undulating dotted lines that might be branches but also suggest the flight of a somewhat drunken bumblebee. ROBERTA SMITH
'26 JULY, 4:50 AM' BY TOYIN ODUTOLA, STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM The young Ms. Odutola is a Nigerian-born portraitist who works in blackness and light. Taking family members and friends as sitters, she begins each bust-length likeness with a loose sketch done in color washes, then fills it with patterns of tight, narrow, precisely drawn linear bands done in ballpoint pen.
The bands cross over and under one another like weaving or like the tissues and sinews of musculature, creating subtle highlights where they curve, giving the skin a subtle luster. And no matter how dense and black looking the patterns are, the facial features of the sitters come through in minute detail, literally eyelash by eyelash.
In one sense Ms. Odutola is interested in examining notions of blackness as a race-defining attribute, one that can make people, depending on the context, either invisible or vulnerable. Certain other, older artists, notably Kerry James Marshall, have done remarkable and complex things with the concept of blackness as a graphic marker of race, and Ms. Odutola, whose work can be seen in a group show called ''Fore'' at the Studio Museum in Harlem, takes the idea in a direction of her own. The blackness in her portraits is not blackness at all, in an essential, finite way.
The ballpoint ink colors she uses range from copper-brown to deep blue. Her sitters range across the ethnic spectrum. The colors that begin each portrait show through at the end. Beaming through chinks in the dark weave they look like stars in a night sky or filtered rainbows. HOLLAND COTTER
'A GORGE IN THE MOUNTAINS (KAUTERSKILL CLOVE)' BY SANFORD ROBINSON GIFFORD, METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART The gauzy light in this vertiginous view of the Catskill Mountains from 1862 separates it from other Hudson River School landscapes in the Met's American Wing. The warm haze is not just a background detail, as in, say, ''The Beeches'' by Asher B. Durand; it's the star of the picture, expanding to fill almost the entire canvas. We could almost be looking at a Rothko or an installation by James Turrell.
Gifford, a second-generation Hudson River School painter, styled himself after Durand and Thomas Cole (who also painted Kauterskill Clove). But he did not seem to be as interested in defining a particularly American mode of landscape painting. Here he pumps a Catskills vale full of Turneresque vapors, just as he had depicted the crater around Lake Nemi in Italy.
The diffuse golden glow is not at all bombastic. It's even a little bit mournful, which makes sense given that Gifford was serving in the Civil War when he painted it, and that one of his brothers had killed himself the previous year. Gifford returned to Kauterskill Clove many times before his own death in 1880. I imagine that he was soothed by the rounded slopes in this view, which look so different from the steep ones in Cole's paintings of the same area. Here they seem to cushion the sun like an old baseball glove. KAREN ROSENBERG
'CATS (RAYIST PERCEP. [TION] IN ROSE, BLACK, AND YELLOW)' BY NATALIA GONCHAROVA, MUSEUM OF MODERN ART This 1913 gem from the Guggenheim Museum's collection is now on loan to MoMA, where it can be seen in ''Inventing Abstraction, 1910-1925.'' There it introduces viewers to the short-lived Russian avant-garde movement known as ''Rayism'' (also sometimes called ''Rayonism''), a marriage of Cubism, Futurism and Orphism pioneered by Natalia Goncharova and her companion, Mikhail Larionov.
As described in the couple's 1913 manifesto Rayism sounds more like a science than an art movement: ''The sum of rays from object A intersects the sum of rays from object B; in the space between them a certain form appears, and this is isolated by the artist's will.'' But it clearly left a lot of room for interpretation, as Goncharova and Larionov dissolved representational images into shimmering, dynamic, disorienting compositions.
In this powerful painting by Goncharova, colliding rays turn three harmless furry creatures -- two black cats and a tabby -- into an optical minefield. Everything is irradiated, shot through with crisscrossing vectors of black, white and gold. Goncharova would go on to design stage sets for Diaghilev's Ballets Russes in Paris. Here she is an expert choreographer of light. KAREN ROSENBERG
'ROOMS BY THE SEA' BY EDWARD HOPPER, YALE UNIVERSITY ART GALLERY The light in many of Hopper's paintings appears overdetermined, as much psychological as natural. In ''Rooms by the Sea'' (1951), one of his strangest paintings, it is especially urgent and borderline surrealistic.
The painting offers a severely cropped view inside the studio Hopper designed and built in Truro, Mass., on Cape Cod. Most of the picture is filled by a blank white interior wall. To the lefta doorway affords a narrow exit to an empty sitting room. To the right, through an open door, we see the blue ocean, calm but alarmingly close. With no intervening porch or beach, it seems as if the house is floating out to sea. Morning light pours in, shaped by the rectangle of the door into a raking, hard-edged, geometric figure. The situation resembles a suspenseful decisive moment in an Alfred Hitchcock thriller.
Like the proximity of the water, something is alarming about how the light penetrates the room. You might imagine yourself seeing through the eyes of someone in a state of crisis, caught between the ordinariness of the sitting room to the left and the yawning, implacably inhuman space to the right, from which comes a frightening inrush of glaring, transpersonal energy.
If that seems an overly dramatic reading, consider this: Hopper's record book from the time refers to the painting as ''Rooms by the Sea. Alias the Jumping Off Place.'' He was advised that the second title had ''malignant overtones.'' KEN JOHNSON
'PORT-EN-BESSIN, ENTRANCE TO THE HARBOR' BY GEORGES-PIERRE SEURAT, MUSEUM OF MODERN ART A big trend in Modern art had artists thinking up and solving problems so that the problem and its solution are equally intelligible in the finished work. If Seurat was not the first artist of this kind, he certainly was one of the most systematically experimental painters of the 19th century.
He reasoned that since white light had been proven to consist of a whole spectrum of colors, it would be truer to its nature to render it literally as a mix of particles of color, like what we today call pixels. On a computer screen we usually prefer not to see the pixels; the exciting thing about Seurat's painting is that you see at once both the field of little spots and the spacious, strangely smooth and coolly luminous image they collectively produce.
It would be impossible to say what time of day it is in ''Port-en-Bessin: Entrance to the Harbor,'' from 1888. There is no directional light or shadow but rather a kind of general irradiation. Despite the careful attention to the scruffy foreground knob of land and the breakwater in the middle distance, and notwithstanding the scientific analysis of light and color, the effect is strangely unreal. All those toylike little boats flying winglike white sails and skimming across translucent blue waters -- where are they going? They are like ghosts at play in a world conjured by the light of consciousness itself. KEN JOHNSON

HEADLINE: Fiscal Deal Fails to Allay Doubts About U.S. Power

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Two years ago the departing chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Adm. Mike Mullen, declared that ''the most significant threat to our national security is our debt.'' After a decade in which the nation had chased Al Qaeda and invaded Iraq, Admiral Mullen was saying, in essence, that the biggest enemy was us.
Now that Congress and President Obama have slipped past the latest budget deadline with a bill that does little to address the country's long-term debt issues -- and by some measures might worsen them -- the worries of the national security establishment have been reignited. Most pointedly, military and diplomatic experts wonder whether the United States is at risk of squandering its global influence.
''There's a sense that we've been playing roulette with our position, and this deal does nothing to stop that,'' Richard N. Haass, the president of Council on Foreign Relations, said in an interview. His coming book, ''Foreign Policy Begins at Home,'' is part of a wave of recent literature arguing that America's reduced global ambitions are linked to its status as a debtor nation. 
Vali Nasr, who will soon publish ''The Dispensable Nation,'' argues that the debt, among other economic woes, has allowed Mr. Obama and other Democrats to justify a retreat from global engagement. ''It's made it far easier to say 'We can't do more,' '' said Mr. Nasr, the dean of the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University. ''And without addressing the debt issues, it will be easier to make that argument for years to come.''
A departing senior diplomat at the State Department who requested anonymity, ruminating on the outcome of the confrontation on the fiscal crisis, said that the failure to attack the long-term debt issues would become another reason ''to turn our backs on the Middle East and trim our sails on the new focus on Asia.''
That is the theme that the Chinese -- who have an interest in portraying the United States as a declining power unable to manage its economy -- are already promoting. ''The politicians have chosen to kick the can down the road,'' the state-run Xinhua news agency said in a commentary on Wednesday. ''The can will never disappear,'' it continued, warning that the United States was falling ''into an abyss you can never come out of.''
Most evidence suggests that the country's debt is not an immediate crisis. The deficit is expected to shrink somewhat in coming years, and even after the United States lost its AAA bond rating, foreigners have remained willing to lend the country money at very low interest rates. That is a sign of confidence in the American economy and a recognition that Europe and Asia have problems of their own.
But the aging of the population and the growth of health costs will most likely cause the deficit to grow rapidly in coming decades, meaning that the most difficult choices about taxes and spending are still ahead. Absent decisions on those issues, the government will have fewer resources and be more dependent on foreign lenders -- increasingly the Chinese.
''Partly it is about resources,'' Mr. Haass said, referring to the national security implications of the deficit. ''But it is also about reducing your vulnerability to the machinations of currency markets and potentially hostile central bankers'' who choose whether to buy American debt.
''When we appear to be dysfunctional, as we have in recent times, it makes it hard to be the model for the democratic, capitalistic model we say we want to be in the world,'' he added.
History suggests that the relationship between debt and American power is a complex one, subject to differing interpretations by both economists and historians. The federal debt exceeded 100 percent of the gross domestic product at the end of World War II, but the postwar period nonetheless marked the beginning of America's superpower status. The debt fell fairly steadily during the cold war, and it was cut to about a third of gross domestic product by the end of the Nixon administration -- even as the country retreated into a post-Vietnam War funk.
On the flip side, the era now regarded as America's ''unipower moment'' -- the Clinton years of the mid-1990s -- was also a time when the government was significantly reducing debt.
But historians point out that other factors besides debt have often driven the perception of American power. The growth of the American manufacturing behemoth in the '50s and '60s helped drive the nation's rise. So much seemed at stake in the cold war that most Western countries waited for Washington to act first, regardless of its postwar deficit. In the 1990s, the collapse of the Soviet Union left the United States as the only player with global reach -- and made it easier to cut defense budgets, suggesting that power drove deficits more than the reverse.
Today, the United States lacks many of those earlier advantages. With economic growth harder to come by, the only obvious way to make major cuts in the budget is to go after Social Security, Medicare and the $1 trillion national security budget -- which includes the military, intelligence, diplomacy and development. And whenever the United States decides not to engage in some part of the world, countries look to a new source of investment and aid: China.
That is certainly happening in countries that are waiting for the promised ''Arab Spring fund'' to aid emerging democracies.
''Morsi has played this very smart, asking the Chinese whether they are willing to invest in Egypt the way they have in Kenya or Uganda,'' Mr. Nasr said, referring to Egypt's president, Mohamed Morsi.
''What's happened is that we've been able to hide behind the economic argument to justify why we are no longer the venture capitalist of democracy,'' added Mr. Nasr, who worked for Richard C. Holbrooke, the special envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan early in the Obama administration who died in 2010.
When Mr. Obama came to office, no one made the argument about focusing on the domestic sources of American power more than the new president. He used that as an argument for ending America's military presence in Iraq and moving to the exits in Afghanistan. ''Our prosperity provides a foundation for our power,'' Mr. Obama said in 2009. ''It pays for our military. It underwrites our diplomacy.''
In the presidential campaign last year, he pushed back at arguments about long-term American decline. Since his re-election, his aides have as well, arguing that the restoration of growth, though slow, and exploitation of new sources of American oil and gas have set the stage for a revival over the next four years.

HEADLINE: From Bangladesh, a Photo Festival Builds Bridges

BYLINE: JAMES ESTRIN


HIGHLIGHT: Founded in 1999, the Chobi Mela International Festival of Photography in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is truly international, showcasing photographers from 23 countries and every continent except Antarctica. 

 BODY:
There are well over a hundred photo festivals around the world, and new ones pop up almost daily. Many claim to be international, usually exhibiting a few local photographers alongside some international - read Western - photographic luminaries.
What sets apart the Chobi Mela International Festival of Photography in Dhaka, Bangladesh, is that it is not only truly international, but is also perhaps the world's most demographically inclusive festival. Running this year from Jan. 25 through Feb. 7, it will feature photographers from 23 countries and every continent except Antarctica. This year, separate programs, presentations and exhibits focus on photography from China, Russia, Nigeria, Latin America and the Middle East as well as Bangladesh.
The festival was started by Shahidul Alam, the founder of the Drik Picture Agency and the Pathshala South Asian Media Institute and the force behind the ascendance of Bangladeshis in the global photographic community. The festival lets fine art photographers, conceptual artists and photojournalists explore issues of social inequality, injustice and cultural and economic hegemony. This year's theme is fragility. 
"At Chobi Mela, we actively try to engage with photography that is not so well known but is from a very different perspective and challenges the predominant culture of photography," said Mr. Alam, who is the director of Chobi Mela.
Since it started in 1999, Chobi Mela has had many noted international participants, including this year Eugene Richards, Graciela Iturbide, Walter Astrada and Anastasia Taylor-Lind. But there are many more photographers who are little known in Europe or the United States.
That combination of photographers lends the festival a syncretic touch - sometimes exemplified in the same person. Maïmouna Guerresi was raised a Catholic in Italy but converted to Islam after encountering an African Sufi community in Senegal. She is a sculptor, video artist and photographer who lives both in Italy and Senegal.
At Chobi Mela, Ms. Guerresi is exhibiting images (Slides 1 to 7) of mystical figures from Islamic Africa that she created by posing her multiethnic family in robes that are also sculptures she made. Only her subjects' faces, hands and sometimes their feet are revealed. She views the images as metaphysical, photographs that are not about "people or facts but represent 'infinity and cosmic space.' "
"Maïmouna is looking at a religious and a cultural phenomenon in a visually arresting manner," Mr. Alam said. "But she is also describing it in a conceptual way as opposed to the more literal, documentary rendering we've seen about Sufism by and large."
Mr. Alam also selected the documentary work of Saiful Huq Omi for this year's festival. He is a Bangladeshi photographer (Slides 8 to 12) who has been documenting the plight of the Rohingyas, a Burmese Muslim ethnic minority. Tens of thousands of them have fled oppression, human rights violations and violence in western Myanmar and now live as refugees in Bangladesh.
Their life there is hardly better. Women living in refugee camps have been gang-raped, sometimes more than once, and they have been forced to marry local musclemen. The refugees receive little support from the government of Bangladesh and have been classified as illegal immigrants.
"In Bangladesh, the Rohingyas now survive in inhumane conditions - 16 or more refugees live in a room that is barely more than three square meters with food and medicine scarce," Mr. Omi wrote in his exhibition statement. "Almost 80 percent of children and 53 percent of adults were reportedly suffering from chronic malnutrition."
Mr. Alam said he created the Chobi Mela festival primarily so Bangladeshi photographers could be more widely exposed globally, extending to international audiences.
"I wanted to create a bridge," he said. "But it also gives us a chance to take stock of this remarkable transformation that is taking place within photography in Bangladesh."

HEADLINE: A Populism Worthy of the Name

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Erick Erickson's new agenda and the future of right-wing populism. 

 BODY:
A big part of the story of the fiscal cliff negotiations, now half-resolved and half-postponed, was that the populist wing of the Republican Party couldn't quite figure what it wanted to actually achieve, or how. The broad goals of less spending and lower taxes were clear enough, but on anything more specific the politicians and activists on the grassroots right seemed confused about what they thought the party should to be negotiating toward, or what they expected that their calls for harder hardball and/or cliff-diving would actually win in the end. (The scenarios being spun out tended to either envision extracting never-gonna-happen concessions from the Democrats across weeks of brand-destroying brinksmanship, or embracing a truly massive defeat on taxes as a "the worse, the better" step toward eventual conservative resurgence.) This confusion was obvious throughout, but particularly during the brief window on Tuesday when there was talk of House Republicans sending the bill back to the Senate with some amendments tacked on. If there had been any kind of strategically-plausible consensus about how conservatives actually wanted the compromise amended, then that gambit might have made some sense. But there wasn't, so it didn't. 
This is not a new problem on the right. As I've suggested before, Mitt Romney didn't overcome the G.O.P.'s populist mood to win his party's nomination because of a conspiracy between squishy party elites to nominate a moderate country club Republican like themselves. Rather, Romney won because the party's populists never found plausible leaders or a plausible message to match the voters' anti-establishment impulses. The strangest and most self-defeating feature of recent Republican politics is that while the party's populists talk a good game about championing regular Americans and taking on the party's Georgetown cocktail partygoers and Wall Street insiders, when it comes time to advocate actual policy they mostly just embrace more extreme, less workable versions of the ideas those same insiders already endorse. (Both the Mike Huckabee-endorsed Fair Tax and Herman Cain's 9-9-9 plan, to pick two prominent examples, are like parodies of the Wall Street Journal editorial page's long-running view that taxes should be much lower on, well, Journal readers and slightly higher on the lower middle class.) The result, in the anti-Washington season of 2012, was a Republican primary campaign that was hotly contested yet intellectually sterile, with the anti-establishment candidates competing on style rather than substance, and the (obvious) populist case against Romney bubbling up in weird, substance-free ways, from Santorum's sweater vests to the policy-free Gingrich-Perry attacks on Bain Capital.
Given all this recent history, then, it was very interesting to read this post-New Year's post by Erick Erickson making the case for what he describes as a "new agenda" for conservatives. Erickson is the model of a populist political-media entrepreneur: He's the editor of RedState and an Atlanta talk radio host, a scourge of Democrats and moderate Republicans alike, a champion of America's conservative river valleys against its liberal coasts, a man who never met a cliff he didn't want to jump or a Beltway deal he wasn't ready to dismiss as a betrayal of conservative principle. I rarely (never?) agree with Erickson about G.O.P. tactics, up to and including his latest post on Republicans and the debt ceiling, and during the campaign just past he often seemed to embody the pathos of right-wing populism: Like many conservatives, he was against Romney without really being for anyone else in the primaries, and he spent September as one of the most prominent defenders of Romney's disastrous "47 percent" donor pander - understandably enough, since it was a framing that he had helped popularize in the first place.
But Erickson's "new agenda" post opens up a path out of futility for the populist right. It's an outline, not a policy paper, but basically he argues for 1) a more family-friendly turn in tax policy, and a focus on payroll taxes as well as income taxes; 2) a more anti-corporate, anti-Wall Street turn in economic policy, based on a recognition that "the Fortune 500 has less and less in common with the fortunes of the average American," (for readers well-versed in D.C. wonk controversies, he even sneaks in a dig at the G.O.P.'s ill-thought-out support for the existing copyright regime) and 3) a focus on the cost of higher education, in pursuit of what he calls "a low cost BA." These ideas share space in his post with old conservative standbys like regulatory reform, school choice, and repealing Obamacare. But they are not old standbys themselves, and they offer a glimpse of what a more constructive and effective right-wing populism might be able to offer to the party - and a glimpse, too, of what might have been had Republicans thought harder about policy in 2012 instead of just expecting the economy to deliver them the White House.
True, some ideas along these lines were floated or gestured at during the 2012 primary: Rick Santorum talked a lot about family breakdown and had a modestly pro-family tax plan, Jon Huntsman had a break-up-the-banks plan, and if Rick Perry's campaign hadn't drowned in two feet of water, he might have talked up some of the Texan higher ed reforms that Erickson mentions. But there was no sustained attempt to define conservative populism as more family-friendly, middle-class-friendly, and anti-corporatist than Beltway Republicanism. Instead, the populists mostly defined themselves by the pitch of their rhetoric and the implausibility of their proposals, and the only substantive pressure they put on Mitt Romney was pressure to embrace a Wall Street Journal-approved tax plan that was predictably and easily attacked, come the general election, as another Republican giveaway to the rich.
More middle-class friendly proposals might not have carried a Perry or a Santorum or a Pawlenty to victory. But they might have changed the way Romney had to position himself, and changed his general election fortunes in the process. And they might do the same for the near-future G.O.P. The current elite consensus is that the Republican Party will ultimately be saved from irrelevance only when its establishmentarians impose some sanity on the Tea Party radicals, and drag their party kicking and screaming back toward the center. But Erickson's proposed agenda offers a different model for how reform might come to the right: Not through the high-minded influence of the self-consciously moderate, but through populists and cultural conservatives realizing that they have more to offer their party and their country than just more outlandish variations on what K Street and Wall Street already support.

HEADLINE: Notes on 2012 North American Auto Sales

BYLINE: JERRY GARRETT


HIGHLIGHT: The F-Series line was America's best-selling vehicle in 2012, with 645,316 trucks sold, compared with 418,312 for the Chevrolet Silverado, which was No. 2. 

 BODY:
The just-released 2012 North American auto sales data offer some insights into some marquee sales match-ups, like the crown for America's best-selling vehicle, Ford vs. Chevy for muscle-car bragging rights and how well America's definition of luxury stacks up against foreign competition.
Using a Nascar analogy, Ford's F-Series trucks seem to have broken the draft on rival pickups from Chevrolet and GMC, and are pulling away. The F-Series line was America's best-selling vehicle in 2012, with 645,316 trucks sold, compared with 418,312 for the Chevrolet Silverado, which was No. 2. Even if the largely similar GMC Sierra's sales of 157,185 were lumped together with Silverado's numbers, Ford still leads by about 70,000 units. 
Analysts also noted that G.M. trucks ended up as close as they did only by having the company slap huge incentives (up to $6,000 and even more, in some cases) on an 80-day inventory glut that existed as of Nov. 30. G.M. said it finished the year with a 30-day inventory, which was in line with what it said it needed to bridge a gap between the end of production of its outgoing 2013 models and the ramp-up in production next spring of its redesigned 2014 trucks.
Ford's F-Series sales for the year were up 10.3 percent, while Silverado eked out a 0.8 percent gain because of the December incentive push. Sierra was up 5.4 percent in 2012.
The big gainer, in terms of volume and percentage, was the Ram truck line, which was split from the Dodge brand in 2009. Ram sales were up a robust 19.9 percent for the year, a gain of nearly 50,000 units over 2011's solid sales. Ram finished the year as America's seventh best-selling vehicle. December marked Ram's 32nd consecutive month of year-over-year sales growth, the company said.
Another marquee sales race, Chevrolet Camaro vs. Ford Mustang, to borrow another racing analogy, saw a close duel to the finish line.
As it did in 2011, Camaro won again. But Camaro's 2011 margin of 18,000 units over Mustang slipped, to less than 1,500 in 2012. The final totals showed Camaro with 84,391 to 82,995 for Mustang.
The trend line, however, seems to favor Mustang, sales of which jumped 17.8 percent in 2012 from its total of 70,438 units sold in 2011. Camaro, meanwhile, had a 4.3 percent decline from the 88,249 units it sold a year earlier.
Those totals did not rank either of those cars among the industry's top sellers. Camaro and Mustang were in about 50th place among the 260 or so models tracked in the United States sales race in 2012.
Dodge's Challenger was almost a footnote in this race, with sales of 43,110.
One of the worst sales stories of 2012 involved the Buick Regal, whose sales plunged 38.7 percent, year over year, to just 24,616 units. The rest of the Buick brand overcame Regal's dismal performance, to finish 2012 with a 2 percent sales gain over 2011.
Finishing in the black was a huge accomplishment compared with America's other luxury carmakers. Cadillac was down 2 percent, while Lincoln was off 4 percent, despite that each introduced important new models in 2012.
Meanwhile, most German and Japanese luxury automakers were enjoying banner sales years in America; BMW, Mercedes-Benz, Lexus, Acura, Audi, Infiniti and Porsche all experienced sales gains of 14-27 percent in 2012 and recorded either record totals or their best totals since the onset of the 2008 recession.
Besides the American luxury brands, the only other luxury carmakers whose 2012 sales were as disappointing were British brands Lotus, Aston Martin and Jaguar.
Rolls-Royce avoided that list by selling 22 vehicles more in 2012 than it did in 2011 (384, up from 362) for a 6 percent increase.

HEADLINE: Historians Look Back, and Inward, at Annual Meeting

BYLINE: JENNIFER SCHUESSLER


HIGHLIGHT: Sessions at American Historical Association conference look at storytelling, used goods, and the relationship between horses and humans across three continents. 

 BODY:
NEW ORLEANS - Some 4,000 historians descended on New Orleans on Thursday for the American Historical Association's four-day annual meeting, replacing the chants of departing Sugar Bowl revelers with more sober talk of job interviews, departmental politics, and - at least in the official panels - the past itself. 
As usual, the meeting's 300-plus sessions touched on contemporary issues like climate change, the 2012 presidential election, and the Arab Spring, along with more purely scholarly topics big ("Horstory: Equines and Humans in Africa, Asia and North America") and small ("Trash and Treasure: The Significance of Used Goods in America, 1880-1950"). But for many in attendance, the most urgent question was the state of the historical profession itself in an era of budget cuts and declining humanities enrollments. 
At a panel called "The Skyscraper Index, the Hemline Index, Champagne, Nail Polish and the Dow Jones," scholars analyzed the colorful - and usually suspect - metrics that journalists and other commentators sometimes use to track the state of the economy. 
In the official conference hotels clustered on Canal Street, it was tempting to look for similarly offbeat indicators of the perennially troubled job market for history doctorates: The number of special "historian-themed cocktails" quaffed at the conference hotel bars? The profusion of sessions with titles like "The Entrepreneurial Historian" or "Exploring a Range of Careers Outside the Academy"? The rueful Twitter post noting that the meeting was generating only .5 tweets per minute, compared with the 13 per minute for the annual convention of the Modern Language Association held simultaneously in Boston?
Or perhaps it was the hearty laughter that followed when the journalist Michael Pollan, at Thursday night's opening plenary panel, asked: "Why do people like me who use your work end up selling more books than you do?"
Tension between popular and scholarly approaches to history can get rancorous, as the recent dust-up over Steven Spielberg's "Lincoln" can attest. But Mr. Pollan's quip wasn't meant as a victory dance. The deep perspective offered by professional historians, he said, is an essential public good in a world where "every politician would have us forget what he said yesterday," and too few journalists are willing (and perhaps able) to cry foul. 
And there was little disagreement from his fellow panelists, four distinguished historians and one publisher who had been summoned to ponder "The Public Practice of History in a Digital Age."
"If we were as lost in space as we are in time, we would be freaking out," said Edward Ayers, the president of the University of Richmond and a host of the popular podcast "BackStory with the American History Guys." 
But there was less agreement over what was to blame for the marginal status of academic history in a world that gobbles heroic biographies of the Founders and turns Twitter feeds like Real Time WWII into viral sensations, but takes a pass on the kind of impersonal, analytic history that academic departments reward.
For William Cronon, a historian at the University of Wisconsin at Madison, and the outgoing president of the history association, the problem is insufficient attention to basic storytelling. Historians, he said, tend to default to a dry omniscient voice that hasn't changed since the 19th-century, despite the fact that historians no longer believe in that kind of omniscience. 
"We are a deeply narrative discipline, but we give very little thought to who the narrator is," he said. 
Niko Pfund, the president of Oxford University Press, seconded the notion, pointing additionally to the history profession's continued reliance on the scholarly monograph for tenure decisions. Historians, more than any other group of scholars, he said, remain "absolutely imprisoned in the format of the printed book," a situation he called "borderline catastrophic."
Not that all the panelists were ready to throw footnotes and peer-review standards out with the monograph. The designated power-blogger on the panel, Claire Potter, a professor at the New School and the author of the blog Tenured Radical, questioned the printed book's status as a professional "fetish object," but defended the value of traditional historical training against those who have called on departments to stop training so many doctoral students who will later find themselves without jobs. 
"I think we should be educating as many Ph.D.'s as possible," she said. 
In the end, the panel seemed to agree on a loose and egalitarian notion of who counted as a "historian." Jon Stewart, several agreed, was a good public historian simply for confronting politicians with inconvenient truths about the past. A historian, Mr. Ayers added, is simply someone who has interesting things to say about the past, and can point to the documentary record to prove them. 
That why-can't-we-get-along outlook, coming from scholars who had already run the tenure gauntlet, drew a mixed response from the audience. And it hardly seems likely to defuse intellectual turf wars like the debate over "Lincoln."
At a packed panel earlier in the day on "The Emancipation Proclamation at 150," a question about the film's "great man" view of emancipation drew an awkward silence from the panel followed by a laugh.
Kate Masur, a professor at Northwestern University who wrote a much-discussed New York Times Op-Edblasting the film for ignoring African-Americans' active role in their own emancipation, said that her view of the film softened somewhat after she went to see it again with groups of students. 
David Blight, a professor at Yale who was briefly an adviser on the film, defended it, cautiously, as delivering a useful public lesson on the 13th Amendment, even if it ended up reinforcing a simplified heroic narrative of Lincoln.
The movie, Mr. Blight said, shows us Lincoln the great abolitionist, rather than the "much messier" and more conflicted pre-1863 Lincoln who believed, among other things, that African-Americans should ultimately be "repatriated" to Africa.
"But no one is going to make that movie," he added.

HIGHLIGHT: President Obama said he would not get into another fight over the debt ceiling. 

 BODY:
Following the fiscal cliff deal, President Obama declared that he would not get into another fight over the debt ceiling.
Nice idea, I thought, but fat chance.
The Congressional Republicans are already getting ready for that fight. "In a couple of months, the president will ask us to raise the nation's debt limit," said Senator Mitch McConnell, the minority leader. "We cannot agree to increase that borrowing limit without agreeing to reforms that lower the avalanche of spending that's creating this debt in the first place." 
That's the usual Republican disinformation. Mr. Obama is required by law to ask Congress to authorize more borrowing to cover debts on spending that Congress already authorized. The president makes no decision here; he just delivers the news.

Mr. Obama's choices are limited. He can invoke the 14th Amendment and unilaterally raise the debt ceiling. (The 14th Amendment says the government may take no action that calls into question "the validity of the public debt of the United States, authorized by law.") But he has never shown the stomach for that kind of confrontation, and the White House has already ruled out that idea.
His only other real choice (setting aside the trillion-dollar coin idea as too cute) is just as confrontational. It's to keep his word by simply refusing to enter into negotiations, and telling the Republicans that the proverbial ball is in their court. That they can either vote to increase the debt ceiling, or not, and risk both an economic collapse as well as the blame for a collapse.
To make that work, Mr. Obama will have to forcefully counter Republican propaganda over the debt and the nature of the debt ceiling, which he hasn't done successfully in the past. And he'll have to stand firm, which he hasn't done successfully in the past.
Some on the right, at least outside of the official Party, are easing Mr. Obama's path by publicly acknowledging the weakness of the Republican position. The Wall Street Journal editorial page warned yesterday that if the G.O.P. fights over the ceiling, "Mr. Obama will say Republicans are risking national default and recession, most of Wall Street will echo him, and the Treasury will maneuver to apply maximum political pressure-for example, by claiming it can't pay Social Security benefits."
More to the point, it said "you can't take a hostage you aren't prepared to shoot."
Still, Mr. Obama should remember that if he makes any offer linked to the debt ceiling, he will have lost the war. He will end up negotiating with himself again, as he did over the fiscal cliff, and the debt ceiling nonsense will become a permanent part of budget talks.

HEADLINE: Big Ticket | Sold for $50,000,000

BYLINE: ROBIN FINN


HIGHLIGHT: A full-floor, four-bedroom apartment on Fifth Avenue that spans 5,000 square feet and commands an impressive view of Central Park was the most expensive sale of the week. 

 BODY:
Another in the skein of palatial domiciles with Central Park vistas and/or impeccable Fifth or Park Avenue pedigrees that named their price in a resurgent 2012 luxury market and received it without the nuisance of negotiations, a full-floor co-op at 944 Fifth Avenue that sold for $50 million was the most expensive sale of the week, according to city records. And it wasn't even a penthouse with wraparound terraces. In fact, it is not a penthouse nor does it possess any outdoor space.
But the apartment, No. 11, spans 5,000 square feet and commands an impressive 70 feet of frontage on Fifth Avenue above the treetops of Central Park - shown to full advantage by seven oversize picture windows that transform western views into seasonal portraits - so it does possess ample trophy attributes. 
With four bedrooms, and renovated to impress a dozen years ago by Thad Hayes, the go-to designer for deep-pocketed avatars of "timeless" good taste like the Lauder family, the apartment rambles from front to back for a grand total of 12 rooms, not counting a separate but equally elegant two-bedroom, two-bath guest suite on the ground floor. 
The main apartment, with wide-plank oak floors, has a private elevator landing and 30 windows to capture all four exposures; each bedroom has its own private windowed bathroom, and the master bedroom, with a fireplace and park views, also has a walk-in closet with a south-facing window. The library, which faces the park, is flanked by the master on one corner and a 27-foot living room on the other; pocket doors connect, or discreetly segregate, the three rooms with prime Fifth Avenue frontage. The monthly fees are $20,804.
The sellers, the investor David T. Hamamoto and his wife, Martha, bought the co-op and its downstairs adjunct 14 years ago, and with their two children they moved in after a two-year tweaking by Mr. Hayes. Mr. Hamamoto, who resigned last fall as the executive chairman of the Morgans Hotel Group, is the longtime chairman of the NorthStar Realty Finance Corporation, which with Deutsche Bank acquired the landmark John Hancock Center in Chicago last year. When the Hamamotos listed the apartment in June, their broker, John Burger of Brown Harris Stevens, said the couple had opted to downsize because their children were grown and they no longer needed such an opulent space.
Citing a confidentiality agreement, Mr. Burger declined to comment on the sale or verify the identity of the buyer. But the buyer was named in public records as Frank McCourt, provoking not-so-idle speculation that the Frank McCourt who was sufficiently flush to pay the full listing price in December is very likely the former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball franchise, which was sold to an investment group headed by Magic Johnson for a record $2.15 billion last spring after filing for bankruptcy.
Mr. McCourt, who made his fortune in parking lots, bought the club for $430 million in 2004 but had since been maligned as an imprudent team owner whose bitter public detractors include his ex-wife, Jamie. Also a former chief executive of the Dodgers, she filed suit last fall requesting that the terms of their divorce be set aside because Mr. McCourt had undervalued his assets.
In Los Angeles, his venture into sports ownership was decried as an ego trip, but Mr. McCourt apparently received a warm welcome at 944 Fifth, a 14-story white-glove limestone establishment designed by Nathan Korn and built in 1925, and lately a favorite of financiers and investors who prize their privacy. All of the upper units occupy full floors. It seems Mr. McCourt has switched coasts and traded one sort of trophy for another. All it took was $50 million.
 Big Ticket includes closed sales from the previous week, ending Wednesday.

HEADLINE: The Complexities of Comparing Medicare Choices

BYLINE: UWE E. REINHARDT


HIGHLIGHT: Whether private Medicare Advantage plans are more or less expensive than traditional fee-for-service Medicare depends on how you do your sums, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Uwe E. Reinhardt is an economics professor at Princeton. He has some financial interests in the health care field. 
The roughly 50 million Americans covered by the federal Medicare program have a choice of receiving their benefits under the traditional, free-choice, fee-for-service Medicare program or from a private, managed-care Medicare Advantage plan. The private plans have a steadily increasing number of enrollees - currently 13 million, or 27 percent of beneficiaries.
A fundamental question that has engaged health-policy researchers and commentators for some time is whether coverage of Medicare's standard benefit package under Medicare Advantage plans is cheaper or more expensive than it is under traditional fee-for-service Medicare. 
The answer is yes.

At the risk of going over ground already covered in Economix and in the scholarly literature on the subject, this answer may warrant some explanation. 
The latest round in the debate over the question was begun in August 2012 by Zirui Song, David M. Cutler and Michael E. Chernew in their paper "Potential Consequences of Reforming Medicare Into a Competitive Bidding System." In that paper, the authors explored how much more above their regular Part B premiums the elderly would have had to pay in 2009 to either a Medicare Advantage plan or to traditional Medicare if the much-debated Ryan-Wyden plan for Medicare had been in place that year. 
That plan would have established a Medicare Exchange - a federal version of the insurance exchanges envisaged under the Affordable Care Act - on which Medicare beneficiaries could have chosen among private health plans that would compete with traditional Medicare on the same terms, that is, on the same competitive platform.
Each private plan would have had to offer a benefit package that covered at least the actuarial equivalent of the benefit package provided by the traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Medicare's contribution (or "premium support") to the full premium for any of these choices, including traditional Medicare, would have been equal to the "second-least-expensive approved plan or fee-for-service Medicare" in the beneficiary's county, whichever was least expensive. That premium support payment would have been adjusted upward for the poor and the sick and downward for the wealthy.
Drs. Song, Cutler and Chernew estimated that on the basis of a national average the second-lowest bids actually submitted by private health plans in the various counties and regions in 2009 were 9 percent below the comparable average per-beneficiary cost of traditional Medicare. 
Close to 70 percent of the beneficiaries in 2009 would have had to pay more than their traditional Part B premiums to stay in traditional Medicare. About 90 percent of beneficiaries in private Medicare Advantage plans in 2009 would have paid more than they actually did in that year. 
These figures suggest substantial savings for United States taxpayers, although not for beneficiaries. Mindful of the beneficiaries, the authors ended their paper with reservations about the Ryan-Wyden plan, rather than an enthusiastic endorsement. 
In an acerbic comment on that paper, published in The Weekly Standard, James C. Capretta and Yuval Levin saw in the authors' numbers strong support for Ryan-Wyden or similar market-driven plans and sharply took the authors to task for their interpretation of the data.
But so far the Ryan-Wyden plan is only theory. In fact, as is by now widely known, enrollment of Medicare beneficiaries in private Medicare Advantage plans actually has cost taxpayers considerably more than it would have cost had the same beneficiaries stayed in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. As the Medicare Payment Advisory Commission, or Medpac, observes in its March 2009 report to Congress (see Page 252):
In 2009, payments to MA plans continue to exceed what Medicare would spend for similar beneficiaries in FFS. MA payments per enrollee are projected to be 114 percent of comparable FFS spending in 2009, compared with 113 percent in 2008. This added cost contributes to the worsening long-range financial sustainability of the Medicare program.
These extra payments to Medicare Advantage plans in 2009 have been estimated at $11.4 billion.
How, then, is one to reconcile these contradictory claims over the likely benefits from competitive bidding for Medicare's business by private health plans? 
The answer can be found in the bureaucratic arrangement enacted as part of the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement and Modernization Act of 2003. 
Remarkably, the Republican authors of that bill in the White House and in the Congress - usually self-proclaimed champions of market-driven competition - eschewed that approach in favor of a statutory, administrative algorithm so complex as to defy description within the space of this post (for details see this Commonwealth Fund document). 
Most likely, the bureaucratic route was chosen at the behest of private insurers that would have insisted that a truly competitive approach required traditional Medicare to be treated as just another health plan competing with private plans on identical terms. In the process, however, the industry managed to extract from Congress remarkably generous terms.
Under those terms, Medicare's benchmark for a county or region is not based on competitive bids at all but is administratively set with appeal to the average spending per beneficiary in traditional fee-for-service Medicare in the county or region in which a beneficiary resides, albeit with a variety of adjustments that push the resulting county or regional benchmarks considerably above per-beneficiary spending under traditional Medicare. Austin Frakt neatly illustrates the resulting benchmarks graphically. 
In this system, the private plans do submit premium bids for a statistically average ("standard") beneficiary in the relevant county or region, and for Medicare's standard benefit package. These so-called standard bids are the actual bids used in the Song, Cutler and Chernew analysis. 
If a Medicare Advantage plan submits for a county or region a standard bid above Medicare's relevant benchmark, the plan is paid by Medicare a "base rate" (for the statistically average beneficiary) equal to that benchmark. It means, of course, that the plan is paid more than the relevant per beneficiary spending under traditional Medicare. The Medicare Advantage plan must then collect the difference between its bid and the benchmark from the enrollee (on top of the Part B premium the enrollee must pay in any event). 
Medicare's payment to the plan for a particular enrollee, however, is not just the "base rate." The actual payment quite properly reflects the individual beneficiary's actuarial risk. That multiplicative adjustment is clearly illustrated in Figure 1 of this Medpac publication, where it is called "CMS-HHS Weight." 
On the other hand, if a Medicare Advantage plan's bid is below Medicare's relevant benchmark, then that plan is paid its bid plus a fixed percentage of the difference between its bid and the benchmark, a so-called rebate. Most of that rebate must be spent by the plan on added benefits not in Medicare's standard benefit package, although some undoubtedly flows into profits. 
For 2012, the fixed percentage for the rebates ranges from 67 to 73 percent, depending on a quality rating score. After 2014, the fixed percentages will be 50, 65 and 70 percent, depending on the plan's quality rating. 
The table below, a reproduction of Table 12-3 of the March 2012 Medpac Report to Congress, exhibits the nationwide averages of the Medicare benchmarks, the standard bids by plans and the projected payments to plans under this complex "bidding" system. The different types of plans (health maintenance organizations, preferred provider organizations and private fee-for-service plans) were described in an earlier post. Special-needs plans concentrate on patients requiring home care or other special care. Employer plans are offered by particular employers. 
It is seen that all Medicare Advantage plans together and especially H.M.O.'s do appear to bid less on average than per-beneficiary spending under traditional Medicare. That would seem to justify the argument that, on average, under genuine competition Medicare Advantage plans as a group would be cheaper than traditional Medicare.
These differentials - here two percentage points for all Medicare Advantage plans and five percentage points for H.M.O.'s - are a bit misleading, however, because the traditional Medicare spending figures include add-ons that are not part of providing health care to Medicare beneficiaries. Traditional Medicare makes payments for graduate medical education and so-called disproportionate share payments to hospitals that treat a disproportionate share of Medicaid patients or uninsured patients. Private Medicare Advantage plans do not have to make such payments. 
There is the additional suspicion that even after risk adjustment, the private Medicare Advantage plans still benefit to some extent from favorable actuarial risk selection.
So the question remains: Is coverage of Medicare's standard benefit package under private Medicare Advantage plans cheaper or more expensive than it is under traditional fee-for-service Medicare?
Readers now know why the correct answer is yes.
Whether Congress will ever have the temerity to foist upon vendors to the Medicare program truly raw price competition remains an open question. Traditionally vendors to government have preferred administered prices, for reasons evident in the table above.

HEADLINE: Google's Antitrust Victory

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday that Google had not violated antitrust or anticompetition laws in the way it arranges its search results. | The Securities and Exchange Commission has ended its investigation of David L. Sokol without filing insider trading charges. | Wegelin &#038; Company, Switzerland's oldest private bank, admitted on Thursday to helping Americans evade taxes. | The eye care products maker Bausch &#038; Lomb is said to have attracted interest from suitors for a potentially $10 billion sale. 

 BODY:
GOOGLE'S ANTITRUST VICTORY | The Federal Trade Commission said on Thursday that Google had not violated antitrust or anticompetition laws in the way it arranges its search results - a major victory for the Internet giant after a nearly two-year investigation. The decision amounts to "a slap on the wrist," The New York Times's Claire Cain Miller and Nick Wingfield write.
Edward Wyatt reports: "By allowing Google to continue to present search results that highlight its own services, the F.T.C. decision could enable Google to further strengthen its already dominant position on the Internet. It also enables Google to avoid a costly and lengthy legal war of attrition like the antitrust battle that Microsoft waged in the 1990s." The decision may set up a conflict with officials in Europe, where Google is battling similar concerns. 
The five members of the F.T.C. voted unanimously to close the investigation without bringing charges. "While not everything Google did was beneficial, on balance we did not believe that the evidence supported an F.T.C. challenge to this aspect of Google's business under American law," Jon Leibowitz, chairman of the F.T.C., said. Mr. Wyatt writes: "Google did agree to make some minor changes to its search practices related to search advertising. The F.T.C. said those commitments were enforceable if the company violated them, but the agreement avoided a formal consent decree or litigation, weapons that the F.T.C. had available."
In making their case to regulators, Google executives traveled to Washington and applied lessons learned from Microsoft's antitrust battle. The army of executives, lawyers, lobbyists and engineers argued "that technology is such a fast-moving industry that regulatory burdens would hinder its evolution," and that the "definition of competition in the tech industry is also different and constantly changing," people briefed on the discussions told The Times. Google spent $13.1 million on lobbying in the first three quarters of 2012, compared with $5.9 million in the period a year earlier, and the company's executive chairman, Eric E. Schmidt, has become a close adviser to President Obama.
NO CHARGES FOR FORMER BUFFETT AIDE | The Securities and Exchange Commission has ended its investigation of David L. Sokol, a onetime top lieutenant at Warren E. Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway, without filing insider trading charges, DealBook's Ben Protess reports. The decision not to pursue a civil enforcement action ends a chapter that began when Mr. Sokol resigned abruptly in 2011 as chairman of Berkshire's MidAmerican Energy Holdings. Mr. Sokol had bought shares of the lubricant maker Lubrizol about two months before Berkshire announced a $9 billion acquisition of the company, Berkshire revealed at the time. But after an investigation, "S.E.C. lawyers decided that there was insufficient evidence to mount a case against Mr. Sokol," Mr. Protess reports. "The evidence was circumstantial, S.E.C. officials concluded, and it was unclear whether Mr. Sokol had a true window into the Lubrizol deal-making process."
WEGELIN ADMITS TAX LAW VIOLATIONS | Wegelin & Company, Switzerland's oldest private bank, admitted on Thursday to helping Americans evade taxes, agreeing to pay $74 million in fines, restitution and forfeiture proceeds to the United States government. The admission was the first time a foreign financial institution has pleaded guilty to tax law violations, and it represents a victory for the Obama administration in its crackdown on tax evasion through offshore banks, DealBook's Peter Lattman reports.
Representatives for Wegelin acknowledged that for nearly a decade the firm helped wealthy Americans dodge taxes by hiding more than $1.2 billion in secret accounts. "From about 2002 through 2010, Wegelin agreed with certain U.S. taxpayers to evade the tax obligations of these U.S. taxpayer clients, who filed false tax returns with the I.R.S.," Otto Bruderer, a Wegelin partner, said in court. "Wegelin was aware the conduct was wrong." Mr. Bruderer said the bank believed it would not be prosecuted in the United States because it had no offices there, adding that the conduct was common practice in the Swiss banking industry. Another Wegelin partner, Konrad Hummler, also appeared at the hearing in Federal District Court in Manhattan.
ON THE AGENDA | Jobs numbers for December are out at 8:30 a.m. The ISM non-manufacturing index for December and data on factory orders in November are out at 10 a.m. 
POSSIBLE SUITORS FOR BAUSCH & LOMB | The eye care products maker Bausch & Lomb has attracted interest from suitors including Abbott Laboratories, Johnson & Johnson and Sanofi, Bloomberg News reports, citing unidentified people with knowledge of the matter. Warburg Pincus, the company's private equity owner, is said to be seeking more than $10 billion in a sale. Warburg, which is working with Goldman Sachs, is seeking first-round bids for Bausch & Lomb by the end of the month, according to Bloomberg. At $10 billion, a deal would give the private equity firm a gain of more than 200 percent on its $1.7 billion equity investment, the news service says.

HEADLINE: Four Years Later, 28,000 More Jobs

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: It appears that the past four years had a net gain of just 28,000 jobs. Private-sector jobs were up, but government employment was down. 

 BODY:
For jobs, the past four years have been a wash.
The December jobs figures out today indicate that there were 725,000 more jobs in the private sector than at the end of 2008 - and 697,000 fewer government jobs. That works into a private-sector gain of 0.6 percent, and a government sector decline of 3.1 percent. 
In total, the number of people with jobs is up by 28,000, or 0.02 percent.
How does that compare? It is by far the largest four-year decline in government employment since the 1944-48 term. That decline was caused by the end of World War II; this one was caused largely by budget limitations. The only other post-1948 four-year drop was during Ronald Reagan's first term, when government employment fell 0.6 percent. 
Going back to Dwight Eisenhower, there have been only two administrations that turned in a worse performance in private-sector job growth. There were small declines in Eisenhower's first term and in George W. Bush's first term. Mr. Bush's second term posted a scant 1.1 percent gain in private-sector employment - a gain that was wiped out during the first two months of 2009.
Over all, Mr. Obama's first four years narrowly - and preliminarily - escaped being the second four-year presidential term since World War II to suffer net job losses. The first was George W. Bush's first term.

A note on methodology. A month from now the Bureau of Labor Statistics will announce the final benchmark revision for the 12 months through March 2012. The preliminary estimate for that revision was that the economy gained 453,000 more private-sector jobs during the period than was previously reported, and lost 67,000 more government jobs. The calculations in this post incorporate those estimates.
The December figure will of course be revised for the next two months, and then will get a final revision in February 2014. Only then will it be clear whether the past four years had a net gain or loss in jobs.

HEADLINE: Czechmate

BYLINE: LUCIAN KIM


HIGHLIGHT: The wonders of a consumer economy have brought comfort to the Czech Republic but little happiness. 

 BODY:
DECIN, Czech Republic - When Vaclav Havel died a little more than a year ago, a Czech friend wrote to me that she feared for the future. For many Czechs, the former playwright and dissident remained a moral authority long after he had led the peaceful Velvet Revolution that brought down Czechoslovakia's Communist dictatorship in 1989. 
On a New Year holiday visit to Decin, a town of 52,000 in northern Bohemia, I'm struck by how gloomy the mood still is. 
Some 20 years ago, I got my first job after college teaching English here: During my stay, Havel was the Czechs' first post-Communist president, and Czechoslovakia split into two separate countries. Many industries in northern Bohemia, including Decin's chocolate factory and forklift plant, have been forced to close since that time. The unemployment rate [pdf] in some districts in the area tops 15 percent. Ethnic tensions with the local Romani minority have flared amid poor economic prospects. And most young people with ambition have turned their backs on the region.
A sort of collective midlife crisis is gripping Czechs who were in their teens and 20s during the Velvet Revolution. The lofty struggle for freedom has degenerated into the horse-trading and pork-barreling of parliamentary democracy. The wonders of a consumer economy have brought comfort and convenience but little happiness.
Former students from the secondary school where I taught now live in Prague, London, New York, Australia or Bali. It's not unusual for locals to spend weeks away from their families working in Germany or the Netherlands.
My friends who stayed behind are disillusioned with the state of Czech politics, which has been marred by corruption scandals and backroom deals. Jan Fischer, the front-runner in this month's presidential election, is likely to become the Czech Republic's first head of state with a Communist past. Vaclav Klaus, Havel's pugnacious successor and an acolyte of Milton Friedman, steps down in March.
Meeting with old friends over beer and dumplings, I try to remind them how far the Czech Republic has come since I lived here. Twenty years ago, Decin was located in one of the most polluted regions of Europe. Power plants fueled by low-grade brown coal spewed out a soupy smog that enveloped the town in the winter, and the tap water had a metallic taste. The idea that the Czech Republic would one day join the rich European Union seemed like an unattainable dream. 
Today, the country takes its membership in the E.U. and NATO for granted. New technologies have helped improve the environmental situation in northern Bohemia dramatically.
As a result, not everybody is giving up hope on Decin. Honza, one of my best former students, recently moved back after years living on the Cayman Islands. Next week he's opening a travel agency that will not only send Czech adventurers abroad but seek to attract foreign visitors.
Just about halfway between the tourist hubs of Dresden and Prague, Decin is nestled in the Elbe River Valley, a picturesque landscape of unique sandstone formations. The town boasts architectural monuments spanning five centuries; the castle overlooking Decin has been meticulously restored since the Soviet Army left it behind as a ruin in 1991.
Decin is located in what was once the disputed Sudetenland that gave Hitler a pretext to march into Czechoslovakia. Today, thanks to European integration, the Czech border to Germany has all but vanished.
After facing the dangers of Nazism and communism for nearly a century, now Czechs just need to come to grips with postindustrial capitalism.

HEADLINE: Factories Are Firing Up, Except in Europe

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
THE slowdown in worldwide manufacturing that began in mid-2012 may be nearing an end.
Surveys of manufacturing companies around the world indicated that in December nearly as many companies reported that orders were rising as said that orders were continuing to decline. 
The gains were concentrated in developing countries; China reported its best month in nearly two years.
But much of the euro zone remained weak. France reported its worst monthly figure since early 2009, when the credit crisis was at its worst.
The figures are based on monthly surveys of manufacturers begun in the United States by the Institute for Supply Management and later imitated in more than a dozen countries by Markit, a British firm. Companies are asked whether business is better than in the previous month, both over all and by several measurements. The accompanying charts focus on whether companies say the volume of new orders coming in is improving or getting worse.
The I.S.M. numbers use 50 as a neutral point. Any number above that indicates that more companies are reporting good news than are reporting that things are getting worse. In the charts, the numbers are adjusted so that such a neutral reading is shown as zero, with higher figures showing an ever greater proportion of companies reporting good news.
The global figure, compiled by J. P. Morgan based on all the surveys, remained in negative territory in December, but it came closer to breaking even than it had in any month since May.
In the United States, according to the Institute for Supply Management survey, a plurality of companies reported declining orders for three months through September, but since then the figures have been positive, although by very narrow margins in November and December. Export orders appeared to be stronger in December than domestic orders, perhaps indicating some caution from domestic buyers as the so-called fiscal cliff deadline approached.
The weakness in the euro zone has lasted more than a year, but for most of that period it was the peripheral countries that were holding down the reports. In December, though, both Germany and France, the two largest economies in the currency union, had worse order reports than the zone as a whole, something that had happened only once before since the end of 2007.
For much of this year, most of the major developing country exporters were reporting declining levels of new orders. But China and Brazil have shown positive margins for three months as the year ended, and South Korea had a narrowly positive number in December, its first in seven months.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: Signs of Life in World's Factories: Manufacturers around the world reported strong gains in new orders for much of 2011, but those gains slowed in 2012 and by autumn many were saying that orders were shrinking. Orders improved late in the year in some countries, although not in most euro zone countries. In the charts, positive numbers indicate that more companies reported rising orders than reported falling ones during the month shown, with higher numbers indicating an increasing number of positive responses.

HEADLINE: On the Trail of a Counterfeiter Called 'The Printer'

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- Making fake money remains a thriving enterprise in the United States, as it has been since before the Civil War.
A few counterfeit artists still engrave metal plates and search for soft paper that approximates the government's proprietary blend. Others soak money in a chemical soup, rubbing off ink to create $100 bills out of fives.
But in more than two-thirds of all cases, criminals manipulate scanners, printers and toner ink to create money where once there was none.
Heath J. Kellogg, 36, whom the United States attorney's office here described as a self-taught graphic artist, is in the latter category. 
Until federal agents arrested him in an Atlanta suburb in November, he was what people in his criminal circle called ''the printer'' -- a man suspected of pumping more than $1.1 million in fake $50 bills into the Southern economy.
As counterfeiting cases go, Mr. Kellogg's is not a record-breaker. (Neither was one last year in which a 26-year-old Atlanta man used solvents and a printer to turn $5 bills into $100 bills, making $1.2 million in fake money.)
Still, a counterfeiting ring in which one man prints more than $1 million in fake money is no small deal. And catching Mr. Kellogg required a few lucky breaks for law enforcers, months of old-fashioned detective work and an ill-fated decision not to bail someone out.
''His bills were pretty good,'' said Malcolm D. Wiley, an agent in the Atlanta Secret Service field office, who added that it was unusual to see fake 50s. A 20 is the most commonly counterfeited bill, followed by the $100 bill.
In addition to computer equipment and bits of partly burned money found at Mr. Kellogg's home, agents found a newly purchased offset press in Mr. Kellogg's storage unit, according to documents in the case.
''They had a lot of confidence and thought they could do even better,'' Mr. Wiley said of Mr. Kellogg and the five other people who have been charged with conspiracy to counterfeit currency.
If you handle money regularly, it is likely that you have passed at least one fake bill, according to the Secret Service, which was created in 1865 to stop rampant counterfeiting.
Advances in technology have allowed more people to make somewhat passable fakes, Mr. Wiley said. Those in the business range from high school students to gang members with prison records.
Nationally, the Secret Service seized nearly $81 million in fake money and arrested 2,424 people in the fiscal year that ended in October. Bills come in from other countries -- Peru is a particularly big contributor -- or from local criminals who shift to counterfeiting as an alternative to the drug trade.
Eventually, after it has been discovered by bank tellers, automated teller machine scanning equipment or astute citizens who have taken the time to learn how to identify fake bills, much of the counterfeit money makes its way to the Secret Service.
Georgia, with its busy airport and postal distribution center, is better known for stolen Social Security and tax refund checks than for counterfeiting, but the state ranks third in that crime category. In 2011, a federal task force was formed to attack the problem. One of its biggest victories came last month when a postal supervisor pleaded guilty to stealing United States Treasury checks worth more than $3 million.
But the case of Mr. Kellogg was one of the South's bigger ones, and cracking it took months.
The first break came in May 2011, when an Atlanta-area bank sent the Secret Service several counterfeit bills that could be identified by missing numbers and other flaws.
Then, said Alana R. Black, the assistant United States attorney who is prosecuting the case, matching bills showed up in the summer of 2012 when the police in Conyers, Ga., arrested someone trying to pass 10 of Mr. Kellogg's fake $50 bills at a local business.
The person, who had a history of forgery convictions, became a confidential informer, telling investigators that $250 in legitimate money would buy $1,000 in fake bills.
The informer was also angry that Stacy P. Smith, 37, who was one of the six men who would later be charged in the counterfeiting conspiracy, did not provide bail as he had done after similar arrests. Names, cellphone numbers and physical descriptions of the suspected players in the ring poured forth.
In North Carolina and around the nation, more of the same fake bills showed up. Forensic analysis tied those bills to the Atlanta case. Another person who had been arrested with counterfeit bills that agents connected to Mr. Kellogg then decided to help out. Conversations were monitored and cellphone records were obtained. The Secret Service arranged several ''buy throughs,'' watching as informers paid $900 for $2,000 in fake cash.
Agents traced toner purchases back to Mr. Kellogg, and arrested a small group of men at a home improvement store in Woodstock, Ga. There, they were using fake bills that agents believed came from Mr. Kellogg's workshop to buy things like alarm systems and then returning them for real money.
Natasha Perdew Silas, a federal public defender and Mr. Kellogg's lawyer, declined to comment. Like the others arrested, Mr. Kellogg has pleaded not guilty.
His father, James C. Kellogg, 63, was also charged, but his lawyer, William H. Thomas Jr., said the elder man's link to the case is tenuous. Prosecutors say the counterfeiting was a family enterprise, with father helping son glue bills together. Cans of spray glue found at the elder Mr. Kellogg's house support the conspiracy charge, they said.
But Mr. Thomas said that the elder Mr. Kellogg cuts lawns for a living, is ill and did not know of his son's dealings.
''Our investigation is going to show his son would come by and utilize the facilities,'' he said.
The younger Mr. Kellogg has a history of arrests and convictions for passing bad checks, theft, forgery and escape that goes back to 1994 in Georgia. Since leaving prison, he opened a graphic and Web design company called Realseriousink, whose address is also his father's home in Marietta, Ga.
To make his bills, Mr. Kellogg first ran paper through a printer and tinted it yellow, investigators said. He then printed the front of a bill on one sheet. On another, he printed the other side of the bill, flipped the paper over and printed a watermark on the back.
He then approximated the security threads embedded in legitimate bills by using pens with colored inks that would show up under ultraviolet lamps. He would then glue the two sheets together and have a passable bill.
But he could never quite get the paper right, and that is the first key to identifying a fake bill, Mr. Wiley said. Fake bills often feel slick, he said. He encourages people to read ''Know Your Money,'' a tutorial on detecting counterfeit currency by the Secret Service and the Treasury Department.
For his part, Mr. Wiley said he always checks his bills before he leaves a store or a bank. If you accidentally hand over a fake bill, tellers and clerks are required by law to confiscate it.
''It will not be replaced,'' he said. ''You're pretty much stuck.''

HEADLINE: Job Creation Is Still Steady Despite Worry

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Despite concerns about looming tax increases and government spending cuts, American employers added 155,000 jobs in December. Employees also enjoyed slightly faster wage growth and worked longer hours, which could bode well for future hiring.
The job growth, almost exactly equal to the average monthly growth in the last two years, was enough to keep the unemployment rate steady at 7.8 percent, the Labor Department reported on Friday. But it was not enough to reduce the backlog of 12.2 million jobless workers, underscoring the challenge facing Washington politicians as they continue to wrestle over how to address the budget deficit.
''Job creation might firm a little bit, but it's still looking nothing like the typical recovery year we've had in deep recessions in the past,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at RDQ Economics. ''There's nothing in the deal to do that,'' he said, referring to Congress's Jan. 1 compromise on taxes, ''and nothing in this latest jobs report to suggest that. We're a long way short of the 300,000 job growth that we need.'' 
If anything, the most visible debt-related options that policy makers are discussing could slow down economic and job growth, which, at its existing pace, would take seven years to reduce the unemployment rate to its prerecession level. The $110 billion in across-the-board federal spending cuts scheduled for March 1, for example, might provoke layoffs by local governments, military contractors and other companies that depend on federal funds.
A showdown over the debt ceiling expected in late February could also damage business confidence, as it did the last time Congress nearly allowed a default on the nation's debts in August 2011.
''We may be seeing the calm before the storm right now,'' said Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomic Advisors, noting that a recent survey from the National Federation of Independent Business found that alarmingly few small companies planned to hire in the coming months. ''Small businesses are wringing their hands in horror at what's going on in Washington.''
A best case for the economy, many analysts say, would involve a swift and civil Congressional agreement that raised the debt ceiling immediately. It would also address the country's long-term debt challenges, like Medicare costs, without sudden or draconian fiscal tightening this year.
Given the uncertainty over what Congress will do, estimates of the unemployment rate's path this year vary wildly. The more optimistic forecasts for the end of 2013 predict that unemployment will fall to just above 7 percent, which would be considerably below its most recent peak of 10 percent in October 2009, but still higher than its prerecession level of 5 percent.
The job gains in December were driven by hiring in health care, food services, construction and manufacturing. The last two industries were probably helped by rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy.
Aside from the wild card of what happens in Washington, some encouraging trends in the economy -- including the housing recovery, looser credit for small businesses, a rebound in China and pent-up demand for new automobiles -- suggest that businesses have good reason to speed up hiring.
Congress's last-minute deal to raise taxes this week will offset some of these sources of growth, since higher taxes trim how much money consumers have available each month.
President Obama's proposals to spend more money on infrastructure projects and other measures intended to spur hiring are fiercely opposed by Republican deficit hawks. The fiscal compromise reached this week did include one modest form of stimulus, though: a one-year renewal of the federal government's emergency unemployment benefits program. That program allows workers to continue receiving benefits for up to 73 weeks, depending on the unemployment rate in the state where they live, and stimulates economic activity because unemployment benefits are spent almost immediately.
The extension was a tremendous relief to the two million workers who would otherwise have lost their benefits this week.
''We woke up on Wednesday morning and saw the news and just said, 'Thank God, thank God, thank God,' and then went out and went food shopping because we knew we had money coming in,'' said Gina Shadis, 56, of Newton, N.J.
Both she and her husband, Stephen, were laid off within the last 14 months from jobs they had held for more than a decade: she from a quality assurance manager position at an environmental testing lab, and he as foreman and senior master technician at an auto dealership. They are each receiving $548 a week in federal jobless benefits, or about a quarter of their pay at their most recent jobs.
''It has just been such a traumatic time,'' Ms. Shadis said. ''You wake up in the morning with shoulders tense and head aching because you didn't sleep the night before from worrying.''
More than six million workers have exhausted their unemployment benefits since the recession began in December 2007, according to the National Employment Law Project, a labor advocacy group.
Millions of workers are sitting on the sidelines and so are not counted in the tally of unemployed. Some are merely waiting for the job market to improve, and others are trying to invest in new skills to appeal to employers who are already hiring.
''I have a few prospects who say they want me to work for them when I graduate,'' said Jordan Douglas, a 24-year-old single mother in Pampa, Tex., who is enrolled in a special program that allows her to receive jobless benefits while attending school full time to become a registered nurse. She receives $792 in benefits every two weeks, a little less than half of what she earned in an administrative position at the nursing home that laid her off last year.
Ms. Douglas calculates that her federal jobless benefits will run out the very last week of nursing school.
''This had to have been a sign from God that I had to do this, since it all worked out so well,'' she said.

HEADLINE: S.&P. Reaches 5-Year High After Jobs Report

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed at its highest level in five years on Friday after a report showed that hiring held up in December, giving stocks an early lift.
The index finished up 7.10 points, at 1,466.47, its highest close since December 2007.
The S.& P. 500 began its descent from a record close of 1,565.15 in October 2007, as the early signs of the financial crisis began to emerge. The index bottomed out at 676.53 in March 2009 before staging a recovery during which it has doubled in value and moved within 99 points of its peak. 
Despite a halting recovery in the United States economy, the index has climbed steadily as the Federal Reserve has provided huge support to the financial system, buying hundreds of billions of dollars of bonds and holding benchmark interest rates near zero. Last month, the Fed said it would keep rates low until the unemployment rate improved significantly.
''Without the Federal Reserve doing what they did for the last few years, there would be no way you'd be near any of these levels in the index,'' said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of equity trading at Themis Trading. ''I would call this the Fed-levitating market.''
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 43.85 points, to 13,435.21. It gained 3.8 percent for the week, its biggest weekly advance since June. The Nasdaq closed at 3,101.66, up 1.09 points.
Stocks surged this week after Congress passed a bill to avoid a combination of government spending cuts and tax increases that had come to be known as the fiscal cliff. The law, passed late Tuesday, averted that outcome, which could have pushed the economy back into recession.
The Labor Department said on Friday that employers added 155,000 jobs in December, showing that hiring held up during the tense fiscal negotiations in Washington. It also said hiring was stronger in November than first thought. The unemployment rate was steady at 7.8 percent.
The report did not give stocks more of a boost because the number of jobs created matched analysts' forecasts, said J. J. Kinahan, chief derivatives strategist for TD Ameritrade.
''The jobs report couldn't have been more in line,'' Mr. Kinahan said. ''The market had more to lose than to gain from it.''
Among stocks making big moves, Eli Lilly & Company shares jumped $1.84, or 3.7 percent, to $51.56 after the company said its earnings would beat Wall Street forecasts, even though it will lose United States patent protection for two more product types this year.
Stock in Walgreen, the nation's largest drugstore chain, fell 61 cents, or 1.6 percent, to $37.18 after the company said that a measure of revenue fell more than analysts had expected in December, even as prescription counts continued to recover.
Share prices may also be benefiting as investors adjust their portfolios to favor stocks over bonds, Mr. Kinahan said. A multiyear rally in bonds has pushed up prices for the securities and reduced the yields that they offer, in many cases to levels below company dividends.
Goldman Sachs reaffirmed its view that stocks ''can be an attractive source of income,'' and warned that there was a risk that bonds might fall. In a note to clients, the bank said that an index of AAA-rated corporate bonds offered a yield of just 1.6 percent, less than the S.& P. 500's dividend yield of 2.1 percent.
The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 1/32, to 97 17/32, and the yield fell to 1.90 percent, from 1.91 percent late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Infusion of $160 Million Gives Mets a Chance to Spend, Perhaps on Talent

BYLINE: By RICHARD SANDOMIR

 BODY:
The Mets' owners, who were financially hobbled by Bernard L. Madoff's immense fraud scheme, now have about $160 million in new money to spend.
The cash infusion, as refreshing to the co-owners Fred Wilpon and Saul Katz as a World Series-ending home run, comes thanks to their majority ownership of the SNY regional sports network. One benefit of owning a network like SNY is the ability to borrow money against it. SNY's annual revenue is in the hundreds of millions of dollars because of monthly subscriber fees that keep increasing regardless of team performance.
The resulting stability and financial muscularity of SNY and similar networks make them low risks to banks. Late last month, SNY refinanced $450 million in existing bank loans at lower interest rates and borrowed at least $250 million more. With their 65 percent ownership of SNY, Wilpon and Katz should have walked away with about $162.5 million. The refinancing was first reported Friday by Bloomberg. 
So what will the Mets, so restrained about spending on talent the last few years, do with this extra money?
They could repay the still-substantial bank debt on the team, sock away money in anticipation of future financial losses or use it for working capital.
Or, perhaps, they could even dabble in a free-agent market they have studiously avoided this off-season, emerging as the only team not to acquire a single major league free agent since the World Series ended.
In particular, the Mets need legitimate outfielders -- even part-time ones -- who could bolster what now stands as an unimpressive starting threesome of Lucas Duda, Mike Baxter and Kirk Nieuwenhuis, all left-handed hitters. Two recent pickups -- Collin Cowgill and Andrew Brown -- hit right-handed and can add some balance to the current outfield options, but both are fringe major leaguers who might not help much at all.
The best free-agent outfielder still available, by far, is Michael Bourn, the 30-year-old, left-handed-hitting center fielder who hit .274 for the Atlanta Braves last season with 42 stolen bases. But Bourn is looking for big money, perhaps as much as $100 million in a multiyear deal, and is represented by the uncompromising Scott Boras, so rule the Mets out.
Then again, Vince Gennaro, a consultant to several major league teams, suggested the Mets should at least think about Bourn, particularly if he remains unsigned as spring training draws closer and his price drops.
''They should give serious consideration to investing in the near-term competitiveness of the team,'' Gennaro said of the Mets' owners.
He added: ''The Mets have two issues. One, the prospects for the team, and two, perceptions about the owners' commitment to winning. They could make a dent in both of those issues by parting with some of this money.''
A more realistic option for the Mets would be to re-sign Scott Hairston, the right-handed-hitting outfielder who slugged 20 home runs for them last season in a platoon role. Hairston was a bargain for the Mets in 2012, making just $1.1 million, and it is believed he is now seeking a two-year deal worth upward of $8 million. That's not a huge amount of money by major league standards, but it certainly seems to be for the Mets.
Because R. A. Dickey, the 2012 National League Cy Young Award winner, has departed for Toronto, the Mets also need to add some depth to a starting rotation that has talent in Johan Santana, Jon Niese and the rookie Matt Harvey.
The most inexpensive move might be to re-sign Chris Young, the 33-year-old, 6-foot-10-inch right-hander who went 4-9 for the Mets last season with a 4.15 earned run average in his latest comeback from an arm injury.
More enticing options would be two remaining free agents -- Kyle Lohse and Joe Saunders -- but they, of course, would cost more money.
For now, the Mets have made one significant off-season financial move -- signing David Wright to an eight-year, $138-million extension. The refinancing is perhaps equally important, bringing new money to a club that lost $70 million in 2011 and $51 million in 2010. The Mets have not said how much they lost in 2012.

HEADLINE: After Fiscal Deal, Tax Code May Be the Most Progressive Since 1979

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- With 2013 bringing tax increases on the incomes of a small sliver of the richest Americans, the country's top earners now face a heavier tax burden than at any time since Jimmy Carter was president.
The last-minute deal struck by the departing 112th Congress raised taxes on a handful of the highest-earning Americans, with about 99.3 percent of households experiencing no change in their income taxes. But the Tax Policy Center estimates that the average family in the top 1 percent will pay a federal tax rate of more than 36 percent this year, up from 28 percent in 2008. That is the highest rate since 1979, at least. 
By some measures, the tax code might now be the most progressive in a generation, tax economists said, while noting that every American is paying a lower burden currently than they did then. In fact, the total federal tax rate is still vastly lower for the very rich than it was at any point in the 1940s through 1970s. It has risen from historical lows, but is still closer to those lows than where it was in the postwar decades.
''We made the system more progressive by raising rates at the top and leaving them for everyone else,'' said Roberton Williams of the Tax Policy Center, a research group based in Washington. ''The offsetting issue is that the rich have gotten a lot richer.''
Indeed, over the last three decades the bulk of pretax income gains have gone to the wealthy -- and the higher up on the income scale, the bigger the gains, with billionaires outpacing millionaires who outpaced the merely rich. Economists doubted that the tax increases would do much to reverse that trend.
With the recovery failing to improve incomes for millions of average Americans and the country running trillion-dollar deficits, President Obama made ''tax fairness'' a centerpiece of his re-election campaign. In the heated negotiations with House Speaker John A. Boehner, that translated into the White House's insistence on tax increases for the top 2 percent of households and a continuation of tax breaks and cuts for a vast number of taxpayers.
Republicans resisted increasing tax rates and aimed for lower revenue targets, arguing that spending was the budget's primary problem and that no American should see his or her taxes go up too much in such a sluggish economy. But ultimately they relented, and Congress cut a last-minute deal.
''A central promise of my campaign for president was to change the tax code that was too skewed towards the wealthy at the expense of working middle-class Americans,'' Mr. Obama said after Congress reached an agreement.
That deal includes a host of tax increases on the rich. It raises the tax rate to 39.6 percent from 35 percent on income above $400,000 for individuals, and $450,000 for couples. The rate on dividends and capital gains for those same taxpayers was bumped up 5 percentage points, to 20 percent. Congress also reinstated limits on the amount households with more than $300,000 in income can deduct. On top of that, two new surcharges -- a 3.8 percent tax on investment income and a 0.9 percent tax on regular income -- hit those same wealthy households.
As a result of the taxes added in both the deal and the 2010 health care law, which came into effect this year, taxpayers with $1 million in income and up will pay on average $168,000 more in taxes. Millionaires' share of the overall federal tax burden will climb to 23 percent from 20 percent.
The result is a tax code that squeezes hundreds of billions of dollars more from the very well off -- about $600 billion more over 10 years -- while leaving the tax burden on everyone else mostly as it was. And the changes come after 30 years of both Republican and Democratic administrations doing the converse: zeroing out federal income taxes for many poor working families while also reducing the tax burden for households on the higher end of the income scale.
''Back at the end of the Carter and beginning of the Reagan administrations, we had a pretty severe income-tax burden for people at a low level of income. It was actually kind of appalling,'' said Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-of-center research group in Washington. ''Policy makers in both parties realized that was bad policy and started whittling away at it'' by expanding credits and tinkering with tax rates.
After those changes and the new law, comparing average tax rates for poor households and wealthy households, 2013 might be the most progressive tax code since 1979. But economists cautioned that measuring progressivity is tricky. ''It's not like there is some scientific measure of progressivity all economists agreed upon,'' said Leonard E. Burman, a professor of public affairs at Syracuse University. ''People look at different numerical measures and they've changed in different ways at different income levels.''
Mr. Viard said that over time the code had become markedly more progressive for the poor compared with the middle class. But it arguably did not become much more progressive for the rich compared with the middle class, or the very rich compared with the rich, in part because of the George W. Bush-era tax cuts on investment income.
An anesthesiologist who earns a $500,000 salary subject to payroll and income taxes might pay a higher tax rate than a hedge fund manager making $1 billion subject mostly to capital-gains taxes, for instance.
Economists are also divided on the ultimate effect of those tax increases on the wealthy to income growth and income inequality in the United States. The recession hit the incomes of the rich hard, but they have snapped back much more strongly than those for middle or low-income workers.
''I'd still rather be really rich, even if I'm getting taxed much more than a low-income person'' would be, Mr. Williams of the Tax Policy Center added.

HEADLINE: And at the Bottom of the Wage Scale...

 BODY:
Nearly a million low-wage workers in 10 states will get a modest raise this year. In Rhode Island, a new law has raised the state's minimum wage by 35 cents an hour, to $7.75, which will work out to an average annual raise of $510 for 11,000 Rhode Islanders. In nine other states -- Arizona, Colorado, Florida, Missouri, Montana, Ohio, Oregon, Vermont and Washington -- laws that peg the minimum wage to inflation will result in increases of 10 cents to 15 cents an hour, for hourly wages ranging from $7.35 in Missouri to $9.19 in Washington. 
By contrast, the federal minimum wage has been stuck at $7.25 an hour since 2009. In all, 19 states and the District of Columbia set their minimums above that level, providing a much needed lift for the lowest-paid workers. But state efforts are no substitute for a higher federal minimum because the ability to earn a minimally acceptable income should not depend on where a worker lives.
Will Congress finally raise the federal minimum wage this year? It would be the least that lawmakers could do. In the fiscal cliff deal, lawmakers locked in big tax breaks for wealthy investors and for heirs of multimillion-dollar estates. At the same time, they allowed the payroll tax cut for low- and middle-income taxpayers to expire, without enacting new provisions to ease the blow. The lowest-paid workers will be hit the hardest. In the states that raised their minimum wage this year, much of the increase will be eaten up by the higher payroll tax. In the other states, paychecks will simply be smaller.
Efforts to raise the minimum invariably run into arguments that employers, especially small businesses, cannot afford to pay a higher wage. But the evidence shows that most low-wage employees work for large companies, which have largely recovered from the recession and have reinstituted generous pay packages for executives. As for low-wage workers at small businesses, many are waitresses and other ''tipped'' workers for whom the federal minimum wage is $2.13 an hour, where it has been since 1991. Clearly, there is ample room for an increase.
A related argument is that a higher minimum wage destroys jobs, especially employment for teenagers. But research shows that most low-wage workers are over the age of 20 and suggests that paying them a higher wage could actually create jobs by bolstering consumer spending.
A higher minimum wage is also an obvious way to counter the accelerating trend toward low-wage work and growing income inequality. For decades, various forces, including the decline in unionization and the global competition for jobs, have pushed down wages in the United States. But the situation has become worse in the last few years, as most of the middle-wage jobs lost during the recession have been replaced with lower-paid work.
Raising the minimum wage is always a fight. Congress has approved legislation to do so only three times in the last 30 years. President Obama promised to take on this fight back in 2008, when he called for a federal minimum wage of $9.50 an hour by 2011, indexed to inflation. It is past time to keep the promise.

 BODY:
8 P.M. (HBO) THE THREE STOOGES (2012) Will Sasso stars as Curly, Sean Hayes is Larry, and Chris Diamantopoulos is Moe (pictured above, from left) in this fictionalized origin story for the mostly lovable fools, and paean to the art of the eye poke, from Peter and Bobby Farrelly. Divided into ''episodes,'' the tale follows the Stooges from infancy -- when they're tossed out of a speeding car at the feet of a nun, Sister Mary-Mengele (Larry David) -- to adulthood, when they're forced to try to save the orphanage in which they were reared from the faltering economy and other calamities. Jane Lynch plays the Mother Superior who sends them out into the world, where they meet a femme fatale (Sofia Vergara) and her lover (Craig Bierko); the handsome guy from the Old Spice commercials (Isaiah Mustafa); and some of the cast of ''Jersey Shore.'' ''The three leads in 'The Three Stooges' play dumb very well, particularly Mr. Sasso,'' Manohla Dargis wrote in The New York Times. She added: ''Much of the pleasure in 'The Three Stooges' comes from watching and hearing (the boings and thumps are terrific) grown men smack each other silly in Rube Goldberg-like formations and without suffering so much as a single black eye, enduring psychological damage or, as bad, being forced to change. Like Wile E. Coyote and those inflatable clowns that bounce back after every punch, the Three Stooges take plenty of hits but keep on coming. 
They are, as the Farrellys understand, testaments to human resilience, one slap and tickle at a time.''

Ms. Streep plays the title character with a perfectionism that ''has rarely seemed so apt,'' A. O.

Henson, Gabrielle Union, Michael Ealy Romany Malco and Kevin Hart (below, from left, Mr. Ealy, Mr. Hart, Gary Owen, Terrence J, Mr. Malco and Jerry Ferrara), portray types involved in the relationship war -- including the Mama's Boy, the Woman Who Acts Like a Man and the Happily Divorced Guy -- in this adaptation of ''Act Like a Lady, Think Like a Man,'' a book by the comedian Steve Harvey. ''So what does Steve say?,'' Rachel Saltz wrote in The Times. ''Mostly things you've heard before: Men need to be the providers (it's in their DNA); men don't like the words 'we need to talk,' etc. A running joke is that Mr. Harvey has thrown men under the bus by giving away their secrets. But, gents, if they were secrets they wouldn't be clichés.''
10 P.M. (Flix) LOST IN TRANSLATION (2003) An American movie star (Bill Murray) cashing in on his celebrity to make an ad in Japan meets a young woman (Scarlett Johansson, below with Mr. Murray) who has been temporarily deserted by her husband (Giovanni Ribisi) in this comic melodrama written and directed by Sofia Coppola. As they escape the confines of the Tokyo Hyatt, something like love ensues. Mr. Murray ''supplies the kind of performance that seems so fully realized and effortless that it can easily be mistaken for not acting at all,'' Elvis Mitchell wrote in The Times. ''The corollary of this is that Ms. Coppola's direction is so breezily assured in its awareness of loneliness that the film could potentially be dismissed as self-consciously moody rather than registering as a mood piece. But it's bound to be recognized as a movie worthy of the kind of Oscar attention occasionally given to films that challenge audiences subtly.'' Ms. Coppola won an Oscar for best original screenplay.
10 P.M. (Nat Geo Wild) CESAR MILLAN'S LEADER OF THE PACK In this new series Mr. Millan, a k a the Dog Whisperer, addresses canine abandonment around the world by giving seemingly unadoptable pups in Europe a second chance through rehabilitation at his Dog Psychology Center in Spain. He then works with families from Britain, Italy and the Netherlands, who will compete to adopt one of the dogs. KATHRYN SHATTUCK

HEADLINE: A New Era's Filmmakers Find Their Way in Cuba

BYLINE: By VICTORIA BURNETT

 BODY:
HAVANA -- Sebastián Miló barely had enough money to put gasoline in the aged bus that ferried his crew to the set each day, let alone to pay actors a salary.
But Mr. Miló, a 33-year-old Cuban filmmaker, had a Canon 5D digital camera and a story to tell. So, during one frenetic week in May 2011, he shot ''Truckdriver,'' a tense 25-minute film about bullying at one of the vaunted rural boarding schools where millions of Cubans used to spend part of their high school education.
''It was something I went through myself, and so did many people I know,'' said Mr. Miló, referring to incidents of bullying that dogged him at school and, later, during military service. ''The subject struck a chord.''
Mr. Miló is one of hundreds of Cuban filmmakers who, armed with digital technology, are laying the foundations of an independent movie industry outside the state apparatus that has defined Cuban cinema for much of the Castro era -- and still, much to the frustration of some filmmakers, controls access to the island's movie theaters. 
Around the country, Cubans are making features, shorts, documentaries and animated works, often with little more than a couple of friends and some inexpensive equipment -- and little input from the state-supported Cuban Institute of Cinematic Art and Industry.
Mr. Miló, who received about $10,000 in financing from a Spanish production company, Idunnu Music and Visual Arts, said that the crew and actors worked for next to nothing. ''They said they felt strongly about what the film was saying,'' he said.
The global boom in digital filmmaking has rippled across Cuba over the past decade, letting filmmakers create their work beyond the oversight of state-financed institutions. Independent movies have become a new means of expression in a country where, despite freedoms and economic reforms introduced by President Raul Castro since 2006, the state still carefully controls national press, television and radio, and access to the Internet is very limited.
While there is no official tally of independent movies, they have gained prominence on the national scene. They dominate the Cuban offerings at the International Festival of New Latin American Cinema in Havana and scored a new level of commercial visibility last year with ''Juan of the Dead,'' a zombie movie that was released in several countries, including the United States.
''They're bringing fresh ideas; they're experimenting,'' said Javier Ernesto Alejándrez, 21, a humanities student waiting in line last month to see the independent feature ''Pablo,'' shown as part of the film festival.
''There's a lot of creativity, and they are really thinking about stuff,'' said Alexandra Halkin, the director of the Americas Media Initiative, a nonprofit group that distributes and promotes Cuban film overseas. ''They just need more tools and more space.''
For decades, the film institute was an important tool of the government's program to educate Cubans and build a national narrative under the Communist system, annually producing dozens of documentaries and features and nurturing acclaimed directors, including Tomás Gutiérrez Alea (known as Titon), Humberto Solás and Fernando Pérez. The institute's financing plummeted after the Soviet Union collapsed, and it now relies on foreign sources to produce a handful of features each year.
The explosion of independent film has yielded an uneven jumble of movies that draw on genres eschewed by the establishment -- like thrillers and horror -- and that offer raw depictions or biting satire about the darker side of life on the island.
Miguel Coyula, whose surreal, fragmentary feature ''Memories of Overdevelopment'' was shown at the Sundance Film Festival in 2010, said that while no specific trend had emerged, there was a greater willingness to tackle riskier and risqué subjects -- even Fidel Castro -- and document issues not covered by the official press.
Some movies offer a glimmer of a promising new generation, experts and filmmakers say, citing the experimental documentaries of Marcel Beltrán and Armando Capó, which will be included in a program at the Museum of Modern Art in February; Victor Alfonso's humorous animated shorts about a high school nerd; Carlos Machado Quintela's feature-length movie ''The Swimming Pool,'' about a group of physically disabled children and their swimming instructor; and the work of more established practitioners like Mr. Coyula and Esteban Insausti, whose work has been screened at many foreign festivals, including Cannes.
Carlos Lechuga, 29, whose debut feature film, ''Melaza'' (''Molasses''), tells a story of social degradation in a sugar town whose mill has been shuttered, said that independent movies were nourishing a conversation among Cubans keen to see the hard realities of their lives dealt with on screen.
But even with the technology much more accessible, filmmakers must struggle to get their work seen. The film institute controls Cuba's theaters; Internet access remains rare, expensive and too slow for downloading movies. Instead, Cubans pass around DVDs.
Karel Ducasse, for example, has made about 500 copies of his 2007 documentary, ''Zone of Silence,'' which is about censorship, to sell and hand out at festivals. He believes the problems with distribution are no accident.
''The state has become afraid of digital media,'' he said. ''They know anything can be passed around the island.''
Aside from longing for better distribution, Cuban producers are anxious for regulations that would let them establish private production companies and seek permits without going through the film institute, whose bureaucracy eats into meager budgets.
Dozens of small production companies have sprouted in recent years, offering camera-rental services and help with permits and logistics, but they have no legal status.
''Look at what countries like Colombia have done in recent years to attract filmmaking,'' said Claudia Calviño of Producciones de la 5ta Avenida, which made ''Melaza'' in production with French and Panamanian financing. She was referring to a Colombian law that offers movie producers rebates of 20 to 40 percent of the cost of production services, catering, accommodation and transportation. ''Cuba must do this. We need laws, we need mechanisms.''
The institute has opened up to independent cinema, establishing an annual festival of work by filmmakers younger than 35, and supporting independent productions with props and permits. But the institute remains a bureaucratic leviathan that even its founder, Alfredo Guevara, considers obsolete.
''I designed the organization, but I say, 'It doesn't work anymore,' '' said Mr. Guevara, who left the institute 12 years ago and is president of the Havana film festival. Mr. Guevara said he believed the institute should stop producing films and be limited to, say, renting out sets and distributing movies.
There are also limits to the institute's openness: after helping with production permits and other logistics for ''Melaza,'' institute officials -- apparently nervous about the film's critical tone -- demanded that its name be removed from the credits, according to three people involved in the production who spoke on condition of anonymity because they wished to preserve good relations with the institute. Officials at the institute could not be reached for comment.
Mr. Guevara said that he believed that the state would slowly adapt to the reality of an independent industry, and that Cuban cinema could one day recover the luster of movies like Mr. Gutiérrez Alea's ''Memories of Underdevelopment'' (Mr. Coyula's film is a sequel) or the later ''Strawberry and Chocolate,'' and Mr. Solás's ''Lucia.''
''A new generation will emerge,'' he said. ''There may not be another Titon, another Humberto Solas. But there will be someone, I am sure.''

HEADLINE: An Invitation for High School Seniors to Write About Finances

BYLINE: By RON LIEBER. 
Twitter: @ronlieber

 BODY:
At the University of Michigan, one application essay talked about how local education cutbacks forced high school students to pay money to play team sports. As a result, the writer could no longer afford to play.
At Pitzer College, a student used the example of the Ponzi schemer Bernard L. Madoff to take a philosophical look at how much money people truly need to be happy.
As the economy has suffered in recent years and college costs have risen, high school seniors have grappled with the fallout in their own families and channeled their feelings into an increasing number of memorable college application essays about sacrifice, social policy and affluence or its opposite.
''Students never used to write about this stuff,'' said Angel Pérez, vice president and dean of admission and financial aid at Pitzer, which is in Claremont, Calif. ''I think there is this new consciousness. It's unlike anything I've ever seen.'' 
Given the Your Money team's long-standing endorsement of raising the financial consciousness of the younger set, we wanted to see these writings for ourselves. So we're asking high school seniors who are applying for college this year to send us application essays that have anything at all to do with money, working, class, the economy and affluence (or lack thereof).
We'll read them all and publish the best on our Bucks personal finance blog.
There is more on our editorial criteria and the logistics down below, but if you're trying to figure out what counts as a money essay, think broadly, as many applicants have in recent years. ''An essay ought to try to fill in the gaps, to tell us things that we don't know about you,'' said Erica Sanders, managing director of the office of undergraduate admissions at the University of Michigan.
Your guidance counselor and teachers who are writing letters of support for your application may not know about or think to write about your family's financial status, good or bad. ''Maybe a parent had to move out of town for work, and the student writes about taking on more responsibility, that it allowed them to take on more leadership and to contribute to their family in a way that they didn't even know was possible,'' she added, echoing essays she's read in recent years.
Even if your family has not struggled or become fabulously wealthy, an essay about your part-time job certainly qualifies. ''Many of our engineering students will talk about building something and the costs of putting it together,'' Ms. Sanders said.
Aside from the Madoff essay, Mr. Perez has read other Pitzer applicant essays and had other conversations with applicants about money and the economy in recent years that have stuck with him.
''One student last year was very affected by the whole conversation about the 1 percent,'' he said. ''He sent us his proposal for the tax code. The committee thought that this is someone who is clearly thinking about this in a critical way, is informed about what is going on the world and has done some dissecting of the information, and that's the kind of student we're looking for.''
The college essay is always a bit of a high-wire act. Harry Bauld, the author of ''On Writing the College Application Essay,'' which I credit with helping me get into college, paints a visceral, frightening picture of haggard admissions officers reading dozens of essays each day. Then, he asks readers to imagine that their application is 38th in the pile. How are you going to excite that person?
Writing about money can offer a bit of voyeuristic thrill in this regard, but it also poses its own particular challenges. ''Most of my students are absolutely brilliant,'' said Mr. Bauld, a high school English teacher at Horace Mann School in New York City and a former admissions officer at Columbia and Brown. ''But they cannot see their own relationship to economic culture. It's not comprehensible.''
The more affluent ones, if they do understand it, struggle further when trying to put it into words. ''When it becomes visible, it comes accompanied with a U-Haul full of guilt that they're towing behind them,'' he said. ''Then, it forces them into various clichés.''
But it need not always. Mr. Perez said Pitzer was quick to admit a student who talked about her travels around the world on her father's yacht, anchoring in various high-end ports. ''It bothered her that her family was never willing to leave the comfort zone, to go to real places,'' he said. ''To me, that young woman was absolutely memorable, and it took a lot of courage for her to do that.''
As we read the essays, which you should send to us by April 1 at Moneyessays@nytimes.com, we'll be looking for that kind of authenticity. We also seek a unique point of view. Not so much ''Why it's good to give'' or ''What I learned from my job'' but ''How I gave in an entirely new way'' or ''How I made money doing something no one else around me had ever thought to do.''
Perspective on current events certainly helps, if it goes beyond the boilerplate. Were you able to take broad economic themes and make them relevant to you, your family or your community?
Also, do you have awareness of value -- of what an education is (or is not) worth and what sort of student loan debt you may be willing to take on to get it? Have you thought through how you measure the success of the services a nonprofit organization delivers -- or the ones you deliver in your part-time job for money?
Finally, and most important, what do we learn about you personally? ''What's particular and distinctive about this essay?'' said Jeffrey Brenzel, Yale's dean of undergraduate admissions, in describing what he and his colleagues seek. ''An honest reflection on an experience that actually mattered to you, where you do your best to express what you've learned from it, is going to serve you best, period, end of story.''
Mr. Bauld, the author and Horace Mann teacher who will be helping us evaluate the submissions, said that this sort of advice was true for current or future application writers, whether you're writing about money or polar bears. The big idea is to make yourself, through the writing of the essay, into a more interesting person than you were when you began.
''It doesn't have to be flashy or have a lot of pizazz,'' he said. ''It just has to be real. You can tell them a mile away, and it's such a pleasure and revelation when you read one.''

HEADLINE: Auto Racetrack Owners Keep Coveted Tax Break

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR and MARY PILON; Robert Pear reported from Washington, and Mary Pilon from New York. Viv Bernstein contributed reporting from Charlotte, N.C.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the rush to pass tax legislation, owners of auto racetracks scored a victory this week even as many other industries were left behind.
With the help of devoted Nascar fans in Congress and lobbyists in Washington, track owners secured a one-year extension of an expiring tax break that allows them to write off investments in their property over 7 years, rather than the more typical 15 years.
That break for speed racing and similar benefits granted to select businesses in the new tax deal will cost the Treasury tens of millions of dollars over the next decade, at the same time the government struggles with its growing debt. 
''This allows us to compete with football, baseball and basketball, whose facilities are often financed with state and local tax money,'' said Daniel W. Houser, senior vice president and chief financial officer of the International Speedway Corporation of Daytona Beach, Fla., which owns and operates 13 auto racetracks. He said the tax provision would allow the company to carry out a ''a robust capital spending plan.''
Mr. Houser described the tax break as a form of economic stimulus. ''We have shovel-ready projects that are ready to put people to work,'' he said.
Preservation of such tax breaks came as lawmakers said they were scouring the budget and the tax code for every dollar that could be saved. After four years of trillion-dollar deficits, federal debt is bumping up against the legal limit of $16.4 trillion.
The tax break for ''motorsports entertainment complexes,'' a part of the tax bill signed Wednesday by President Obama, is estimated to cost $78 million over 10 years. It would cost more if it were extended again or made permanent, as the industry wants. By contrast, Congress sliced billions of dollars from hospitals and other health care providers.
A few years ago, enthusiasm for motor sports soared, but in recent years Nascar and others like the IndyCar Series have struggled. The recession crimped the wallets of Nascar's typically middle-aged, working-class fan base.
The auto racetrack provision was one of many business tax breaks extended by Congress. Others continue tax incentives for film and television productions and for railroad track maintenance. Senator Tom Coburn, Republican of Oklahoma, included the auto racetrack provision in a long list of ''special interest giveaways.''
But supporters said it was justified, even at a time of big budget deficits. ''This tax provision is a job creator,'' said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and co-chairman of the Congressional Motorsports Caucus.
Nascar, based in Daytona Beach and controlled by the France family, has an influential voice in Washington. Its employees made $347,400 in campaign contributions in the 2012 cycle, according to OpenSecrets.org, a site that tracks campaign donations.
Marcus Jadotte, a vice president of Nascar, said that while his company did not represent racetracks directly affected by the legislation, ''we support the efforts of Congress to preserve the same tax treatment that motorsports facilities have been operating under for decades.''
International Speedway, the Nascar sister company that owns and operates racetracks, derives 90 percent of its revenue from Nascar events.
Mr. Houser said the tax break could also benefit hundreds of racetracks owned by other companies like Speedway Motorsports and the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Nascar and International Speedway are members of the National Motorsports Coalition, which lobbied for the tax break in meetings with lawmakers.
Wayne Allard, a Republican former senator from Colorado who is now vice president for government relations at the American Motorcyclist Association, a member of the coalition, said that membership and interest in the association had waned, with the group now running about 3,000 events a year, down from 4,000. The tax break, besides encouraging physical improvements at tracks and creating jobs, could help ''prop up our membership,'' he said.
Among those who lobbied for the tax break was John F. Kelly Jr. of Cornerstone Government Affairs, a Capitol Hill firm that represents International Speedway. Mr. Kelly was a tax policy adviser at the Treasury Department under President George W. Bush and then director of federal relations for Walmart.
With passage of the tax bill, Mr. Kelly and his firm also won a victory for another client, Beam Inc., whose Cruzan rum is distilled in the United States Virgin Islands. The new law continues an arrangement under which federal excise taxes on imported rum are shared with Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The territories have used the money to promote and assist the rum industry and to finance economic development projects.
The tax break in the new federal law closely resembles the language of racetrack tax bills introduced by Senator Debbie Stabenow, Democrat of Michigan, home to the auto industry and the Michigan International Speedway; Representative Vern Buchanan, Republican of Florida, home of the Daytona International Speedway; and Dean Heller, a Republican senator and former representative from Nevada, home of the Las Vegas Motor Speedway.
Among the co-sponsors, or chief backers, were Senator Pat Roberts, Republican of Kansas, home of the Kansas Speedway, and the senators from North Carolina, home base for many race teams and the Nascar industry -- Richard M. Burr, a Republican, and Kay Hagan, a Democrat.
Also supporting the legislation was Senator Jon Kyl, Republican of Arizona, whose love for the sport earned him the nickname Mr. Nascar. Mr. Kyl, who just retired from Congress, used to volunteer at the Phoenix International Raceway.
Ms. Stabenow's Web site includes pictures of her at a Nascar race at the Michigan track in August.
But Cullen Schwarz, a spokesman for Ms. Stabenow, said of the tax break: ''This is not a special deal for Nascar. It's for racetrack companies. It keeps them on a seven-year depreciation schedule, the same as other entertainment venues with major capital expenditures like amusement parks.''
Nascar, the National Association for Stock Car Auto Racing, was founded by Bill France Sr. in December 1947, and the family continues to own and operate the business today. His son, Bill Jr., was head of Nascar until 2000, and currently, Bill France Sr.'s grandson, Brian France, is Nascar's chairman and chief executive. Brian's sister, Lesa France Kennedy, serves on Nascar's board and is the chief executive of the International Speedway Corporation.
Brian France and Lesa France Kennedy have held fund-raisers for Mr. Buchanan at the Daytona speedway and have become regular donors to Republican and Democratic campaigns.
In Charlotte, N.C., in August, Mr. France and several team owners held a fund-raiser for Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential nominee, who had stirred a political fuss by saying he had ''some great friends that are Nascar team owners.''

HEADLINE: The End of a Decade of Uncertainty Over Gift and Estate Taxes

BYLINE: By PAUL SULLIVAN

 BODY:
FOR many of the wealthy, the American Taxpayer Relief Act, passed this week by Congress, is aptly named.
For estate and gift taxes in particular, all but the richest of the rich will probably be able to protect their holdings from taxes, now that Congress has permanently set the estate and gift tax exemptions at $5 million (a level that will rise with inflation).
''You could say this eliminates the estate tax for 99 percent of the population, though I've seen figures that say 99.7 or 99.8,'' said Richard A. Behrendt, director of estate planning at the financial services firm Baird and a former inspector for the Internal Revenue Service. ''From a policy point of view, the estate tax is not there for raising revenue. It's there for a check on the massive concentration of wealth in a few hands, and it will still accomplish that.'' 
And while Congress also agreed to increase tax rates on dividends and capital gains to 20 percent from 15 percent for top earners -- in addition to the 3.8 percent Medicare surcharge on such earnings -- the rates are still far lower than those on their ordinary income. For the earners at the very top, whose income comes mostly from their portfolios of investments, and not a paycheck like most of the rest of us, this is a good deal.
The estate tax, once an arcane assessment, has been in flux and attracting significant attention since 2001. That was when the exemption per person for the estate tax began to rise gradually from $675,000, with a 55 percent tax for anything above that amount, to $3.5 million in 2009 with a 45 percent tax rate for estates larger than that. Estate plans were written to account for the predictable increases in exemptions.
Then in 2010, contrary to what every accountant and tax lawyer I spoke to at the time believed would happen, the estate tax disappeared. Congress and President Obama could not reach an agreement on the tax. So that year, for the first time since 1916, Americans who died were not subject to a federal estate tax. (Their estates still paid state estate taxes, where they existed, and other taxes, including capital gains, on the value of the assets transferred.)
At the end of 2010, President Obama and House Speaker John A. Boehner reached an agreement that was just as unlikely as the estate tax expiring in the first place: the new exemption was $5 million, indexed to inflation, with a 35 percent tax rate on any amount over that, and it would last for two years. The taxes and exemptions for gifts made during someone's lifetime to children and grandchildren were also raised to the same level, from $1 million and a 55 percent tax above that.
As I have written many times, this was a far better rate and exemption than anyone expected. It also created a deadline of Dec. 31, 2012, for people who could make a major gift up to the exemption level or above the amount and pay the low gift tax.
Using the gift exemption was enticing because it meant those assets would appreciate outside of the estate of the person making the gift. Even paying the tax became attractive to the very rich because of how estate and gift taxes are levied. Take, for example, someone who has used up his exemption and wants to give an heir $1 million. The amount it would take to accomplish this differs depending on when it is given. In life, it would cost $1.4 million because the 40 percent gift tax is paid like a sales tax. If it was given after death, the estate would have to set aside about $1.65 million after the 40 percent estate tax was deducted. But this presented a conundrum: while it may make perfect sense to give away a lot of money during your lifetime and save on estate taxes, it means ceding control of cash, securities or shares now. What if you end up needing them? It wasn't an easy decision, and it led to a fourth-quarter rush.
As of this week, this is no longer an issue. The estate and gift tax exemptions are permanently set at the same $5 million level, indexed for inflation, and the tax rate above that exemption is 40 percent, up from 35 percent. With indexing, the exemption is already about $5.25 million per person -- double for a couple -- and it will rise at a rate that means most Americans will continue to avoid paying any federal estate tax.
''The new law yields a lot of clarity,'' said Dan Kesten, a law partner at Davis & Gilbert. ''We can educate our clients more, and it will be easier for them to make decisions.''
Mr. Kesten added: ''For less wealthy people, they may not need much estate planning. I think we're back to the days of more straightforward wills and not much need for lifetime wealth transfers.''
Still, there are a few unresolved issues.
REGRETS Given that the exemption was set to return to $1 million with a 55 percent tax rate above that, many people rushed to take advantage of the maximum gift tax exemption before the year ended. They may now be feeling a New Year's hangover that could last for some time, particularly if they could not really afford to give all they gave.
Mr. Behrendt said people who went a step further and set up complicated structures, like trusts that allowed spouses access to the money or family limited partnerships, may want to undo them. But they could run afoul of the I.R.S.
''Can they do it?'' he asked. ''Not legally. Once you transfer to children or grandchildren, their ownership rights are vested.''
John Dadakis, a law partner at Holland & Knight, said someone could try to argue that the gift was not legitimate and that it was made under the assumption that the ability to do so was going away. But he said a better approach would be to think of those assets as now growing in the estates of your children and grandchildren.
''You're way ahead of the game now,'' he said.
CURRENT CONCERNS While federal estate taxes will not hit most of the affluent anymore, this group has other concerns.
The big one is state estate taxes. While only Connecticut has a state tax on gifts, about 20 states have estate taxes with much lower exemptions than the federal tax. In New Jersey, for example, the exemption is $675,000. In New York and Massachusetts, it is $1 million. Above those amounts, the tax rates range from 5 to 16 percent.
Many people may plan to retire to states like Florida that have no state estate tax. But as Leiha Macauley, head of the Boston office of the Day Pitney law firm, pointed out, you can't always plan when you will die.
She said one way to deal with this was to set up trusts that preserve each spouse's state exemption level. These are the same types of trusts that spouses created to take advantage of the federal exemption before this law made permanent the ability for a spouse to use a deceased spouse's exemptions. (This is what is known as portability.)
On the positive side for the affluent, a separate gift exemption known as the annual exclusion has also been indexed for inflation. It is $14,000 this year, up from $13,000 last year. It is set to rise every few years at $1,000 increments.
''In a couple of years, it's going to be $30,000 per couple, and you can give that amount to anyone you want,'' Ms. Macauley said. ''We have a couple who gives the maximum. They've given just over $2 million in the past few years.''
THE FUTURE The very rich could still face estate taxes, but there continue to be sophisticated ways for them to shield many times the exemption levels.
Mitchell A. Drossman, national director of wealth planning strategies for U.S. Trust, said two of the big tools that planners had feared would be changed but were not are grantor-retained annuity trusts -- which allow the appreciation on the asset put into the trust to pass to someone else tax-free -- and the ability to discount shares in a family business because the shares are not as liquid as stock in a public company.
Another concern is that the very rich will become lax in their planning. Carol G. Kroch, a managing director for wealth and philanthropic planning at Wilmington Trust, said trusts would still be important to families.
''One of the things that people dealing with wealth need to think about is how do you manage it,'' she said. ''A long-term trust is like an endowment for a family. You can still create that pool of wealth. You just don't have that gun to your head.''
But as we saw, deadline pressure is often needed to get people, including elected officials, to act.

HEADLINE: Ideology and Economics

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: How and where is it important? 

 BODY:
I'm in San Diego for the annual economics meetings, and am starting off this morning as a discussant of a paper by Roger Gordon and Gordon Dahl on the question of agreement versus disagreement among economists. (As far as I can tell, no public version of the paper is available yet).
Interestingly, Gordon and Dahl's paper is empirical and quantitative. Their data come from the panel of economic experts put together by Chicago's Booth School of Business. Each week since the fall of 2011, members of the panel have been asked whether they agree or disagree with a sample statement about economic affairs. These responses offer a quantitative measure of consensus or lack thereof on economic ideas; they can also be used to ask such questions as whether disagreements, when they occur, fall along a liberal/conservative divide.
And the picture Gordon and Dahl derive from this evidence is quite benign. On most issues, particularly where there is a lot of research, there is considerable consensus; and they can't find evidence of ideological divides driving disagreement. Economics, they find, looks a lot like a normal field of scientific inquiry; to the extent that it seems otherwise, they suggest, it's only because sometimes economists are working for politicians and are obliged to seem supportive. 
This picture seems, of course, to be at odds with what I have written about the state of macroeconomics. Why are they telling such a different story? One possible answer is that I was all wrong. Another possible answer, however, is that macroeconomics - and in particular the study of recessions and policy responses thereto - is special, and that the Booth panel responses just don't provide sufficient information on what is happening in that corner of the field.
Obviously I prefer the second answer, and in fact I'm quite sure I'm right. In the spirit of the paper, however, I should do my best to justify that belief quantitatively, with as little subjective interpretation as possible.
So here's a stab at doing that.
The first question is, how well are economists specializing in business-cycle models represented on the panel? There are 42 economists on the panel, 6 from each of the top 7 schools. A simple if rough way to identify the business-cycle types is to ask how many of the panelists are also members of the NBER's Economic Fluctuations and Growth (EFG) program; the answer is, 11. So we aren't getting nearly as large a sample here as the overall size of the panel might suggest.
The next question is, how many of the statements the panel was asked to address focused on the core areas of dispute among macroeconomists? Here I can't avoid making some subjective judgments. There were a number of statements focusing on macroeconomic issues, but many of those statements were clearly outside the range of dispute among professional economists. For example, while there may be significant political support for the gold standard, you won't find that support echoed even by economists who are very hostile to active monetary policy.
By my count, in fact, there were only two statements that lay within the range of serious intra-academic dispute. One involved the effects of quantitative easing; the other, on which I'll focus my attention, regarded the effects of the Recovery Act, and hence the question of fiscal stimulus. (Actually, this was a two-part, with the first statement involving the Act's effectiveness, the second its desirability).
What did the panel have to say about fiscal stimulus? The answers actually suggested a lot of consensus: 80 percent of the panel agreed that the Recovery Act significantly boosted output and employment, with only 5 percent disagreeing. (By the way, that's Caroline Hoxby and Eddie Lazear). There was a lot more uncertainty over whether the Act was a good idea, but among those who did have a view, the yeas outnumbered the nays almost three to one.
So, are impressions of a bitter ideological divide over fiscal policy just wrong? Or is the panel failing to reflect the realities of modern macroeconomics?
Again, let's go to the NBER's EFG program. Ideally, we should go through all the members and assess their views on stimulus. For now, I'll take a quicker approach, and focus only on highly prominent members of the program, using an objective measure of prominence - namely, possession of a Nobel Prize.
There are, it turns out, five laureates among the EFG members, and three of them have expressed strong views on the effects of stimulus. The most moderate of these statements comes from Thomas Sargent, who denounced the president for, in his view, falsely implying that there was a consensus among economists of the kind the Booth experts panel data also seem to suggest:
In early 2009, I recall President Obama as having said that while there was ample disagreement among economists about the appropriate monetary policy and regulatory responses to the financial crisis, there was widespread agreement in favor of a big fiscal stimulus among the vast majority of informed economists. His advisers surely knew that was not an accurate description of the full range of professional opinion.
A stronger statement came from Edward Prescott, who simply dismissed the whole notion:
Stimulus is not part of the language of economics.
Finally, Robert Lucas made a personal attack on Christina Romer for advocating stimulus, calling it "shlock economics" and questioning her intellectual honesty. Her analysis, he asserted, was
a very naked rationalization for policies that were already, you know, decided on for other reasons.
Hmm. This doesn't sound much like the consensus supposedly demonstrated by the Booth panel. And do you really want to say that the divide here has nothing to do with ideology? Really?
OK, here's how I read the Gordon and Dahl results: what they show is that most of what economists do is indeed fairly objective and non-ideological; business-cycle macro, although it's not at all like that, is a small enough part of the academic field that their data don't pick it up.
Unfortunately, while business-cycle macro may not be a large part of what economists do, it's a field that matters a lot - especially with the world still facing its worst economic crisis in three generations.
And business-cycle macro is also, I'd argue, more important to the field of economics in general than most economists themselves realize.
Long ago I stumbled on an analogy that still seems relevant to me: business-cycle macro is to economics in general in something like the way that nuclear bombs (and to some extent, to be fair, nuclear power) are to high-energy physics. I'm sure that very few physicists working on the mysteries of the universe trouble themselves at all thinking about how to make things go boom. Yet the reason the field continues to receive public funding is in large part precisely the fact that once upon a time physicists did, indeed, find a way to make things go boom, and you never know what they might come up with in the future.
Similarly, while the vast majority of economists may work on issues far removed from the question of what to do in a depression, an important part of our field's prestige and the support it receives comes from the perception that economists do indeed have useful advice to offer in times of depression, and may come up with more useful advice in the future.
And if the perception spreads, instead, that business-cycle macro is just ideological posturing, that influential economists choose their doctrines to suit their political prejudices, and that the field not only fails to progress but sometimes actually retrogresses, this will be bad for the profession as well as the world.

HEADLINE: Fusion Energi Fuel Economy Reaches 108

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
The 2013 Ford Fusion Energi plug-in hybrid has received an E.P.A. certification of being able to achieve the equivalent of 108 miles per gallon in city driving, the automaker has announced. 
The Fusion Energi was also certified at up to 92 "MPGe" - under the Environmental Protection Agency's electricity vs. gas equivalency formula - in highway driving, for a combined 100 MPGe, Ford said.
The Fusion Energi's triple-digit fuel economy certification comes at a welcome moment for the automaker, whose ratings on two of its hybrids introduced this year were called into question recently by Consumer Reports magazine. In tests conducted by the magazine's editors, the C-Max and Fusion hybrids returned up to 20 percent worse fuel economy than the 47 m.p.g. Ford had claimed for both vehicles in its E.P.A. certification tests.
The E.P.A. announced it would review the discrepancy.
At least one lawsuit, a class action on behalf of a disgruntled C-Max owner in California, has been filed.
"In its advertising and marketing campaign for the vehicles, Ford claimed that the C-Max Hybrid and Fusion Hybrid achieved a class leading 47 miles per gallon," a lawsuit filed by the California-based law firm McCuneWright reads in part. "These materials helped Ford achieve record sales for the first two months of C-Max Hybrid sales, outselling its rival, hybrid sales leader Toyota, but there was a problem. These ads were false."
Ford also calculated that in five years of normal driving, compared with a gasoline-powered car, the Fusion Energi "could potentially help save customers an estimated $6,850 in fuel costs."
The company said its hybrids sales were on a "record pace," with more than 19,000 units expected to be sold during the year.
"In fact, C-MAX became the fastest-selling hybrid ever at launch after 8,030 units were sold in October and November, the first two months C-MAX was on the market," the company said in a press release.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: At Last, All Over the Screen Scoot McNairy

BYLINE: By ABBY AGUIRRE

 BODY:
When Scoot McNairy's voice first came over the phone, I was startled to hear a Texan accent. I should not have been - I had read that he grew up outside of Dallas - but I had just watched him act in two films, "Killing Them Softly" and "Argo," in which he disappears so fully into two very different characters, I had all but forgotten he came from anywhere. You don't expect a chameleon to speak with a twang. In "Killing Them Softly," directed by Andrew Dominik and starring Brad Pitt, McNairy plays one of three guys who rob a mob-protected card game. In "Argo," directed by and starring Ben Affleck, and based on real events, he plays one of six American diplomats who were extracted out of revolutionary Iran in an outlandish C.I.A. scheme that had them pretending to be a Canadian film crew. 
McNairy, 34, shifts shapes again in "Promised Land," a Gus Van Sant movie that opened Dec. 28, and, if these films are any indication, he'll do so again in "Twelve Years a Slave," directed by Steve McQueen and due out this year. But don't call him an overnight success. Between long days of shooting yet another major feature, "Non-Stop," starring Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson, McNairy spoke to T about muddying accents, the art of riding mechanical bulls and what he terms his "slow, slow break."
Q.
You've got three major films in theaters in one month. Is it safe to say this is a first for you?
A.
Absolutely. Yes, indeed. It is definitely a first. I've been doing independent films for 10 years, but one out of five didn't see the light of day. To have three movies coming out at the same time - I probably will never have that again in my life.
One of your first big jobs was a Levi's commercial in which you were thrown from a mechanical bull. As a native Texan, can you in fact ride a mechanical bull better than that? Were you holding out on us?
Yes. But that was the thing - I also knew how to pitch myself a good ways off of that thing. So when I went into the casting, I said, "You know, if you stick your foot in the stirrup, you can really throw yourself off of there." Growing up, my friends and I would ride barrels that you tied to four trees with springs on them. A guy would get on each rope and rock the barrel back and forth, and it would simulate riding the bull.
You recently moved back to Texas from Los Angeles. Was Hollywood not for you?
I love L.A. It was an awesome place to spend my 20s, full of creative people, but I never wanted to stay there. It wasn't necessarily Texas that I wanted to move to; I just knew I wanted to live in the country somewhere. My wife and I found this place in Texas that we really liked, so we packed up our stuff and moved. We live off of a dirt road. Our closest neighbors are a half a mile away. You can be as loud as you want.
Are you glad in a way to have hit your stride now, having had a decade of experience, rather than in your early 20s?
I can't say that enough. I've been asked, "What was your big break?" I don't feel like I've had a big break. It's been a slow, slow break. I want my career to grow gradually. There's still so much for me to learn. I'm just trying to take these opportunities to get better at what I'm doing.
In "Killing Them Softly," you co-star alongside quite a lineup - Brad Pitt, James Gandolfini, Richard Jenkins, Ray Liotta. What was it like to walk onto that set?
I was excited about getting the job, but I didn't really have time to think about it too much. I was just focused so much on the work and doing a good job. I really love Andrew Dominik's movies. When you work with someone whose movies you really love and who you have a lot of admiration for, you turn into putty in their hands.
The film, about a kind of money crisis in the crime world, is presented as a parable of the financial crisis. You play a low-level stickup guy, Frankie. Did you have a real-life corollary in mind? Or was that theme more of an undertone for you?
For me, it was a hundred percent undertone. Frankie's world was separate from all that. He was just trying to survive. He had gone into prison at the height of the economy and the boom and come out at the bottom, but the character himself wasn't so conscious of it.
Your accent in that film seems very distinct. Where exactly are you supposed to be from?
The film is based on a novel ["Cogan's Trade" by George V. Higgins]. In the book, my character is from Boston. And the dialogue, the way that Andrew [Dominik] wrote it, he wrote certain words to sound very Boston. But the film is set in New Orleans. My take it on it was, yes, this kid is from Boston, but it's a contemporary piece, and I found it interesting to muddy it - to make the accent more distinct as a sound rather than a particular Boston dialect. If anything, he's a sick, malnutritioned kid from South Boston who's lived all over.
Frankie could not be more different than the tense diplomat you play in "Argo." At one point there is a scene where you speak almost entirely in Farsi. Did you take Farsi lessons for that?
I have two lines in Farsi in the beginning of the movie, and initially that was it. But throughout the shooting of the movie I was trying to learn different things to improvise in Farsi. There was a P.A. on set who spoke Farsi, and I was hanging out with him a lot. Then Ben [Affleck] told me, "All that stuff at the airport, I think we should do it in Farsi." That was thrown at me three or four days before we shot it. I posted the words on a wall, and I would just stare at them and say them over and over again. I was like, "Oh my God, dude. This is the end of my career."
Were you familiar with this little-known chapter of the hostage crisis before reading the script?
I was familiar with the hostage crisis but not this specific story. It was classified. They didn't declassify it until, I believe, 1997 or so. As far as the story is concerned, it's all pretty accurate.
There is a cooped-up, cramped feeling to the scenes, many of which take place in one house where your character and the other five diplomats are hiding out. Did the cast do anything special to prepare for this?
We all spent a week in the house we shot the movie in. No cellphones, no computers, just board games and magazines, all from 1979. We would sit around and have dinner and hang out. It was incredibly beneficial, I think, for all the actors to create our own organic chemistry.
You've got a pretty serious mustache in "Argo." Did you grow it yourself?
That's my mustache. It grows like a weed if you don't take care of it.
You are writing a screenplay at the moment. What can you tell us about it?
It's a film about redemption. And it's kind of a "Drugstore Cowboy" story, but set in the South.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

Income, Taxes and Math
To the Editor:
In ''Bad Math and the Middle Class'' (Economic View, Dec. 30), N. Gregory Mankiw says that tax and income data ''suggest that the rich are not, as a general matter, shirking their responsibilities to support the federal government,'' and that ''the current tax system looks plenty progressive.'' 
First, Mr. Mankiw never mentions that many taxes in our society -- like sales and gasoline taxes -- are regressive. Second, he sets the bar for tax fairness way too low. The growth of income inequality since the Reagan administration shows that Congress went too far in abolishing high-income tax brackets -- a revenue source that we need if we are ever to pay for two wars lasting 11 years.
A progressive tax system should maintain or reduce income inequality so that our society is more of a meritocracy than a plutocracy. Roger Friedman
Decatur, Ga., Dec. 30
To the Editor:
In the long run, most all Americans are likely to face higher taxes, thus broadening the base, but let's remember that taxes haven't solely been used for the purpose of raising revenue or reducing debt.
The tax structure in America over the past 30 years has clearly been a major component of a sharp shift in the nation's wealth. Lowered tax rates on income and dramatically reduced rates on investment income have skewed the system in favor the already wealthy, and the implications will impact our national fiscal well-being for years to come. Kevin Kobalter, M.D.
San Rafael, Calif., Dec. 30
To the Editor:
Lamenting the growth of the United States deficit, Professor Mankiw blames higher spending on entitlement programs like Medicare -- spending that is driven, he argues, by ''new technology, which extends and improves the quality of life, but often at a high cost.''
Such views are hard to stomach after reading ''Finding Profits, at $28,000 a Vial'' in your section the same day. That article described a company that paid $100,000 for the rights to a drug developed decades ago, increased the price of the drug overnight to $23,000 from $1,650 a vial (and now to more than $28,000), has manufacturing costs that account for only 1 percent of the drug's price -- and saw the drug's sales total nearly $350 million in the first nine months of 2012.
Rather than cut Medicare benefits, wouldn't it make more sense to rein in sky-high prices for drugs?
François Furstenberg
Montreal, Dec. 30
To the Editor:
Professor Mankiw attributes much of America's federal deficit to the growth in entitlement spending, but why doesn't he mention the cost of the wars that the nation has waged?
Policy makers have presumably known all along that the population would age and that health care costs would increase. Rather than factoring those truths into the budget, they chose to wage wars of choice. Is that the citizens' fault? I don't think so. Carol Wheeler
San Miguel de Allende,Mexico, Dec. 30

HEADLINE: Violent Crime Fell? Tell It to East Harlem

BYLINE: By GINIA BELLAFANTE

 BODY:
The passing of the previous year was greeted, in recent days, by the announcements that New York City had broken various records in 2012, achieving the lowest annual number of murders -- just over 414 -- since the city started keeping a comparable count in 1963, and receiving more tourists -- 52 million -- than ever in its history. Though the city witnessed an increase in crime over all, a rise of 3.3 percent over the past 12 months, this was attributed by the mayor's office to the enduring appeal of Apple products among thieves in thrall to consumer voyeurism. If only the iPhone could tamp down its hotness; if only it would stop going out and getting drunk in short skirts and heels.
The implication that what we most need to worry about is better concealment of expensive portable electronics belies the perceptions of many New Yorkers who don't live in places most likely to be visited by any meaningful percentage of those 52 million out-of-towners, those for whom the fear of crime isn't peripheral and almost quaintly postmodern, but immediate and paramount. Just before Christmas, for instance, Union Settlement, the 117-year-old social service agency based in East Harlem, released the results of a survey that identified crime as the single greatest concern to residents in the area. 
The survey, conducted in conjunction with the Silberman School of Social Work at Hunter College, questioned 1,000 men and women who used the agency's services. It found that 77 percent of respondents placed the need for crime reduction above these needs: affordable health care, housing, improved schools and expanded job opportunities. Two years ago, when Union Settlement conducted a similar survey with only a slightly varied methodology, respondents placed crime sixth in order of what preoccupied them most.
In the case of East Harlem, rising crime fears are accompanied by an obvious statistical explanation: Countering trends in most of the city, crime there has increased drastically. Over the past year, it has gone up by 17 percent, according to Police Department figures, with increases in rape, robbery and felony assault, among other transgressions. (Rapes, in fact, have risen citywide over the past two years in an uptick of 5 percent, a subject little discussed by city officials.) In May, East Harlem community leaders led a march calling for an end to the rampant violence that in the preceding month had included the stabbing of a police officer in the head by an emotionally disturbed man on Third Avenue and 107th Street, and the attempted armed robbery of a pharmacy on First Avenue.
It is these sorts of lurid crimes -- those that leave an outsize impression -- that seem to contribute to another phenomenon prevalent in certain parts of the city, the belief that crime is actually worse than the accounting suggests. While reporting in parts of the Bronx and central Brooklyn over the past year, I have repeatedly met longtime residents who believe that crime is much more pervasive now, especially in public housing, than it was during the horror days of the 1980s and '90s.
Of course, this isn't borne out statistically -- crime has plummeted over the past two decades even in the most severely affected neighborhoods. But there is a view that guns are everywhere, that teenagers will shoot at one another for no good reason whatsoever, that the old gang rules -- or the contracts of the now-diminished crack economy, as Bryant Williams, a 30-year resident of the McKinley Houses in the Bronx, explained it to me -- perilously no longer apply. Twenty-year-olds don't even know how to shoot their targets anymore. Mr. Williams is afraid in a way that he wasn't afraid in 1982. And when a child, in a playground, is maimed or killed in the cross-fire, a circumstance that seems to have been repeated over and over this past summer -- in the Bronx, in Brooklyn, in Upper Manhattan -- there seems little reason to try to change his mind.
This gap between perception of crime and reality has been understudied by criminologists, but it would be useful to know what toll our anxieties, however provoked, take societally. Statistics from the Police Department tell us that gun crime was down in 2012 over the previous year, even though it certainly doesn't feel that way in light of the summer's violence (and especially in light of the shootings in Newtown, Conn.).
It is highly unlikely that any New Yorker in the course of his or her life will be pushed in front of a moving subway train. But in the days since a passenger was shoved to his death from the platform of the 40th Street-Lowery Street subway station in Queens, the second such episode in several weeks, riders have stood back from the edge, their minds clearly not on the math. Ear buds, however, were everywhere.

HEADLINE: Relocation Therapy

BYLINE: By JOANNE KAUFMAN

 BODY:
ALMOST four years ago, Marilyn Kotcher suddenly became a widow. And the large -- 2,250-square-foot -- condominium in Fort Lee, N.J., that she and her husband had bought together and lovingly remodeled no longer seemed like home.
''It had a lot of wonderful memories for me,'' said Ms. Kotcher, a clinical social worker. ''But I didn't have a sense of belonging there anymore.''
She was similarly disenchanted with Fort Lee. ''I felt very isolated,'' she said. ''There are just a lot of large buildings on the water. If you're part of a couple, it's O.K., but I wanted a sense of community.''
In the past, space had always trumped location for Ms. Kotcher when it came to choosing a home. Now, location was going to be her priority. And so it was that last May she moved to a one-bedroom rental on East 79th Street in Manhattan. ''I had a zillion friends in New Jersey, but I would never just bump into them,'' she said. ''In Manhattan if I run into someone on Second Avenue, we go out for coffee.'' 
That kind of spontaneity reminds her of college dorm life, though the adult version has ''everyone in a separate apartment.'' On the Upper East Side, she said, ''I can always find something to do. A long weekend no longer creates any anxiety for me.''
Legions swear by retail therapy as a way of dealing with a bad day at the office, a bad hair day or a really bad number on the bathroom scale. But people who are going through more substantial life crises -- the death of a loved one, illness, divorce, a messy breakup -- may be able to work through the pain with the aid of real estate therapy. A new home, after all, can be much more than a change of address.
''If real estate is a big part of your problem, it's possible that real estate can solve it,'' said Elayne Reimer, an executive vice president of Halstead Property and a former marriage and family counselor. ''If you live a two-hour commute from work, moving closer to the job might be very beneficial to your health, and to improving relations with family members because you'd have more time for them.''
But ''a lot of people use real estate as an escape,'' she added. ''If you're living in the suburbs and you aren't happy in your home life, you may think if you move to the city your life will be better. But the location isn't going to make a difference if the unhappiness is internal.''
When you decide that a new residence is the best solution to a problem, your emotional baggage gets loaded in the moving van along with the linen and flatware, said Beth Fisher, a senior managing director of the Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group. ''But changing real estate can really be psychologically healthy under certain circumstances.''
Such circumstances include what can be described as the Second Mrs. de Winter Syndrome. ''We see marriages where the new couple is burdened psychologically living in the same apartment that had been occupied by the former spouse,'' Ms. Fisher said. ''It's a burden, especially for a second wife. To get out of the shadow of someone's stakehold in a particular neighborhood is very empowering.''
Ms. Fisher has also known of cancer patients who abandon a longtime address for a home in a newly built development. ''There's nothing more beneficial and promising,'' she said, ''than deciding, 'Not only am I going to survive; I'm going to triumph; I am going to live in a fresh new environment.' They're using real estate to make a therapeutic -- positive -- bet on the future.''
Two years ago, Matt Holbein was grieving for his partner's father, who had just died, an event that hit the couple very hard.
''He was like my father, too,'' said Mr. Holbein, 44, a vice president of Douglas Elliman. Soon afterward, he and his partner began a trial separation that quickly became ''a pretty dramatic breakup,'' Mr. Holbein said. ''It was very painful, and we dealt with it in very different ways.''
Mr. Holbein hunkered down in the 1,500-square-foot Dumbo loft that the couple had bought in 2003. His partner, meanwhile, moved a block away with a new boyfriend. Awkward? Unpleasant? All that and more.
''But I dug my heels in and said, 'That's not going to make me move,' '' recalled Mr. Holbein, who had decided to buy out his former partner.
Such was the plan until A) he saw the size of the mortgage he'd have to carry, and B) he saw a psychic. ''She told me: 'No, no, you're moving. The new apartment is going to make you serene.' ''
This past July, Mr. Holbein moved to a one-bedroom condo with 13-foot ceilings in Brooklyn Heights. ''My new apartment is all me,'' he said. ''The paint colors are my paint colors, the wallpaper is my wallpaper. The people who stay here are my people.''
Mr. Holbein added that he would advise anybody who wanted to keep a once-shared home: ''Don't do it! There's always a residue.'' Moving, he said, has given him ''a clarity about who I am.'' Striking out on his own helped him learn ''that I'm an independent soul and that I'm O.K. by myself,'' he said.
''And the good things from my relationships came with me. I wouldn't be in the position I'm in, if not for the good financial decisions my partner and I made together.''
Therapists generally counsel bereaved patients not to make any major decisions for at least a year after the death of a loved one. Don't sell the stock portfolio; don't throw out possessions. Oh, yes, and don't, don't, don't move out of the home you shared.
But maybe this last is not always good advice.
When Clyde Alves and Robyn Hurder began seeing each other eight years ago, it quickly became apparent that they had more in common than their careers as Broadway performers. Both were crazy about dogs, boxers to be specific. Almost immediately after they started dating, they moved in together. And almost immediately after that, they bought a boxer named Sophie; then, barely a month later, another boxer, Mariella. The couple were married almost four years ago.
Two years ago, the vet gave Sophie a diagnosis of lymphoma; this summer her condition became critical. ''Taking care of her consumed our lives,'' said Ms. Hurder, who with Mr. Alves is appearing in the hit musical ''Nice Work if You Can Get It.'' Unfortunately, the couple had to euthanize Sophie on Aug. 31.
The next day, Ms. Hurder looked around their ground-floor rental apartment in Inwood and announced, ''I need to get out of here.''
Every time she walked into the kitchen, ''I thought Sophie would be there,'' she said. ''Every time I put my key in the lock, I would think I was going to see her. There was something that reminded me of her in every room. What was so hard about losing Sophie was that she was part of the first chapter of Clyde's and my life together.'' And, Ms. Hurder added, sounding a practical note, ''The apartment didn't get a lot of sunlight.''
When they walked out of their building, going to the right was now an impossibility. That was the direction they'd always taken on their walks with Sophie. Inwood Hill Park was similarly off limits; too many memories of frolicking there with the two dogs. ''I kept telling Clyde, 'We have to move, we have to move,' '' Ms. Hurder said.
Mr. Alves, trying to be the voice of reason, pointed out that they would lose their security deposit.
''I also thought we should sit down where we were and grieve,'' he said. ''It would be harder in the short term, but by the time we left I thought we would be over the worst of it.''
With three months left on the lease, Ms. Hurder began checking out rentals online. ''It was very therapeutic just to get my wheels going,'' she said.
The last weekend in November, the couple moved 10 blocks from the Inwood apartment to a sunny sixth-floor corner apartment in Washington Heights. They have good friends in the building, a lower rent and a new park -- Fort Tryon -- for Mariella to cavort in. ''She's really been our savior,'' Ms. Hurder said. ''But I don't know if we'll get another dog. If we get anything, it will be a baby.''
Sometimes emotional equilibrium comes at considerable cost.
''Economically, it wasn't a good time to sell my condo,'' said Ms. Kotcher, the Fort Lee transplant on the Upper East Side. ''But I asked myself, 'What's more important: psychological well-being, or money in the bank you can't get any interest on anyway?' ''
And the old place, once deserted, can sometimes exert a powerful tug. Eight years ago, Paul Purcell, a founder of Rutenberg Realty, split with his partner of two decades and sold their 41st-floor place ''with views to die for'' in the Olympic Tower at Fifth Avenue and 51st.
''We renovated it together, decorated it together, had parties there for his company and my company, had our parents there,'' said Mr. Purcell, 60. ''But we realized we had to make some changes, as hard and sad and painful as it was.''
After the breakup, he bought a perfectly fine one-bedroom in the East 50s, but put off doing the things that would have turned the apartment into a home. ''There was as period of not wanting to commit,'' said Mr. Purcell, who finally painted, redid the fireplace facade and, with the help of his former partner -- the two have remained close friends -- chose furnishings. ''Now,'' he said, ''this feels like my little nest.''
And yet. Just the other week Mr. Purcell was walking past the Olympic Tower. ''And the doorman was the same doorman as when we lived there,'' he recalled. ''And he said, 'Mr. Purcell!' And I hugged him and I went into the lobby and saw the concierge and the elevator operators and they all hugged me.''
He called his former partner and said: ''Why did we ever leave? We loved it, we adored it. We adored the apartment.''
And then, he added, ''You know, we really should have figured out a way to hold on to it.''
THE ANSWER?
IT'S not uncommon for those who have experienced a major change -- an empty nest, the death of a spouse -- to want to move, according to Gail Saltz, a clinical associate professor of psychiatry at NewYork- Presbyterian Hospital.
''Our home represents comfort and another way of identifying ourselves,'' she said. ''Your identity is changed by loss, so you think of changing your house, too.''
People may see a move ''as a way of starting over,'' she added, ''even a way of undoing the bad thing that has happened. It's a defense mechanism.''
But is it a healthy defense mechanism?
''There's no right answer,'' Dr. Saltz said. ''But I certainly wouldn't board up the house the week your spouse leaves.
''We don't process things instantly,'' she said. ''Being guided by a desire to run might lead you to a financially or emotionally unwise decision for yourself.'' Unless, she said, ''it means moving somewhere you had always wanted to be anyway.''

HEADLINE: The Crowd Is Anxious

BYLINE: By AMY CORTESE. 
Amy Cortese is the author of ''Locavesting: The Revolution in Local Investing and How to Profit From It.''

 BODY:
RYAN CALDBECK was stumped. A director at a private equity firm, he was taking part in a panel discussion at a consumer goods conference last summer in New York when an entrepreneur raised his hand with a question: Where could a young company with just a few million dollars in sales go for money to grow?
Mr. Caldbeck and his peers on the panel fumbled for a response. The fact is, most private equity investors and venture capitalists won't touch a consumer products company until it has surpassed $10 million in sales -- anything else is too small to bother with.
The best advice the panel could offer was for the entrepreneur to tap his credit cards. 
''The purpose of the panel was to help entrepreneurs raise money, but we had no answers,'' Mr. Caldbeck remembers. ''That's when I knew that there is a big issue here.''
That big issue caused Mr. Caldbeck to leave his job to start CircleUp, a company that aims to connect up-and-coming consumer products companies with investors.
Right now, the people allowed to invest through CircleUp must be accredited, meaning they have a high net worth. CircleUp hopes that soon not just the wealthy few, but the general public -- whether friends, family members, customers, Facebook friends, or even total strangers -- will be able to invest in deserving companies through a hot new area of finance known as crowdfunding.
To its advocates, crowdfunding is a way for capital-starved entrepreneurs to receive financing that neither big investors nor lenders are willing or able to provide. To others, it represents a potential minefield that could help bad businesses get off the ground before they eventually fail, and in some cases could even ensnare unsophisticated investors in outright fraud.
Those fears are partly why the Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed rules allowing crowdfunding that were supposed to take effect this month as part of the JOBS Act (Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups), signed by President Obama last April. The S.E.C. is wary of loosening investor protections that have been in place since the 1930s.
Despite the uncertainty, the outlines of a new industry are emerging as a few crowdfunding start-ups have found ways to raise money within current rules. They include companies like CircleUp and SoMoLend, which lends money to small, Main Street-type businesses that typically wouldn't interest private investors.
By themselves, of course, a few start-ups can't completely democratize finance. But they begin to illuminate what the future of crowdfunding could look like, as the debate continues over a vast widening of the private investor pool.
Mr. Caldbeck formed CircleUp last fall along with Rory Eakin, a former business school classmate who was working for a philanthropic foundation. Through their start-up, the two men seek to finance food, personal care, apparel and pet-related companies, often with an environmental or social bent.
CircleUp considers applications from companies with $1 million to $10 million in revenue. Companies whose applications are accepted make their pitches to investors behind a firewall on the CircleUp Web site, offering equity stakes in return for capital. CircleUp, which helps companies raise up to $3 million, takes a small cut of the money.
Under current federal regulations, CircleUp wouldn't be able to arrange such deals on its own. But it struck a partnership with W. R. Hambrecht, a registered broker-dealer that can handle investments from accredited, or high-net-worth, individuals whom the S.E.C. considers sophisticated enough to invest in private companies.
''Living here in Silicon Valley, a lot of people don't understand the need,'' Mr. Caldbeck says. ''If you're a tech company with a good idea, you can raise money. But it's a different story for food, agriculture, retail and other consumer-oriented businesses.''
Mr. Caldbeck sees a big opportunity. Consumer goods companies account for a sizable portion of the nation's businesses, yet very little capital -- from private equity funds or from accredited investors -- flows to them, he says.
What's more, only a tiny percentage of those who qualify as accredited investors actually invest in private companies, he says. (These are people with a net worth of at least $1 million, not including their primary residence, or who have earned more than $200,000 -- $300,000 for couples -- in each of the last two years.)
CircleUp is aiming to simplify the process so that more accredited investors take the plunge and more start-ups can get financing. And it wants to expand its business to unaccredited investors when the rules for crowdfunding are completed.
So far, CircleUp has helped seven companies raise money on its site. They include Episencial, a children's organic skin care line based in Los Angeles; Laloo's, a maker of goat milk ice cream in Petaluma, Calif.; and Little Duck Organics, a children's snack producer in Brooklyn.
Zak Normandin, 26, the tousled-haired founder of Little Duck Organics, got the money to start his business the way many small businesses do: by maxing out credit cards. He ran the company out of his basement and distributed products himself to local stores before winning his first big client: Whole Foods.
Two years later, he and nine employees operate out of offices in a brick warehouse in the Greenpoint area of Brooklyn. His goal has been to create healthy snacks and cereals that he would serve to his own three children.
''There's no healthy fun alternative for kids,'' Mr. Normandin says.
The company's first product -- Tiny Fruits, a line of no-sugar-added organic fruit snacks -- can be found in 6,000 retail outlets, including Whole Foods and Stop & Shop stores and on Amazon.com. Mighty Oats, a new cereal line packaged in compostable containers, will hit stores this month. There are juices, fruit purées and other products in the works, he says.
All of that takes capital -- lots of it. Yet fund-raising takes valuable time away from running the business.
CircleUp has given entrepreneurs like Mr. Normandin a streamlined way to raise money while providing investors with opportunities they may not otherwise hear about. In seven weeks, Little Duck raised nearly $900,000 from about a dozen investors on the site.
''Pre-CircleUp, 80 percent of my time during fund-raising was spent with investors,'' Mr. Normandin says.
And the CircleUp fund-raising brought more than money. A few investors with experience in building and marketing consumer brands have become informal advisers to Mr. Normandin. ''To have that kind of experience to leverage has been extremely helpful,'' he says.
Another draw is that CircleUp has partnered with corporations like General Mills, which get an early look at new brands they might want to acquire down the road.
CircleUp itself has attracted $1.5 million from big-name investors including Howard Schultz, the Starbucks chairman, through his Maveron venture fund.
Another supporter is Clayton Christensen, the Harvard Business School professor known for his work on what is called disruptive innovation; he invested in CircleUp through his Rose Park Advisors investment firm. (Professor Christensen says that seemingly simple innovations can disrupt and displace mainstays in a market the way the personal computer disrupted the mainframe market and smartphones are now disrupting PCs.)
CircleUp, and crowdfunding in general, have ''the potential to be disruptive,'' Professor Christensen says, by opening up financing to companies that have traditionally struggled to raise capital and to investors who have been excluded from the market.
SOMOLEND, a crowdfunding start-up based in Cincinnati with offices in New York City, is focused on a more modest, but ultimately larger, market: the millions of small businesses that dot the nation's Main Streets.
These businesses usually rely on financing from friends and family, home equity loans, credit cards and bank loans. Yet all of those financing sources suffered greatly during the financial crisis and in many cases have not yet recovered. While overall commercial lending has rebounded, bank lending to small businesses is still down significantly from 2008.
Much of the crowdfunding focus has been on equity -- selling shares in start-ups -- but SoMoLend is betting that loans to expanding small businesses are a bigger opportunity. Equity crowdfunding will be ''minuscule compared to the impact crowdfunding will have on debt financing,'' says Candace Klein, SoMoLend's founder and C.E.O. ''We think this is literally going to change the banking system.''
Citing a recent Federal Reserve report, Ms. Klein says that nearly a third of small businesses don't apply for bank loans for fear of rejection. Of those that do apply, two-thirds are turned down, leaving them in need of capital.
That is the market that SoMoLend -- short for Social Mobile Local Lending -- was created to serve. Ms. Klein's experience with her first start-up, a Cincinnati-based firm that mentors and makes microloans to entrepreneurial women, made her clearly aware of the need, she said. But how to serve that market as crowdfunding worked its way through the legislative -- and now the regulatory -- process? Ms. Klein had an idea: instead of raising money from a group of individual investors, she would seek out institutions to serve as lenders.
Her first partner was KeyBank, a regional bank based in Cleveland, which helped test the site and develop an underwriting algorithm. Today, SoMoLend counts more than 40 institutions among its lenders, including Fifth Third Bank, the Emery Federal Credit Union, the Bank of Kentucky and Justine Petersen, a nonprofit microlender.
Ms. Klein says she offers an efficient way for lenders to find loan candidates and to team up so they can reduce their risk.
With SoMoLend, ''we can query and filter the types of businesses we're interested in'' and ''only take on the risk that we are comfortable with,'' says Britt Scearce, a business development officer at Emery. In addition, local governments like the City of Cincinnati and St. Louis County, Mo., have signed on, seeing the service as a way to spur economic development.
Since SoMoLend started about a year ago, it has eased the way for $3.4 million in loans to 89 small-business borrowers, typically retailers, restaurants, salons and other concerns that have inventory and equipment that can be used as collateral.
Borrowers have included Candice Peters, who raised $9,000 from three lenders to help with working capital for her two-year-old Hyde Park Body Boutique, a workout studio in the Hyde Park section of Cincinnati. She now employs six instructors and says she hopes to open a second studio in another part of town.
And there's Stacey Shiring, owner of Creative Invites and Events, a Cincinnati shop that creates custom stationery and invitations from designs by local artists.
Ms. Shiring, who is 34, obtained a $15,000 loan, at 6 percent interest, from Key Bank through SoMoLend. She used the loan to develop software that will allow customers to design stationery online; she plans to license the software to other stationers. As she began building a history of loan repayment on SoMoLend, she was able to secure a $50,000 line of credit from her bank.
Ms. Shiring says her business is profitable, and she now employs five full-time and two part-time employees. ''It's hard to open a small business, and SoMoLend has made it a little easier for us,'' she says.
Crowdfunding sites like SoMoLend aim to act as a kind of financial launching pad. ''Crowdfunding can get companies started to the point where they can get bank financing down the road,'' says Mr. Scearce of Emery Credit Union. ''We're excited about what this can do for the economy -- it can get a lot of companies up and running. And we're excited to be in on the ground floor.''
In October, Ms. Klein formed a partnership with Gate Global Impact, a broker-dealer based in New York, that allows SoMoLend to add accredited investors, as well as family members and friends, to its mix of lenders. That paves the way for what she calls ''leveraged loans,'' so that institutional lenders can feel more confident knowing that a borrower who has raised money from friends and family has some ''skin in the game.'' It also moves her closer to her goal of enabling ordinary investors to ''invest in the products, people and companies that they already know and love.''
HER hope is shared by dozens of other start-ups that geared up after President Obama signed the JOBS Act. One of the law's crucial provisions allows private companies to sell shares to the public over the Internet, but it stipulates that such investments take place on a new type of Web site known as a ''funding portal.'' The S.E.C. was given until the end of 2012 to flesh out the legislation with detailed rules.
Thus, last spring, the race to reinvent finance for the Internet age was on. With their eye on early 2013, dozens of ambitious start-ups began preparing their crowdfunding portals. They watched the stunning success of sites like Kickstarter and Indiegogo, which have helped raise hundreds of millions of dollars in donations, and they vowed to do the same for entrepreneurs. (Donation- and rewards-based crowdfunding is not covered by securities laws, which kick in only when a financial return is promised.)
Those dreams have been stalled, if not exactly extinguished. The S.E.C., sensitive to critics of the new law, has missed its year-end deadline. Turnover at the top of the agency -- Mary L. Schapiro left as chairwoman in December, and a permanent replacement has not been named -- could further slow progress.
Kevin Callahan, a spokesman for the S.E.C., wrote in an e-mail that the agency had been working very hard on crowdfunding rules and had said both before and after the JOBS Act was enacted that the year-end deadline was unrealistic for such a complex issue.
''We will continue working hard amid a busy rule-making agenda to get these crowdfunding rules done as soon as possible and to get them done right -- with the appropriate investor protections in place,'' he said.
Crowdfunding portals, meanwhile, are recalibrating their business plans as they operate in a holding pattern. Many people estimate that actual crowdfunding might not occur until early 2014.
For crowdfunding entrepreneurs, ''it's going to be a long, cold winter and spring,'' says D. J. Paul, a former securities professional who was a co-founder of a portal called Crowdfunder and now advises others.
As the S.E.C. struggles to balance protection for investors with increased access to capital for small businesses, some advocates of crowdfunding worry that the idea's promise will be stifled.
Slava Rubin, the C.E.O. of Indiegogo, says, ''I'm very concerned about the idea of the government stopping this before it has ever had the chance to get off its feet.''
Mr. Rubin, whose company is considering expanding into investment-style crowdfunding once the new rules are completed, says he fears that regulations will be so complex that crowdfunding -- at least as envisioned -- ''will be too burdensome to execute.''
In part, the delay reflects the fact that crowdfunding poses risks. Small businesses and start-ups, after all, have a high failure rate. Even advocates concede that there will almost certainly be examples of fraud and failure when crowdfunding takes hold.
''No one should expect that it will be flawless,'' Mr. Rubin says. ''As the saying goes, you've got to break some eggs to make an omelet.''
Thom Ruhe, vice president for entrepreneurship at the Kauffman Foundation, says: ''I'm absolutely certain there will be fraud in the crowdfunding space -- it's just too attractive for people with nefarious intent, which is why I hope the S.E.C. is taking all this time to get it right.'' He favors prominent investor warnings on crowdfunding sites and an emphasis on investor education.
''My biggest concern is when, not if, these fraudulent actions are discovered, that there won't be an overreaction,'' he says. He offers this analogy: If a bank is robbed in Chicago, you don't shut down banks everywhere.
Over all, he says, crowdfunding will broaden the pool of capital available to entrepreneurs and bolster the economy. ''The movement behind crowdfunding is a market response to a market reality,'' says Mr. Ruhe, referring to the financial crisis, which caused banks to rein in lending and to deny lines of credit to many healthy small companies.
THE JOBS Act contains investor protections. For example, legislators capped the amount that unaccredited investors can invest through crowdfunding in a given year to $2,000, or 5 percent of their income, whichever is greater. Also, businesses that raise money on crowdfunding portals must disclose relevant financial information; for companies seeking more than $500,000, that includes audited figures.
Creators of the new Web portals, meanwhile, have been offering crowdfunding conferences and boot camps, holding business-plan competitions and hosting fund-raising campaigns that allow companies to solicit donations but not investments. Others are re-evaluating whether they want to be involved in what may ultimately be a highly regulated industry.
One high-profile entrepreneur, Adam Draper, has already thrown in the towel. His start-up, BoostFunder, had planned to create an online marketplace for start-ups and investors when he introduced it last year. But, citing regulatory red tape, Mr. Draper shifted gears and turned BoostFunder into a conventional Silicon Valley incubator.
Mr. Eakin of CircleUp continues to work with accredited investors as the S.E.C. completes its work on crowdfunding. ''We're still optimistic about the potential for crowdfunding writ large,'' he says. ''It's been a longer process than many of us had hoped, but one that in the end we think will be a good thing for the country over all.''

HEADLINE: Patience and Progress in the Bronx

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE ROSENBLUM

 BODY:
AS the founder and president of the Bronx Pro Group, a family-run, neighborhood-based company in Morris Park that builds, renovates and manages low- and moderate-income housing in the Bronx, Peter Magistro, 63, has seen the borough struggle and come back to life. A Bronx native and longtime resident who now lives on the Upper West Side, he has an intimate knowledge of local housing trends. He knows where the Bronx has been and where it's headed.
Q Tell us about your background.
A My grandparents came from Italy, and I grew up in a two-room walk-up in the Westchester Square section. I majored in economics at Fordham and have a master's in finance. I spent 12 years at Citibank, working mostly in financial control and real estate. 
Q How did you get into the real estate business?
A In 1973, when I was 24, I bought my first building with my dad, an old six-family apartment house north of Fordham Road for $60,000, as an investment. I kept buying residential buildings in the Bronx. In 1998 I got a chance to renovate 185 units of housing in the Bronx. Since then I've built or renovated over 1,300 apartments, everything from town houses to high-rise apartment buildings. We also manage 1,800 apartments in 64 buildings. Thanks to a variety of government programs, including tax credits and capital funds, we can provide quality housing at affordable rents. We mostly offer family-sized apartments that rent for an average of under $1,000 a month.
Q Who lives in your buildings?
A Mostly working families with a wide range of incomes. A typical family of four renting a two-bedroom apartment could earn from $44,000 to $86,000 a year.
Q Let's say you're a student, or retired or have a young family, and you want to move to the Bronx. What neighborhoods should you think about?
A The West Bronx has a lot of attractions. Subway service is excellent, the buildings are solid in a way they don't build anymore, and there's a retail strip along Fordham Road. To the north are a number of affluent bedroom communities, like Riverdale and Pelham Manor. And there are emerging areas in the South Bronx that offer good transportation, including High Bridge, which includes Yankee Stadium, and Melrose, which includes the Hub.
Q What are the pluses and minuses of living in the Bronx these days?
A The main plus is that you can find an affordable, family-sized apartment in a well-constructed building. Bronx apartments are roomy, and the buildings have good bones. Many neighborhoods have great subway service, and there's plenty of shopping. The Bronx also has remarkable attractions like the Bronx Zoo, the New York Botanical Garden, Wave Hill, terrific parks where you can play golf or picnic, beaches and our very own Bronx Riviera -- Orchard Beach and City Island. You can have one of the best Italian meals in New York on Arthur Avenue, our Little Italy.
But some amenities need to catch up. We don't have enough of the large Manhattan-style supermarkets or chain stores. There could be more bank branches and more specialty coffee shops. Certain areas are in a two-fare subway zone and may require a car. The social needs are a challenge, as they are citywide. In our developments, we're addressing this challenge through community facilities that provide after-school programs, day care facilities and senior centers.
Q Who's moving to the Bronx these days?
A Newcomers include people who are coming to the West Bronx from Washington Heights, where they're getting priced out. People from Manhattan and Brooklyn have applied to live in our moderate-income buildings. We also see applicants from New Jersey who work in the city and want an easier commute.
Q Many New Yorkers don't know much about the Bronx, but in their opinion, it's a violent place. What's your answer to them?
A What's different since the '70s, when that attitude developed, is that now people want to live here. They're not running away from the Bronx; some are even running to the Bronx. I think today's Bronx is very much like the Bronx that I experienced growing up, essentially a melting pot of people who settle here to make a better life for themselves and their families. That's what defines the Bronx. Maybe there's not a Starbucks on every corner, but there is a rich variety of people and experiences.
Q Will the Bronx ever shake its negative portrait in Tom Wolfe's novel ''The Bonfire of the Vanities''? A Who sees it that way? I don't think anyone does anymore, unless they're not informed. And the proof is in the pudding, because when we market a new development, we receive thousands of applications from all parts of the city. It shows that with attention and investment, perceptions shift over time.
Q If you could fix one thing about the Bronx, what would it be?
A It would be to eradicate any lingering reputation of the Bronx made famous in the '60s and '70s and that was further dramatized by movies. In recent years, the Bronx has made substantial progress through investments made under the mayor's new housing marketplace plan, which has created safe and secure housing for people. Misperceptions about the Bronx have delayed us from reaching our full potential. But time really does heal all wounds, and people eventually forget. The Lower East Side, Harlem and certain neighborhoods in Brooklyn experienced similar devastation and notoriety, and they have succeeded in changing. The Bronx is a diamond in the rough, being discovered.
Q Gentrification often seems to start after artists colonize a neighborhood. Is that happening in the Bronx?
A Not much, which is a shame. For a while there was an opportunity in the South Bronx, but the economic downturn crushed that. Eventually, however, artists will cross the river. And if we invest in housing that addresses their needs, it could help attract them. I believe the potential is there. Look at SoHo and TriBeCa. Look at what they were and what they've become.
Q What's been the impact of buildings in the Bronx by star architects like Rafael Viñoly, who designed the Bronx Hall of Justice on 161st Street, just off the Grand Concourse, and Arquitectonica, responsible for the expansion of the Bronx Museum of the Arts?
A They've created an architectural buzz and interest in this part of the city. They change perception. We should have more such projects.
Q In terms of safety, a sense of community and great restaurants, Arthur Avenue has always been a successful Bronx neighborhood. Could it be replicated elsewhere in the borough?
A Part of the neighborhood's longevity and mystique is rooted in its historic and ethnic origins. I remember my mother shopping at the Arthur Avenue market when the streets were lined with pushcarts. Perhaps the new immigrants will create their own Arthur Avenue rooted in their traditions and culture. I'm not sure that isn't already happening.
Q For families thinking about moving to the Bronx, what's the takeaway?
A The Bronx is a growing and vibrant place. Sure, there are trade-offs. But on balance our neighborhoods are safe and prospering. A family of four earning under $86,000 can find affordable housing in an apartment as big as many houses and in a building with character. Where else in the city can you find this?
Q Is it true that every Thanksgiving you deliver turkeys to the families who live in your buildings?
A Yes. This year we delivered almost 1,400 turkeys to our tenants and other members of our community.

HEADLINE: Boehner, American Hero

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
HERE are a few things that happened to John Boehner, ostensibly one of the most powerful men in Washington, during the past two weeks.
First his own backbenchers blew up his attempt at a fiscal cliff negotiating maneuver. Then he had to step back and let Joe Biden and Mitch McConnell hammer out the details of the fiscal cliff deal, which he then had to shepherd through his own legislative body with more Democratic than Republican votes. The next day he was dressed down on national television by a grandstanding Chris Christie. The day after that, he survived an utterly incompetent revolt against his re-election as speaker of the House.
These tribulations have earned Boehner press coverage that's sympathetic without being particularly respectful. It's increasingly taken for granted that he's an ineffective speaker who holds his position mostly because nobody else wants the job -- an anti-Sam Rayburn, a survivor who's liked but not feared. The only compliments he ever seems to earn are backhanded, rueful, there-but-for-the-grace-of-God-go-I. 
Yet at the same time, Boehner has done his country a more important service over the last two years than almost any other politician in Washington.
That service hasn't been the achievement of a grand bargain with the White House, which he has at times assiduously sought. Nor has it been the sweeping triumph over liberalism that certain right-wing activists expect him to somehow gain. Rather, it's been a kind of disaster management -- a sequence of bomb-defusal operations that have prevented our dysfunctional government from tipping into outright crisis.
Three realities have made these constant defusing operations necessary. First, there's the grim economic and budgetary situation -- a mix of slow growth and huge peacetime deficits that constrains policy makers in unprecedented ways. (It's far, far easier to be a successful legislator when you're negotiating over an expanding pie.) Second, there's the combination of gridlocked government and ideological polarization, which simultaneously requires compromise while reducing the common ground available to would-be deal makers.
Such obstacles might be enough to frustrate even the legislative giants of the past. Pundits talk blithely about the good old days of bipartisanship, but there's no real precedent in modern American history for a bipartisan bargain in which two bitterly divided sides both accept so many painful sacrifices.
The Republicans' current position makes things harder still, because Boehner's party has much more power in Washington than it has support in the nation as a whole. Republicans are a minority party nationally, but thanks to redistricting they control the House despite Democrats' 2012 successes. This mismatch leaves the base spoiling for fights that can't actually be won: House Republicans have just enough real power to raise conservative expectations but not nearly enough to bend a liberal president and a Democratic Senate to their will.
Boehner's job, then, requires constantly pushing hard enough to persuade his caucus that he's maximizing Republican leverage, while simultaneously looking for ways to make small, can-kicking deals at the last possible moment. Which he's always found, by hook or by crook: there was no government shutdown in the spring of 2011, no debt default that summer, and the fiscal cliff was averted (at least temporarily) last week.
The fact that all these crises have been resolved at the 11th hour, amid persistent brinkmanship and repeated near-death moments for his speakership, isn't a sign that he's a failure. Instead, given the correlation of forces he's dealing with, this is what success looks like. (For a glimpse of the alternative, just imagine rerunning the last two years with Newt Gingrich in the speaker's chair.)
You might say that this is no way to run a government. I'd agree. But the nation's polarization and his party's dysfunction are beyond a speaker's ability to undo. As Democrats learned across the 1970s and '80s, the House is a poor base from which to rebuild a national party. Nobody blames Tip O'Neill or Jim Wright for failing to do what Bill Clinton and Barack Obama ultimately achieved. And anyone who thinks that Boehner would transform the Republican Party for the better by, say, resigning his leadership position and excoriating his colleagues should watch fewer Aaron Sorkin shows.
No, the way out of our predicament is through the ballot box, not the speaker's office. Either Democrats need to consolidate their advantages and win back the House or Republicans need to find a way to start winning national elections again, at which point the current impasse will be broken and policy will tilt more clearly toward the left or right.
Until then, we're stuck with the cycle of brinkmanship -- another debt-ceiling debate, another shutdown possibility, the spending portion of the fiscal cliff.
It would probably be better to call the whole thing off and accept that the fiscal picture won't change much in two years. But if we're going to go through it again, I'm glad that the speaker who prevented dysfunction from producing disaster last time is around to try again.

HEADLINE: More Risk-Taking, Less Poll-Taking

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
THE U.S. military trains its fighter pilots on a principle called the ''OODA Loop.'' It stands for observe, orient, decide, act. The idea is that if your OODA Loop is faster and more accurate than the other pilot's, you'll shoot his plane out of the sky. If the other pilot's OODA Loop is better, he'll shoot you down. Right now, our national OODA Loop is broken. We're are doing something crazy -- taking the country back and forth to the financial brink to produce suboptimal, midnight compromises without any overall plan for how this will lead to growth in the world in which we're living. We're doing the worst thing a country can do -- cutting taxes and spending without a plan. Maybe you can grow without a plan. But if you want to ensure that every scarce dollar gets the biggest bang, you can't cut without a plan. It's deciding and acting without observing and orienting. It's how fighter pilots get shot down. 
President Obama, by his own admission, focused his campaign almost exclusively on the need to raise taxes on the wealthy, and the Republicans focused theirs on lowering them. But neither one offered the country what we need most: a description of what world we're living in, what is new, and how we maximize our ability to compete and grow in this world -- and then offering up a comprehensive, detailed plan of appropriate phased-in spending cuts, tax reforms and investments in research, infrastructure and early childhood education to create more good jobs and the workers to fill them.
What world are we living in? It's a world in which we face three major challenges: responding to the merger of globalization and the information technology revolution, which is changing every job and workplace; dealing with our mounting debt and entitlement burdens, driven by steadily rising health care costs and unsustainable defined benefits; and, finally, developing energy sources that can grow the world economy without tipping it into disruptive climate change. (At one point last week, the Senate approved a $60.4 billion aid package to help New York and New Jersey recover from Hurricane Sandy. If fully implemented, that would mean we'd spend on one storm all the new tax revenue for next year that the House and Senate just agreed to in the fiscal-cliff negotiations.)
What each party should be saying is, ''Given this world, here are the specific tax reforms, spending cuts, investments and policy innovations we need to grow our middle class, sustain our retirees and shrink inequality.'' Instead, we have no leaders ready to trust the public with the truth, so both parties are shooting themselves in the foot and our future in the head. As Matt Miller, author of ''The Tyranny of Dead Ideas'' noted in The Washington Post, ''Republicans haven't identified anything remotely equal to the savings we need. And because many liberals haven't thought through the long-term budget implications, or wrongly assume that taxes can rise indefinitely or that the Pentagon can be shrunk to something less than a triangle, they resist sensible steps to slow the growth of Social Security and Medicare, not realizing that this course will assure before long that there isn't any new money to spend on, say, poor children.''
I expect nothing from the G.O.P. It's lost and leaderless. I expect a lot from Obama, who knows what needs to be done and has said so in the past. I expect him to stop acting as a party leader and start acting like the president of the whole country. When I heard Obama say, after the election, that this time he was going to take his plan to the country, and not make the mistake again of just negotiating with Congress, I thought, ''Great, I can't wait to hear what he says.'' But all he took to the country was a plan for increasing taxes on ''millionaires and billionaires.'' There was nothing comprehensive, nothing bold, no great journey for America and no risks for him. Really disappointing.
Maybe Obama has a strategy: First raise taxes on the wealthy, which gives him the credibility with his base to then make big spending cuts in the next round of negotiations. Could be. But raising taxes on the wealthy is easy. Now we're at the hard part: comprehensive tax reform, entitlement cuts, radical cost-saving approaches to health care and new investments in our growth engines. This will require taking things away from people -- to both save and invest. A lot of lobbies will fight it. The president will need to rally the center of the country and the business community to overcome them. He'll have to change the polls, not just read the polls. He will have to take on his own base and the G.O.P.'s.
Obama has spent a lot of time lately bashing the rich to pay their ''fair share.'' You know what? There are definitely some Wall Street bankers and C.E.O.'s who deserve that bashing. But there are many successful Americans who got their wealth the old-fashioned way -- by risk-taking, going into debt to start a business or pursue a dream. It's time for the president to do some risk-taking -- to stop just hammering the wealthy, which is so easy, and to start selling the country on a strategy to multiply them. We need to tax more millionaires, but we also need more millionaires and middle classes to tax. The president was elected to grow our national pie, not just re-divide it.

HEADLINE: Germany, for Decades a Pacifist Power, Faces the Need to Play a Military Role

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS KULISH; Chris Cottrell and Victor Homola contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BERLIN -- When Chancellor Angela Merkel hosted a recent reception for military families, she greeted parents, wives and children whose loved ones were spending their holidays in Afghanistan, Lebanon, Kosovo and off the Horn of Africa. German deployments overseas, Ms. Merkel said, ''will soon encompass the entire globe.''
On that same wintry afternoon, members of Parliament debated whether to add to the nearly 6,000 German troops currently serving abroad by sending up to 400 soldiers to Turkey, where they would operate two Patriot missile batteries to help protect their NATO ally from a potential escalation of the civil war across the border in Syria.
''For decades, we Germans have benefited from the fact that our partners gave us the feeling of reliable security,'' Thomas de Maizière, Germany's defense minister, said during the debate last month. ''Now we are in a position and have the duty, even, to make our impact felt.'' 
Only a handful of shivering protesters passed out fliers in front of the Brandenburg Gate opposing the deployment. The vote easily passed in the Parliament two days later.
It was not that long ago that every German military action brought with it mass demonstrations, public hand-wringing and probing questions about the country's militarist past. But the shadow of history continues to recede here and Germany is, for better or worse, quietly approaching a normal relationship with its armed forces.
For the past three years, Europe has been preoccupied with economic issues as the debt crisis threatened to sunder the euro currency union. But strategic military questions cannot be ignored indefinitely. The United States is increasingly shifting its focus to the Asia-Pacific region and reducing the number of troops stationed in Europe.
''Europe has more responsibility for its own security, and Germany has to step up to that, particularly considering its new economic power in Europe,'' said Constanze Stelzenmüller, senior fellow at the German Marshall Fund in Berlin.
Conscription was suspended indefinitely here in 2011 as part of a drive to professionalize and modernize the armed forces. In August, the Constitutional Court ruled for the first time that the German military could be deployed at home under exceptional circumstances, like in the wake of a terrorist attack.
''Naturally, a great deal has developed further in terms of the acceptance of deployments outside of this country and outside the NATO territory,'' said Col. Ulrich Kirsch, chairman of the German Federal Armed Forces Association, which represents the interests of active and former military personnel. ''But the Germans are, now as before, difficult to inspire for military operations.''
Military business is another matter. Germany is the world's third-biggest arms exporter, behind only the United States and Russia, sending weapons not only to NATO members and allies like Israel but increasingly to the Middle East and beyond. As the business grows, critics at home question sales to undemocratic countries like Saudi Arabia.
Germany's military industry employs an estimated 80,000 people, jobs Ms. Merkel wants to protect, especially less than a year before September's parliamentary election. In October, German opposition helped doom the proposed merger of two aerospace giants, British-based BAE Systems and the consortium EADS, in part out of concern that German jobs and influence might be lost in the new entity.
Last month Der Spiegel, the influential newsmagazine, showed a grim-faced Ms. Merkel on the cover in a camouflage suit jacket with the headline ''German Weapons for the World.'' The magazine described the Merkel doctrine as deploying fewer German troops to conflict zones and instead strengthening partners by selling them arms. The German government approved military exports in excess of 10 billion euros, or over $13 billion, for the first time in 2011, the magazine reported.
That is an especially impressive feat considering that military expenditures in Western and Central Europe fell 1.9 percent in real terms that year, according to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute. Those cuts have ''prompted unease in many quarters that European countries risk losing global influence as they fall further behind the United States in military capabilities,'' the institute said in its most recent annual report on military spending, ''while rising powers such as China rapidly catch up and even overtake them.''
Germany's path forward could well determine the shape of Europe's military affairs for years to come. Whether that is through a growing leadership role and the assumption of more responsibility for regional security or a limited, some say cynical, emphasis on protecting its own interests still remains to be seen.
''Germany is back in the game as one of the most important countries in the Western Hemisphere, but the kind of responsibility that goes with that is not really reflected in German government behavior,'' said Olaf Böhnke, head of the Berlin office of the European Council on Foreign Relations. ''If Germany wants to be in a leadership position, you need stronger military engagement.''
German troops have been in Afghanistan for more than a decade, but mostly restricted to the safer northern part of the country. The Bundeswehr, Germany's army, sent its first Tiger attack helicopters to Afghanistan in December. On Tuesday the army announced that it had not suffered a single fatality in 2012 in Afghanistan.
''This conflict-averse basic attitude still remains, and one has to deal with it,'' said Martin Kahl, a political scientist at the Institute for Peace Research and Security Policy at the University of Hamburg. ''People feel safer than before. There is no enemy on the European continent who could lead a classic conflict.''
After World War II, West German politicians rejected military force for any goal other than self-defense, and a strong pacifist streak developed in the public. The end of the cold war brought the beginning of a long period of halting change. Allies, particularly in the United States, have repeatedly called for Germany to take more responsibility and a larger share of the burden.
''I don't think it's healthy for the future of Europe to give Germany this refuge where Germany handles the economy and doesn't have to deal with the dirty stuff,'' Mr. Böhnke said.
The biggest turning point was probably when Germany participated in airstrikes in the Kosovo war in 1999, a break with the taboo against offensive operations.
Even as Germany exports arms around the world, idealism about the use of force by German soldiers remains. In May 2010, Germany's president, Horst Köhler, gave an interview to German public radio saying that society needed to recognize the sacrifices and contributions of the military. A broader political discussion was necessary, Mr. Köhler said, about the military's role.
''A country of our size,'' Mr. Köhler said, ''with its focus on exports and thus reliance on foreign trade, must be aware that military deployments are necessary in an emergency to protect our interests, for example, when it comes to trade routes, for example, when it comes to preventing regional instabilities that could negatively influence our trade, jobs and incomes.''
A public outcry ensued, and Mr. Köhler resigned. But the German Navy was essentially already doing what Mr. Köhler described in his comments, as part of the multinational mission to combat piracy off the coast of Somalia. The government announced plans to suspend conscription just a few months after Mr. Köhler quit.
Parliament made it official in 2011, toppling in the process another of the remaining hurdles between Germany and a normal military.
''The suspension of conscription officially recognized the fact that the German Army had become a professional army,'' said Ms. Stelzenmüller from the German Marshall Fund. ''These are people who get paid for putting themselves in harm's way, just like other Western armies.''

HEADLINE: As Biofuel Demand Grows, So Do Guatemala's Hunger Pangs

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL; Mike McDonald contributed reporting.

 BODY:
GUATEMALA CITY -- In the tiny tortillerias of this city, people complain ceaselessly about the high price of corn. Just three years ago, one quetzal -- about 15 cents -- bought eight tortillas; today it buys only four. And eggs have tripled in price because chickens eat corn feed.
Meanwhile, in rural areas, subsistence farmers struggle to find a place to sow their seeds. On a recent morning, José Antonio Alvarado was harvesting his corn crop on the narrow median of Highway 2 as trucks zoomed by.
''We're farming here because there is no other land, and I have to feed my family,'' said Mr. Alvarado, pointing to his sons Alejandro and José, who are 4 and 6 but appear to be much younger, a sign of chronic malnutrition. 
Recent laws in the United States and Europe that mandate the increasing use of biofuel in cars have had far-flung ripple effects, economists say, as land once devoted to growing food for humans is now sometimes more profitably used for churning out vehicle fuel.
In a globalized world, the expansion of the biofuels industry has contributed to spikes in food prices and a shortage of land for food-based agriculture in poor corners of Asia, Africa and Latin America because the raw material is grown wherever it is cheapest.
Nowhere, perhaps, is that squeeze more obvious than in Guatemala, which is ''getting hit from both sides of the Atlantic,'' in its fields and at its markets, said Timothy Wise, a Tufts University development expert who is studying the problem globally with Actionaid, a policy group based in Washington that focuses on poverty.
With its corn-based diet and proximity to the United States, Central America has long been vulnerable to economic riptides related to the United States' corn policy. Now that the United States is using 40 percent of its crop to make biofuel, it is not surprising that tortilla prices have doubled in Guatemala, which imports nearly half of its corn.
At the same time, Guatemala's lush land, owned by a handful of families, has proved ideal for producing raw materials for biofuels. Suchitepéquez Province, a major corn-producing region five years ago, is now carpeted with sugar cane and African palm. The field Mr. Alvarado used to rent for his personal corn crop now grows sugar cane for a company that exports bioethanol to Europe.
In a country where most families must spend about two thirds of their income on food, ''the average Guatemalan is now hungrier because of biofuel development,'' said Katja Winkler, a researcher at Idear, a Guatemalan nonprofit organization that studies rural issues. Roughly 50 percent of the nation's children are chronically malnourished, the fourth-highest rate in the world, according to the United Nations.
The American renewable fuel standard mandates that an increasing volume of biofuel be blended into the nation's vehicle fuel supply each year to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels and to bolster the nation's energy security. Similarly, by 2020, transportation fuels in Europe will have to contain 10 percent biofuel.
Large companies like Pantaleon Sugar Holdings, Guatemala's leading sugar producer, are profiting from that new demand, with recent annual growth of more than 30 percent. The Inter-American Development Bank says the new industry could bring an infusion of cash and jobs to Guatemala's rural economy if developed properly. For now, the sugar industry directly provides 60,000 jobs and the palm industry 17,000, although the plantations are not labor-intensive.
But many worry that Guatemala's poor are already suffering from the diversion of food to fuel. ''There are pros and cons to biofuel, but not here,'' said Misael Gonzáles of C.U.C., a labor union for Guatemala's farmers. ''These people don't have enough to eat. They need food. They need land. They can't eat biofuel, and they don't drive cars.''
In 2011, corn prices would have been 17 percent lower if the United States did not subsidize and give incentives for biofuel production with its renewable fuel policies, according to an analysis by Bruce A. Babcock, an agricultural economist at Iowa State University. The World Bank has suggested that biofuel mandates in the developed world should be adjusted when food is short or prices are inordinately high.
Concerned about the effects of its biofuel mandate on world hunger, the European Commission recently proposed amending its policy so that only half of its 2020 target could be met by using biofuels made from food crops or those grown on land previously devoted to food crops.
The current American mandate, established in 2007 by Congress, can be waived by the Environmental Protection Agency, but, according to law, such adjustments focus on domestic issues like cases in which biofuel ''requirements would severely harm the economy of a state, a region or the United States,'' the agency said in an e-mail when asked for comment.
Once nearly self-sufficient in corn production, Guatemala became more dependent on imports in the 1990s as a surplus of subsidized American corn flowed south. Guatemalan farmers could not compete, and corn production dropped roughly 30 percent per capita from 1995 to 2005, Mr. Wise said.
But cheap imports disappeared once the United States started using corn to fulfill its 2007 biofuels standards. ''The use of maize to make biofuel has led to these crazy prices,'' said Guy Gauvreau, head of the United Nations World Food Program in Guatemala. It ''is not ethically acceptable,'' he added.
In part because the agency's primary food supplement is a mix of corn and soy, it cannot afford to help all of the Guatemalan children in need, Mr. Gauvreau said; it is agency policy to buy corn locally, but there is no extra corn grown here anymore. And Guatemalans cannot go back to the land because so much of it is being devoted to growing crops for biofuel. (Almost no biofuel is used domestically.)
The southwestern village of La Ayuda is now an island of rickety dwellings in the middle of a giant African palm plantation. Félix Pérez, 51, used to grow corn, beans and fruit behind his home. He now walks about three miles to a cheap hillside plot that he rents for four months of the year. ''Every day it's more difficult to survive since we live off the land, and there's less and less,'' he said.
Although African palm was practically nonexistent in Guatemala two decades ago, palm oil is now the country's third-largest export, after sugar and bananas, with exports rising by more than a third in 2011, according to United Nations trade statistics.
Although Susana Siekavizza, executive director of Grepalma, the local industry association, said that Guatemalan palm is currently exported for cooking oil, the high prices that it commands reflect heightened global demand for a crop also used in biofuel. It is exported in a raw form that can be distilled into biofuel in the receiving country, and Ms. Siekavizza said there was ''interest'' in manufacturing fuel in Guatemala.
Production of sugar cane, long a mainstay Guatemalan crop, has also skyrocketed as biofuels opened new market opportunities. Pantaleon Sugar Holdings, which once exported only food products, now uses 13 percent of its production for fuel. Local sugar prices have doubled.
For Guatemala's largest landowners, long-term leases with large biofuel companies are more profitable and easier to manage than cattle ranching or renting to subsistence farmers.
In small towns like San Basilio, representatives of one palm company are pressing farmers to lease their fields.
''I'm trying not to because I need that land to grow corn,'' said one farmer, Gilberto Galindo Morales, 46. But he added that farming has become difficult as nearby plantations divert and deplete rivers to feed industrial-scale irrigation systems. Ash from burning cane fields after harvest also damages his corn crop and irritates his children's lungs, he said.
With sometimes violent confrontations over land and labor, plantation gates are secured with armed guards. Still, Ms. Siekavizza of the trade group contends that the belief that palm cultivation is robbing people of food is ''more myth than reality'' since much of Guatemala's terrain and soil composition ''is not well suited to growing corn.''
In the remote Mayan villages in the north of the country, the incursion of plantations has brought a few good jobs and some training, but many complain of low wages and the backbreaking nature of the work, which mostly involves picking the small red fruits from African palm trees or off the ground. ''We sold our land, so now we have to work, but I think it's better when you grow your own,'' said Juana Paula Tec Choc in the village of El Cancellero. ''At least then you have some security.''
A report last year by the United States Department of Agriculture noted Guatemala's potential for biofuel production, saying that palm plantations tended to be on ''underutilized'' agricultural land and applied no dangerous pesticides to the trees; that assessment could be important for getting palm-based fuel approved for use in the United States.
But villagers in El Cancellero disputed that, saying they suspected chemical poisoning was behind the mysterious deaths of four young children last year. On a recent afternoon, a crop duster buzzed overhead, and workers wearing tanks fitted with spray hoses trudged along a narrow road that separates what remains of the village from endless rows of squat palms.

HEADLINE: Looking for a Jump-Start in China

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
BEIJING
HERE is my prediction about China: The new paramount leader, Xi Jinping, will spearhead a resurgence of economic reform, and probably some political easing as well. Mao's body will be hauled out of Tiananmen Square on his watch, and Liu Xiaobo, the Nobel Peace Prize-winning writer, will be released from prison.
These won't happen immediately -- Xi won't even be named president until March -- and I may be wrong entirely. But my hunch on this return to China, my old home, is that change is coming. 
Here's my case for Xi as a reformer.
First, it's in his genes. His father, Xi Zhongxun, was a pioneer of economic restructuring and publicly denounced the massacre of pro-democracy protesters in 1989. Xi's mother chooses to live in Shenzhen, the most capitalist enclave in the country.
Xi is also one of the first Chinese leaders to send a child to the United States as an undergraduate. His daughter is a junior at Harvard, reflecting her parents' emphasis on learning English and their admiration for American education.
It helps that the bar is low for Xi: he follows President Hu Jintao, who is widely regarded in China as a failure. Even government ministers complain that he squandered his 10 years as leader. Today there is pent-up demand for change.
President Hu, who always reads speeches from texts, is a robot who surrounds himself with robots. One such robot aide is Ling Jihua, whose 23-year-old son was driving a Ferrari one night last March with two half-naked women as passengers. The car crashed on a Beijing road, killing the young man and badly injuring the women, one of whom later died.
Ling feared a scandal and reportedly began a cover-up. He went to the morgue, according to the account I got from one Chinese official, and looked at the body -- and then coldly denied that it was his son. He continued to work in the following weeks as if nothing had happened. The cover-up failed, and the episode underscored all that was wrong with the old leadership: the flaunting of dubious wealth, the abuse of power and the lack of any heart.
Xi is trying to send a message that he is different. His first act upon becoming Communist Party general secretary in November was to replicate a famous ''southern tour'' by Deng Xiaoping in 1992 that revived economic reforms. Xi and his team have also startled officials by telling them to stop reading empty speeches at meetings.
Another good sign: I hear that Wang Yang, a reformist who has been the party chief in Guangdong Province and is perhaps the single most capable leader in China today, will be named a vice premier in March.
The new leaders would probably prefer to accelerate economic change while minimizing political relaxation, but that is increasingly difficult as China develops an educated, worldly and self-confident middle class. Over the years, most of China's neighbors -- from Taiwan to Mongolia, South Korea to Thailand -- have become more democratic, and now even Myanmar is joining the parade. How can mighty China be more backward than Myanmar?
For 25 years, I've regularly been visiting my wife's ancestral village in the Taishan area of southern China. At first, the villagers were semiliterate and isolated, but now their world has been transformed. On this visit, we dropped by a farmhouse where a former peasant was using the Internet to trade stocks on his laptop. His daughter is in college, and he watches Hong Kong television on a big screen.
People like him are ever harder to control or manipulate, and they're steamed at China's worsening corruption. A couple of decades ago, a friend who is a son of a Politburo member was paid several hundred thousand dollars a year to lend his name to a Chinese company so that it could get cheap land from local governments. These days, the family members of leaders can rake in billions of dollars over time.
The 70 richest delegates to China's National People's Congress have a collective net worth of almost $90 billion, Bloomberg News reported. That's more than 10 times the collective net worth of the entire American Congress.
Granted, there is evidence to counter my optimistic take. Most troubling, the authorities are cracking down on the Internet. That's a great leap backward, but I am skeptical that it will be sustained. Right now a fascinating test case is unfolding: a senior propaganda official censored a New Year's message in a major Guangdong newspaper, and now journalists are publicly demanding that he be fired. Stay tuned.
Xi is also more nationalistic than President Hu, and I worry that a confrontation with Japan over disputed islands could escalate out of control -- in which case all bets are off.
Still, the pre-eminent story of our time is the rise of China. For the last decade it has been hobbled by the failed leadership of President Hu. I'm betting that in the coming 10 years of Xi's reign, China will come alive again.

HEADLINE: MacLaine's Next Life

BYLINE: By DAVE ITZKOFF

 BODY:
AS if the impending nuptials of Lady Mary and Matthew Crawley, not to mention all the social and economic upheaval of the early 1920s, were not enough to set servants scurrying and sherry glasses crashing in the decorous halls of ''Downton Abbey,'' that period drama is getting one more shock to its system when its third season begins Sunday on PBS's ''Masterpiece.'' This year Shirley MacLaine joins its cast as Martha Levinson, the mother of Cora, Countess of Grantham (Elizabeth McGovern), who arrives from America bringing a tart tongue and liberal attitudes unfamiliar to her daughter's aristocratic household. 
As surely as Martha's unusual sense of propriety affronts some longtime Downton residents -- particularly the prim Dowager Countess, Violet (Maggie Smith) -- Ms. MacLaine, an Oscar winner for ''Terms of Endearment'' and a star of films like ''The Apartment,'' ''Steel Magnolias'' and ''Bernie,'' has lived her life with a similar spirit of irreverence and nonchalance. As this exuberant 78-year-old actress demonstrated in a recent telephone conversation from her home in Los Angeles, there is nothing that she places off-limits, from her views on sexuality to her ideas about mysticism and reincarnation -- at least, once she got her iPhone working. Here are excerpts from the interview:
Q. Hi, Ms. MacLaine?
A. Oh, hi, one second. I'm just trying to learn my new iPhone. [Laughs] I'm trying my best to be technological, in a rather colorful, poetic world I am used to living in.
Q. They're very user-friendly.
A. No, they're not. But I am.
Q. This feels like a perfect segue to talk about life in the early 20th century.
A. Oh my God, wasn't that something? Going into that world, with those people who really seem to be living it. I didn't know ''Downton Abbey.'' I learned about it at my hairdresser. Really. I look at PBS for news.
Q. Do you make all your career choices based on what your hairdresser says?
A. I don't ask him for advice. But all the girls were talking about it. They were trying to figure out who was Elizabeth McGovern's mother, and whether she was a Rothschild, whether she was Jewish. The next thing I knew I got a call from my agent about playing Elizabeth McGovern's mother. I'd better look at this. And whoa -- I got addicted for a full week.
Q. What about the show hooked you in?
A. I realized that Julian [Fellowes, the ''Downton Abbey'' creator and producer] had either purposely or inadvertently stumbled on a formula for quality television in the Internet age. Which means there are, what, 15 or so lives and subplots, with which not too much time is spent so you don't get bored, but enough time is spent so you are vitally interested.
Q. Is that why you agreed to meet with Julian Fellowes?
A. I think I wanted to meet Bates [played by Brendan Coyle], basically. And of course Julian, being so wily, arranged a lunch at which nobody else was there but Bates. I guess he was seeing if he was cougar-able. Or something.
Q. When you're going up against Maggie Smith -- there's one scene where you serenade her a bit -- how do you prepare?
A. I thought the best course of action in going toe to toe with Maggie would be a sense of American expressive feeling. What does she do with that? I told her I was going to sing it, and first she said to me, [genteel Maggie Smith voice] ''You know, dear, when you do that, I'm going to fall off the chair.'' I said, O.K. And then she said, ''No, I think not. I think I'll fall asleep.'' I said, O.K., that's good too. And then she said, ''No, I think I will cry.'' I said, I don't know what you'd do that for, but whatever. What she did instead was flirt back. [Laughs] I was so surprised.
The day we shot in the church, when we're all done up in our white fur, we sat there all day. And Maggie and I don't like to get up and walk around a lot anymore. So we sat and we reminisced about life and lovers and the business and directors. That was really interesting and so much fun.
Q. When you're comparing lists of lovers, did you find any names in common?
A. Oh! No. She never really used names. When we were doing a press conference here, someone asked me if I had known Maggie before. And I said, ''Oh, yes, we were lovers in another life.'' [Laughs] I don't know where that came from.
Q. Do you genuinely believe that?
A. How the hell do you know? Listen, since I don't know where it came from, maybe it's true. I have no idea.
Q. You seem to have better antennas for these transcendental experiences.
A. Yeah, comedic metaphysics. That's the way I think of it right now.
Q. But in the course of working on a show like this, where you get to inhabit another time period, the setting, the costumes ----
A. No, I didn't have any familiarity at all. I didn't feel that at all. I was more interested in the buttons and whether they were popping open, and rain in my face. That, I have come to call reality. But how do I know I'm right? When you look at it, my goodness, I can't prove that we're all alive right now. It could be an illusion as far as I'm concerned. That's the stuff that interests me: What is reality?
Q. Do you feel like you're more comfortable with yourself than others are with themselves?
A. Well, I'm not your run-of-the-mill lady from the Valley, am I? Come on, I've got lots of reasons to be viewed eccentrically.
Q. You're O.K. being described that way?
A. As long as they don't do it with a hidden meaning. Right now I would call General Petraeus the most eccentric man I know. Who the hell would admit that and then resign? Q. You think he should have confessed his affair but not resigned his position?
A. I think he should have done neither. And gone ahead and done what everybody else was doing and enjoying his life.
Q. People aren't comfortable with sexual lives that deviate from the norm.
A. I don't know what the norm is. The latest evaluations on human sexuality say that we are one-third monogamous, one-third serially monogamous and one-third polygamous. I would say there should be some kind of form to fill out before you promise monogamy.
Q. Do I dare ask which category you put yourself in?
A. Serially monogamous, that's what I was.
Q. Meaning, while you're with someone, you're faithful to that person?
A. Yeah, till it wears off. [Laughs]
Q. Where do you find the time to act and still write a new book every few years?
A. I've learned as I've gotten older to not strive anymore. That doesn't mean giving up. It means surrendering to a more wise truth. I don't plan anything. I just sit down, and it all just happens. I don't know if it's any good but that's the way I act too.
I'm going into this picture [''Elsa & Fred''] with Christopher Plummer. I have no idea what I'm going to do, I really don't. Christopher and I have worked together before, so we're friends. But I don't like leading out the actors and the director by being so prepared that I'd be thrown by their reality. Because I don't know anything about acting. Never have.
Q. You must come with some ideas.
A. Yeah, it's called the script.
Q. When you get offered all these roles where you're playing family matriarchs or grandmothers ----
A. How about the great-grandmother?
Q. Does it change the way you think about yourself?
A. Of course. The one thing I truly have a hard time believing is that I'm 78. I shan't say that I like everybody helping me down the stairs and out of my trailer. But it's nice to have 50 percent of them do it.
Q. Would you do live theater again?
A. I do miss the stage. There's nothing like it, nothing. When I did my one-woman show and played the Palace and played the Gershwin and all that, I did -- what? -- eight shows or maybe more a week. Of course you can't do anything else, and you can't run quickly for a cab in the rain, and you can't have a drunken love affair. You can't do any of that. Because you've got to be perfectly healthy. And I guess I value enjoying my life a little bit more than the discipline these days.

HEADLINE: In the Bronx, Restoring A Fleeting Paradise

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
Steven Smith stands on the refuse that, no matter what, always seems to regenerate in the South Bronx. Plastic soda bottles, soccer balls, a thermos and a faded life preserver poke out from under the wooden planks scattered on the eroded shores of the East River.
This is Oak Point, west of Hunts Point, a peninsula of perpetual reinvention.
Once home to colonial estates and a Cuban sugar importer, then a public beach, a railroad float yard, a city landfill during the Bronx's burning years, an illegal dumping ground tied to the mob, a proposed power plant and a jail, Oak Point, which Mr. Smith developed, now features a $60 million warehouse supplying food to bodegas and restaurants.
For three months the waterfront on the 28-acre site was also home to a wetland with verdant slopes and grassy marshes. Paradise in the Bronx. 
And then it was all lost: two years of planning, nine months of work, $1.5 million and three acres of wetlands washed away in a matter of hours by Hurricane Sandy's 13-foot storm surge. What remain are a few patches of marsh grass, a Charlie Brown-like evergreen and one lonely, weedy mound just below a concrete wall.
Mr. Smith has to rebuild. But how?
''This has to be done properly,'' he said, shaking his head. ''This is an environmental disaster. And you don't want to repeat this mistake again.''
Forgive Mr. Smith's passion. The shoreline destruction at Oak Point is not exactly on a scale with the Exxon Valdez oil spill, but the ruined habitat can provide a prism for the city's post-hurricane rebuilding concerns -- sustainability, resilience and economic development.
Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said last month that the city would examine different methods to fortify the coast, but he did not offer specifics. Before the storm, the city and its parks department began restoring 127 acres of wetlands throughout the city, while a complementary pilot project was planned to redevelop 10 acres of wetlands in hopes of spurring business along the shoreline.
Especially since Hurricane Katrina, scientists have debated the role of wetlands in storms. The vegetation can produce friction to slow down wave energy, but marine biologists say the amount of protection depends on the acreage, the location and the surrounding infrastructure. Not to mention the size of the storm.
At Oak Point, Mr. Smith reached an agreement with the State Department of Environmental Conservation: In exchange for developing the property, he would work with the agency to build wetlands. The purpose was to beautify the shoreline, create a haven for day-tripping birds coming from the North and South Brother Islands nearby, and stop silt or contaminants from seeping into the East River.
Kelly Risotto, whose Land Use Ecological Services designed the habitat, said that in addition to the sheer size of the storm, a reason the plantings were washed away was probably that they had not yet taken root -- the marsh grasses were already submerged as the storm approached. Ms. Risotto said her company, based in Medford on Long Island, would replant in the spring.
A spokeswoman for the Environmental Conservation Department said it was still evaluating plans for the wetlands.
Said Mr. Smith, ''It would be insanity to rebuild it exactly as we did.''
But S. Jeffress Williams, a scientist with the United States Geological Survey, said: ''The cost of the structures you need to prevent a 15-foot storm surge would be in the tens of millions of dollars. You get what you pay for.''
Mr. Smith, 59, is somewhat of a rare bird in the Bronx. Raised in a log cabin in Greenwood Lake, N.Y., he became an engineer for a Swiss power company wanting to build a plant on the abandoned garbage dump at Oak Point. When the company dropped its plans after the site's owners, Britestarr Homes, went bankrupt, Mr. Smith left his job and bought the property in 2002. He put himself in debt up to $60 million on the morning of his wedding. He signed the Oak Point deal in his tuxedo.
It took seven years to clean the 50-foot-high piles of trash dumped by Britestarr, which was investigated for its connections to John A. Gotti, son of the former Gambino crime boss. Mr. Smith found no bodies in the trash heap, he said, but five handguns. He paid off Britestarr's debts and rented land to landscapers and construction firms.
After his own proposal to build a power plant on the site was defeated, he joined Hunts Point neighbors in opposing a city-proposed jail. Then Mr. Smith sold 12 acres to Jetro Holdings, a national food distribution company, for $25 million in 2010. Jetro's warehouse now serves restaurants and neighborhood markets across the city, offering an array of fresh and frozen foods, packaged goods and alcohol.
Kellie Terry-Sepulveda, the executive director of the Point, a Hunts Point group for youth programs and economic development, said that after a decade of proposals for Oak Point, she was pleased with Mr. Smith's shoreline plan. ''Oftentimes developers here take the road that will make the most money,'' she said. ''That's what special about Steve's project: it was an added value, something that was looking to help the environment.''
Mr. Smith, who lives on wetlands in Brick, N.J., hired graduates of a job-training program from Sustainable South Bronx, another local nonprofit organization, to plant trees and shrubs. One graduate, Devorah Gross, 56, worked eight-hour shifts for six weeks this summer planting sumac, river birch, roses for the bees, juniper berries for the birds. She was thrilled to see the ecosystem transformed, and was crushed when Mr. Smith sent her pictures after the storm.
''Oh, 'sad' is an understatement,'' Ms. Gross said. ''It broke my heart. We worked so hard and we were so happy to see wildlife coming back in a positive mode. We were starting to see baby fish and crab and swans and ducks.''
Ms. Gross said she could see the marsh grasses grasping oil from the water, acting like a filter. ''It was such an education,'' she said.
The project had two components. Mr. Smith removed the decaying wood bulkheads and other debris from the former float yard -- where railroads brought in freight cars by boat -- but kept three existing piers. Inland, he expanded the intertidal marsh wetlands, formed three beaches and brought in 6,000 yards of sand as a foundation.
On the remaining two acres, he made a buffer habitat of shrubs, trees and grasses. On the corner of the peninsula, where currents had converged for centuries, he persuaded the state to approve of piling boulders in a riprap. Those remained after the storm, as did the mile-long, 15-foot-high cast-concrete wall lining the property to prevent flooding.
Based on what survived, Mr. Smith advocates rebuilding by integrating, or layering, hard and soft materials.
He has a wider vision, though, beyond the waterfront, for his remaining 13 acres. He plans a three-level ''food campus'' for a wholesale farmers' market for New York State growers, a rooftop greenhouse, a kitchen incubator and public space overlooking the water. In December, Oak Point's second phase (projected at $80 million) received a $400,000 economic development grant from Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo.
Mr. Smith also wants to have an information kiosk on the property, displaying the rusty handguns and the quartz sandstone rocks he excavated, and perhaps showing his time-lapse video of the initial wetlands project. For that purpose, he bought from the old rail yards a New Haven Line caboose, now sitting on makeshift tracks. Mr. Smith wants someone to refashion it.
''You know that show, 'Pimp My Ride'?'' he said, referring to the former MTV series. ''I want to find someone to 'Pimp My Caboose,' '' he said with a laugh.
The property, like the borough these days, is undergoing a makeover. ''On the tomb of the old Bronx, we're building the new Bronx,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Knowing Every Breath You Take

BYLINE: By MIRABAI BUSH

 BODY:
IN 1972, I was a 30-year-old American traveling in India, with the smell of incense in my hair and mantras repeating in my ears. Back then, if you had told me that I would someday be training employees of corporate America to apply contemplative practices to help them become more successful, I would have said you'd been standing too long in India's hot noonday sun.
Yet not long ago, I was standing in front of employees at Google in Mountain View, Calif. They were dutifully following my instructions to feel the sensations of their breath as it passed in and out of their nostrils, and learning how to send e-mail mindfully, by taking three deep breaths before hitting ''send.'' 
I am a co-founder of the Center for Contemplative Mind in Society, a nonprofit organization that is now 16 years old, and we have undertaken a daunting task: to convince people in their workplaces that the simple meditation techniques developed 2,500 years ago by the Buddha might help increase productivity, reduce absenteeism and inspire greater creativity. We have introduced contemplative exercises that can reduce stress and heart rate and increase attention and awareness of self and others. We teach what we call ''mindful listening,'' so that a speaker is fully heard.
For our first project, we chose a large corporation in the Midwest whose C.E.O. knew one of our board members. We created a three-day, mostly silent retreat off site.
I encountered workers who were exhausted, overworked and stressed. They were curious whether these practices could help, but also skeptical. Before the retreat, several people said, in effect: ''Stress got me where I am. I don't want to lose my edge.''
I thought to myself: This won't be easy; maybe they won't even attend.
But they all showed up. First, I asked them to lie on the floor for a deep-relaxation exercise. They didn't balk; instead, they followed my instructions to let go and relax their bodies. We also introduced mindfulness meditation, which we believe builds attention and insight and helps people become more kind and loving. We taught the practice of bringing our minds to our breath, noticing our breath, and returning to our breath each time the mind wanders off -- a task that's tougher than it sounds.
''This is the hardest thing I've ever done,'' said the C.E.O., who had a brilliant mind and thousands of employees. But the participants learned how to bring their minds to a place that was calm and clear, a great place to begin thinking and making decisions. When it was over, all felt that it was helpful.
SINCE that first foray into the corporate world, we have worked with many other organizations. For a small group, we have had a big reach, working with high-profile organizations like Yale Law School, Hearst Publications and the Army. We've offered programs as diverse as one-hour introductions, four-day intensive retreats, and courses with six weekly sessions.
At first, resistance was everywhere, but so were the possibilities. A litigation lawyer thought that if he became more compassionate toward the opposition in his cases, he couldn't be a zealous advocate for clients. But he found that being calm, clear and compassionate gave him better insights and better timing.
An environmental leader thought that if others knew he practiced meditation, they wouldn't take him seriously -- and would write him off as a tree-hugger without scientific rigor. Instead, he found that he became more resilient, and less overwhelmed by climate-change predictions, and that he collaborated better with colleagues.
Magazine editors thought that they would miss deadlines; in fact, they learned to focus on priorities and work better in teams to meet the deadlines in new ways. Data-driven Google engineers questioned the value of developing capacities that can't be quantified, but many of them learned better ways to communicate. One engineer told me his wife had noticed a change in the way he listened to her. She asked him: ''What happened to you?''
As we continue exploring the benefits of mindfulness for work, scientists are researching the effects of the practices on the brain. Neuroscientists have confirmed much of what we were experiencing: that meditation improves attention, reduces stress hormones, increases appreciation and compassion for others and helps us recover faster from negative information.
Personally, this work has made me feel more connected to the world. Watching the responses of so many people -- from an economics professor to Army soldiers -- I've come to believe that it's a basic human need to be calm and clear, to be aware of ourselves and others, to be kind and collaborative, to be fully present in each moment.
It turns out that people work better when they are happy and feel aligned with their work. I know I do.

HEADLINE: Health Insurers Raise Some Rates By Double Digits

BYLINE: By REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Health insurance companies across the country are seeking and winning double-digit increases in premiums for some customers, even though one of the biggest objectives of the Obama administration's health care law was to stem the rapid rise in insurance costs for consumers.
Particularly vulnerable to the high rates are small businesses and people who do not have employer-provided insurance and must buy it on their own.
In California, Aetna is proposing rate increases of as much as 22 percent, Anthem Blue Cross 26 percent and Blue Shield of California 20 percent for some of those policy holders, according to the insurers' filings with the state for 2013. These rate requests are all the more striking after a 39 percent rise sought by Anthem Blue Cross in 2010 helped give impetus to the law, known as the Affordable Care Act, which was passed the same year and will not be fully in effect until 2014.
In other states, like Florida and Ohio, insurers have been able to raise rates by at least 20 percent for some policy holders. The rate increases can amount to several hundred dollars a month. 
The proposed increases compare with about 4 percent for families with employer-based policies.
Under the health care law, regulators are now required to review any request for a rate increase of 10 percent or more; the requests are posted on a federal Web site, healthcare.gov, along with regulators' evaluations.
The review process not only reveals the sharp disparity in the rates themselves, it also demonstrates the striking difference between places like New York, one of the 37 states where legislatures have given regulators some authority to deny or roll back rates deemed excessive, and California, which is among the states that do not have that ability.
New York, for example, recently used its sweeping powers to hold rate increases for 2013 in the individual and small group markets to under 10 percent. California can review rate requests for technical errors but cannot deny rate increases.
The double-digit requests in some states are being made despite evidence that overall health care costs appear to have slowed in recent years, increasing in the single digits annually as many people put off treatment because of the weak economy. PricewaterhouseCoopers estimates that costs may increase just 7.5 percent next year, well below the rate increases being sought by some insurers. But the companies counter that medical costs for some policy holders are rising much faster than the average, suggesting they are in a sicker population. Federal regulators contend that premiums would be higher still without the law, which also sets limits on profits and administrative costs and provides for rebates if insurers exceed those limits.
Critics, like Dave Jones, the California insurance commissioner and one of two health plan regulators in that state, said that without a federal provision giving all regulators the ability to deny excessive rate increases, some insurance companies can raise rates as much as they did before the law was enacted.
''This is business as usual,'' Mr. Jones said. ''It's a huge loophole in the Affordable Care Act,'' he said.
While Mr. Jones has not yet weighed in on the insurers' most recent requests, he is pushing for a state law that will give him that authority. Without legislative action, the state can only question the basis for the high rates, sometimes resulting in the insurer withdrawing or modifying the proposed rate increase.
The California insurers say they have no choice but to raise premiums if their underlying medical costs have increased. ''We need these rates to even come reasonably close to covering the expenses of this population,'' said Tom Epstein, a spokesman for Blue Shield of California. The insurer is requesting a range of increases, which average about 12 percent for 2013.
Although rates paid by employers are more closely tracked than rates for individuals and small businesses, policy experts say the law has probably kept at least some rates lower than they otherwise would have been.
''There's no question that review of rates makes a difference, that it results in lower rates paid by consumers and small businesses,'' said Larry Levitt, an executive at the Kaiser Family Foundation, which estimated in an October report that rate review was responsible for lowering premiums for one out of every five filings.
Federal officials say the law has resulted in significant savings. ''The health care law includes new tools to hold insurers accountable for premium hikes and give rebates to consumers,'' said Brian Cook, a spokesman for Medicare, which is helping to oversee the insurance reforms.
''Insurers have already paid $1.1 billion in rebates, and rate review programs have helped save consumers an additional $1 billion in lower premiums,'' he said. If insurers collect premiums and do not spend at least 80 cents out of every dollar on care for their customers, the law requires them to refund the excess.
As a result of the review process, federal officials say, rates were reduced, on average, by nearly three percentage points, according to a report issued last September.
In New York, for example, state regulators recently approved increases that were much lower than insurers initially requested for 2013, taking into account the insurers' medical costs, how much money went to administrative expenses and profit and how exactly the companies were allocating costs among offerings. ''This is critical to holding down health care costs and holding insurance companies accountable,'' Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said.
While insurers in New York, on average, requested a 9.5 percent increase for individual policies, they were granted an increase of just 4.5 percent, according to the latest state averages, which have not yet been made public. In the small group market, insurers asked for an increase of 15.8 percent but received approvals averaging only 9.6 percent.
But many people elsewhere have experienced significant jumps in the premiums they pay. According to the federal analysis, 36 percent of the requests to raise rates by 10 percent or more were found to be reasonable. Insurers withdrew 12 percent of those requests, 26 percent were modified and another 26 percent were found to be unreasonable.
And, in some cases, consumer advocates say insurers have gone ahead and charged what regulators described as unreasonable rates because the state had no ability to deny the increases.
Two insurers cited by federal officials last year for raising rates excessively in nine states appear to have proceeded with their plans, said Carmen Balber, the Washington director for Consumer Watchdog, an advocacy group. While the publicity surrounding the rate requests may have drawn more attention to what the insurers were doing, regulators ''weren't getting any results by doing that,'' she said.
Some consumer advocates and policy experts say the insurers may be increasing rates for fear of charging too little, and they may be less afraid of having to refund some of the money than risk losing money.
Many insurance regulators say the high rates are caused by rising health care costs. In Iowa, for example, Wellmark Blue Cross Blue Shield, a nonprofit insurer, has requested a 12 to 13 percent increase for some customers. Susan E. Voss, the state's insurance commissioner, said there might not be any reason for regulators to deny the increase as unjustified. Last year, after looking at actuarial reviews, Ms. Voss approved a 9 percent increase requested by the same insurer.
''There's a four-letter word called math,'' Ms. Voss said, referring to the underlying medical costs that help determine what an insurer should charge in premiums. Health costs are rising, especially in Iowa, she said, where hospital mergers allow the larger systems to use their size to negotiate higher prices. ''It's justified.''
Some consumer advocates say the continued double-digit increases are a sign that the insurance industry needs to operate under new rules. Often, rates soar because insurers are operating plans that are closed to new customers, creating a pool of people with expensive medical conditions that become increasingly costly to insure.
While employers may be able to raise deductibles or co-payments as a way of reducing the cost of premiums, the insurer typically does not have that flexibility. And because insurers now take into account someone's health, age and sex in deciding how much to charge, and whether to offer coverage at all, people with existing medical conditions are frequently unable to shop for better policies.
In many of these cases, the costs are increasing significantly, and the rates therefore cannot be determined to be unreasonable. ''When you're allowed medical underwriting and to close blocks of business, rate review will not affect this,'' said Lynn Quincy, senior health policy analyst for Consumers Union.
The practice of medical underwriting -- being able to consider the health of a prospective policy holder before deciding whether to offer coverage and what rate to charge -- will no longer be permitted after 2014 under the health care law.

HEADLINE: Down-Home American, Korean Style

BYLINE: By JOHN ELIGON; Matthew Staver contributed reporting.

 BODY:
MINOT, N.D. -- Charlie's Main Street Cafe in the heart of downtown here is a monument to small-town Americana.
The menu offers down-home favorites: eggs and bacon, chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes, chicken noodle soup, vanilla ice cream and, yes, apple pie. Polished timber panels provide a log-cabin atmosphere. Framed black-and-white photos from generations past adorn the walls: carriage-style cars cruising down Main Street, baseball players in stirrups and knickers, President Dwight D. Eisenhower in a black top hat shaking a man's hand.
It is a gathering place for local leaders, and for residents to catch up on gossip.
This could well be a haunt on any idyllic American street corner. But Charlie's is a bit different. 
The purveyor at this landmark of deeply American culture in a town that is more than 97 percent American-born happens to be a South Korean immigrant who traces her earliest awareness of the United States to a story her mom told her when she was in elementary school in Seoul, about a place that boasted of 31 flavors of ice cream.
When Geewon Anderson, 48, bought Charlie's in May, she not only embraced the tradition the cafe represented, she also worked to bolster it.
She overhauled the dirty and dilapidated interior and then decorated the walls with old pictures of Minot and its people that she found online. Her husband, Joel, a Minnesota native, carved an image of an American Indian and a buffalo out of bloodwood and hung it behind the cash register. She washed an old blue-and-white sign posted behind the building that read ''Charlie's Fine Food'' and hung it inside the restaurant.
Most important, perhaps, she left the menu alone.
''Meat and potatoes,'' she said. ''That is a tradition of the Middle West. I want them to carry on. I don't want to come here and disturb their tradition. I don't want to modify it. I want to enhance it.''
She added, ''I want my customers to feel this restaurant is theirs.''
Ms. Anderson moved to Anchorage in 1991 with her husband, whom she met while he worked in Seoul as a computer engineering contractor for the United States military. She built a career as a mortgage originator in Anchorage. She also worked as a translator and was involved in civic activities. She counts a red BMW convertible among the fruits of her hard work.
Though she had no ties to North Dakota before hearing about Charlie's, her latest venture, it was the unlikely vehicle she chose to provide her family with a shot at the American dream.
Just six months ago, her mother, two sisters and brother-in-law had not even heard of sunny-side ups, ranch dressing or tomato sauce. They moved here from South Korea in June to help run the restaurant. Her brother-in-law, Sung Chun Lee, a 56-year-old retired banker, has taken to American favorites like hamburgers and is now one of the cooks. This Thanksgiving, he helped prepare a turkey dinner that the restaurant served.
''I am becoming more and more American,'' he said.
Ms. Anderson is helping open a franchise of CherryBerry Yogurt Bar in the mall here that her younger sister will run. Once her family becomes comfortable operating the businesses here on their own, Ms. Anderson hopes to return to Anchorage.
Other family restaurants in Minot have come and gone, but Charlie's has endured. Though residents were uncertain about the date it was established, it has been around at least since World War II, when it was called the Victory Cafe. It became Charlie's in 1957, when Charlie DeMakis, a Greek immigrant, bought it, according to his son, Greg, who runs a bowling alley and lounge in town.
Charlie once cooked a meal for President Eisenhower when he came to Minot for the dedication of the Garrison Dam in the early 1950s, Greg DeMakis said. The restaurant has always specialized in home-style cooking, though Charlie did occasionally cater special meals for groups, Greg said.
''It was the meeting place in Minot in those days,'' he said.
Charlie DeMakis sold the place because of failing health, and ownership changed hands several times before Ms. Anderson and a friend from South Korea bought the building that houses the restaurant and 11 apartments this year for $390,000. Ms. Anderson first visited Minot (which she once pronounced MEE-not, before residents corrected her, saying, MY-not) last January after friends in Alaska told her about the economic opportunities that had resulted from the oil boom in western North Dakota.
The restaurant renovations cost about $50,000 and were completed on Aug. 1. Ms. Anderson put up decorations in October when she moved to Minot full time. She fills in where she can, helping to clean the kitchen and the bathroom, for instance, or chopping vegetables.
Customers at the cafe one recent morning seemed visibly smitten as she darted between tables. One customer affectionately clutched Ms. Anderson by the wrist as they spoke. She brought hot chocolate topped with whipped cream to three burly construction workers, and their faces melted into smiles. All the while, Ms. Anderson, who stands about 5 feet tall at most, bounced around the restaurant wearing a glittery Santa hat that played Elvis Presley's rendition of ''Here Comes Santa Claus'' with the push of a button.
''She's always upbeat,'' said Gary Kramlich, 72, a real estate broker who has been eating breakfast at Charlie's since 1963 and who was the broker when Ms. Anderson bought the restaurant.
Ms. Anderson seemed to favor American life from the start.
Her father worked in the South Korean Navy as a liaison to the United States Navy. Though he died when she was 4, her mother passed along his glowing stories about the United States. Later, Ms. Anderson frequented the same bars in Seoul as some American expatriates, and that was where she met her husband, with whom she has a 23-year-old son, Victor. Her first visit to the United States was to Hawaii in 1987, where she was sworn in as a citizen. One of the first places she visited on American soil was a Baskin-Robbins shop, for a banana split, she said.
She does not view herself as American or Korean, but rather as a citizen of the moment. During the day, she is happy to speak English to her customers and enjoy the hearty cooking. At night, she watches Korean soap operas on satellite television.
''I cannot totally live with Koreans; it would drive me crazy,'' she said. ''I cannot totally live with American people; it drives me crazy. I love being in between and being a bridge.''

HEADLINE: Venezuela's Future

BYLINE: By MARK WEISBROT and MOISÉS NAÍM. 
Mark Weisbrot is co-director of the Center for Economic and Policy Research and president of Just Foreign Policy. Moisés Naím, a scholar at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is the former minister of trade and industry for Venezuela.

 BODY:
As Venezuela looks to the prospect of a future without Hugo Chávez, is it likely to pursue his legacy without him or take another course?
MOST WANT TO STAY THE PATH 
Since Hugo Chávez first took office, he and his party have won 13 of 14 national elections, mainly because they have greatly improved the living standards of most Venezuelans. Since 2004, after the economy recovered from the devastating opposition oil strike, poverty has been cut by half and extreme poverty by more than 70 percent.
Millions of people have gotten access to health care for the first time. Access to education has increased sharply, with college enrollment doubling. Eligibility for public pensions tripled, and in the past two years the government has built hundreds of thousands of houses. Most of the poverty reduction came from increased employment, not ''government handouts,'' and during most of Chávez's tenure, the private sector has grown faster than the public. These numbers are not really in dispute among economists or international statistical agencies.
The 20 years before Chávez were an economic disaster, with per capita income falling between 1980 and 1998.
Is this progress sustainable? The press focuses on Venezuela's inflation, which, at just under 18 percent, is about the highest in the region. But it has come down from 28.2 percent in 2010, even as the economy has recovered and growth has accelerated. This shows that the government can bring inflation down with the right policies.
All of the left-leaning governments in South America -- Brazil, Argentina, Ecuador, Bolivia and Uruguay -- have been re-elected because they have brought real economic and social change and significant improvements in living standards for the majority of their people. This indicates that Chávez's chosen successor would likely win if he should step down. MARK WEISBROT
THE NATION MUST REVERSE COURSE
President Chávez has bequeathed the nation an economic crisis of historic proportions. The crisis includes a fiscal deficit approaching 20 percent of the economy, one of the world's highest inflation rates, a swollen number of public sector jobs, a fragile banking system and the free fall of the state-controlled oil industry, the main source of revenue.
Mismanagement and lack of investment have decreased oil production. Oil revenue is compromised partly because Venezuelans can buy this most valuable resource at heavily subsidized prices. (It costs 25 cents to fill up a midsize car).
Oil is also shipped to Cuba and other Chávez allies, and to China, which paid in advance at deeply discounted prices. Most of the crude exported at market prices is sold to Chávez's main foe: the United States. Yet, as a result of America's own oil boom, United States imports of Venezuelan oil are at a 30-year low. Moreover, due to an explosion in its main refinery, Venezuela now must import gasoline. The Financial Times reckons that for each 10 barrels of crude Venezuela sells to the United States, it has to import two barrels refined abroad.
The nation's total imports have jumped from $13 billion in 2003 to over $50 billion currently. Paying for those imports and servicing its huge debt requires more hard currency than Venezuela's weakened economy can generate. Huge headaches are looming. MOISÉS NAÍM

HEADLINE: The Military Machine, As a Management Wreck

BYLINE: By FRED ANDREWS

 BODY:
IT was once a wry joke that the military was designed by geniuses to be run by idiots. Not anymore, Tim Kane writes. As an all-volunteer force, the young men and women who serve these days are top drawer; it is the institution that is idiotic, he argues. And he has a drastic remedy in mind: a dose of classic economics.
In ''Bleeding Talent'' (Palgrave Macmillan, $30), Mr. Kane gives us a veteran's proud, though acutely critical, perspective on the American military. He offers an illuminating view of the other ''1 percent'' -- not the privileged upper crust, but the sliver of Americans who have accepted the burden of waging two of the longest wars in our history. 
The military is perhaps as selfless an institution as our society has produced. But in its current form, Mr. Kane says, it stifles the aspirations of the best who seek to serve it and pushes them out. ''In terms of attracting and training innovative leaders, the U.S. military is unparalleled,'' he writes. ''In terms of managing talent, the U.S. military is doing everything wrong.''
The core problem, he argues, is that while the military may be ''all volunteer'' on the first day, it is thoroughly coercive every day thereafter. In particular, it dictates the jobs, promotions and careers of the millions in its ranks through a centralized, top-down, one-size-fits-almost-all system that drives many talented officers to resign in frustration. They leave, he says, because they believe that ''the military personnel system -- every aspect of it -- is nearly blind to merit.''
Mr. Kane knows whereof he speaks. An Air Force Academy graduate, he worked in military intelligence for five years before resigning, in the mid-1990s, after the Air Force declined to send him for graduate studies in economics. He is now chief economist at the Hudson Institute, a conservative research group. In the years between, he helped start a couple of small companies and picked up a taste for entrepreneurship.
He finds a natural hero in Milton Friedman, the libertarian economist and intellectual father of the all-voluntary military. And Mr. Kane suggests that today's Pentagon is ignorant of Adam Smith, whose ''Wealth of Nations'' taught that society's interests might best be served by every individual's seeking his or her own self-interest.
In 2005, Mr. Kane made a mark with empirical studies demonstrating that the ''myth of the stupid soldier'' is indeed a myth. His data showed that the enlisted ranks were brighter and better educated than their civilian counterparts.
He looks at today's military and sees suppressed entrepreneurs among officers and enlisted ranks alike. ''America's armed forces are a leadership factory,'' he writes, saying that former military officers are three times as likely to become corporate C.E.O.'s as their raw numbers would suggest.
In surveying recent West Point graduates, he found that only 7 percent believed that most of the best officers remained in the military. It is not the combat, the low pay or the pull of family life that is the top reason they quit in surprising numbers, Mr. Kane writes, but rather the ''frustration with military bureaucracy.'' One study found that young officers left because they wanted a sense of control over their careers. In short, they wanted what the rest of us want.
The exodus of young officers means that promotion to lieutenant colonel is taken for granted in a career trajectory. Yet the step beyond colonel, to general, is subject to a rigid and stultifying screen. A thousand colonels a year are considered; only 35 or 40 make the cut, he says. The mavericks, the innovators who rock the boat, usually do not.
ACCORDING to Mr. Kane, ''the root of all evil in this ecosystem'' is the Defense Officer Personnel Management Act, enacted by Congress in 1980 to standardize military personnel policies. But the system has defied efforts by successive defense secretaries to bring about change.
That act binds the military into a system that honors seniority over individual merit. It judges officers, hundreds at a time, in an up-or-out promotion process that relies on evaluations that have been almost laughably eroded by grade inflation. A zero-defect mentality punishes errors severely. The system discourages specialization -- you can't expect to stay a fighter jock or a cybersecurity expert -- and pushes the career-minded up a tried-and-true ladder that, not surprisingly, produces lookalikes.
In the subtitle of his book, Mr. Kane declares a radical intent: ''How the U.S. Military Mismanages Great Leaders and Why It's Time for a Revolution.'' The revolution he has in mind would turn the military inside out by creating an internal labor market for job assignments and promotions.
Need an assistant commander of an airborne regiment? If an officer has the training and the credentials, why shouldn't he or she be allowed to apply for the job? Let the commander, not the Pentagon, choose a sidekick from a stack of résumés, Mr. Kane says. Sounds a lot like civilian life, doesn't it?
By the same token, a talented 33-year-old colonel could command a 40-year-old major, an age reversal that is commonplace in the civilian economy. The ranks would also be open to lateral entry. Why not readmit a former officer who wants to re-enlist after a stint in logistics for Walmart?
Mr. Kane is taking on an institution whose sheer size boggles the mind. There are 1.1 million men and women in the United States Army, including the National Guard and Army Reserve. The regular Army alone has some 82,000 officers, 15,000 above the rank of major (but only 300 generals). Can it rely on a military Monster.com of the kind the author is proposing to put all those people in the right jobs?
There are skeptics, even among Mr. Kane's supporters in the military, who say his quest is quixotic, an attempt to dent a stone wall that has defied all efforts to change it. But it might not be hopeless. Our military is part of our society. It has bent before to provide greater opportunities, first for blacks, then for women, and most recently for gays and lesbians. If the demand now is for greater personal autonomy, how long can the military resist?

HEADLINE: A Stock Market Streak That Has Drawn Few Cheers

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
ON May 30, 1982, Cal Ripken Jr. played a solid game in the infield for the Baltimore Orioles. He did it again the next game and the game after that and the next game, too. Ripken didn't miss a game for 16 years.
At first, no one noticed his perfect attendance record. But thanks to the obsessive data crunching of baseball statisticians, people eventually began to celebrate. That unbroken string of games turned into the Streak -- 2,632 consecutive games, a run of lunchbox heroism that shattered the seemingly unbreakable, 2,130-game record of Lou Gehrig, the fabled Iron Horse of the Yankees. 
Baseball's legions of statisticians have made it easy to track Ripken's achievements -- as well as those that are far more obscure. (Who held the Orioles' club record for most consecutive games until Ripken broke it on May 4, 1985? Does anyone care? No matter, it's in the books: Brooks Robinson, another superstar infielder, with 463 games.)
Making money is, arguably, the true national pastime of the United States. While the financial game isn't always analyzed with quite the same élan as baseball, Paul T. Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, has unearthed a noteworthy financial streak -- one that is still under most people's radar.
Each day in 2012, as well as in these early days of 2013, he says, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has closed in positive territory for the calendar year. Here's another way of putting it: In 2012, the index never had a daily close below the closing level for 2011. And despite endless worries about the so-called fiscal cliff, the streak lives on.
How unusual is this?
''Going back to 1928, there have only been eight other years where the index went an entire year of trading up year-to-date every single day,'' Mr. Hickey says. The last time was in 1979.
The odds that the current streak will be sustained through a second calendar year are quite low. Since 1928, it's happened only once -- in 1975 and 1976, a period not remembered as being particularly strong for equities.
Today, many people don't see the market as worth the bother, either. ''Although the current bull market is approaching four years in duration, if you talk to the average investor, many will not even call it a bull market,'' Bespoke wrote last week in its annual report on the markets. ''In 2012, the S.& P. 500 was up by more than 10 percent, but if you asked most casual observers how the market was doing, they would probably tell you that it was flat, or maybe even down.''
That may help explain why the current streak hasn't received more attention, Mr. Hickey said in an interview. Cogitating about it may induce cognitive dissonance, because the streak attests to the market's consistently strong performance while many wise commentators have been stressing the market's uncertainty and turbulence.
''The numbers don't lie,' Mr. Hickey said. ''We've been having a bull market streak when many people don't even realize we're in a bull market.''
The reasons for the market's persistent buoyancy may not be appealing, Mr. Hickey said. It's possible that stocks have performed well primarily because of the expansive monetary policy of central banks and because of governments' heightened intervention in the financial system and the economy.
''But whatever the reasons,'' he said, ''if you bought stocks in March 2009 at the bottom of the market, you can sell them today at a tremendous premium.''
In fact, a $1,000 investment in an S.& P. 500 index fund made in March 2009 would be worth more than $2,000 today.
Yet many investors are ''disconnected from the stock market these days and that's understandable,'' Mr. Hickey said, given the enormous losses suffered in the financial crisis and in the collapse of the Internet bubble less than a decade before that.
The current rally may still have legs precisely because many investors have so far failed to participate in it. They may become reaccustomed to the idea that stocks can be very profitable, he said.
Crunch the numbers for the last year or so and you'll see that active investors actually ''have been risk-on, not risk-off,'' he said. Last year, growth stocks generally fared better than the traditionally safe dividend payers, he observed. And stocks of companies that derive a high proportion of their revenue from the domestic market generally outperformed foreign stocks. They also fared better than domestic stocks with high international exposure.
In short, the bull market that started in March 2009 remains very much intact, he said.
You might not know that from financial headlines that have often focused on weakness in the economy and on the myriad crises in Europe, the Middle East and Washington.
In fact, many sentiment indicators suggest that investors remain quite worried, and that the market's rise last week may have simply been a world-didn't-end rally, a collective sigh of relief.
On Monday, the last day of 2012, there were rumors of a breakthrough in the impasse in Washington, and the S.& P. 500 rose 1.7 percent, its best year-ending day since 1974.
On Wednesday, the market soared 2 percent on news that the so-called fiscal cliff had been dodged in a last-minute deal. That built a cushion for the rest of the week. Stocks wavered on Thursday and rose on Friday -- finishing 2.8 percent above their closing level for 2012.
STILL, the market's perch is precarious, in the view of many strategists. Will Geisdorf, senior global analyst at Ned Davis Research, for example, said last week that while the bull market was intact, a short-term correction was very likely, if only because the market had risen so rapidly.
''We have a cautious view for the next four or five weeks,'' he said, though the medium-term outlook is ''decidedly bullish.''
The deal reached in Washington created a new series of seemingly crucial deadlines in March. That's when the federal government is expected to hit its debt ceiling, when its spending authorization bill will need approval, and when cuts in domestic and military spending will begin if no action is taken. The market turbulence may well be disconcerting.
But for now, the streak lives on. Perhaps it's time to take a little notice.

HEADLINE: Obama and Republicans Gear Up for Next Fiscal Fight

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In dueling weekly addresses, the White House and Republicans drew lines in the sand for their next fiscal showdown, which could be as soon as next month, when a Congressional fight is expected on raising the nation's borrowing limit. 
Democrats have warned Republican leaders not to use the debt authorization for political leverage. In his weekly address, President Obama again said he would not trade spending cuts for an increase in the debt limit.
''One thing I will not compromise over is whether or not Congress should pay the tab for a bill they've already racked up,'' he said. ''If Congress refuses to give the United States the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic.''
Mr. Obama also repeated his new demand that future spending cuts be met with commensurate tax increases. ''Spending cuts must be balanced with more reforms to our tax code,'' he said. ''The wealthiest individuals and the biggest corporations shouldn't be able to take advantage of loopholes and deductions that aren't available to most Americans.''
A similar standoff over raising the debt limit in 2011 led Standard & Poor's for the first time to downgrade its rating of United States Treasury debt by one notch, suggesting a higher risk of default. The impasse caused a slump in the market, and analysts fear that another one could cause yet more damage.
Many Republicans have said they do not plan to lift the country's statutory borrowing limit unless Democrats agree to significant spending cuts, particularly to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare.
In the Republican address, Representative Dave Camp of Michigan, the chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee, argued that Congress needed to focus on cutting spending and simplifying the tax code.
''Many of our Democrat colleagues just don't seem to get it,'' he said. ''Throughout the fiscal cliff discussions, the president and the Democrats who control Washington repeatedly refused to take any meaningful steps to make Washington live within its means. That position is irresponsible and fails to acknowledge what every family in America already knows: when you have no more money in your account and your credit cards are maxed out, then the spending must stop.''
Just after the new year, Congress agreed to raise taxes on the wealthiest Americans and delay for two months significant cuts to the discretionary budget, brokering the deal to avoid the worst of the tax increases and spending cuts known collectively as the ''fiscal cliff.'' But the deal, which will cut the deficit by an estimated $650 billion over 10 years, is far smaller than the trillions of dollars in deficit reduction initially sought by negotiators.
It also left several issues for the 113th Congress to resolve, including raising the debt ceiling, trying to defuse some of the mandated discretionary-spending cuts and averting a government shutdown. Those will come to a head in February and March. If Congress fails to lift the ceiling, a cash management crisis will result, as the Treasury will lack the money to pay all the country's bills on time.

HEADLINE: New Legislature Faces a New Set of Priorities

BYLINE: By THE TEXAS TRIBUNE

 BODY:
The last time Texas lawmakers convened in Austin, they were absorbed with numbers and boundaries: how to make ends meet with a deflated state budget and draw new district maps the courts would approve.
But with improving fiscal conditions and redistricting mostly in the rearview mirror, they are approaching the 2013 legislative session with some pressing policy questions, from whether to introduce private school vouchers into the state's public education system to whether they should put in effect -- and accept financing for -- major provisions of the federal health care overhaul.
Meanwhile, lawmakers will face the consequences of the sweeping cuts and budget-balancing tricks of the 2011 session, including a multibillion-dollar Medicaid shortfall and a lawsuit -- expected to be appealed to the Texas Supreme Court early this year and decided in the summer -- over how the state finances public education.
The Legislature is also staring down the barrel of some other major investments, from ensuring that Texas has the water to meet its soaring population growth to finding consistent revenue streams for long-delayed transportation projects. 
Do not expect a full respite from hot-button issues; lawmakers have already offered legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks, and to allow teachers to carry concealed handguns in school classrooms. But the Legislature's Republican majority may take a softer tack toward immigration bills this session, after a national election in which the growing Hispanic population moved even further into the Democratic camp.
A look at the anticipated legislation, issues and political battles in the 83rd session.
PUBLIC EDUCATION
Whether to pass school choice reform -- and what shape it might take -- could be one of the biggest battles of the 2013 session. A key aspect of any proposal will be whether parents can use public money to send children to private schools. Support for such a measure does not fall along party lines, and it has divided Republicans in the past.
Lawmakers are also poised to take on the state's public school accountability system because of widespread reaction against the use of high-stakes standardized tests to measure student performance. Dan Patrick, Republican of Houston and the chairman of the Senate Education Committee, and Michael L. Williams, the state's education commissioner, have offered proposals that rate schools on a scale of A to F; other legislators have suggested doing away with state testing.
Education advocates and some lawmakers will push to restore some or all of the $5.4 billion in public school budget cuts made during the 2011 session. But any decision will hinge on the resolution of a major school finance lawsuit against the state. A Texas Supreme Court decision, anticipated in early summer, could bring lawmakers back to Austin to revamp the state's method of financing public schools.
After the mass shootings last month at a Connecticut elementary school, lawmakers could also consider measures to heighten security at public schools, including a bill to let school employees carry concealed handguns.
Look to Mr. Patrick to be the gatekeeper on education policy in the Senate. Key lawmakers to watch in the House include John Otto, Republican of Dayton and an appropriations guru, and Jimmie Don Aycock, Republican of Killeen, who has taken the lead on school finance issues. MORGAN SMITH
HEALTH CARE
Lawmakers will be responding to scandals in the health care arena that have rocked the state's cancer research institute and its Medicaid program, and federal reforms that will dramatically alter Texas' medical landscape.
As criminal and civil investigations of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas continue, rebuilding public trust in the $3 billion, voter-approved initiative will be a top priority. Lawmakers have also filed bills to tackle Medicaid fraud among dental and orthodontic providers.
In response to federal health care reform -- so-called Obamacare -- lawmakers must decide whether Texas will expand Medicaid to cover poor, uninsured adults or set up an Orbitz-like online insurance exchange. Mr. Perry has insisted that Texas will not play ball, but decisions by the state's Republican majority could pressure the governor to accept federal reforms and the money that comes with them.
Some lawmakers may be reconsidering a $73 million cut to family planning services that was made in the last session, which was largely an effort to force Planned Parenthood out of state programs. They will also be looking at the rules and financing of the Texas Women's Health Program, the successor of a federally financed program that ended after the state enforced a rule banning providers affiliated with abortion clinics.
Abortion opponents are also backing a ''fetal pain'' measure that would ban abortions after 20 weeks, and a bill to place tougher requirements on doctors who perform abortions. BECCA AARONSON
HOUSE SPEAKER
Once upon a time, speakers of the Texas House easily won re-election until they overstayed their welcome, falling victim to politics or scandals. But during the tenure of Joe Straus, the current speaker, and his predecessor, Tom Craddick, there have been challenges at the beginning of every legislative session.
Mr. Straus, Republican of San Antonio, unseated Mr. Craddick, Republican of Midland, in 2009. In 2011, he fended off a rambunctious challenge from Representative Ken Paxton, Republican of Plano, who has since moved on to the Texas Senate.
Now it is Representative David Simpson carrying the challenger's banner.
Mr. Simpson, Republican of Longview, is entering only his second term, but he proved during his freshman term that he was not a go-along-to-get-along guy. He got in the way of restrictions on so-called puppy mills two years ago, even though the sponsor was Senfronia Thompson, the venerated Houston Democrat who was in a position to spike all of the upstart's legislation.
He argued loudly and unsuccessfully in favor of restricting federal airport searches and gave a personal privilege speech -- a fancy term for a heartfelt oratorical address to the House that cannot be interrupted for debate -- railing against the machinations he said prevented passage of the ''anti-groping'' legislation.
Now his disdain for Mr. Straus's leadership has blossomed into a full-blown challenge for his job. After members take their oaths of office on Tuesday to begin their new terms, they will decide whether to stick with Mr. Straus or switch to Mr. Simpson. ROSS RAMSEY
THE GOVERNOR
After enduring a humiliating run for president, and his first electoral loss ever, Mr. Perry heads into the session looking to rebuild his brand.
He will most likely do it by championing the no-holds-barred conservatism that made him a presidential contender in the first place.
Over the next few months, look for Mr. Perry to push a ''fetal pain'' bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy, possibly as an ''emergency'' item that would fast track the measure. He said recently that he sees it as a step toward his goal of ending abortion rights entirely.
Mr. Perry will also call for drug testing welfare recipients, and Texans can count on him to resist anything that sounds like a federal mandate, whether it relates to health care, the environment or guns.
The governor says people should be allowed to carry concealed weapons in any public place. His response to the mass shooting in Connecticut? Let teachers carry guns.
Mr. Perry is likely to face some awkward wrangling over tax incentives and grants to private companies that promise to create jobs -- he calls it economic development, but many Tea Party conservatives see the programs as corporate welfare.
The governor promises to reveal his political plans this summer. He has said he is leaning toward a re-election race, and he could begin another presidential bid in 2016. At a Tea Party gathering a few weeks ago, Mr. Perry was quoted as saying he still has ''a burning desire in my heart to see this country led by a God-fearing conservative patriot.'' JAY ROOT
ENERGY
In a state that remains in a severe drought, the overarching energy and environment issue this session will undoubtedly be water.
Lawmakers will consider proposals to draw $1 billion or more from the Rainy Day Fund to help finance water projects. State Representative Lyle Larson, Republican of San Antonio, has already filed such a bill.
High water rates charged by private companies in rural Texas are also likely to receive scrutiny, especially as lawmakers assess whether to move water rate oversight to the Public Utility Commission from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality. The utility commission is undergoing a comprehensive ''sunset'' review by the Legislature this session, an assessment of the need for a state agency.
The Texas Railroad Commission, like the utility commsssion, is also under sunset review. That could result in a name change (the leading candidate is the Texas Energy Resources Commission, which reflects the agency's oil and gas oversight) as well as scrutiny of the agency's enforcement policies for drillers.
The Legislature will also most likely be looking at how effectively Ercot, the state grid operator, resolves its long-term problem of limited power supplies and growing demand.
Environmentalists will be pushing for the restoration of financing to state parks, which saw budget cuts last session. Twenty state parks could close if the money does not materialize, according to Luke Metzger, director of Environment Texas. KATE GALBRAITH
HIGHER EDUCATION
Ideas for getting more out of Texas colleges and universities without giving them more money will dominate higher education discussions in the coming session.
Under a plan proposed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board, the eligibility pool for the state's largest need-based grant program would be reduced and the award decreased, allowing financing to stretch farther in a more targeted population.
This will be the first session in which the Senate's higher education committee, which was created in 2009, has not been run by Senator Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo. Senator Kel Seliger, Republican of Amarillo, is the new chairman.
Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas and the chairman of the House Higher Education Committee, has already signaled his priorities: filing a bill that would require universities to offer students the option of a four-year, fixed-rate tuition plan and seeking to tweak the state's enrollment-based approach to appropriations by tying as much as 25 percent of financing to performance measures like graduation rates. Mr. Perry has endorsed variations of both proposals.
The governor does not expect legislation ending Texas' longstanding policy of giving some illegal immigrants in-state tuition rates and access to financial aid to reach his desk. But such a bill has been filed, and it could be one of the session's most contentious higher education issues. REEVE HAMILTON
IMMIGRATION
Unlike last session, lawmakers have not prefiled a mountain of immigration legislation. After President Obama's strong showing among Hispanic voters in the November general election, analysts suggest, Texas Republicans may be revising their message.
Some state lawmakers, however, remain intent on keeping the issue front and center. State Representative Lyle Larson, Republican of San Antonio, has filed a bill to repeal in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, and another that could make it easier for county governments to construct immigration detention centers.
Representative Bill Zedler, Republican of Arlington, has filed a bill that would crack down on day labor centers where unauthorized workers congregate to look for temporary work.
Mr. Perry has not said whether legislation to ban so-called sanctuary cities in Texas would be a priority. But he recently reiterated his support for the measure, which would expand the immigration enforcement authority of local law enforcement officers.
After the United States Supreme Court's decision in June to uphold what critics call the ''show me your papers'' provision of the controversial Arizona immigration law, Texans could see a similar bill filed this year.
But there could also be unprecedented pushback, as Texas Republicans watch the state's demographics shift and seek to draw more Hispanics into the party's ranks.
At their state party convention in June, Republicans voted to include a call for a national guest-worker program in their platform, a public acknowledgment that some of the party's rhetoric may have alienated Hispanic voters. JULIÁN AGUILAR
CRIMINAL JUSTICE
In the realm of courts and prisons, continuing debate is expected over the role of prosecutorial misconduct in Texas' wrongful convictions.
Michael Morton, who was exonerated in 2011 after spending nearly 25 years in prison for his wife's murder, is already lobbying legislators to find more ways to hold prosecutors accountable when they make mistakes that lead to wrongful convictions. Senator Rodney Ellis, Democrat of Houston and chairman of the Innocence Project board, is likely to take the lead on this issue.
Following a year of renewed violence in Texas' youth lockups -- youth-against-youth violence this time, as opposed to the staff-on-youth assaults of 2005 that resulted in system reforms -- lawmakers will work to improve the state's troubled juvenile justice system. Discussion is likely to center on whether to close even more of the state's facilities; currently there are just 6, down from 15 a few years ago.
Reform advocates have long urged legislators to consider smaller secure facilities that are closer to urban centers, instead of the massive ones in rural parts of the state.
In the months ahead, Texas could also make more history with its prison system. In 2011, lawmakers shut down the aging Central Unit near Houston; it was the first time the state had ever closed a prison.
Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat and the longtime leader of the upper chamber's Criminal Justice Committee, has already hinted that he would like to see two more Texas prisons closed as the inmate population continues to decline. Mr. Whitmire will be taking charge of prison issues after the retirement of his longtime partner in criminal justice, Representative Jerry Madden, Republican of Plano. BRANDI GRISSOM
TRANSPORTATION
Other budget priorities have overshadowed transportation for years, but Texans may see some major movement on two fronts in 2013.
After a decade of relying largely on debt and tolls to advance road projects without raising taxes, state leaders, including Mr. Perry and the speaker of the House, Mr. Straus, are calling for the development of a more dependable revenue stream. The current financing system, largely bolstered by gas taxes, has been unable to keep pace with the cost of maintaining roads, let alone developing new routes to relieve congestion. A proposal to dedicate the sales tax on new vehicle purchases to transportation financing is drawing strong interest.
Commuter rail may also see a big boost this year if private development of a high-speed rail system and public efforts to expand rail lines in North Texas move forward.
Following Mr. Perry's veto of a 2011 texting-while-driving ban, lawmakers could reconsider behind-the-wheel legislation to counter distracted driving.
Lawmakers may also provide ways for state and local authorities to hold oil and gas production companies responsible for the damage their vehicles and equipment do to roads in the Permian Basin, Eagle Ford Shale and Barnett Shale regions. AMAN BATHEJA

THE PHYSICS OF WALL STREETA Brief History of Predicting the Unpredictable
By James Owen Weatherall286 pp. Houghton Mifflin Harcourt. $27.
Ever since the financial crisis, James Owen Weatherall writes in his new book, ''The Physics of Wall Street,'' ''words like 'quant,' 'derivative' and 'model' have taken on some nasty connotations.'' He is out to change that.
What finance and economics need, he says, is more physics, not less. So what if the quantitative models that underlay such products as mortgage-backed securities blew up, nearly bringing down the world financial system in the process? Models always have assumptions; it is up to the users to pay attention to whether those assumptions hold.
Did some so-called quants -- investors who use sophisticated mathematical models in deciding what and when to buy and sell -- lose their shirts? Indeed they did. But others did not. Weatherall points to Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund founded by James Simons, who was an esteemed mathematician before he became an esteemed investor. Simons's success, Weatherall argues, ''shows that mathematical sophistication is the remedy, not the disease.'' 
Weatherall, an assistant professor of logic and philosophy of science at the University of California, Irvine, has two Ph.D.'s -- one in physics and mathematics, and one in philosophy -- and he has really written two books. The first, which takes up much of the volume, is an entertaining and enlightening tale of the history of finance and gambling. Along the way we meet a neglected Frenchman named Louis Bachelier, who, Weatherall says, invented mathematical finance in 1900 with a thesis proposing that probability theory could be used to understand financial markets. This notion may seem obvious now -- people who don't like Wall Street often refer to it as a casino -- but at the time Bachelier's findings didn't impress much of anyone. He had trouble getting academic jobs, and his work was forgotten until the 1950s, when it was rediscovered by the M.I.T. economist and Nobel laureate Paul Samuelson.
While Samuelson studied economics in college and graduate school, Weatherall is careful to emphasize that ''he was deeply influenced by a mathematical physicist and statistician named E. B. Wilson.'' And Weatherall points out that Jan Tinbergen, the first winner of the Nobel in economic science (Samuelson was the second), was a physicist who introduced the word ''model'' to economics in the 1930s. Tinbergen also studied a topic that few on Wall Street today want to think about, arguing that ''a company would become less productive if the income of the highest-paid employee was more than five times the income of the lowest-paid employee.''
Weatherall does an excellent job of describing how Fischer Black and Myron Scholes figured out a model to value stock options; the model ultimately contributed to a foolish product called portfolio insurance, which played a major role in causing the 1987 stock market crash.Echoing its initial treatment of Bachelier, the economics discipline at first had little use for Black and Scholes, whose paper announcing their model was rejected by the leading journals. (Scholes would later go on to win a Nobel.)
Also fun to read is the story of Edward Thorp, the mathematician who came up with card-counting methods that forced Las Vegas to change the way blackjack was played, and his (unsuccessful) efforts to devise a winning strategy for roulette. (It has to do with noticing where the ball is released -- an observation that, if acted upon rapidly enough, could give a bettor an advantage similar to the one enjoyed by card counters.)
But Weatherall has a grander aim. ''The Physics of Wall Street'' ''is a book about the future of finance,'' he writes in his introduction. ''It's about why we should look to new ideas from physics and related fields to solve the ongoing economic problems faced by countries around the world. It's a story that should change how we think about economic policy forever.''
This is a lofty goal, made all the more ambitious by the blunders of physicists on Wall Street in recent decades, blunders he describes well but with an extremely generous view. Sure, he concedes, the crisis ''was partly a failure of mathematical modeling,'' but he declares that the real problem ''was a failure of some very sophisticated financial institutions to think like physicists.''
Weatherall wants a new Manhattan Project to determine what's wrong with economics, and he thinks it should be based in no small part on the contributions of physics-oriented economists, some of whom he believes have been treated unfairly by the establishment. At his worst, he sees conspiracies. Was an economics graduate student penalized when she proposed using ''gauge theory,'' a tool from mathematical physics, to set the Consumer Price Index? Weatherall suggests as much, implying that her ''new and mathematically rigorous method'' threatened a plan to lower the reported rate of inflation and thereby reduce Social Security benefits.
He has little use for Nassim Taleb, whose best-selling book ''The Black Swan'' argues that the models used by traders disastrously underestimated the possibility of very negative outcomes -- the black swans. To say that a model failed, Weatherall contends, is not to say that no models can work. ''We use mathematical models cut from the same cloth to build bridges and to design airplane engines, to plan the electric grid and to launch spacecraft,'' he writes. If you don't trust them, why are you driving over the George Washington Bridge? ''After all, at any moment an unprecedented earthquake could occur.''
Well, yes. But what caused the models to fail during the financial crisis was far from unprecedented, even if it did involve events that had not occurred during the relatively limited period for which the modelers had good, quantifiable data. The process by which speculative euphoria leads to bubbles and disasters was well described by the economist Hyman Minsky, and his work has rightly enjoyed a revival since the crisis. But Minsky was not especially mathematical, and Weatherall does not mention him or his ideas.
The problem with using quantitative models in finance is not that they don't work, nor that they cause losses when their assumptions turn out to be wrong; there have been bridges that collapsed when calculation errors went unnoticed. It is instead that banks and regulators allowed an entire system to develop out of models that encouraged a lot of borrowing in order to transform tiny profits into big ones. The result was that rather than losing one bridge, we came very close to losing them all.
It is one thing for you to go broke because you failed to understand something crucial; it is wholly another for everybody else to go broke because of your mistake.
The world's economic problems are far too complex to be reduced to a matter of physics and mathematics. Reading this book brought to mind the adage that if all you have is a hammer, every problem looks like a nail.

''Life Goes On'' is both a very good first novel and a chilling reminder of the Nazis' success at destroying Germany's rich literary culture for a generation, if not longer. The author, Hans Keilson, wrote this lightly fictionalized account of his life about 80 years ago, when he was in his early 20s. To give just one example of how much the world has changed since then: Keilson tells us in an afterword that the impetus to start the novel was the fury he felt after he'd been turned away as a patient by the powerful Berlin Psychoanalytic Institute. (A few years later, the institute would be taken over by a cousin of Hermann Goering, and most of its analysts would flee to Palestine.) The publisher, the great S. Fischer Verlag, accepted the novel for publication in December 1932. The extremely poor and extremely elated Keilson took his advance and went skiing for the first time in his life. When he came back, the Reichstag was on fire, the Nazis had begun arresting Communists, and the publisher told Keilson to change his ending, which had a Communist twist. 
The novel appeared, with the altered ending, in 1933. It was banned in 1934. And that is the story, Keilson explains in the afterword, of ''the last debut by a Jewish writer from the old S. Fischer Verlag.''
Keilson lived to the age of 101, having survived the Nazis in hiding; published two more novels; abandoned fiction writing because, he said, he'd lost his audience; become a psychotherapist treating Jewish war orphans; and written an important treatise on trauma in children. (He died in 2011.) Though his third novel, ''The Death of the Adversary,'' sold well in America and was one of Time's top 10 books of 1962 -- along with fiction by Faulkner, Roth, Nabokov, Borges and Katherine Anne Porter -- the German Jewish writer had been forgotten by the English-speaking world in 2007, when the translator Damion Searls found another of his novels, ''Comedy in a Minor Key,'' in the bargain bin of an Austrian bookstore. Searls picked the book up only because he mistook it for another one. At that point, Keilson had only just been rediscovered in Germany; Fischer issued his ''Collected Works'' as a boxed set in 2005. Searls translated ''Comedy in a Minor Key'' into English, and in 2010 The New York Times Book Review published an essay on that novel and ''The Death of the Adversary'' that called them ''masterpieces'' and Keilson ''a genius.''
''Life Goes On,'' also translated by Searls, is not a masterpiece, but it is certainly worth reading. Partly a work of social realism and partly a bildungsroman, it contrasts the financial and psychological decline of a clothing merchant and his wife in a small German town during the Great Depression with the artistic awakening of their watchful, worried son. The boy's father, Herr Seldersen, already exudes a downtrodden timidity when his fat, mincing landlord comes into his store to announce that he's expanding his stationery business and moving Seldersen to a smaller space next door. Vaudevillian as this opening is, it aptly prefigures Seldersen's future as a man at the mercy of forces too big for him to push back against. ''That winter was the first one when all the poverty and misery was out in the open. Unemployment was rampant,'' the boy observes. ''People came by and told stories, complained about all sorts of things, and were all so discouraged.'' Seldersen extends credit to his customers, but fewer and fewer pay him back. His troubles multiply: tax audits, angry letters from unpaid suppliers, ruinous loans.
Meanwhile, the son, Albrecht, goes from roaming at will with his best friend, Fritz, through their town and its pastoral surroundings, ''all-powerful masters of the world,'' as Albrecht thinks of it, to noticing with alarm the country's rapid disintegration and his family's worsening situation. Fritz, a strong, handsome boy who ''could make anyone in the world laugh,'' descends into a strange, reckless moodiness and abruptly leaves home. Albrecht, a good-enough but distracted student, senses his own possibilities shrink. One night at the local literary club, though, he hears a lecture on Thomas Mann's ''Tonio Kröger'' and is befriended by the lecturer, who lends him the novella: ''Grand, strange, wonderful thoughts came to him, and he had no idea himself how they had arisen, but for the time being astonishment and uncertainty outweighed everything else. This fateful book was decisive for Albrecht.''
Albrecht's literary development shadows Kröger's in the sense that Albrecht is equally alienated from the mainstream of German life, but otherwise their lives could not be more different. The wealthy Kröger glides to fame in pre-World War I Germany, retreating into his ''fastidious, exquisite, precious, refined, hypersensitive'' poetic sensibility, as Mann puts it. Albrecht goes to college in Berlin, which roils with hunger and rage and violent social upheaval. He plays violin in a band to pay his way through school, then to support his parents; this is harsher labor than you'd think if what you long to do is study and write. He keeps his distance from the turmoil at first, as his literary mentor and his own cautious temperament urge him to do, but ultimately plunges into the fray and achieves political consciousness, although the exact nature of the politics he becomes conscious of is never specified.
And that lack of specificity, I have to say, makes this novel a little weird to read. Keilson tells us that he had to cut the ideological content out of the ending, but the rest of the book feels as if it's been neutered too. For all the sharply observed details of the economic crisis and the riots in the streets and the approach of an unnamed menace, Keilson, writing in the run-up to Hitler's ascent to power, never names a party, never speaks of Nazis or Communists, utters not one single word about Jews. We who know not only what was happening in Germany while Keilson wrote but also what happened right after his book came out (and that, of course, is nearly all of us) can't help interpreting the Seldersens as Jewish. Their growing terror, deteriorating social position and loss of dignity make that identification hard to avoid. But Keilson refuses to say that they are.
Was Keilson drawing an allegorical veil over the events and characters of his novel so as to keep it from being pigeonholed by the ideologues of the day? Or was he being evasive? If he was, do we have the right to judge him for that? His other two novels, one or both written while he was in hiding (it's not clear when ''Comedy in a Minor Key'' was begun), deal somewhat more directly with the experience of German Jews, although ''The Death of the Adversary'' pursued a contrarian argument about the love/hate relationship between victims and oppressors that made the novel unpopular among Jewish readers after the war. Still, whatever his attitude toward his own identity during those terrible times, he can't be accused of having run away from it later.
In any case, ''Life Goes On'' is an important and heartbreaking novel, and not only because it lets us hear the power of Keilson's young voice just before it was silenced for more than a decade. The book also lets us relive and understand, a little, the anguish and confusion from which a madman emerged as chancellor. Moreover, as grim as the material is, the prose is a pleasure. Keilson has a lovely, easy style, a gentle tone and an analytic mind. He depicts complicated human interactions -- between a broke customer and a near-bankrupt merchant, a tactful schoolteacher and a loving but obtuse father -- with a precocious mastery of nuance and full comprehension of what can't be said. He was so young, and such a natural. We should have had more than just three short novels from Hans Keilson.

HEADLINE: What's It Gonna Be, 2013?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON; Additional reporting by Jacob Goldstein. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Back in the mid-2000s, the U.S. consumer economy was undergoing a serious change. After decades of favoring low prices (even when they promised low quality), consumers began paying more for all sorts of premium features like single-serve packaging and pretty much anything ''green'' or ''organic.'' Then came the financial crisis and the drop in consumer demand.
Despite a worse-than-expected holiday season, the Federal Reserve forecast that G.D.P. growth would approach the historic average of about 3 percent in 2013. The economy may be coming back, but the question for many businesses is what the new ''normal'' looks like. Will shoppers spend as they did in the credit-bubble years? Or has the Great Recession scared them into prolonged stinginess? Early evidence suggests a mix. What is clear is that the big changes are just beginning.
Waste More, Want More 
From the 1970s through the 1990s, the dominant retail trend was toward cheap and big: shoppers drove long distances to buy large boxes of everything they needed in bulk. Starting in the last decade, though, this began to change. And the success of products like Tide Pods (premeasured balls of detergent that made Procter & Gamble an estimated $500 million last year) suggest that the era of premium conveniences isn't going anywhere.
Somewhat counterintuitively, this trend is directly related to the downturn, says John N. Frank, an analyst at Mintel, a market-research firm. Fearful of losing their jobs, millions of workers coped with the crisis by putting in more time at the office -- ''doing at least two people's jobs,'' Frank says -- even if it meant less time to shop for deals. Dollar General saw tremendous growth as a more convenient alternative to Sam's Club. Duane Reade, now owned by Walgreen, is proving that no block in Manhattan should be without a drugstore that also carries basic grocery items at an upcharge. Frank says he expects that anxious, overtired workers will drive this trend well into this decade, too.
Housing Is Back
Now that at least one million households are looking to move somewhere better, investors are looking to buy houses on the cheap -- not to flip, but to rent. (The Blackstone Group, the private-equity colossus, has spent more than $1 billion this year buying up thousands of single-family homes around the country.) New residential construction starts also came back strong last year, and much of the growth was from multiunit apartment buildings designed, yes, for renting.
Despite the fact that homeownership has been promoted as a universal economic good since the Depression, the trend toward rentals might be a good one. Renters are more able to follow the job market. Renting, as the housing bubble revealed, benefits the overall recovery, because fewer people have their money tied up in one asset.
Not Your Father's Oldsmobile
In 2012, the average life of a car in the United States reached a historic high of 11.2 years. This was tied to the collapse of new-car sales during the recession, but it was also driven by several long-term shifts. After steady increases for decades, Americans are driving less. Total miles driven in the United States hit 3 trillion for the first time in 2006. It went up even further in 2007 but has generally fallen since.
For the first time in nine decades, according to census data, walkable cities are growing faster than suburbs. And wherever people happen to move, they are buying smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. Large- and some luxury-car segments are falling, says Tom Libby, an automotive research analyst at Polk, and the cheaper subcompact and emerging sub-subcompact classes are growing. All this means that autos -- one of the biggest industries in the United States -- will not soon regain the explosive growth of the early 2000s.
Debt and Taxes
In 2008, Americans owed a collective $12.7 trillion. Today, thanks in part to mortgage defaults, we are down to $11.3 trillion, which is about 95 percent of our disposable income. That's progress, but it's still higher than the 88 percent we owed 10 years ago.
Whether debt continues to fall this year should signal what American consumers really learned from the bubble years. After the start of the Depression, it took more than a decade for consumption as a percentage of the economy to rebound. Will the Great Recession generation be as tightfisted? It will be hard: retailers are already pining for a return to borrowing and buying, and some basic building blocks of increased debt (like historically low interest rates) are already in place.
The U.S. Doesn't Have All the Answers
Depending on the various definitions, the middle class and wealthy populations of developing countries may approach or surpass those of developed ones this year. Rich people in Shanghai and São Paulo already buy lots of American products, but the middle classes are more likely to buy knockoff fashions and digital products designed and made in low-wage countries.
U.S. businesses still make money from these transactions. The technology inside the devices and the movies and songs played on them are often invented and patented here. And while intellectual property can be far more lucrative than manufacturing, its laws are difficult to enforce in the developing world. Chen Deming, the commerce minister in China, recently promised to strengthen protection of American intellectual property, but those measures are also likely to expedite the development of Chinese invention and entertainment exports. It's easy to dismiss the South Korean musician Psy's ''Gangnam Style'' video, but as my Planet Money colleague Zoe Chace reported, the world's most popular viral video came after South Korea's decades-long investment in its entertainment industry. In a decade or two, we may watch Chinese sitcoms on Brazilian-invented streaming devices made in Africa.
Most of our major economic recoveries of the last century have had a clear narrative. The Depression gave way to massive military spending -- which gave way to the equally massive task of building America's suburbs and supplying them with houses, roads, cars and TVs. The three recoveries between 1982 and 2002 were notable for riding along consumption booms, too. The story of this recovery may be unusually opaque, but the brightest forecasts are built less on a return to old consumption levels than on, for example, fracking. And that's not necessarily a bad thing. There was so much bubbly growth in houses, cars and appliances during the mid-2000s, that it's hard to see how any kind of return to those levels would lead to a healthy economy. The best thing we could hope for, paradoxically, is a return to 1999.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Consumption is back.
2. But many buying habits are changing.
3. Regardless, the habits of the U.S. middle class are becoming less important.

JERRY SEINFELD
I worked for IIT Research Institute, the company that invented the Pop-Tart (which is the subject of a joke described by Jerry Seinfeld in your magazine). In the '60s, the company was tasked with creating a rival to the frozen waffle. It was a point of pride for this little eggheaded company that worked on radio gear and train switches. Years later, when meetings ran long and people grew tired, someone would say ''Pop-Tart'' under their breath and everyone would laugh and instantly decompress. Nothing we were going to create was going to generate a billion dollars in revenue with something so worthless. We lived in the shadows of giants. SAGRILARUSI, Annapolis, Md., posted on nytimes.com
In the '80s, Jerry Seinfeld did television commercials for our client, a sandwich chain called Suburpia. Jerry arrived the night before the shoot, took our scripts and a yellow legal pad and retired to his room. By the next morning, he and his comic buddy Joel Hodgson had tweaked or rewritten every script. They were infinitely better. The commercials went on to win awards. Incidentally, the evening of the shoot Jerry found an opening at a local comedy club, where he killed. The man lived to work. Nothing's changed. STEVE EICHENBAUM, Eichenbaum/Associates Inc., Milwaukee 
Jerry is safe, solid and smooth. He has no edge. His humor and style does not challenge the listener. Rather, he lulls his audience to a laugh -- perfect for prime-time sitcom television and his safe stand-up. Don Rickles, George Carlin, Jack Benny, George Burns and Groucho Marx never retired.

IS THE CURE FOR CANCER INSIDE YOU?
I was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in early 2010 at age 42. I had no risk factors. I received conventional treatment: chemo, radiation and surgery. And I'm alive and disease-free almost three years after my diagnosis. Part of the problem with pancreatic cancer is the defeatist attitudes of many oncologists. Instead of suggesting your readers grasp at therapies that are extremely unlikely to provide any benefit, you should emphasize the importance of being treated at a major cancer center. STACY JORGENSEN, Honolulu, posted on nytimes.com
Like Ralph Steinman, I was shocked when I was diagnosed earlier this year with pancreatic cancer and realized there was a dearth of quality treatment options. I ended up having the barbaric surgery described in the article (it's called the Whipple procedure) and then six months of chemotherapy. While I show no sign of disease 11 months after being diagnosed, the odds are that it will come back -- likely before these immunological treatments become widely available. But I remain hopeful that the work done by Steinman and others may develop something that will help people affected by this disease in years to come. THOM MROZEK, Pasadena, Calif., posted on nytimes.com
GOD SAVE THE BRITISH ECONOMY
For a clearheaded explanation of why massive spending cuts would likely injure the United States, not fix it, look no further than Adam Davidson's piece on Adam Posen, who, until very recently, was a key British central bank economist (and the only American to serve in that capacity). Posen would regularly speak out against the United Kingdom's massive austerity program. . . . Davidson minces no words about whether Posen's Keynesian-driven theorems can find a place in America: ''Doing neither stimulus nor austerity -- which is basically what's happening in the United States -- isn't working, either. So, [Posen] says, let's try stimulus, even if we don't know for sure it'll do the job.'' What Posen offers is a different prescription for achieving better health. One that won't sting as much. ABRAM BROWN, on forbes.com
Adam Davidson and his subject, Adam Posen, go round and round the puzzle: will a sluggish economy spark through stimulus or austerity? But both seem to miss a critical point -- the British and the American economies are international. Their workers are not restricted to their borders. So the observation that ''companies will fire workers when they become less productive and hire them when they become more productive'' is true. American companies hire millions of Chinese workers and that economy is booming. Pump priming or belt tightening won't change that. CHRISTOPHER KING, Sherborn, Mass.

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Begins Soul-Searching After Tax Vote

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and JIM RUTENBERG; Michael D. Shear reported from Washington, and Jim Rutenberg from New York.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- When Republican leaders in Congress agreed to raise taxes on the wealthy last week, it left the increasingly fractured and feuding party unified on perhaps only one point: that it is at a major crossroads.
From Mitt Romney's loss on Election Day through the recent tax fight that shattered party discipline in the House of Representatives, Republicans have seen the foundations of their political strategy called into question, stirring a newly urgent debate about how to reshape and redefine their party.
At issue immediately is whether that can be achieved through a shift in tactics and tone, or will instead require a deeper rethinking of the party's longtime positions on bedrock issues like guns and immigration. President Obama intends to test the willingness of Republicans to bend on those issues in the first months of his new term, when he plans to push for stricter gun control and a comprehensive immigration overhaul.
The coming legislative battles are certain to expose even more division in the party. And with establishment Republicans and Tea Party activists at times speaking as if they are from different parties altogether, concern is spreading throughout the ranks that things could get worse before they get better. 
''The Republican Party can't stay exactly where it is and stick its head in the sand and ignore the fact that the country is changing,'' said Ralph Reed, the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and onetime leader of the Christian Coalition. ''On the other hand, if the party were to retreat on core, pro-family stands and its positions on fiscal responsibility and taxes, it could very quickly find itself without a strong demographic support base.''
Having lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections, Republicans now face a country that is increasingly younger, multiethnic and skeptical of Republican positions on some social issues. The party's deficit-cutting agenda relies heavily on reducing taxes for the wealthy, which irks middle-class voters, and cutting spending on government programs, like Social Security and Medicare, that are popular with many voters.
Generational change is also robbing the party of some of its most effective political positions. Same-sex marriage, which less than a decade ago was an issue that reliably drove conservative voters to the polls in favor of Republicans, appears to be losing its potency with an electorate increasingly comfortable with gay unions.
None other than Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker who promised to fight for a constitutional ban against same-sex marriage during the Republican presidential primaries, now says his party must come to terms with the country's rapidly shifting views on the subject.
''Walking around and pretending it doesn't exist just means you're going to become irrelevant,'' Mr. Gingrich said in an interview.
Prominent Republicans insist that if the party's disparate factions can come together around a set of economic, social and foreign policy principles in the coming years, they stand a good chance of retaking the presidency, making gains in Congress and repairing some of the damage done through several years of bitter primary battles and divisive legislative bickering.
''Republicans will get their mojo back when they define themselves as the party of economic growth and upward mobility,'' said Gov. Mitch Daniels of Indiana, a Republican who will become the president of Purdue University next week. Mr. Daniels said new lawmakers and governors -- many of whom are minorities and women -- would reshape the Republican Party.
''The party, with all its problems -- and I'm not disputing them -- has a really large and interesting crop of new faces,'' he said. ''Ultimately, parties tend to be defined by their most visible personalities.''
Republicans have already demonstrated success in midterm elections, when fewer people vote, and in state elections for governorships and legislatures. In North Carolina, Pat McCrory, a Republican former mayor of Charlotte, was sworn in as governor on Saturday after waging a campaign that emphasized pragmatism over ideology.
''My message remained a Republican message,'' Mr. McCrory said, suggesting that national Republicans could learn a lesson from state politicians. ''But I did it with a tone of problem solving. I did it with a tone of cooperation. I didn't run one negative ad.''
But a changed tone alone may not do enough to smooth over the very real disagreements in the Republican Party. And it is not clear how the intraparty combatants can meet in the middle. For example, while some Republicans argued that the tax vote last week enshrined almost all of the Bush-era tax cuts into permanent law and should be seen as a victory, harder-line fiscal conservatives called it a shameful departure from the party's two decades of successful opposition to tax increases.
Clashes between Tea Party supporters in the House and Speaker John A. Boehner during the budget battles last year led a dozen of them to withhold their votes for speaker last week.
And across the country, deeply conservative organizations angry about the concession on tax increases are pledging more, not fewer, primary challenges to Republicans they believe are straying too far from the party's orthodoxy on taxes, guns, energy, immigration, spending and abortion.
''The gloves are off,'' said Everett Wilkinson, a founder of the Tea Party movement in Florida. ''We're going to challenge a lot of the G.O.P. going forward,'' he added, both in primaries and general elections.
Moderate Republicans are bracing for the challenges. Steven C. LaTourette, who retired from his Ohio Congressional seat at the end of the year and will become the president of the Republican Main Street Partnership, said his group would raise money to defend middle-of-the-road Republicans against the more conservative groups.
''There has to be an acceptance within the party of people who have nonidentical views on every issue,'' Mr. LaTourette said. ''You can't be a national party unless you invite in and are accepting of members with different visions. You can't treat them as pariahs.''
As the new year begins, some of the party's leaders in Washington are searching for ways to address the philosophical divide and the structural changes in the country that have caused such problems.
Some are talking about the need to find a positive vision and agenda that represents conservative values but still speaks more directly to the concerns of a broad section of voters -- and manages to sell that vision through leaders who can convince voters that the party wants to move forward and not back.
Former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, a Texas Republican who retired this year, said Republicans must shift their focus away from issues like abortion, same-sex marriage, gun rights and immigration.
''The combination of our fiscal responsibility message and the social issue message did not bring together a majority'' in the presidential election, she said. ''It's not so much coming to the middle. It's letting people have various views on personal issues and not requiring complete fealty to all of those issues in a way that will drive people off.''
Other leaders have urgently ordered top-to-bottom reviews to determine how the party lost touch with the most important and fastest-growing voting blocs, including women and Hispanics, and how it can win them over by the 2014 midterm elections.
It is now accepted in the party that it has failed to keep up with Democrats in the competition for ascendant voting blocs of Hispanics, African-Americans, Asians and young people. Although exit polls showed that Mr. Romney won nearly 60 percent of the white vote, Mr. Obama won more than 70 percent of Asians and Hispanics and more than 90 percent of black voters.
''If there's one conclusion that's going to come out of this process, it's that we have to be much more granular in our approach to partners in the community like African-Americans, Hispanics and Asians,'' said Reince Priebus, the Republican National Committee chairman, who is overseeing one of the most ambitious review efforts.

HEADLINE: In Texas, Resistance to a Renewed Call for an Annual Roundup of Legislators

BYLINE: By MANNY FERNANDEZ

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex. -- Long before lawmakers prepared to gather at the sand-colored Capitol here on Tuesday for the opening day of the legislative session, State Representative Richard Peña Raymond had already filed a little-noticed bill to drastically change not only how they conduct business, but also how often.
Texas is one of only four states whose legislatures convene in regular session every two years. Lawmakers in Texas meet in odd-numbered years only -- as do legislators in Montana, Nevada and North Dakota -- while those in the 46 other states hold legislative sessions yearly, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. 
Mr. Raymond's bill would require the Texas Legislature to meet in regular session in odd-numbered years and to hold a budget session in even-numbered years. The move would mean annual meetings and budgets, an idea that has been debated for decades but has long been viewed with suspicion in a place that prizes small government, low taxes and deregulation.
''As big a budget as we have, as big a state as we are, as diverse of an economy as we have, we really should be looking at annual budgets,'' said Mr. Raymond, a Democrat from Laredo and a former member of the Appropriations Committee, which writes the budget. ''There's no business in the private sector that does two-year budgets. It's a very outdated idea.''
In Texas, the biennial sessions unfold quickly -- beginning at noon on the second Tuesday in January and ending in May after a 140-day run. It is a tradition dating back 137 years, when the State Constitution was ratified and required the Legislature to meet every two years.
Although the state's population has grown in that time to nearly 26 million people from about 1 million, Texas has held on to the biennial tradition. Several Republican lawmakers and conservative activists said it suited them, and the political culture, just fine.
They described Mr. Raymond's bill -- his third attempt to change the system since the 2009 session -- as a long shot at best. Republicans control both chambers of the Legislature, and even if the bill were to pass, a constitutional amendment changing the legislative schedule to annual sessions would have to be approved by Texas voters before it could take effect.
''There's not a single Republican who would vote for that,'' said Steve Ogden, a Republican senator from Bryan who was preparing to officially retire on Tuesday after 22 years in the Legislature. ''I think one of the reasons that Texas does as well as it does is because the Legislature meets as infrequently as it does. In a state that believes in limited government, I think it works well for us.''
Gov. Rick Perry, a Republican, appeared to agree with Mr. Ogden. ''The governor believes we need to limit government in people's lives, not expand it,'' said Lucy Nashed, a spokeswoman for Mr. Perry. ''A part-time Legislature allows lawmakers to come in and complete the business of Texans and then go out and live under the laws that they've passed.''
As with other state issues, the debate over biennial sessions falls along party lines. Republicans argue that meeting every other year prevents the Legislature from passing frivolous bills, forces lawmakers to focus under considerable deadline pressure and keeps part-time legislators from becoming full-time politicians.
Some Democrats and political scientists say the infrequency of the sessions increases the power of the governor and state agencies because of a lack of oversight. They also say it makes the budget process a difficult task amid ever-changing national and state economies. (This session, lawmakers will adopt a budget for the 2014 and 2015 fiscal years.)
''It's very fast-paced and tumultuous and inefficient to have a short 140-day session every other year in a state as big and as complex as Texas,'' said Calvin Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. ''You're trying to budget and anticipate revenues and the need for expenditures 30 months out, and that's very difficult to do.''
Lawmakers, of course, work more often than the legislative schedule implies. Mr. Perry has used his power to call special sessions several times during his 12 years as governor. In even-numbered years, the Capitol does not shut down, but hums quietly with committee hearings. But unlike lawmakers in California, New York and other large states, Texas legislators have the populist distinction, and pay, that come from being part-timers.
Members of the House and the Senate are paid $7,200 annually. A per diem for living expenses during the sessions stands at $150 but will most likely rise to $179 through a vote this month by the Texas Ethics Commission. Legislators spend at least part of their time focused on other jobs. Many are lawyers, and others are ranchers, business consultants, insurance agents and pharmacists.
Cindy Burkett, a Republican representative from Mesquite, oversees a company that operates Subway sandwich shops. Charles Anderson, a Republican representative who is known as Doc, is a longtime veterinarian. (He planned to be at the Capitol for opening day on Tuesday and back at his practice in Waco later in the week.) Several conservatives said in effect that they want Dr. Anderson to spend as much time on his clients as he does on legislative bills.
''The California Legislature meets, I think, 30 hours a day, 9 days a week, 412 days a year, and they seem to invent new ways to cause problems for their citizens,'' said Michael Quinn Sullivan, the president of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility. ''The last thing Texas needs is a Legislature that meets more often.''

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senate Leader Says No to More Tax Revenue

BYLINE: BRIAN KNOWLTON


HIGHLIGHT: The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, made clear in three television appearances that he would oppose any effort by the Obama administration to further increase tax revenue and that he remained focused on finding ways to cut spending as the government grapples with debilitating debt. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, made clear on Sunday that he would oppose any effort by the Obama administration to raise more tax revenue and that he remained focused on finding ways to cut spending as the government grapples with its debt.
"The tax issue is finished," Mr. McConnell said on the ABC News program "This Week." "Over. Completed. That's behind us." 
Mr. McConnell's interviews on three Sunday morning programs came just days after he and Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. helped broker a resolution to the latest fiscal crisis and as Washington braced for a series of confrontations over debt and spending.
Mr. McConnell's stance on taxes countered calls from Democrats, and even some House Republicans, to revamp the tax code to close some provisions and raise new revenue. But Mr. McConnell did say he would favor changes if they were "revenue neutral," meaning that lower rates would be paid for by limiting deductions and closing loopholes.
Mr. McConnell's focus on the need for spending cuts was relentless in his interviews on ABC, NBC and CBS. He was equally insistent that President Obama must take the lead on fiscal plans.
His remarks stood in contrast to comments from the Senate's No. 2 Democrat, Richard J. Durbin of Illinois, who said on the CNN program "State of the Union" that there was plenty of room to increase revenue by examining "deductions, credits, special treatments under the tax code."
Mr. McConnell's position also contrasted with remarks on Saturday by Mr. Obama, who said in his weekly address that he remained open to both spending cuts and further tax increases. The fiscal agreement last week made tax cuts permanent for most households and put off big spending cuts.
Mr. Obama, who was speaking from Hawaii before returning to Washington on Sunday, emphasized his own line in the sand. Now that the government has reached its statutory borrowing limit, Mr. Obama said, Congress had no choice but to raise it to avoid a damaging default. He said the matter was not up for negotiation.
"If Congress refuses to give the United States the ability to pay its bills on time, the consequences for the entire global economy could be catastrophic," Mr. Obama said. "Our families and our businesses cannot afford that dangerous game again."
Mr. McConnell repeatedly sidestepped questions about whether he supported Republican senators who have suggested that a default - and even a brief shutdown of the government - might be necessary to secure deep spending cuts.
"My answer is hopefully we don't need to get to that point," he said on ABC. "The president surely must know we're spending way too much. So why don't we do something about reducing spending?"
Mr. McConnell also suggested that other Obama administration priorities, including a new push for gun restrictions after the Connecticut school shooting, might have to wait.
Mr. McConnell was asked about reports that Mr. Biden, whom Mr. Obama charged with developing proposals to address gun violence, had confidently predicted the passage of gun-control legislation this month.
Mr. McConnell seemed to cast cold water on that notion.
"The biggest problem we have at the moment is spending and debt," he said. "That's going to dominate the Congress between now and the end of March. None of these issues, I think, will have the kind of priority that spending and debt will have."

HIGHLIGHT: The American Prospect is subletting part of its Washington offices to The American Conservative. 

 BODY:
The financial crisis did not bring bipartisanship to Congress, but a difficult media environment may have brought that spirit to two political standard-bearers.
In need of cash and with extra space on its hands, the liberal magazine The American Prospect decided to sublet part of its Washington offices. The American Conservative, tired of working from Arlington, Va., was looking for a new location. When the publishers Jay Harris of The Prospect and Wick Allison of The Conservative were getting lunch in August, they put two and two together. 
A six-month lease was soon signed. The self-described bastion of "traditional conservatism" moved in with the self-described "liberal, progressive, lefty" on Dec. 27. 
"We have a water fountain labeled conservatives only," joked Mr. Harris, who cleared the idea with his staff. "We turned to the staff and said, 'Would you be comfortable?' To a person, the folks who responded said, 'Our values are pretty different, but we have a lot of respect for what The American Conservative does journalistically.' "
What they lack in ideological viewpoint, the two nonprofit monthlies make up for in an independent, establishment-bucking mind-set. Each has faced the sort of downsizing that has become all too common in the print world.
The American Conservative, founded in 2002 by Pat Buchanan, ran biweekly before it went out of print for six weeks in 2009 and returned as a monthly magazine. It has a circulation of 8,000. The American Prospect, in print since 1990, announced to its staff in April that if the magazine could not find $500,000 in financing, it would close altogether by the end of May. With help from good publicity from Prospect alumni and a few large donors - and by shrinking its staff by four - the bimonthly magazine has endured. The publication has combined paid print and digital circulation of nearly 45,000. The Conservative's seven staff members will share the white-walled, blue-carpeted 12th floor of 1710 Rhode Island Avenue with The Prospect's fund-raising and advertising departments. They must share a conference room, a potential source of conflict, though Mr. Harris says it could be a site for events the magazines co-host.
Daniel McCarthy, The Conservative's associate editor, said the new locale suits its independent outlook.
"Where we had been," Mr. McCarthy said of the office in Arlington, "was sort of a hotbed of lobbyists and defense contractors. People who represent a different side of Washington."
Maisie Allison, a Web editor at The Conservative, said the shared space would help both magazines.
"Since we do not directly compete, we can only benefit from sharing ideas, formally and informally," she said. "They have a bunch of magazine covers on the wall; we're going to get some of ours up soon."

HEADLINE: The Political Realignment on Full Display

BYLINE: ALBERT R. HUNT


HIGHLIGHT: The vote on the legislation to avert the fiscal cliff revealed how the parties and the country have changed -- and how fraught the crucial votes over the coming months will be. 

 BODY:
The House Republicans' vote on the fiscal cliff deal, in which a solid majority of party members went against their speaker, reflects the conservative and Southern drift of recent decades. 
"On the fiscal deal, his own majority leader and whip deserted him, as did seven current committee chairmen and almost two-thirds of his caucus," as I write in my latest Letter From Washington.
But the regional realignment, visible in where the votes came from and where they didn't, portends much more dangerous territory - and consequences - in the votes to come.
Lawmakers are braced for a tougher battle in the next two months over the debt ceiling and across-the-board spending cuts that neither side likes... The White House believes Republican leaders privately realize that holding the nation's full faith and credit hostage to cutting popular programs is a loser. Congressional Republicans dismiss Mr. Obama's lines in the sand, saying that he invariably backs down and that any economic fallout ultimately hurts his presidency.
What the vote last week tells us about the votes to come: The deal passed the House, 256 to 173, with most Democrats in favor. It was brought to the floor with the support of Speaker John Boehner yet the Republican rank and file voted 151 to 77 against it.
More than half the votes against the Boehner-backed measure came from representatives from the 11 Southern states of the old Confederacy. These states were once solidly Democratic. Now Republicans command big majorities in each of these House delegations. These members voted 78 to 12 against the debt package.
Conversely, representatives from large non-Southern states stuck with the speaker. Republican members from California, New York, New Jersey and Illinois voted 30 to 12 for the fiscal package.
The clout of these big-state Republican delegations has declined dramatically as the Southern influence in the party increases. A little more than 30 years ago, when President Ronald Reagan took office, the California House delegation was almost evenly divided; today, the Democrats hold a 39 to 14 advantage. The small margin in New York the Democrats had then has widened to 21 to 6. There are no Republican House members from any of the six New England states in the new Congress.
It's the opposite situation in the South. In 1981, 19 of the 24 Texas House members were Democrats; today, the Republicans hold a 24 to 12 advantage. The same trend is apparent in Florida, where Democrats dominated 11 to 4, and Republicans now have a 17 to 10 advantage.

Primary Stages is to announce on Monday that the world premiere of a new play written by and starring Charles Busch will be among the productions in the 2013-14 season. Mr. Busch's untitled comedy, scheduled to have its premiere next January, sounds as if it will fit among the rest of a farcical oeuvre that includes ''The Tale of the Allergist's Wife'' and ''You Should Be So Lucky.'' He will play an unemployed female impersonator who steals the identity of his recently deceased landlord to remain in her Greenwich Village town house. Primary Stages will also mount the New York premiere of ''Harbor,'' a comedy by Chad Beguelin (''The Wedding Singer'') and directed by Mark Lamos (''Black Tie''), from July through September 2013. And the world premiere of ''The Yankees,'' written and directed by Eric Simonson (''Lombardi''), following the career of Yogi Berra, will run this September and October.

HEADLINE: McConnell Takes Taxes Off the Table In New Talks

WASHINGTON -- The Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, made clear on Sunday that he would oppose any effort by the Obama administration to raise more tax revenue and that he remained focused on finding ways to cut spending as the government grapples with its debt.

HEADLINE: Drilling Far From Imminent, But Debate Roils a Region

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES

 BODY:
ONEONTA, N.Y. -- If Otsego County were Hollywood, then its debate over hydraulic fracturing, the contentious method of drilling for natural gas, would be resolved as it is in the movie ''Promised Land,'' which opened here over the weekend at the Southside Mall. That is, a good-looking representative of a villainous gas company would dupe the townspeople into selling him their mineral rights, only to repent after deciding that his employer was bad and fracking, as it is known, potentially worse. And this would win him the heart of the prettiest teacher at the local elementary school.
Instead, people here are not following the script. 
Natural gas companies have yet to flock to this region at the foot of the Catskills, and truth be told, drilling is more of a distant possibility than an imminent event, since a state decision on whether to allow the process is still pending. But the debate between supporters and critics is so caustic it is as if rigs were already sinking pipe into every farm and backyard.
On the movie's first day, about 50 people from this area of 21,000 appeared for the four showings, a ''good, but not great'' turnout, one theater worker said. But they were a magnet for environmentalists who believe that landowners wanting to sell exploration rights to gas companies are bent on despoiling the pristine farms and foothills that ring the town.
''When the gas comes up here, there isn't going to be anything left,'' said Barbara Loeffler, a retired farmer whose pickup is covered with antifracking slogans. ''I own some land in Pennsylvania, and I've learned some things. If what's going on there comes to this area, that's the end of it.''
Dan Mark Sr., a retired environmental health and safety inspector, was one of 15 ticket holders at the first showing of ''Promised Land'' on Friday. ''If you look at the movie, it's a feeling people here have had for a long time,'' he said. ''People here want to hold on to what they have. The other side, they want money.''
On that other side, Dick Downey, the 78-year-old head of a landowner's association, said he would not pay a cent to see ''Promised Land'' lest the money enrich its backers.
''The evil gas company against the noble environmentalists isn't what's happening,'' he said. ''That's a Hollywood construct. What's really happening is, people up here with land who want to develop it against people who are quite comfortable and don't want any disturbance.
''There's a lot of charlatans on the other side. They're not telling the truth a lot of the time.''
Truthful or not, the opponents of hydraulic fracturing are winning. Otsego County, like much of south-central New York, sits atop the Marcellus Shale formation, a gas-rich sheet of rock that underlies much of the Appalachian Basin. In Pennsylvania, where fracking is already under way, some landowners have made a comfortable living by allowing drilling on their property.
But the critics' case against the process -- that land and groundwater can be poisoned by the chemical cocktail that is forced into the earth to fracture the shale and free the gas -- is carrying the day. The number of Otsego towns with bans or moratoriums on fracking has risen in just 18 months to nine, from five, including the city of Oneonta and the surrounding town. And the share of the land under lease to gas companies for future exploration has dropped as well.
''Leases have been expiring,'' said Adrian Kuzminski, the moderator at Sustainable Otsego, a social network with several hundred subscribers. ''A couple of these companies have gone bankrupt, and others have pulled out. So there's a deceleration in activity.''
But the movement has not relented. At the Southside Mall, ''Promised Land'' viewers wore buttons against hydraulic fracturing, and windows throughout the town display signs warning of its alleged environmental consequences. Proponents have responded with homemade placards extolling the virtues of gas: ''Let's boost our local economy'' and ''Support safe drilling and pipelines, jobs.''
Despite their critics' accusations, landowners in favor of the process say they are not pawns of the gas industry. Rather, they see drilling bans as an infringement on their property rights, and drilling itself as the economic savior of a region they say is on the skids.
Anna Marie Lusins was for years a member of the Oneonta Town Board. ''I've seen a gradual decline,'' she said. ''Though we've seen an increase in retail space, I see a decline in schools. Our young people are going away. We need the economic development that will come with gas.''
Mr. Downey of the Unatego Area Landowners Association said that contrary to critics' assumptions, landowners wanted strict regulation of hydraulic fracturing and stiff punishment for any environmental damage it might cause. Indeed, he said, gas may be the only way to preserve the area's rural nature.
''You have people here who used to farm, and they don't farm now because they can't make a living at it,'' he said. ''The land's been in their family for six, seven generations. They'd love to go back to farming but they can't. But if they have the money from gas, they can.''
Regardless of how likely or remote the chances of victory -- or how close or distant the prospect of an actual well -- neither side has any plans to stop.
''We've won the campaign for public opinion,'' said Mr. Kuzminski, of Sustainable Otsego. ''But that's just a battle. It's not the war.''

HEADLINE: Critics of Google Antitrust Ruling Fault the Focus

BYLINE: By EDWARD WYATT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- One of the more surprising conclusions drawn by the Federal Trade Commission when it dropped its nearly two-year antitrust investigation into Google last week was that Google, far from harming consumers, had actually helped them.
But some critics of the inquiry now contend that the commission found no harm in Google's actions because it was looking at the wrong thing.
Instead of considering harm to people who come to Google to search for information, Google's competitors and their supporters say that the government should have been looking at whether Google's actions harmed its real customers -- the companies that pay billions of dollars each year to advertise on Google's site.
In its reports, the F.T.C. did not detail how it defined harm or what quantitative measures it had used to determine that Google users were better off. 
But interviews with people on all sides of the investigation -- government officials, Google supporters, advocates for Microsoft and other competitors, and antitrust experts and economists -- show that many of the yardsticks the commission used to measure its outcomes were remarkably similar to Google's own. Not surprisingly, they cast Google in a favorable light.
At issue were changes that Google made in recent years to its popular search page. Google makes frequent adjustments to the formulas that determine what results are generated when a user enters a search. Currently, it makes more than 500 changes a year, or more than one each day.
Users rarely notice the changes in the formulas, or algorithms, that generate search results, but businesses do. If a change in the formulas causes a business to rank lower in the order of results generated by a search, it is likely to miss potential customers.
What customers are now seeing reflects changes in the format of Google results. For certain categories of searches -- travel information, shopping comparisons and financial data, for example -- Google has begun presenting links to its own related services.
People close to the investigation said that Google had presented the F.T.C. with the results of tests with focus groups hired by an outside firm to review different versions of a Google search results page. After Google acquired ITA, a travel search business, in 2011, it began testing a new way to display flight results.
The company asked test users to compare side-by-side examples of a results page with just the familiar 10 blue links to specialty travel sites with a page that had at the top a box containing direct links to airlines and fares.
People who reviewed the Google data said tests with hundreds of people showed that fewer than one in five users preferred the page with links only. Users said they liked the box of flight results, so Google reasoned that making the change was better for the consumer.
''There is a deep science to search evaluation,'' Amit Singhal, a senior vice president who oversees Google's search operation, said in an interview on Friday. ''A lot of work goes into every change we make.''
But the changes were not better for companies or alternative travel sites that were pushed off the first page of results by Google's flight box and associated links. By pushing links to competing sites lower, Google might be making things easier for people who come to it for free search. But it also is having a negative effect on competitors, shutting off traffic for those sites.
Drawing fewer customers as a result of Google's free links, those competitors are forced to advertise more to draw traffic. And advertisers who aren't competitors have fewer places to go to reach consumers, meaning Google can use its market power to raise advertising prices.
''There might be no consumer harm if Google eliminates Yelp,'' said one Microsoft advocate, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the likelihood of further interactions with the F.T.C. ''But advertisers certainly are harmed.''
Google's suggestion that the correct way to measure the benefit of a design change was through user appreciation seemed to strike a chord with the commission. In its statement explaining why it took no action against Google on search bias, the F.T.C. said that ''the documents, testimony and qualitative evidence the commission examined are largely consistent with the conclusion that Google likely benefited consumers by prominently displaying its vertical content on its search results page.''
F.T.C. officials said they considered data from a wide range of sources -- those with interests aligned with Google as well as against it. The officials also bought quantitative data about Internet usage and conducted interviews with experts who were independent of all sides.
None of the data was taken strictly at face value, Howard Shelanski, director of the F.T.C.'s Bureau of Economics, said in an interview. ''We kick the tires hard on all of the data we receive.''
While some of Google's competitors might have suffered when Google made changes to the way it generated and displayed search results, the F.T.C. said, ''the totality of the evidence'' showed that ''any negative impact on actual or potential competitors was incidental.''
The five commissioners at the F.T.C. voted unanimously not to pursue a case accusing Google of using unfair competition to enhance its search business. One of those commissioners, however, warned that there was little to prevent Google from misrepresenting the value of the changes it made to its search methods.
That commissioner, J. Thomas Rosch, a Republican who criticized the F.T.C.'s decision not to seek a court order preventing Google from certain actions, said, ''Nothing in this 'settlement' prevents Google from telling 'half truths' -- for example, that its gathering of information about the characteristics of a consumer is done solely for the consumer's benefit, instead of also to maintain a monopoly or near monopoly position.''
Google's interest in maintaining its market dominance -- it accounts for about 70 percent of all searches in the United States -- goes beyond its dedication to improving the experience for users, of course.
Jon Leibowitz, the F.T.C. chairman, said that while ''some evidence suggested that Google was trying to eliminate competition,'' that was not necessarily illegal. ''Some may believe the commission should have done more in this case, because they are locked in hand-to-hand combat with Google around the world and have the mistaken belief that criticizing us will influence the outcome in other jurisdictions,'' he said.
The commissioners also appeared to view Google's changes to its results pages as a design issue as much as an antitrust one. ''Product design is an important dimension of competition,'' the commission wrote, ''and condemning legitimate product improvements risks harming consumers.''

HEADLINE: Schools of Design Extend Their Reach Into Asia

BYLINE: By KELLY WETHERILLE

 BODY:
More Western education institutions are looking to open up in Asia -- and U.S. art and design schools are no exception. While the potential for growth is huge, given Asia's rising creative industries, the actual logistics can be complicated.
The Savannah College of Art and Design opened a campus in September 2010 in Sham Shui Po, a district of Hong Kong, after extensive research on opportunities in Asia. The school spent 250 million Hong Kong dollars, or $32 million, of its own capital to revitalize the former North Kowloon Magistracy building, which it received from the Hong Kong government in 2009 amid some controversy that the heritage site was given to a foreign school instead of a local group. 
''SCAD sees in Asia an increasing demand for and appreciation of art and design talents with a global perspective in fields ranging from digital media to fashion design and luxury management,'' Grant Preisser, associate vice president of SCAD Hong Kong, said by e-mail.
''It makes perfect sense for us to be in Asia, as many of our graduates will be looking to develop creative careers here,'' he said. ''Hong Kong is a sophisticated, international city with strong market growth and an ongoing need for creative talent.''
Having a presence in Asia can also benefit students at the school's main campuses in Atlanta and Savannah, Georgia. (It also has a study-abroad location in Lacoste, France).
Still, SCAD Hong Kong had trouble with recruitment in the beginning. According to The South China Morning Post, it opened in 2010 with only 141 students, or less than half its initial target of 300. At full capacity, the school could hold up to 800 students.
Last autumn, it got its total student enrollment up to 330. About 60 percent are from Hong Kong, and 40 percent from 15 other countries and territories.
Parsons The New School for Design, based in New York, is exploring initiatives in Asia that, unlike SCAD, will not require significant monetary investment. It has signed a cooperation agreement with a design education center in Shanghai established by Shanghai Textile Group Holdings, or Shangtex, which will allow it to offer programs there. The school has been given a floor in Shangtex's corporate campus, where there will also be space for other design institutions like Esmod International, a Paris-based network of fashion institutes from all over the world.
A timeline has not yet been established for when courses would start at this center, but under consideration are summer and winter intensive courses for Parsons students, continuing and professional education programs and a program that would provide English-language instruction for those looking to enter design fields.
''The rapidly expanding interaction between cultures, markets and world regions has revolutionized the practice of design,'' David E. Van Zandt, president of the New School, wrote by e-mail. ''Design, while increasingly global, is also rooted in local cultures and social practices.''
''In order to thrive in this new global environment, students must be able to synthesize these often-differing perspectives into their own practice,'' he added.
Mr. Van Zandt said Parsons was in discussions with a new design school in Mumbai, though he would not comment on details. While this would not be a Parsons operation, Parsons could help with curriculum development and faculty training. Parsons students could potentially have the opportunity to study in India and vice versa.
Parsons also announced in November that it would open a new center in Paris this coming autumn.
Like any major undertaking, establishing overseas campuses and programs take time. SCAD Hong Kong is one of few cross-border design schools that are actually up and running in Asia.
''As Asia's role continues to grow in the global economy, businesses and industries will increasingly need to design with the Asian consumers in mind, not just in terms of products, but also marketing communications,'' Mr. Preisser of SCAD said. ''And, as more and more international brands extend their footprint and presence in Asia, they will be looking for design talents trained in Asia and attuned to the Asian marketplace.''
There are a few other Western players. Esmod already has branches in Tokyo, Osaka, Seoul, Beijing and Jakarta.
And there are signs that Asian schools might cross borders regionally: Bunka Fashion College, based in Tokyo, plans to open a branch in Dalian, China, though no dates are set. Still, these programs are reasonably small or still in development.
''Asia is at a different stage of evolution in design education than the United States and Europe, which is why these countries have approached us with these types of opportunities, and why for many years their students have come to the U.S. and Europe to study,'' Mr. Van Zandt of Parsons said. ''As these countries continue to invest in the development of institutions for art and design education, there is certainly the potential for them to be competitive.''
One setback many may face is simple economics in a region that has some affluent cities but also many developing nations.
Tuition at SCAD's Hong Kong campus is set at the same level as that of its U.S. campuses, which may be daunting to many students in the greater Southeast Asian region. Providing an internationally recognized design education at locally competitive tuition rates, however, could prove to be a challenge that prevents more Western schools from expanding into Asia.
Mr. Preisser said that as of September, the university had awarded nearly 31 million Hong Kong dollars in financial aid to students at the Hong Kong campus.

HEADLINE: Ad Blocking in France Sets Off an Online Battle

BYLINE: By DAVID JOLLY

 BODY:
PARIS -- Xavier Niel, the French technology entrepreneur, has made a career of disrupting the status quo.
Now, he has dared to take on Google and other online advertisers in a battle that puts the Web companies under pressure to use the wealth generated by the ads to help pay for the network pipelines that deliver the content.
Mr. Niel's telecommunications company, Free, which has an estimated 5.2 million Internet-access users in France, began last week to enable its customers to block Web advertising. The company is updating users' software with an ad-blocking feature as the default setting. 
That move has raised alarm among companies that, like Google, have based their entire business models on providing free content to consumers by festooning Web pages with paid advertisements. Although Google so far has kept largely silent about Free's challenge, the reaction from the small Web operators who live and die by online ads has been vociferous.
No Internet access provider ''has the right to decide in place of its citizens what they access or not on the Internet,'' Spiil, an association of French online news publishers, said in a statement Friday.
The French government has stepped into the fray. On Monday Fleur Pellerin, the French minister for the digital economy, plans to convene a meeting of the feuding parties to seek a resolution.
Free's shock to advertisers was widely seen as an attack on Google, and is part of the larger, global battle over the question of who should pay to deliver information on the Web -- content providers or Internet service providers. An attempt to rewrite the rules failed at the December talks of the International Telecommunication Union in Dubai, after the United States and other nations objected to a proposal that, among other measures, would have required content providers to pay.
Mr. Niel declined to comment on Sunday, through a spokeswoman, Isabelle Audap.
But he has often complained that Google's content, which includes the ever expanding YouTube video library, occupies too much of his network's bandwidth, or carrying capacity. ''The pipelines between Google and us are full at certain hours, and no one wants to take responsibility for adding capacity,'' he said during an interview last year with the newsmagazine Nouvel Observateur. ''It's a classic problem that happens everywhere, but especially with Google.''
Analysts said that French regulators would probably not oppose an agreement between Free and Google aimed at smoothing traffic flows and improving the quality of the service, as long as competitors were not disadvantaged. But they said regulators would probably not allow an Internet access provider to unilaterally block content.
When it comes to blocking ads, though, disgruntled consumers do not have to rely on their Internet service providers. Consumers already have the option of downloading software like Adblock Plus to do the job for them.
Free is the second-largest Internet access provider in France, behind Orange, which is operated by France Telecom and has 9.8 million Internet customers. Because Free seeks to be a low-cost competitor, the company may feel itself particularly vulnerable to the expense of providing capacity to meet Internet users' ever-growing demand for streaming and downloading videos, music and the like.
Ms. Pellerin, the digital economy minister, expressed sympathy for Free's position in an interview with Le Figaro, published Saturday. ''There are today real questions about the sharing of value between the content providers -- notably in video, which uses a lot of bandwidth -- and the operators,'' she said.
''In France, and in Europe,'' Ms. Pellerin added, ''we have to find more consensual ways of integrating the giants of the Internet into national ecosystems.'' And in a subsequent Twitter message, she said she was ''no fan of intrusive advertising, but favorable to a solution of no opt-out by default.''
Google, which is currently engaged in delicate antitrust negotiations with the European Union, has been largely silent about the Free episode, appearing content to let other aggrieved parties take the lead. Al Verney, a Google spokesman in Brussels, said Sunday, ''We are aware of Free's actions and are investigating the impact.'' He declined to comment further.
Free's ad-blocking campaign began last week when it rolled out a new generation of hardware and software that enables users to block Web advertising. Free has set the ad-blocking software as the default option.
Numerama, a news site, thundered in an editorial that the move ''demonstrates the power that Internet service providers can have on the content of Web sites, and the risk it represents to democracy.'' Free, it said, ''penalizes thousands of sites that can only make it through online ads,'' including Numerama itself. Affected sites can either ''join in a game of cat and mouse with Free to escape the filter,'' it said, or ''change their business models.''
Jean-Baptiste Fontana, founder of Frequence-sud.fr, a news site, argued that smaller Web sites were being left to suffer the collateral damage, in Free's fight with Google.
On Atlantico, an online news site, Mr. Fontana wrote: ''Numerous Web sites, and particularly the online press, have worked out a moral contract with their readers: You get valuable information, we don't make you pay, because the advertisers pay for you.''
But ''should either the reader or the Internet service provider break that contract, the entire system collapses,'' Mr. Fontana continued. ''It brings us back to the economic model of the press: who pays for information?''
If nothing else, the dispute has been a publicity coup for Mr. Niel, who is the majority shareholder in Iliad, the publicly traded company that operates Free. He is also half-owner of the French daily Le Monde.
Iliad reported third-quarter revenue of &#x20ac;819 billion, or about $1.1 billion. The company's shares have gained more than 36 percent over the past year.
Mr. Niel's online business background dates to the days of the Minitel, the French precursor to the Internet in the 1980s. Then, a decade ago he upended the market with the introduction of an inexpensive broadband package offering Internet access, fixed-line telephone calls and television. Last year Iliad entered France's mobile telephone market, shattering the cozy dominance of the three established carriers with ultra-low-cost service.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Qatar Pushes for a Larger Role on the Global Stage

BYLINE: By STANLEY REED

 BODY:
LONDON -- At first glance the willingness of Al Jazeera, the satellite network owned and financed by Qatar, to pay in the neighborhood of $500 million for Current TV, Al Gore's struggling channel, seems like a vanity project. And it may turn out that way.
But in recent years Qatar has developed what is one of the more energetic and sophisticated foreign investment strategies of the Gulf oil and gas producers. Al Jazeera's expansion plan in the United States can be seen as part of its overall plan to put itself on the map and make itself heard globally. 
The Qatari leadership want to propagate ''a Qatari-sponsored narrative of events in the Middle East and elsewhere,'' said Kristian Coates Ulrichsen, a Gulf analyst at Chatham House, a London research institute. ''Being able to shape that narrative and how it is being seen in the U.S. is extremely important.''
When he overthrew his father in 1995, Qatar's ruler, Hamad bin Khalifa al Thani, took control of what was a small and vulnerable country jutting out into the Gulf from the Arabian Peninsula. He has assiduously worked to change Qatar's circumstances, most notably by bringing in partners like ExxonMobil and Royal Dutch Shell to build the liquefied natural gas installations needed to exploit Qatar's enormous North Field.
As a result, Qatar, which had been a relatively small oil producer, is now the world's dominant L.N.G. power with financial surpluses in the range of $30 billion to $40 billion a year, according to Rachel Ziemba, an analyst at Roubini Global Economics in London.
The oil and gas money has given the ruler and his key collaborator, Prime Minister Hamad bin Jassim al Thani, the means to transform the once sleepy capital, Doha, into a Dubai-like cityscape that has become a preferred location for international conferences like the recent COP 18 summit meeting and prestigious sports events like the 2022 World Cup in soccer.
Qatar is also now the world's wealthiest country per capita. Income was close to $100,000 per person in 2011, according to the C.I.A. World Factbook.
Having so much money to spend has helped make the Qataris key global deal makers in both business and politics.
''The leadership of Qatar is probably the most dynamic and ambitious of any senior leadership in the Gulf,'' Tarik Yousef, chief executive of Silatech, a Qatari nonprofit that helps young people in the Middle East set up businesses, said in an interview last year. ''They not only have ambitions and drive, but they have phenomenal financial resources.''
That ambition and drive have been conspicuously in evidence of late. In a high-profile gambit involving mediation by Tony Blair, Britain's former prime minister, Qatar helped force Glencore to increase its takeover bid last autumn for the miner Xstrata, in which Qatar's sovereign wealth fund held a large stake, increasing the price of the multibillion-dollar deal 9 percent, said Jeff Largey, an analyst at Macquarie in London.
Despite being a tightly controlled monarchy, Qatar is the only Gulf country that has enthusiastically bought into the Arab Spring revolutionary movements that have roiled the Middle East over the past two years. Qatari aid was instrumental in toppling the Libyan dictator, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, and its leadership was early in calling for the departure of President Bashar al-Assad of Syria. Qatar has backed the government of President Mohamed Morsi of Egypt with promises of billions in investment, including money for an oil refinery near Cairo.
Some of these decisions, like investing in the Xstrata deal or Qatar's supplying new capital to Britain's Barclays bank during the financial crisis -- a matter that is now under investigation in Britain -- make good business sense. So does Qatar's stake-building in major Western companies including Shell, the German construction giant Hochtief and Volkswagen. But they also help accentuate Qatar's political clout. When buying large shareholdings ''you are gaining access to a network. It's almost a means of doing politics,'' said a senior Western investment banker in the Gulf last year, who declined to be identified because it might affect his business.
Being the site of billions of dollars in investment by major oil companies including ExxonMobil, Shell and Total also enhances Qatar's relevance, as do its L.N.G. contracts with countries like Japan and China. The Qataris are thinking ''if you have many long-term partners around the world, you won't be sacrificed in a time of need,'' said Mr. Ulrichsen of Chatham House.
In this context, Al Jazeera's plan to expand in the United States may be seen as another part of Qatar's global outreach campaign, though Al Jazeera has changed its tactics from its early days.
Al Jazeera's English channel, introduced in 2006, has helped at least partially change its image from that of a network used as a vehicle by Al Qaeda and hostile to the United States to that of a professionally run news channel that has won prominent U.S. journalism prizes, including George Foster Peabody and George Polk awards last year. The Polk prize came for coverage of unrest in Bahrain, another small Gulf emirate.
''The key question is whether this is to give Al Jazeera in English more exposure in its current relatively objective form or to buy a forum for sending more of a Qatari and Arab message to U.S. viewers,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, a Gulf security expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
The English channel has struggled to find viewers in the United States. It reaches only 4.7 million homes and far fewer actual viewers. The deal for Current TV will multiply potential viewers almost tenfold. ''This is intended to be a commercial venture,'' said Stan Collender, a spokesman for the company. Al Jazeera made the purchase only after ''several years of study,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Mayhem Oozes From the Womb

BYLINE: By BEN BRANTLEY

 BODY:
Yuck, what a mess. What a sticky, goopy, embarrassing, all-over-the-place and absolutely necessary mess. This is what happens when you try to give birth to something: an original idea, a paragraph, a play, a human being. Now that the little monster has torn its way out of the womb, don't expect it to clean up after itself.
Radiohole, the Brooklyn-based experimental theater company, has dedicated much of its 14 beer-swigging years of existence to the proposition that art isn't tidy. But even theatergoers who remember this company's slobbering, caveman-style consumption of a mountain of greasy chicken (that was in ''Radiohole Is Still My Name'' in 2004) may recoil before the dripping forms of afterbirth on display in their ''Inflatable Frankenstein,'' which opened Saturday night at the Kitchen.
Yep, Frankenstein's monster, that ultimate big galoot and wayward child of one mad scientist's fevered brain, has been resurrected to give the members of Radiohole a chance to do what they do best: talk fancy, sing badly and play very inventively with both their food and their iPhones. And if you have any unkind judgments to make on these proceedings, speak fast, because the odds are that the cast will voice the same opinion long before you do. 
''Inflatable Frankenstein,'' a co-production of Performance Space 122 and the Kitchen, is one of the opening productions in a month replete with theater work that aims to stake out (or make up) new artistic frontiers. Running simultaneously in New York this January are PS 122's Coil festival (of which ''Frankenstein'' is a part) and the Under the Radar festival (which operates under the aegis of the Public Theater). And it's hard to think of a more fitting prologue to the weeks of innovation and mayhem ahead.
For this ''Frankenstein,'' like the original 1816 novel by Mary Shelley and the assorted movie adaptations and literary riffs of the succeeding couple of centuries, is all about the difficulties of the act of creation. And not just the Promethean efforts of a demented man of science to summon life in a laboratory. This show also considers the more natural (if ultimately no less complicated) and old-fashioned form of childbirth.
That's baby making as it was experienced, often tragically, by Shelley in the early 19th century and (by implication) as it has been experienced in the early 21st century by members of Radiohole. (Reference is made early to the pregnancies and progeny of participants in this show, reminding us of Radiohole's status as the reigning bougie-boho theater artists of Brooklyn.)
Then of course there is the great artistic offspring that is Shelley's ''Frankenstein, or the Modern Prometheus,'' and the many multiform descendants it spawned. The text -- if such a term can be applied to the mutable, self-destructing words that are heard in ''Inflatable Frankenstein'' -- draws from Shelley's novel; James Whale's celebrated ''Frankenstein'' movies of the 1930s; autobiographical writings by Shelley and the theoretical musings of Antonin Artaud (''Theater of Cruelty'').
These sources are discussed, with deliberately clumsy pretentiousness, in a sort of symposium that is conducted early in this hourlong show. A microphone is passed among -- and thrown and ripped from the hands of -- six performers, who talk about the genesis of the show and the personal, historical, sexual and sociological implications of the Frankenstein myth before one speaker descends into polysyllabic gobbledygook that puts a period to any serious discussion. Well, that and the viscera-pink gooey stuff that keeps dropping off the suspended bier, bearing an inhumanly human cargo, which hangs ominously above the panel.
From then on you can choose to apply or disregard whatever ideas have been bruited in this opening session. Don't look for a clear through line. Words and images, time periods and art forms, collide and go splat via production devices that are as high tech as the latest gadget from the Apple store (camera cellphones play a major role) and as low-tech as Silly Putty, or whatever that gunk is that they manufacture in a mock-TV-cooking class segment.
That sequence, by the way, perfectly captures the happy contradictions of Radiohole. Brains, we are being told, are what the troupe is whipping up for consumption, and the pliable, sticky mass that emerges is plopped on all the chefs' heads. Then, as the stuff oozes down over their faces, the image of the actor Eric Dyer (who plays the Creature, sort of, and who never stops talking) is simulcast over theirs. And voilà, an instant battalion of monsters, who might well conquer the world if they just looked a little more confident.
Other images are similarly compelling: the repeated inflation and deflation, seemingly by bicycle pump, of the stomach of Maggie Hoffman as Mary Shelley; the treadmill that churns out rubber-stamped words on plastic sheets; the flame-lapped, sheet-covered funeral pyre from which Mary speaks to the world by telephone; and, above all, the stunningly creepy, messy coup de théâtre that concludes the show, which delivers big-time on the implicit promise of its title.
None of this, let me hasten to add, ever feels slick or, for that matter, entirely professional. Line readings are usually amateur, and even the most artful illusions here call attention to their homemade manufacture. The idea of failure is built into the Radiohole aesthetic. Toward the end the troupe members sing a little ballad (off key, natch) about how they certainly haven't achieved what they set out to, and that they might as well go back to Williamsburg in shame.
But of course if you've set out to fail, and you have failed, then you've succeeded, haven't you? Unlike the previous generation of techno-savvy avant-garde theater artists, including Richard Foreman and the Wooster Group, Radiohole doesn't try to create an exquisitely self-contained parallel reality. That's a large part of its appeal to theatergoers for whom being hip means knowing that you're not hip, that the whole notion of hipness is so vieux jeu.
As for that poor old, much maligned monster, he's allowed to have the last word. Do we ''know what it's like to be a metaphor for everything?'' his disembodied voice complains wearily.
What's so liberating about Radiohole, paradoxically enough, is its awareness of being captive to its own limitations. This company turns goofy, crippling self-consciousness into a kind of redemptive grace.

HEADLINE: The Big Fail

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
San Diego
It's that time again: the annual meeting of the American Economic Association and affiliates, a sort of medieval fair that serves as a marketplace for bodies (newly minted Ph.D.'s in search of jobs), books and ideas. And this year, as in past meetings, there is one theme dominating discussion: the ongoing economic crisis.
This isn't how things were supposed to be. If you had polled the economists attending this meeting three years ago, most of them would surely have predicted that by now we'd be talking about how the great slump ended, not why it still continues. 
So what went wrong? The answer, mainly, is the triumph of bad ideas.
It's tempting to argue that the economic failures of recent years prove that economists don't have the answers. But the truth is actually worse: in reality, standard economics offered good answers, but political leaders -- and all too many economists -- chose to forget or ignore what they should have known.
The story, at this point, is fairly straightforward. The financial crisis led, through several channels, to a sharp fall in private spending: residential investment plunged as the housing bubble burst; consumers began saving more as the illusory wealth created by the bubble vanished, while the mortgage debt remained. And this fall in private spending led, inevitably, to a global recession.
For an economy is not like a household. A family can decide to spend less and try to earn more. But in the economy as a whole, spending and earning go together: my spending is your income; your spending is my income. If everyone tries to slash spending at the same time, incomes will fall -- and unemployment will soar.
So what can be done? A smaller financial shock, like the dot-com bust at the end of the 1990s, can be met by cutting interest rates. But the crisis of 2008 was far bigger, and even cutting rates all the way to zero wasn't nearly enough.
At that point governments needed to step in, spending to support their economies while the private sector regained its balance. And to some extent that did happen: revenue dropped sharply in the slump, but spending actually rose as programs like unemployment insurance expanded and temporary economic stimulus went into effect. Budget deficits rose, but this was actually a good thing, probably the most important reason we didn't have a full replay of the Great Depression.
But it all went wrong in 2010. The crisis in Greece was taken, wrongly, as a sign that all governments had better slash spending and deficits right away. Austerity became the order of the day, and supposed experts who should have known better cheered the process on, while the warnings of some (but not enough) economists that austerity would derail recovery were ignored. For example, the president of the European Central Bank confidently asserted that ''the idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect.''
Well, someone was incorrect, all right.
Of the papers presented at this meeting, probably the biggest flash came from one by Olivier Blanchard and Daniel Leigh of the International Monetary Fund. Formally, the paper represents the views only of the authors; but Mr. Blanchard, the I.M.F.'s chief economist, isn't an ordinary researcher, and the paper has been widely taken as a sign that the fund has had a major rethinking of economic policy.
For what the paper concludes is not just that austerity has a depressing effect on weak economies, but that the adverse effect is much stronger than previously believed. The premature turn to austerity, it turns out, was a terrible mistake.
I've seen some reporting describing the paper as an admission from the I.M.F. that it doesn't know what it's doing. That misses the point; the fund was actually less enthusiastic about austerity than other major players. To the extent that it says it was wrong, it's also saying that everyone else (except those skeptical economists) was even more wrong. And it deserves credit for being willing to rethink its position in the light of evidence.
The really bad news is how few other players are doing the same. European leaders, having created Depression-level suffering in debtor countries without restoring financial confidence, still insist that the answer is even more pain. The current British government, which killed a promising recovery by turning to austerity, completely refuses to consider the possibility that it made a mistake.
And here in America, Republicans insist that they'll use a confrontation over the debt ceiling -- a deeply illegitimate action in itself -- to demand spending cuts that would drive us back into recession.
The truth is that we've just experienced a colossal failure of economic policy -- and far too many of those responsible for that failure both retain power and refuse to learn from experience.

HEADLINE: Catholic Education, In Need of Salvation

BYLINE: By PATRICK J. McCLOSKEY and JOSEPH CLAUDE HARRIS. 
Patrick J. McCloskey, a project director at the Center for Catholic School Effectiveness at Loyola University Chicago, is the author of ''The Street Stops Here: A Year at a Catholic High School in Harlem.'' Joseph Claude Harris is a financial analyst and the author of ''The Cost of Catholic Parishes and Schools.''

 BODY:
CATHOLIC parochial education is in crisis. More than a third of parochial schools in the United States closed between 1965 and 1990, and enrollment fell by more than half. After stabilizing in the 1990s, enrollment has plunged despite strong demand from students and families.
Closings of elementary and middle schools have become a yearly ritual in the Northeast and Midwest, home to two-thirds of the nation's Catholic schools. Last year, the Archdiocese of Philadelphia closed one-fifth of its elementary schools. Cardinal Timothy M. Dolan, the archbishop of New York, is expected to decide soon whether to shut 26 elementary schools and one high school, less than three years after the latest closings. Catholic high schools have held on, but their long-term future is in question. 
This isn't for want of students. Almost 30 percent of Catholic schools have waiting lists, even after sharp tuition increases over the past decade. The American Catholic population has grown by 45 percent since 1965. Hispanics, who are often underserved by public schools, account for about 45 percent of American Catholics and an even higher proportion of Catholic children, but many cannot afford rising fees.
Since the early 19th century, parochial schools have given free or affordable educations to needy and affluent students alike. Inner-city Catholic schools, which began by serving poor European immigrants, severed the connection between poverty and low academic performance for generations of low-income (and often non-Catholic) minority kids.
Until the 1960s, religious orders were united in responding to Christ's mandate to ''go teach.'' But religious vocations have become less attractive, and parochial schools have faced increasing competition from charter schools. Without a turnaround, many dioceses will soon have only scatterings of elite Catholic academies for middle-class and affluent families and a token number of inner-city schools, propped up by wealthy donors.
As in other areas, the church has lost its way, by failing to prioritize parochial education. Despite the sex-abuse scandals and two recessions, church revenue -- which flows from parishes via Sunday donations, bequests and so on -- grew to $11.9 billion in 2010, an inflation-adjusted increase of $2.2 billion from a decade earlier. Yet educational subsidies have fallen; the church now pays at least 12.6 percent of parochial elementary school costs, down from 63 percent in 1965.
Much of the money has gone to paying for a growing staff: about 170,000 laypeople, priests and members of religious orders, including some unpaid volunteers, responsible for more than 17,000 parishes. Since 2000, there has been more than a 25 percent increase in lay ecclesial ministers, who serve alongside priests and deacons in ministering to colleges, hospitals and prisons and caring for bereaved or homebound parishioners.
The church should shift its spending and also hold ambitious fund-raising drives. Instead of approaching donors with the least effective pitch -- filling deficits -- educators, pastors and prelates should propose new initiatives (with help from Web sites like DonorsChoose.org and Kickstarter) and new schools.
Bishops preach social justice but fail to practice it within the church. Thirty percent of American parishes report operating deficits, but there is no systemic means for wealthier dioceses and parishes to help poorer ones -- and to stave off self-defeating tuition increases.
After finances, personnel is the biggest challenge. Once upon a time, a pastor and two assistant priests took care of religious duties, while nuns ran the parish schools. Now, typically, there is just a beleaguered pastor (increasingly born and trained in Asia, Africa or Latin America) without any experience in running the business side of a parish and a school. Priests' collars and nuns' habits have become rare sights in parochial schools.
One solution is at hand. In the late 1960s, the Vatican allowed men to be ordained as deacons, who are clergy with many but not all the powers of a priest. Today there are almost 17,000 in the United States, about the same number as active diocesan priests. Over the next decade, the diaconate will continue to grow, while the number of ordained priests is projected to decline to 12,500 by 2035.
Many deacons have valuable professional, managerial and entrepreneurial expertise that could revitalize parochial education. If they were given additional powers to perform sacraments and run parishes, a married priesthood would become a fait accompli. Celibacy should be a sacrifice offered freely, not an excuse for institutional suicide.
Without an overhaul of money and personnel, the future of Catholic education is grim. Since 1990, the church has closed almost 1,500 parishes. Most were small, but just as big-city parochial schools are being closed, thriving urban parishes may be next on the chopping block.
''The school is more necessary than the church,'' said John J. Hughes, the first archbishop of New York. Unless the Vatican and the American bishops heed those words, the decline in parochial education may forewarn the fate of the church itself.

HEADLINE: Students Rush to Web Classes, But Profits May Be Much Later

BYLINE: By TAMAR LEWIN

 BODY:
MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. -- In August, four months after Daphne Koller and Andrew Ng started the online education company Coursera, its free college courses had drawn in a million users, a faster launching than either Facebook or Twitter.
The co-founders, computer science professors at Stanford University, watched with amazement as enrollment passed two million last month, with 70,000 new students a week signing up for over 200 courses, including Human-Computer Interaction, Songwriting and Gamification, taught by faculty members at the company's partners, 33 elite universities.
In less than a year, Coursera has attracted $22 million in venture capital and has created so much buzz that some universities sound a bit defensive about not leaping onto the bandwagon.
Other approaches to online courses are emerging as well. Universities nationwide are increasing their online offerings, hoping to attract students around the world. New ventures like Udemy help individual professors put their courses online. Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology have each provided $30 million to create edX. Another Stanford spinoff, Udacity, has attracted more than a million students to its menu of massive open online courses, or MOOCs, along with $15 million in financing. 
All of this could well add up to the future of higher education -- if anyone can figure out how to make money.
Coursera has grown at warp speed to emerge as the current leader of the pack, striving to support its business by creating revenue streams through licensing, certification fees and recruitment data provided to employers, among other efforts. But there is no guarantee that it will keep its position in the exploding education technology marketplace.
''No one's got the model that's going to work yet,'' said James Grimmelmann, a New York Law School professor who specializes in computer and Internet law. ''I expect all the current ventures to fail, because the expectations are too high. People think something will catch on like wildfire. But more likely, it's maybe a decade later that somebody figures out how to do it and make money.''
For their part, Ms. Koller and Mr. Ng proclaim a desire to keep courses freely available to poor students worldwide. Education, they have said repeatedly, should be a right, not a privilege. And even their venture backers say profits can wait.
''Monetization is not the most important objective for this business at this point,'' said Scott Sandell, a Coursera financier who is a general partner at New Enterprise Associates. ''What is important is that Coursera is rapidly accumulating a body of high-quality content that could be very attractive to universities that want to license it for their own use. We invest with a very long mind-set, and the gestation period of the very best companies is at least 10 years.''
But with the first trickles of revenue now coming in, Coursera's university partners expect to see some revenue sooner.
''We'll make money when Coursera makes money,'' said Peter Lange, the provost of Duke University, one of Coursera's partners. ''I don't think it will be too long down the road. We don't want to make the mistake the newspaper industry did, of giving our product away free online for too long.''
Right now, the most promising source of revenue for Coursera is the payment of licensing fees from other educational institutions that want to use the Coursera classes, either as a ready-made ''course in a box'' or as video lectures students can watch before going to class to work with a faculty member.
Ms. Koller has plenty of other ideas, as well. She is planning to charge $20, or maybe $50, for certificates of completion. And her company, like Udacity, has begun to charge corporate employers, including Facebook and Twitter, for access to high-performing students, starting with those studying software engineering.
This fall, Ms. Koller was excited about news she was about to announce: Antioch University's Los Angeles campus had agreed to offer its students credit for successfully completing two Coursera courses, Modern and Contemporary American Poetry and Greek and Roman Mythology, both taught by professors from the University of Pennsylvania. Antioch would be the first college to pay a licensing fee -- Ms. Koller would not say how much -- to offer the courses to its students at a tuition lower than any four-year public campus in the state.
''We think this model will spread, helping academic institutions offer their students a better education at a lower price,'' she said.
Why would colleges pay licensing fees for material available free on the Web? Because, Ms. Koller said crisply, Coursera's terms of use require that anyone using the courses commercially get a license, and because licensing would give colleges their own course Web site, including access to grades.
Just three days before the announcement, Ms. Koller discovered that the deal would have a very modest start. For the pilot, Antioch planned to have just one student and a faculty ''facilitator'' in each course. She expressed surprise but took the news in stride, moving right on to greet a delegation from the University of Melbourne that was waiting for her in the conference room.
Coursera recently announced another route to help students earn credit for its courses -- and produce revenue. The company has arranged for the American Council on Education, the umbrella group of higher education, to have subject experts assess whether several courses are worthy of transfer credits. If the experts say they are, students who successfully complete those courses could take an identity-verified proctored exam, pay a fee and get an ACE Credit transcript, a certification that 2,000 universities already accept for credit.
Under Coursera's contracts, the company gets most of the revenue; the universities keep 6 percent to 15 percent of the revenue, and 20 percent of gross profits. The contracts describe several monetizing possibilities, including charging for extras like manual grading or tutoring. (How or if partner universities will share revenue with professors who develop online courses remains an open question on many campuses, with some professors saying the task is analogous to writing a textbook and should yield similar remuneration.)
One tiny revenue stream has begun flowing into the nondescript Silicon Valley office building where Coursera's 35 employees work to keep up with the demand for their courses: the company is an Amazon affiliate, getting a sliver of the money each time Coursera students click through the site to buy recommended textbooks or any other products on Amazon.
''It's just a couple thousand, but it's our first revenue,'' Ms. Koller said. ''When faculty recommend a textbook and people buy it on Amazon, we get some money. The funny thing is that we're getting more than twice as much money from things like Texas Rangers jackets as from what the textbooks are bringing in.''
Other possibilities around the edges include charging a subscription fee, after a class is over, to continue the discussion forum as a Web community, or perhaps offering follow-up courses, again for a fee. And advertising sponsorships remain a possibility.
Like the Antioch deal, some early attempts have gotten off to a slow start. For example, the University of Washington has already offered credit for a fee in a few Coursera courses. But while thousands of students enrolled in the free version, only a handful chose the paid credit-carrying option. David P. Szatmary, the vice provost, said part of the problem was that the credit option was posted only shortly before the course started, when most students had already enrolled free.
''We're going to try it again,'' he said. ''We think that if students know about the possibility of doing it for credit, they might be willing to pay a fee and get their own discussion board, an instructor who guides them through the course and some additional readings and projects.''
Some Coursera partners say they are in no hurry to cash in.
''Part of what Coursera's gotten right is that it makes more sense to build your user base first and then figure out later how to monetize it, than to worry too much at the beginning about how to monetize it,'' said Edward Rock, a law professor serving as the University of Pennsylvania's senior adviser on open course initiatives.
The Coursera co-founders have become oracles of higher education, spreading their gospel of massive open online courses at the World Economic Forum in Abu Dhabi, the Web Summit in Dublin and the Aspen Ideas Festival. They describe how free online courses can open access to higher education to anyone with an Internet connection; liberate professors from repeating the same tired lectures and jokes semester after semester; and generate data, because the computers capture every answer right or wrong, that can provide new understanding of how students learn best.
Many educators predict that the bulk of MOOC revenues will come from licensing remedial courses and ''gateway'' introductory courses in subjects like economics or statistics, two categories of classes that enroll hundreds of thousands of students a year. Even though less than 10 percent of MOOC students finish the courses they sign up for on their own, many experts believe that combining MOOC materials with support from a faculty member or a teaching assistant could increase completion rates.
The University of Pennsylvania has high hopes for the mass marketing of Robert Ghrist's single-variable calculus course, which starts this month and features his hand-drawn animations.
''What Rob has done is figure out how to make PowerPoint dance,'' Mr. Rock said. ''I think it'll revolutionize the teaching of calculus both by allowing kids to take it on Coursera and by making the normal textbooks obsolete. It could become a way that more high schools that want to offer BC Calc can do so, and junior colleges that don't have good quality calculus instruction can license it and use it in a blended format, with the teacher now not giving frontal lectures but answering questions and exploring concepts in great detail.''
Mr. Rock, whose university has produced 16 Coursera courses, said each one costs about $50,000 to create, the biggest expenses being the videography and paying the teaching assistants who monitor the discussion forum. The University of Pennsylvania is just beginning to think about how to recover those costs. Last fall, at the conclusion of its Listening to World Music course, for example, the university sent out a questionnaire asking students whether they would be interested in a follow-up course, what they would want to cover and how much they would be willing to pay for it.
Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel, a Penn bioethicist who served as health adviser to the Obama administration, is teaching two Coursera courses: one on the Obama health care law, the other on rationing scarce medical resources.
He said he was not trying to produce a course that can be offered over and over, with no additional costs, but simply hoping to spread understanding of important health issues. And rather than reuse his materials from last summer's course on the new law, Dr. Emanuel overhauled the course, using not one but two videographers to film his live classes at Penn.
But Dr. Emanuel is not immune to the commercial possibilities: he is considering whether to develop a MOOC that could be marketed to those seeking health care ethics certification.
Even Ms. Koller is unsure about the future of MOOCs -- and her company.
''A year ago, I could not have imagined that we would be where we are now,'' she said. ''Who knows where we'll be in five more years?''

HEADLINE: Kashmir Clash With Soldiers From India Kills Pakistani

BYLINE: By DECLAN WALSH; Salman Masood and Ihsanullah Tipu Mehsud contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ISLAMABAD, Pakistan -- Pakistani and Indian troops exchanged gunfire across the disputed Kashmir border early Sunday, leaving one Pakistani soldier dead in a relatively rare fatal confrontation between the two neighbors.
As usual, the rival armies, which have been engaged in a face-off in Kashmir for decades, disagreed about who started the shooting or what happened next.
Pakistan said Indian troops crossed the disputed boundary, known as the Line of Control, into Pakistani-controlled territory, where they attacked a remote outpost and wounded two soldiers, one of whom later died. 
''Our army troops effectively responded and repulsed the attack successfully,'' said a Pakistani military spokesman, speaking on the condition of anonymity. ''Indian Army troops left behind a gun and a dagger.''
But the Indian military said that its troops had not crossed into Pakistani territory and that it was only responding to an unprovoked Pakistani shelling across the Line of Control that destroyed a civilian house.
''None of our troops crossed the Line of Control,'' Col. Jagadish Dahiya, an Indian Army spokesman, told Reuters. ''We have no casualties or injuries.''
The clash was an unusual breach of an almost decade-long cease-fire that has largely held between the two rivals, whose leaders have concentrated on building economic and diplomatic ties.
In the last major shooting, in September 2011, Pakistan claimed to have lost three soldiers while India said one of its officers was killed. There have been other, smaller, clashes in recent months.
But in the last year, encouraging signs have emerged that relations are thawing.
The two countries have eased travel restrictions for Kashmiris living on both sides of the de facto border, and introduced encouraging economic initiatives intended to foster bilateral trade.
It was unclear whether Sunday's clash would affect any of that. The Pakistani cricket team is visiting India, and on Sunday, a match was played between the two sides in New Delhi, the Indian capital.
Still, military and ideological hard-liners in both countries consider the bitter conflict over Kashmir, which erupted just after independence in 1947, as the core issue that needs to be resolved. Pakistan and India, both of which claim the mountainous territory in its entirety, have fought two wars over the region.
Pakistan said that Sunday's clash occurred at a remote border post in the Bagh district, more than 50 miles east of the capital, Islamabad.
One encouraging sign is that the recent warming of relations could not have taken place without approval from Pakistan's generals, who at any rate are increasingly absorbed by the fight against Islamist militants along their western border with Afghanistan.
That fight has been complicated by tense relations with the United States. On Sunday the Central Intelligence Agency continued to press its drone strike campaign in Waziristan, with three missile attacks against suspected militant bases that killed at least 12 people, according to Pakistani intelligence officials.
In one strike, in South Waziristan, a remotely piloted American aircraft fired 10 missiles into a suspected Pakistani Taliban training camp, one intelligence official said, speaking by phone on the condition of anonymity.
A senior Taliban militant, speaking by phone from Waziristan on the condition of anonymity, confirmed the strike. Three senior Taliban commanders were believed to have died, he said, including one who had masterminded a jailbreak in nearby Bannu last year that allowed 390 inmates to escape.
Another commander who is believed to have died, Wali Muhammad, who is also known as Tuffani Mehsud, was considered to be the leader of the Pakistani Taliban's suicide bomber squad.
''It is a major blow to our organization,'' the Taliban militant said.

HEADLINE: Regulators and 14 Banks Are Said to Be Near a Deal on Foreclosure Claims

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
A $10 billion settlement to resolve claims of foreclosure abuses by 14 major lenders is expected to be announced as early as Monday, several people with knowledge of the discussions said on Sunday.
The settlement comes after weeks of negotiations between federal regulators and the banks, and covers abuses like flawed paperwork and botched loan modifications, said these people, who spoke on condition of anonymity because the deal had not been made public.
An estimated $3.75 billion of the $10 billion is to be distributed in cash relief to Americans who went through foreclosure in 2009 and 2010, these people said. An additional $6 billion is to be directed toward homeowners in danger of losing their homes after falling behind on their monthly payments. 
All 14 banks , including JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Citigroup, are expected to sign on.
The agreement comes almost a year after a sweeping deal in February between state attorneys general and five large mortgage lenders.
The settlement almost fell apart over the weekend. Some officials at the Federal Reserve threatened to scuttle the deal unless the banks agreed to pay an additional $300 million for their role in the 2008 financial crisis, which upended the housing market and led to millions of foreclosures.
The Fed officials argued for additional aid for homeowners ensnared in a flawed foreclosure process, according to several people briefed on the negotiations who spoke on condition of anonymity. The $300 million demand was to come on top of the $10 billion payout, but was met with resistance from the banks, especially because it was raised late in the day on Friday, according to these people.
The Federal Reserve officials backed down, allowing the $10 billion pact to move forward ahead of bank earnings releases this month, these people said.
During the last week, officials from the Federal Reserve met with community groups and consumer advocates to gather comments about a settlement. It was those talks that induced the Fed to forgo the request for additional money, according to three people familiar with the matter. The thinking, these people said, was that broad relief was better than a lengthy review process that had not yielded much relief.
Representatives from the Federal Reserve and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, which led banking regulators in the negotiations, declined to provide further details on the settlement.
Still, some housing advocates said the settlement did not go far enough in providing relief. Bruce Marks, chief executive of the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, expressed cautious optimism about the deal, but added that the ''devil is in the details.''
It is still unclear how the monetary relief will be distributed among homeowners, but one immediate result of the settlement is the end of a troubled review of millions of loan files.
As part of a consent order in April 2011, the comptroller's office and the Federal Reserve established the Independent Foreclosure Review, which mandated that banks hire independent consultants to audit loan files and look for illegal fees, bungled loan modifications and instances where borrowers lost their homes even though they were current on their payments. Only 323,000 homeowners submitted claims for their files to be reviewed.
Within the comptroller's office, senior officials raised concerns that the reviews had grown bloated and inefficient, especially after each loan took more than 20 hours to review, up from original estimates of eight hours a file.
The mounting costs of the reviews, up to $250 an hour, began to worry the banking regulators, according to several of the people with knowledge of the matter. So far, the foreclosure review program has cost the banks an estimated $1.5 billion, according to these people.
Banking regulators grew concerned that the reviews were not producing meaningful instances of banks wrongfully seizing the homes of borrowers who were current on their payments, according to these people.
Told last week of the plans to stop the foreclosure reviews, some consumer advocates expressed concern that the full extent of the damage to homeowners would never be known. Some of the advocates have questioned whether the banks were getting off too easily because they selected and paid the consultants charged with examining their loans.

HEADLINE: Major Companies Push the Limits Of a Tax Break

BYLINE: By DAVID KOCIENIEWSKI

 BODY:
It began more than 90 years ago as a small tax break intended to help family farmers who wanted to swap horses and land. Farmers who sold property, livestock or equipment were allowed to avoid paying capital gains taxes, as long as they used the proceeds to replace or upgrade their assets.
Over the years, however, as the rules were loosened, the practice of exchanging one asset for another without incurring taxes spread to everyone from commercial real estate developers and art collectors to major corporations. It provides subsidies for rental truck fleets and investment property, vacation homes, oil wells and thoroughbred racehorses, and diverts billions of dollars in potential tax revenue from the Treasury each year.
Yet even with those generous terms, some major American companies -- including Cendant, Wells Fargo and General Electric -- have routinely pushed the boundaries while claiming lucrative tax savings, according to evidence recently presented at a federal trial in New York. 
President Obama and Congressional leaders agreed New Year's Day to a limited agreement to raise taxes on the wealthy, and the president said over the weekend that he would press this year for broader reform in the tax code. The expansion of the tax break once intended to help farmers illustrates the challenges ahead and how special interests have learned to use the tax code to maximum effect.
The federal government now allows more than $1.1 trillion a year in this and other tax expenditures. Each of those incentives -- which include hundreds of exemptions, exclusions, deferrals and preferential rates -- either adds to the budget deficit or shifts the cost of government to other taxpayers.
Some are narrowly targeted and offer aid to specific industries like Nascar owners, asparagus farmers, oil companies, yacht makers or solar panel producers. Others, like accelerated depreciation or the tax code's preference for debt financing over equity, provide tax benefits for wide swaths of businesses.
''Tax expenditures are very similar to an entitlement program, so they're easy to start,'' said George K. Yin, former chief of staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, and now a professor at the University of Virginia School of Law. ''But once a tax break gets started, people think they're entitled to it, so they are very difficult to end.''
Many tax breaks began with narrow targets and expanded into vast, expensive subsidies far beyond their original intent or the Internal Revenue Service's ability to monitor them. Most have developed constituencies of taxpayers, lobbyists and elected officials who fiercely defend them, making it politically treacherous to limit or eliminate them.
With hundreds of thousands of transactions a year, it is hard to gauge the true cost of the tax break for so-called like-kind exchanges, like those used by Cendant, General Electric and Wells Fargo. The government estimates that it diverts less than $3 billion a year from the Treasury, but industry statistics suggest the number could be far higher.
The tax break also exposes one of the greatest vulnerabilities of the United States tax system: it depends on voluntary compliance. The I.R.S. staff is so outnumbered by tax lawyers and accounting departments at major corporations that there is often little to prevent taxpayers from taking a freewheeling approach to interpreting and administering the rules.
What's more, the tax break is one of so many that it tends to escape attention. The independent Simpson-Bowles deficit commission appointed by Mr. Obama in 2010 raised the possibility of eliminating it and other tax expenditures, however, and some budget experts argue that the program should be severely limited or repealed.
Some financial planners and economists say that the tax break even favors real estate investors unfairly by allowing them to defer capital gains taxes that those who invest in securities and other ventures have to pay. And although it was originally intended to help farmers, some economists and lawmakers in agricultural areas say it has perversely contributed to suburban sprawl and the spiraling cost of farmland. Because it allows farmers to avoid capital gains taxes on land swaps, the tax break provides an incentive to sell farmland coveted by developers and buy property in less desirable and more remote areas.
A crucial element of the tax break is that companies cannot use the proceeds of an asset sale for any purpose other than buying a replacement. Because the break is intended to encourage reinvestment in a business, companies that sell an asset are required to deposit the proceeds from the sale into an escrow account, which must be controlled by a third party. If the company has control of the money, the tax break is disallowed, according to tax experts.
''Funds cannot be held under the taxpayer's sole control,'' said David Shechtman, a lawyer who headed the American Bar Association tax committee that oversees the exchanges.
Documents and testimony at the recent federal trial indicate that a subsidiary of one of the nation's largest banks, JPMorgan Chase, stood by for years as the companies -- most of which were also major depositors in the bank -- bent the rules governing these exchanges of property. JPMorgan sold the subsidiary in 2008.
At least a half-dozen companies were allowed unrestricted access, according to evidence at the trial. For at least 30 months, Wells Fargo had unfettered access to billions of dollars intended to be held in escrow, the records show. And American subsidiaries of Volkswagen and BMW had so much control over the money that they used it as collateral to obtain lines of credit.
Oscar Suris, a spokesman for Wells Fargo, declined to comment. Officials at Volkswagen and BMW said they were confident that the companies were in full compliance with tax regulations. A spokesman for Cendant, John Barrows, said that company, which is now the Avis Budget Group, had complied with all tax laws and I.R.S. regulations.
JPMorgan's lawyers argued during the trial that the instances in which its clients were apparently allowed to skirt the tax rules had been few, inadvertent and, in some cases, approved by tax lawyers and accountants who worked for the companies. Officials at JPEX, the subsidiary that handled the transactions, testified that because they were not tax experts, they deferred to their clients' accountants and legal specialists.
JPMorgan said its employees never violated tax regulations.
''The court agreed that our firm acted appropriately and that this business complied with all relevant tax laws at the time our firm owned it,'' said Joseph Evangelisti, a company spokesman.
The largest corporation cited in the case, General Electric, had unrestricted access to nearly $300 million from transactions made by its equipment finance subsidiary from 2007 to 2009, according to testimony, documents and company officials. The money -- which saved G.E. $3 million to $4 million a year in interest because of tax deferrals, according to company estimates -- was kept in G.E.'s internal computer system, WebCash, which is controlled solely by company employees rather than by an intermediary.
Russell Wilkerson, a managing director at G.E. Capital, said outside tax advisers had assured the company that its unorthodox arrangement met I.R.S. regulations because it required the approval of the intermediary before any transaction was made.
''G.E. has always executed its like-kind exchange programs in a fully compliant manner, without exception,'' Mr. Wilkerson said.
Evidence about the questionable procedures was made public as part of a lawsuit filed in Federal District Court by NES Financial, a California company that acquired JPEX in 2008. NES Financial sought more than $20 million in damages, saying that JPMorgan had failed to reveal the apparent violations before the unit's sale, and that the I.R.S., which is now auditing several of its clients, could impose millions of dollars in back taxes and penalties on the corporations.
Judge Victor Marrero dismissed the suit, despite evidence that some of the companies were not following I.R.S. regulations. In his ruling in late November, he said NES Financial had not proved it was likely to face losses.
Several JPEX employees said at the trial that the company had, in some cases, allowed clients access to money that was supposed to be segregated.
I.R.S. officials are reviewing some of the companies that used JPMorgan Chase, according to evidence presented at the trial, though it is not clear which ones. General Electric said it was not the subject of an inquiry.
Even as the debate over the tax break continues, there is a deep conviction in the real estate business that it is justified. Advocates for the real estate industry say that a large majority of transactions are conducted in strict compliance with I.R.S. regulations. Because the asset exchanges spur investment and help create jobs, industry officials say they would strenuously oppose any effort to end them.
''Historically, these exchanges are a very important consideration for a very important segment of the economy,'' said Jeffrey D. DeBoer, chief executive of the Real Estate Roundtable. ''I have no reason to believe that Congress won't ultimately recognize that.''

HEADLINE: On Their Way to Broadway, Eventually. Maybe.

BYLINE: By PATRICK HEALY

 BODY:
The Oscar-winning filmmaker Barry Levinson and the Grammy-winning musician Sheryl Crow may be superstars, but their reputations don't necessarily guarantee safe passage through the financial minefields of Broadway theater.
Their new collaboration, a musical based on Mr. Levinson's 1982 movie ''Diner,'' was supposed to open on Broadway on April 10 but is being delayed until the fall because the producers need more time to recruit investors and sharpen Mr. Levinson's script for the $9.5 million show. One of the lead producers, Scott Zeiger, said in an interview that the show's developmental workshop in October -- intended to lay the groundwork for Broadway -- was marred by Hurricane Sandy, and that fewer investors signed on afterward than he had hoped.
''Everyone just feels it needs more work to be better, and we want it to be the best,'' said Mr. Zeiger, a veteran producer on Broadway and in Las Vegas and a former theater executive with Clear Channel Entertainment. ''We wanted to do the creative work without a spring opening being a gun to our heads. And we want to raise all the money, so we can open on Broadway without worrying about making budget and having reserve funds if ticket sales are slow at first.'' 
''Diner'' is only one of several musical projects that were announced or aimed for Broadway in the 2012-13 season but were delayed or canceled, in some cases because producers were not able to raise money. The other shows include movie-to-musical adaptations like ''Flashdance,'' ''Big Fish,'' and ''Honeymoon in Vegas,'' as well as ''Rebecca'' and ''Prince of Broadway.''
The reason for the financial difficulties, producers say, is that the shows need improvement before most investors are willing to write checks, usually of $25,000 and up. But another factor -- and the one that few theater people like to talk about for publication -- is that veteran investors are snakebit, and potential new investors are wary, because the economics of Broadway have become prohibitive.
Roughly 75 percent of shows on Broadway never turn a profit because ticket sales come nowhere near covering the high costs for backstage labor, cast and crew salaries, advertising, theater rent and other expenses in an industry that has some 15 unions. In just the last year investors took a bath on the Broadway musicals ''Chaplin,'' ''Ghost,'' ''Scandalous'' and ''Leap of Faith.''
Still, most producers expressed confidence that their shows would arrive in New York sooner or later. Here is a status report on which shows are still aiming for Broadway, and the factors that stand in their way.
LOCKING DOWN INVESTORS Marc Routh, one of the lead producers of ''Flashdance'' -- which was delayed twice for Broadway and is now scheduled for August -- said investors were increasingly asking sophisticated questions about potential profitability.
''Raising money for Broadway still isn't back to the strong levels of pre-2008, and the reality is that it's harder to raise money for some musicals, because some musicals just aren't very good,'' Mr. Routh said, declining to name names. Regarding the $12 million ''Flashdance,'' he said, ''We're getting increasingly happy with the show artistically, and we're within spitting distance of having all our money.'' (A national tour of the show just played in Pittsburgh to mixed reviews.)
Another musical that had been in the pipeline for this season, ''Big Fish,'' is to open in Chicago in April and then shoot for Broadway in the fall. One of its producers, Dan Jinks, said the Chicago tryout would cost $2.5 million; he declined to provide the show's total budget. Mr. Jinks said the money was worth it to hone the show into Broadway-caliber shape and ensure that enough investors would ultimately be on board. Very few successful musicals open on Broadway without some kind of tryout.
''Songs that can play brilliantly in a rehearsal room can sometimes play very differently in front of a couple thousand people in a theater,'' Mr. Jinks said. ''Some people suggested we lower our budget, but taking the time to develop the show is better in the long run.''
The biggest debacle this season was ''Rebecca,'' a $12 million show that has been repeatedly delayed. A November opening was finally scratched after the producers learned that four investors, who were supposed to put up $4.5 million, were phantoms invented by a middleman. (He is now facing federal fraud charges.) One of the lead producers of ''Rebecca,'' Ben Sprecher, said that he hoped to open on Broadway in late 2013 but added that he still needed to raise several million dollars.
''Prince of Broadway'' was rescheduled after its initial lead producer pulled out of the project, citing cost issues; one of its new lead producers, Steven Baruch, said he was confident the show, drawing on the musicals of the director Harold Prince, will open on Broadway in the fall.
Among plays, meanwhile, two admired revivals at the Goodman Theater -- of ''The Iceman Cometh'' and ''Sweet Bird of Youth'' -- will not be coming to Broadway because of lack of interest from producers. Two other plays that have been announced for Broadway, ''The Miss Firecracker Contest'' and ''The Velocity of Autumn,'' are awaiting word on theaters, said the producer of both, Larry Kaye.
CALENDAR CONFLICTS A Broadway transfer of the musical ''Into the Woods,'' which ran in Central Park last summer, did not come together because of schedule conflicts with the actors, according to the producer on the project, Joey Parnes. (Other producers say negative reviews killed any hope of a transfer.)
A London revival last summer of ''The Sunshine Boys'' will not come to Broadway this season because of the schedules of its stars, Danny DeVito and Richard Griffiths; the producer, Sonia Friedman, said she was aiming for 2013-14. And some Broadway producers had been thinking that the musical ''A Gentleman's Guide to Love & Murder,'' which recently had an acclaimed production at Hartford Stage, might slip into the Broadway lineup this spring. Mr. Parnes, who is also involved with that show, said it would run at the Old Globe in San Diego this spring -- after which, who knows?
GOING NONPROFIT The producers of ''Honeymoon in Vegas'' are now negotiating to run at a nonprofit theater in the 2013-14 season, according to the show's composer, Jason Robert Brown. Asked if a lack of money had hindered ''Vegas,'' which included Tony Danza in its announced cast, Mr. Brown said yes.
''If you can't get the money you need, you won't get a theater, and you will probably need to do more creative development,'' Mr. Brown said. ''If you do get the money you need, voilà, no creative development necessary.''
Another show from Mr. Brown, ''The Bridges of Madison County,'' will be staged in August at the Williamstown Theater Festival in Massachusetts, according to its artistic director, Jenny Gersten. Bartlett Sher, who won a Tony directing ''South Pacific'' in 2008, will reunite with that show's leading actress, Kelli O'Hara, who will play the central character in ''Bridges'' -- an Iowa housewife who falls in love with a photographer. (Meryl Streep played the role in the 1995 film.)
Ms. Gersten and Mr. Sher said there were no plans to take the show to Broadway at this point. But given the star power involved, a successful outing in Williamstown could lead to a New York run. That was the route for ''Far From Heaven,'' which Williamstown produced (and Ms. O'Hara starred in) last summer and which opens Off Broadway this spring.
IN FLUX Two musicals that received major regional productions, ''The Nutty Professor,'' directed by Jerry Lewis, and the Stephen King-John Mellencamp show ''Ghost Brothers of Darkland County,'' will not be reaching Broadway anytime soon. Ned McLeod, the lead producer of ''The Nutty Professor'' (which was the final show by the composer Marvin Hamlisch), said he and the creative team were trying to align their schedules to develop the show further, and Mr. McLeod said he was looking for more investors as well. He said the death of Hamlisch had not derailed the show, noting that it had songs to spare, and that the book writer and lyricist Rupert Holmes was also a composer.
An album of ''Ghost Brothers'' songs is expected to be released this spring, after which a touring production is expected to begin, said its director, Susan V. Booth of Alliance Theater in Atlanta, where the musical ran last year. ''Subsequent to the show's close in Atlanta, Steve and John did significant rewriting and restructuring of the book,'' she said. ''What we learned and have leaned into is that this work only succeeds if it commits to being something unique unto itself.'' To that end the tour will be staged as a live radio play and produced in concert form, rather than a conventional musical production.
As for ''Diner,'' Mr. Levinson has both cut and added scenes to the script since the workshop ended in October and has further fleshed out some of the characters, Mr. Zeiger, the producer, said. Ms. Crow, who has written 17 original songs for the '50s-era show, has not been asked to write more.
The October workshop ended during the same week as Hurricane Sandy, which interrupted work for several days. After regrouping, the actors quickly went into performances for potential investors, and there was limited time to make changes in between the closed-door presentations. (The director is the Tony winner Kathleen Marshall.)
''I'm not using Sandy as an excuse,'' Mr. Zeiger said. ''But sometimes the unexpected happens, and you have to adjust. So, in our case, one of the adjustments is moving opening night to the fall.''

HEADLINE: Magazines on Left and Right Unite to Share Office Space

BYLINE: By WILL STOREY

 BODY:
The financial crisis did not bring bipartisanship to Congress, but a difficult media environment may have brought that spirit to two political standard-bearers.
In need of cash and with extra space on its hands, the liberal magazine The American Prospect decided to sublet part of its Washington offices. The American Conservative, tired of working from Arlington, Va., was looking for a new location. When the publishers Jay Harris of The Prospect and Wick Allison of The Conservative were getting lunch in August, they put two and two together. 
A six-month lease was soon signed. The self-described bastion of "traditional conservatism" moved in with the self-described "liberal, progressive, lefty" on Dec. 27.
"We have a water fountain labeled conservatives only," joked Mr. Harris, who cleared the idea with his staff. "We turned to the staff and said, 'Would you be comfortable?' To a person, the folks who responded said, 'Our values are pretty different, but we have a lot of respect for what The American Conservative does journalistically.' "
What they lack in ideological viewpoint, the two nonprofit monthlies make up for in an independent, establishment-bucking mind-set. Each has faced the sort of downsizing that has become all too common in the print world.
The American Conservative, founded in 2002 by Pat Buchanan, ran biweekly before it went out of print for six weeks in 2009 and returned as a monthly magazine. It has a circulation of 8,000. The American Prospect, in print since 1990, announced to its staff in April that if the magazine could not find $500,000 in financing, it would close altogether by the end of May. With help from good publicity from Prospect alumni and a few large donors - and by shrinking its staff by four - the bimonthly magazine has endured. The publication has combined paid print and digital circulation of nearly 45,000. The Conservative's seven staff members will share the white-walled, blue-carpeted 12th floor of 1710 Rhode Island Avenue with The Prospect's fund-raising and advertising departments. They must share a conference room, a potential source of conflict, though Mr. Harris says it could be a site for events the magazines co-host.
Daniel McCarthy, The Conservative's editor, said the new locale suits its independent outlook.
"Where we had been," Mr. McCarthy said of the office in Arlington, "was sort of a hotbed of lobbyists and defense contractors. People who represent a different side of Washington."
Maisie Allison, a Web editor at The Conservative, said the shared space would help both magazines.
"Since we do not directly compete, we can only benefit from sharing ideas, formally and informally," she said. "They have a bunch of magazine covers on the wall; we're going to get some of ours up soon."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Annual Buildup of Air Pollution Chokes Tehran

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Already battered by international threats against their nation's nuclear program, sanctions and a broken economy, Iranians living here in the capital are now trying to cope with what has become an annual pollution peril: a yellowish haze that engulfs Tehran this time of year.
For nearly a week, officials here and in other large cities have been calling on residents to remain indoors or avoid downtown areas, saying that with air pollution at such high levels, venturing outside could be tantamount to ''suicide,'' state radio reported Saturday. 
On Sunday, government offices, schools, universities and banks reopened after the government had ordered them to shut down for five days to help ease the chronic pollution. Tehran's normally bustling streets were largely deserted.
Residents who dare to go outside cover their mouths and noses with scarves or surgical masks, but their eyes tear up and their throats sting from the mist of pollutants, which a report by the municipality of Tehran says is made up of a mixture of particles containing lead, sulfur dioxide and benzene.
''It feels as if even God has turned against us,'' Azadeh, a 32-year-old artist, said on a recent day as she looked out a window in her apartment that often offers a clear view of Tehran, a sprawling city that is home to millions. But on this day, Azadeh, who did not want her full name used, saw only the blurred outlines of high-rise buildings and the Milad communications tower in the distance. The setting sun was reduced to a yellowish coin by the thick blanket of smog.
The haze of pollution occurs every year when cold air and windless days trap fumes belched out by millions of cars and hundreds of old factories between the peaks of the majestic Alborz mountain range, which embraces Tehran like a crescent moon.
Iran is prominently represented in the World Health Organization's 2011 report on air quality and health, with three of its provincial towns among the organization's list of the world's 10 most-polluted cities. According to the report, Tehran has roughly four times as many polluting particles per cubic meter as Los Angeles. Many cities known for their poor air quality, like Mexico City, Shanghai and Bangkok, are cleaner than Tehran.
But since 2010, when American sanctions on Iranian imports of refined gasoline began to bite, the situation has grown worse, according to the report by the municipality of Tehran.
Faced with possible fuel shortages, Iran surprised outsiders by quickly making up for the loss of imports by producing its own brew of gasoline. While the emergency fuel kept vehicles running, local experts warned that it was creating much more pollution.
A recently released report by Tehran's department of air quality control contained blank spaces where there should have been information about levels of benzene and lead -- components of gasoline -- in the capital's air. But the report did state that while Tehran experienced more than 300 ''healthy days'' in 2009, in 2011 there were fewer than 150.
Iran's Health Ministry has reported a rise in respiratory and heart diseases, as well as an increase in a variety of cancers that it says are related to pollution.
The state newspaper Resalat on Saturday called the pollution a continuing crisis, and it urged the authorities to act. ''Why is it that when the winds pick up, this problem is again quickly forgotten?'' an editorial asked. Another newspaper, Donya-e-Eqtesad, which is critical of the government, pressed for an improvement in gasoline standards.
The pollution caused by the use of the emergency fuel concoction has been a taboo subject here, as officials try to portray each measure to counter the economic sanctions as a success that should not to be criticized by the local news media.
On state television, several officials have denied that the yellow haze has anything to do with the locally produced gasoline.
In an interview on Saturday, Ali Mohammad Sha'eri, the deputy director of Iran's Environmental Protection Organization, strongly denied that the pollution was linked to gasoline. However, he said that only 20 percent of the emergency fuel was up to modern standards. ''Hopefully in three months that level will be 50 percent,'' he said.
Meanwhile, the government has imposed strict traffic regulations in Tehran, Isfahan and other major population centers. An odd-even traffic-control plan based on the last digit of vehicle license plates keeps about half of the approximately three and a half million cars in Tehran off the streets on a daily basis.
Other plans to combat the pollution have been less realistic, analysts say. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has long advocated a plan to move civil servants from Tehran to reduce overpopulation in the capital. In 2010, the governor of Tehran Province ordered crop-dusters to dump water on the smog in an effort to dissipate it. There have also been plans for placing air purifiers in the city, but experts say they will not work in open spaces.
For those living in Tehran and unable to leave town for a vacation home on the Caspian Sea, waiting for the winds to pick up seems to be the only option.
''My head hurts, and I'm constantly dead tired,'' said Niloufar Mohammadi, a university student. ''I try not to go out, but I can smell the pollution in my room as I am trying to study.''
Azadeh, the artist, said the pollution forced her to stay indoors, adding to her sense of isolation. Step by step her world was being curtailed, she said. The Western sanctions imposed on Iran make her feel like a pariah, she explained. The government's mismanagement of the economy and the resulting inflation have left her with little purchasing power, she said; she has stopped shopping for everything but essential items. And last week, security officers removed her illegal satellite dish from her roof.
''The pollution is the last straw for me,'' she said. ''We should wait helpless for winds to pick up and clean the air before we can safely leave our houses. It shows we have lost all power to control our lives.''

HEADLINE: In Asia, Ill Will Runs Deep

BYLINE: By ODD ARNE WESTAD. 
Odd Arne Westad, a professor of international history at the London School of Economics, is the author of ''Restless Empire: China and the World Since 1750.''

 BODY:
London
THERE are few economies and societies on earth more complementary than China's and Japan's. The Chinese are relatively young, poor and restless and fiercely committed to economic growth. The Japanese are relatively old and sated, but technologically advanced and devoted to guarding their high standard of living. Proximity would seem to make the two nations ideally suited to benefit from each other.
But Japan is afraid of China's rise, because the Chinese economy is so much more dynamic than Japan's. And China is troubled by Japan, because the island nation seems to act as an unsinkable American aircraft carrier just off its coast. 
Over the last year, nationalists in both countries have fought a war of words over the disputed islands that Japan calls Senkaku and China calls Diaoyu. Japan's new right-wing prime minister, Shinzo Abe, has alarmed Chinese leaders with his calls for revisiting its commitment to pacifism, enshrined in the American-imposed postwar constitution, and for making the school curriculum more patriotic.
The long shadow of history continues to haunt relations between the two countries. In Asia, World War II started in 1937 as a Sino-Japanese war; millions of Chinese were killed as a result of Japan's expansionism. But that does not explain why young people in China and Japan today are more inimical in their views of one another than their forebears -- even immediately after the war -- were.
The real explanation lies further back. Japan's rise in the late 19th century was seen as an affront by China, which had always felt entitled to the mantle of regional leadership. Mao Zedong and other founders of the Chinese Communist Party adopted these views and bequeathed them to their successors.
Most Chinese today therefore regard Japan's wealth, and its position as America's main ally in Asia, as results of ill-gotten gains. Even when the Chinese state was at its weakest, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, its elites felt that the Confucianism China had exported to its key neighbors -- Korea, Japan and Vietnam -- was the root of a common culture. Other countries in the ''Confucian zone'' were supposed to simply accept China's natural leadership.
Beijing's policies in the South China Sea today resemble those of the Qing empire, China's last ruling dynasty, in the late 18th century. The emperor then, Qianlong, liked to speak to the ''myriad nations'' to the south as a father would address his children. Current Chinese leaders, who are exerting their influence in countries like Vietnam and Laos, echo his paternalism.
It is unlikely that China's neighbors will appreciate this now any more than they did then. Qianlong got involved in a war in Vietnam in the 1780s that severely weakened his empire. Since then, the countries in the region have had their own waves of nationalism, often in response to Western colonialism. Indonesia, a country of 248 million, does not regard itself as ''small,'' even compared with a giant like China. It is bound to seek to counter China's power unless Chinese attitudes and policies change.
For its part, Japan veers between accommodating China and competing with it. Even though Japan's imperialism is a thing of the past, some of the attitudes that gave rise to it persist. Mr. Abe, the grandson of a former prime minister regarded by many Chinese as a war criminal, seems to embody such views.
Although most Japanese recognize the importance of trade with and investments in China, national security at the moment seems more important.
Japan's sins of omission in dealing fully with its past hinder its present foreign policy, but they pale in comparison with China's historical sense of entitlement to regional hegemony and its virulent new form of state-sanctioned anti-Japanese nationalism. Sadly, these chauvinist attitudes are unlikely to change under the new Communist leadership installed in November.
Even China's diplomatic language emphasizes toeing the party's line on history rather than discerning present-day interests, and it assumes that only one position in international affairs -- usually China's -- can be correct.
China today has much more to gain from cooperation with Japan than from conflict. Harping about past sins and inflaming the dispute over the islands do little good. If China is to become the predominant power in the region, it can only do so with Japan, not against it.
As France and Germany have demonstrated, perceptions can change when national interest demands it. But shifting Beijing's thinking from hierarchy to cooperation will require strong leadership and a nuanced understanding of national interests. China's recent leaders haven't inspired much hope of either.

HEADLINE: U.S. Fiscal Talks Made No One Look Good

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG NEWS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A grand fiscal bargain, with perhaps $2 trillion more in deficit reduction over 10 years -- more than a quarter of which would be additional revenue, with much of the rest obtained through well-crafted, significant cutbacks in big-ticket entitlements -- could have been a win-win for Republicans and Democrats.
Along with terminating the high-end Bush tax cuts, this would have earned lawmakers public approbation for working together and given investor and business confidence a boost. 
The corollary is the small-bore deal cobbled together to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, which may be a lose-lose for both sides. Defying political physics, the White House and congressional Republicans emerged politically weaker and facing more trouble ahead.
President Barack Obama, who Republicans acknowledged had all the leverage in the latest round, could have hung tough and persevered with one goal: the bigger deal. Indisputably, Democrats got much more than Republicans. Yet even with this unusual leverage -- without a deal, taxes would have increased for everyone -- the Democrats got only about 60 percent of what the House speaker, John A. Boehner, had once been willing to give on taxes.
Republicans reinforced their image as protectors of the privileged. In the House of Representatives, which they control, they displayed dysfunction remarkable even by Washington standards. With bigger fights ahead over the debt ceiling and indiscriminate across-the-board spending cuts, the problems outweigh the possibilities for both sides.
The estate tax epitomizes this state of affairs. It is assessed on fewer than 1 percent of the wealthiest estates. Michael J. Graetz, a former Treasury official in the administration of President George H.W. Bush who has written a book on the subject, says that with huge deficits and worsening income inequality, ''it is amazing that our political system cannot maintain an estate tax that contributes less than 1 percent of federal revenues from those Americans best able to afford it.''
Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary, once observed, ''There is no case other than selfishness'' for cutting the estate tax.
There are legitimate debates about the effect on economic growth of tax rates on capital gains, dividends or corporate income. It's tough to find a serious economist who makes that case for the estate tax; years ago, the conservative economist Irwin M. Stelzer described a low tax as ''affirmative action'' for wealthy heirs.
Still, reducing or eliminating the estate tax was a top priority for Republicans in this latest round. The White House essentially caved to a measure that will cost about $100 billion over 10 years and will benefit fewer than 5,000 wealthy estates.
In the 2010 year-end tax-cut deal, the Obama administration insisted on extending the refundable tax credits for the poor; resistant Republicans said they would go along only if the White House accepted two years of lower estate-tax rates. Agreed. This time, however, the refundable credits for the poor were extended only temporarily, while the more generous estate-tax provision is permanent.
The political appeal here is to reward big campaign contributors; that matters to Democrats as well as Republicans. When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr., in the private bargaining, argued for a tougher provision, the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell, asked that it be put to a vote. The vice president knew that Democrats like Senators Max Baucus of Montana and Mary Landrieu of Louisiana would side with the rich heirs.
Lawmakers are braced for a tougher battle in the next two months over the debt ceiling and across-the-board spending cuts that neither side likes. Republicans contend that, unlike with the fiscal cliff -- the package of tax increases and spending cuts that had been set to take effect with the new year -- this time they have the leverage to force the president to accept big spending cuts, particularly of big-ticket entitlements.
House Republicans insist on the ''Boehner rule,'' that any increase in the debt ceiling be matched by a comparable reduction in spending. That isn't realistic: The debt ceiling will have to be increased by almost $2 trillion over the next two years, and spending cuts of that order would be politically and economically disastrous. The speaker's ability to maneuver may be limited, though. On the fiscal deal, his own majority leader and whip deserted him, as did seven current committee chairmen and almost two-thirds of his caucus.
Tougher still is the substance. House Republicans are all for big spending cuts, though other than some easy ones, including going after programs for the poor, they duck specifics.
They are fierce deficit hawks in principle, yet when specific cuts to Medicare, a health insurance program for the elderly, or Social Security, a retirement fund, are raised, they turn into pacifists.
And the president, who wouldn't play for keeps when he had the leverage, vows this time will be different. He won't negotiate over the debt ceiling; that would be tantamount, he proclaims, to negotiating with terrorists.
Mr. Obama demands that any spending cuts be accompanied by revenue increases.
He correctly notes that there already has been more than twice as much in spending cuts as in tax increases and that any subsequent action that involves only cuts would run counter to the recommendations of bipartisan panels like the 2010 commission headed by Alan K. Simpson, a former Republican senator, and Erskine Bowles, a former White House chief of staff under Bill Clinton. Republicans dismiss that as a nonstarter.
The bottom lines: The White House believes Republican leaders privately realize that holding the nation's full faith and credit hostage to cutting popular programs is a loser. Congressional Republicans dismiss Mr. Obama's lines in the sand, saying that he invariably backs down and that any economic fallout ultimately hurts his presidency.
Both points are persuasive.

HEADLINE: The Next Round of Tax Increases

 BODY:
When the White House announced the deal on the fiscal cliff last week, it was quick -- and correct -- to note that much was left undone. There was still ''substantial'' room, the administration said, to raise taxes on high-income Americans, to reform corporate taxes and to reform entitlements, with the aim of ''balanced'' deficit reduction. 
The White House seems to think the deal has established a firm foundation for building a new fiscal house. In fact, the deal could make tax reform less likely. And without reform to raise new revenue, deficit reduction would have to rely heavily on spending cuts, an outcome that can be averted only by persuasive and sustained leadership from President Obama.
One way the deal could undermine tax reform is that contrary to Republican complaints, its basic framework of low tax rates and lots of loopholes is bound to prove acceptable, even popular. The deal retains the Bush-era tax cuts and almost all existing deductions and tax breaks, except for a few changes affecting a sliver of high-income Americans, generally defined as those with taxable income above $450,000, and even they did not fare badly (their new top rate of 39.6 percent is still among the lowest top rates in the 100-year history of the income tax).
The deal removes impetus for reform by permanently ''patching'' the alternative minimum tax. The change ensures that the A.M.T. will no longer routinely threaten to ensnare tens of millions of taxpayers for whom it was never intended. This is a step in the direction of better tax policy, but it also means the loss of the A.M.T. as a potent reminder of just how in need of reform the tax code is.
The deal will also play into the wrongheaded, but widespread, idea that corporations should not have to pay higher taxes. Congressional Republicans have made it clear that they will fight all further tax increases, while some Democrats have voiced support for corporate tax reform that would streamline the code but not raise more revenue. Put those two views together, and you have the makings of a bipartisan agreement to reform corporate taxes without raising revenue. That would be indefensible at a time when corporate tax avoidance has already driven corporate tax revenues close to all-time lows as a share of both federal revenues and the economy.
Mr. Obama has pledged to demand significant tax increases as deficit reduction talks go forward. The fiscal cliff deal could leave him with less room to maneuver. But caps on deductions, higher taxes on investment income and a financial transaction tax are worth fighting for, as are broader tax reforms, like a carbon tax and a value-added tax, that could take effect as the economy recovers.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Authority in Crisis Over Finances, Premier Says

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The Palestinian government is in ''extreme jeopardy'' because of a financial crisis largely caused by Arab countries' failure to send hundreds of millions of dollars in promised aid, the Palestinian prime minister said Sunday. 
The crisis has worsened in recent years, and the government, the Palestinian Authority, has reached the point of not being able to pay the salaries of about 150,000 government employees, said the prime minister, Salam Fayyad. If the crisis continues, he said, the number of Palestinians in poverty is bound to double to 50 percent of the population of roughly four million people.
The Palestinian Authority, set up two decades ago as part of interim peace deals with Israel, is on the ''verge of being completely incapacitated,'' Mr. Fayyad warned.
The government was meant to be temporary and to be replaced by a Palestinian state, which was to be established through negotiations with Israel. But those talks have repeatedly broken down, and for the past four years the two sides have been unable to agree on the terms for renewing them.
In November, the authority's president, Mahmoud Abbas, won United Nations recognition of Palestine in the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem as a nonmember observer state, overriding Israeli objections to the largely symbolic step. On Sunday, Mr. Abbas asked his government, which is based in the West Bank, to prepare for replacing the words ''Palestinian Authority'' with ''State of Palestine'' in all public documents, including identification cards, drivers licenses and passports.
Israeli officials declined to comment.
A statement from Mr. Abbas's office said the move was aimed at enhancing Palestinian ''sovereignty on the ground'' and was a step toward ''real independence.''
Israel, which still controls most of the West Bank, objected to the Palestinian statehood bid, calling it a step aimed at bypassing direct peace negotiations.
In December, Israel halted its monthly transfer of about $100 million in tax rebates it collects on behalf of the Palestinians. That sum amounts to about one-third of the monthly operating costs of the Palestinian Authority. Mr. Fayyad put most of the blame for the Palestinian Authority's financial troubles on delinquent Arab donors, saying they are ''not fulfilling their pledge of support in accordance with Arab League resolutions.''
European countries kept their aid commitments, he said.
About $200 million in American aid was held up by Congress last year, a sum the Obama administration hopes to deliver to the Palestinians this year, along with $250 million more.

HEADLINE: For Ryan's Next Act, Balancing Pragmatism With Politics

BYLINE: By ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- After Senator John McCain's failed presidential bid in 2008, he repaired to the Senate to become a thorn in President Obama's side. His running mate, Sarah Palin, used her considerable clout on the right to rally her fervent supporters against Mr. Obama and Democrats.
But when the vice-presidential hopes of Representative Paul D. Ryan were dashed this Election Day, he returned to the House of Representatives and last week helped pass a bipartisan tax deal sought by Mr. Obama.
Mr. Ryan's vote in support of the plan, which raised tax rates on high income while locking in lower rates for the vast majority of households, was both pragmatic and political. In what he described as a ''tough decision,'' he backed what was seen by most in Congress as a piece of legislation whose passage was necessary to avert a fiscal crisis. Notably, his support aligned him with Speaker John A. Boehner, who voted for the measure. But it put him in conflict with his two fellow ''young guns,'' Representatives Eric Cantor of Virginia and Kevin McCarthy of California, the No. 2 and 3 House Republicans. The three men had been in virtual lock step on policy issues and wrote a book together. 
It was the first in a series of votes on budget and deficit reduction measures expected in the coming months, all potentially reverberating in the race for the 2016 Republican presidential nomination. A potential rival to Mr. Ryan for the nomination, should both decide to run, is Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who was among only eight senators to vote no, the first clear demarcation between the two men since the election.
(Before the vote, when asked by a reporter if Mr. Rubio's ''no'' vote would influence his own, Mr. Ryan laughed and said, ''Give me a break!'' according to a recounting on Twitter.)
Congressional supporters of Mr. Ryan describe his vote as an illustration of leadership. As chairman of the House Budget Committee, he was motivated by the chance to make the lower tax rates for most households permanent, these supporters say. And as a legislator whose actions are watched closely by fellow members, they add, he does not have the luxury of taking a purely ideological stance.
Mr. Ryan, his supporters say, did not necessarily return to the House to start building a presidential campaign. Instead, he is interested in continuing to mix things up as one of his party's leading voices on budget matters. He is interested in forging an even tighter bond with Mr. Boehner as the fiscal fights play out, they say, starting in the coming weeks with a debate over whether to authorize raising the government's borrowing limit and how to avoid deep across-the-board spending cuts set in motion by previous compromises.
''I understand why somebody would want to vote no, but I understand why we had to vote yes,'' said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who voted in favor of the deal. ''But leadership is voting yes when you need to, and we needed to, because if the bill had failed, the stock markets wouldn't have gone up 300 points; they would have gone down 1,000, and all those guys pounding their chests would have folded like a cheap suit.''
He added: ''I thought it was a very responsible vote.''
In a statement released by his office after the vote, Mr. Ryan described his decision this way: ''Will the American people be better off if this law passes relative to the alternative? In the final analysis, the answer is undoubtedly yes. I came to Congress to make tough decisions -- not to run away from them.''
Mr. Rubio, in a statement explaining his vote, warned that ''rapid economic growth and job creation will be made more difficult under the deal reached here in Washington.'' He added: ''This deal just postpones the inevitable, the need to solve our growing debt crisis and help the 23 million Americans who can't find the work they need.''
Those close to Mr. Rubio point to what they say is his unwavering allegiance to conservative principles and note that his sticking point was the tax increase on the highest earners.
''It's bad policy that fails to address the real fiscal issues facing our country,'' said Alex Conant, a spokesman for Mr. Rubio. ''When it comes to taxes, we need tax reform that will promote growth. That's the only way to solve our fiscal problems in the long run, and nothing in the package that was passed was designed to promote growth.''
Of course, it is always tricky to gauge the political impact a vote will have four years later. When Hillary Rodham Clinton and John Edwards, as senators, voted to authorize the Iraq war in 2002, their positions were seen as a political no-brainer. Yet during the 2008 Democratic primary, Mr. Obama's initial opposition to the Iraq war helped catapult him to the nomination.
Mr. Ryan's vote, which lent support to Mr. Boehner, also places him squarely in a role he has long found comfortable: that of the dutiful Republican soldier. Mr. Ryan voted in favor of many large and contentious issues -- the Medicare prescription drug plan, the bank and auto bailouts -- and in the process cast aside conservative orthodoxy to support his party's leadership.
His tax vote, however, was also a calculated one. He believes that the coming fights on spending and deficit reduction will fall squarely in his budget ''sweet spot,'' in the words of a friend. And with Mr. Boehner's backing, Mr. Ryan has a better chance of influencing those debates.
On Friday, in a vote that seemed to move him closer to his image as a fiscal hawk intent on lowering government spending, Mr. Ryan joined 66 Republican members to oppose a flood insurance bill that would take on more than $9 billion in debt to help victims of Hurricane Sandy.
''Paul has the long game in mind, so taking short-term pops at Boehner does not advance the conservative agenda,'' an associate close to Mr. Ryan said. ''He's politically invested in his partnership with Boehner.''
Many Congressional Republicans said they understood both positions on the fiscal bill, and though Mr. Ryan incurred some anger online from the right wing, those in Washington said that the 2016 race would probably turn on larger fights yet to come.
''I just don't think 2016 is going to be litigated through the lens of this one vote,'' said Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist and former adviser to Mitt Romney, ''because in a month or two, we're going to be onto a whole new deadline fight, and there will be plenty of votes and plenty of areas where you can still build your political profile and your electoral profile where you're a viable candidate in 2016 -- the full body of work so to speak.''

HEADLINE: The Secret Soothsayer Behind Notre Dame's Revival

BYLINE: MICHAEL NICHOLS


HIGHLIGHT: For two students, the Irish's run to the B.C.S. title game can be traced to a late-night trek to the Knute Rockne statue outside Notre Dame Stadium. 

 BODY:
Football is not always on the minds of Notre Dame students - especially on a dead Saturday in late February after a disappointing season. Such was the case when Scotch Henderson moseyed into my grungy dorm room. Half asleep and half hypnotized by a terrifying local commercial, I barely noticed him join me on the broken, taco-shaped futon. The glaze that fell over our eyes while watching bad TV was interrupted only when he noticed a sock sticking to the side of the wall. That is when we realized we needed to get out - fast. But where to go? We would be either catching the tail ends of parties or going to bed at a time that seemed more fitting for a nursing home than a college dormitory.
We had heard from a friend that the science building had an unlocked observatory on the roof. Thinking that a rooftop would be a neat place to go at night, we decided to embark on the adventure with a slight hope that the doors would actually be open. Everyone else we invited either had no hope or called us crazy for wanting to be outside on a cold night. They must not have seen the sock stuck to the wall. 
Walking around clothes and video-game controllers, Scotch peeked into the already ajar refrigerator on his way out. Typical of such a night, only one blue can stared back at him, so he deposited it into his hoodie pocket for hydration at our hoped-for destination. Opening the door to North Quad, I noticed that the sky was not blue-gray, but instead was a deep navy with a crisp moon and stars - a perfect night to relax on a roof. Sadly, the university did not think so, and the locked doors kept us moving.
Scotch is a quiet but economical kid. He does not say more than what needs to be said, but it is known that when he does say something, you'd better tune in because it is sure to be hilarious. And he is never short of ideas. Our journey had us walking by the ghostly skeleton that was Notre Dame Stadium. Having barely noticed the stadium for a few months, we began complaining about the disappointing season. Ranting about the marathon, storm-interrupted loss to South Florida and the multiple goal-line fumbles, we wondered what it was like when Notre Dame was a perennial powerhouse (before we were born). 
When we reached Knute Rockne Gate, we were creating hypotheticals - complete jokes. What if, miraculously, we won the national championship the next season? What if Notre Dame was the center of the college football world again? Then Scotch stopped. He had been contemplating the safety of drinking his tucked-away can for most of the walk. After a few quick scans of the area, he pulled it out. We were standing under the bronze figure of Knute Rockne. Just as I had done when I was little, I called out "Knute!" and he grinned back, fists on his hips. We reread his accomplishments - 105 wins, 12 losses, 5 ties and 3 national championships. This quickly reaffirmed his legendary status, and reiterated the tradition that is the backbone Notre Dame. That is when Scotch decided it was time to add to the legend.
With a crack of the can, Scotch looked around again. In a few seconds, half the can was in his stomach. But he stopped about halfway through and wiped his permanent five-o'clock shadow with his sleeve. This was one of those moments when I had to make sure I was listening. Scotch looked at me, laughing, and declared that he had to pour out the other half for Knute. As the liquid flowed to Knute's feet, it gathered into a stagnant puddle of the purest beverage you could find. From a college student's point of view, it was glorious.
"We're going to be undefeated next season," Scotch announced. "Knute has just been thirsty."
And what a declaration it was.
 A Thirst Is Quenched 
Come late summer and early fall, the start of the Fighting Irish football season was just as spine-tingling as ever. But while the leaves were beginning to turn gold in a way that only Notre Dame leaves do, there was something missing: that perennial, overblown anticipation of a good Notre Dame team. A gantlet of a schedule seemed to hold students and the news media from the hopes of reliving glory days. The claims of Notre Dame's irrelevance were growing. Little did the doubters know of Scotch's prediction.
It was not until the Michigan game, on Sept. 22, that I remembered the events of the past February. With the Irish entering the game 3-0 after a big win against Michigan State, the student section seemed to be electrically charged under the stars. Manti Te'o's defense proved to be the generator. As we grew closer and closer to victory, my friend Robert began to continually yell, "We're going to state!" Our group joined in, much to the chagrin of the graduate students around us, and it became our slogan of the season. When the game finally ended, and a beautiful sea of twirled leis finally ceased, "December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)" blared over the loudspeakers. Surprised, students danced and sang from bleacher to bleacher, refusing to go home. It was the beginning of belief in a miraculous, high-school-like run to the championship. I looked at Scotch. He knew.
As the wins kept coming, the games kept getting better and better, and Scotch and I kept our secret. Then came Stanford. The morning was ugly and rainy, but as with most games at Notre Dame, the rain seemed to clear up at kickoff. It stayed that way until overtime, when rain flooded into the stadium. Nobody seemed to care, especially after a goal-line stand. A goal-line stand! It was like the stories I had read about teams past. I could not believe it. An official review allowed for two celebrations in the soaked student section. The second one was better. As students rushed onto the field, I ran to the top of the stadium to watch the giant party unfold, thinking that it would be the best view. I was wrong. On the field, I climbed onto the shoulders of Gordon, my 6-foot-7 friend. Yelling "We're going to state!" and getting those around me to echo, I felt like a skyscraper. Just like me, Notre Dame football was on the shoulders of college football again.
Scotch and I went to the dining hall once the party ended. Always getting a large crowd after games, it was packed. Seeing no free tables, we sat next to a couple of alumni. The first thing they said to us was, "Congratulations on experiencing your first Notre Dame moment." A few minutes later I received a text message from my dad that simply said, "Notre Dame moment!" All those hypotheticals that we envisioned in February were coming true.
We continued to talk to the alumni, and one told us his Notre Dame superstition (we all have them). As a student, he usually would not drink before games. But the few times he did, the team lost. Because of this, he never again drank before any Notre Dame games. Did we have a story to tell him! So we spilled the secret and told him all about what happened on that February night. He was impressed. Maybe the reason the team lost when he drank was the same reason we were now undefeated: Knute was thirsty.
While my roommate Sean used the uncertainty of the Oklahoma game to "party like it's the last time we're undefeated," I took a different approach. I walked across the hall to my friend E.J.'s room. He is on the team, and I wanted an inside report. I asked him how he felt, and he responded: "We're going to win. We're Notre Dame, we never lose." That was all I needed. I had never heard that said before. But it showed a confidence within the team that the Irish had seemed to lack for a while. E.J. was right: students flocked to the fountain known as Stonehenge to celebrate its waters, and the team was greeted by fans on its return to South Bend. Scotch seemed to belong telling fortunes at Delphi.
So the season continued and the road to "state" became more and more clear. My I.T. teacher began to blame the team's success for the overall disappointing grades of our class, while my sentimental Accounting I teacher would tell us stories of when he experienced a national championship as a student. My statistics teacher even started class with a video of Mark May, the ESPN analyst and former University of Pittsburgh player, in a leprechaun suit. Even more, all the campus computers were programmed to have a photo of the "#1" sign on campus as their background. You just could not escape the vibe, even while on break.
Our "semifinal" against Southern California was played over Thanksgiving break, and a plethora of nervous texts messages were sent that night. But after the final play, I looked down to a buzz on my phone. Scotch had texted me, "Who would have thought that no one tried that before." Notre Dame was undefeated and heading to the Bowl Championship Series title game. His prediction was true. Scotch Henderson for Heisman!
Notre Dame is a football program based on tradition and legends. It was built by Knute Rockne, the four horsemen and the Gipper in the early days of college football, and is known for its Heisman Trophy winners and national championships. This season will be remembered for the sound coaching of Brian Kelly, the inspirational play of Te'o and, as far as I'm concerned, the bold prediction of Scotch Henderson. Knute was thirsty. I mean, he is a Fighting Irishman, isn't he?

HEADLINE: A Start-Up Clips the Web but Doesn't Broadcast It

BYLINE: NICK WINGFIELD


HIGHLIGHT: Gary Flake believes that a lot of people who share images and other material through social networking services are mostly performing, cultivating artificial online versions of themselves aimed at impressing others. Mr. Flake, a veteran technologist, has a start-up company called Clipboard that he believes is a more authentic reflection of its members' interests, and he has just raised a new round of financing to help it grow. 

 BODY:
Gary Flake believes that a lot of people who share images and other content through social networking services are mostly performing, cultivating artificial online versions of themselves aimed at impressing others. 
Naturally, Mr. Flake, a veteran technologist who has held senior positions at Microsoft and Yahoo, has a solution, a service that he believes is a more authentic reflection of its members' interests, and he has just raised a new round of financing to help it grow.
Clipboard, the start-up founded by Mr. Flake, has echoes of Pinterest, the popular site for sharing images from the Web. As with Twitter, Pinterest members can follow the image galleries created by other members and publicly share their own.
Clipboard, in contrast, lets its members save entire Web pages, including images, video and text, or just pieces of them to a personal Web page. Although Clipboard members can share their galleries with others, the company doesn't push public sharing as hard as others. About 80 percent of everything Clipboard members save through the service is left private, according to Mr. Flake.
The material they save, as a result, is decidedly personal and practical, said Mr. Flake, the company's chief executive. Online shoppers use Clipboard to save Web pages for products so they can more easily compare them. Clipboard is also popular with programmers, who use it to save chunks of code from Web pages.
"There's a big difference between saving for yourself and saving with an eye towards broadcasting for the world," said Mr. Flake. "On Facebook, I have a persona -- this is Gary Flake, the witty version. Everything there is for supporting the fake version of me. Stuff I save for myself is much more boring and mundane."
The material on Pinterest, he believes, is "much more a statement of hopes, values and ideals. It's not focused on getting stuff done or an accurate representation of what I'm trying to accomplish on a given day."
Clipboard, based in Bellevue, Wash., announced on Monday that it had taken an investment from Scientia, a provider of scheduling services for educational institutions. The two companies will collaborate on developing services geared to the education market. The financing -- Clipboard declined to disclose the amount --
is the company's largest investment so far. The start-up has already raised a $1.5 million seed round of financing from Andreessen Horowitz, Index Ventures and others.
Of course, it's a lot harder to become a big Internet property if your focus is mostly on private saving of Web material. Clipboard, which began testing its service in late 2011, surpassed 100,000 registered users in December, and it is showing an average 40 percent month-over-month growth rate. Pinterest had 26 million unique visitors in October, according to Comscore.
"There were ways for us to grow much faster than we have, but I think we found a good compromise," Mr. Flake said.

HEADLINE: The Financial Crisis in the Courts

BYLINE: DAVID ZARING


HIGHLIGHT: The executive and legislative branches of the government have responded to the financial crisis, but the courts have played a low-key role thus far, the author writes. 

 BODY:
 David Zaring is assistant professor of legal studies at the Wharton School of Business. 
Two of the three branches of government have responded to the financial crisis, but we are only beginning to hear from the third one. As the executive branch, the White House and the Treasury Department organized bailouts of auto makers, money market funds and most of the large banks in the country. Congress passed a rescue and stimulus statute in the thick of the crisis, and the Dodd-Frank Act after it. 
But the courts have been, until recently, almost totally silent. Part of that silence is structural; we may not hear the Supreme Court opine on any aspect of it for years, given the complexities of its appellate jurisdiction. And part of it - the part that the lower courts are beginning to play only now - is uneven. 
Courts are supposed to put the policies of presidents and Congress to the test of judicial review, to evaluate decisions by the executive to sanction someone for wrongdoing and to resolve disputes between private parties. But the really sweeping programs that Congress and the president put in place during the financial crisis will not receive much courtroom attention at all, even as the executive's individual enforcement decisions receive scrutiny. It is only in private disputes that the facts of the financial crisis will get a judicial airing - and even then, all signs point to the airing being a modest one.
The courts have played such a low-key role for three reasons: the government has rarely been challenged for its own crisis-related conduct; at the same time, the Justice Department and other federal agencies have hesitated to prosecute the financial executives in place during the crisis; finally, private litigation over losses sustained during the crisis has been slow to develop, and quick to settle. In all, it is likely to be a disappointment to those who believe that the blame for the financial crisis can only really be apportioned through verdicts and judgments.
The government's own conduct is beginning to get a bit of glancing scrutiny from the courts, albeit largely through nontraditional means. The government is defending its bailouts of the American International Group, General Motors and Chrysler against shareholders or franchisees who argue that their property was taken in the restructurings, and it faced a smidgen of litigation during those bankruptcy proceedings. It is also facing a long-shot challenge from conservative activists over the constitutionality of Dodd-Frank. 
The Dodd-Frank challenge singles outthe Consumer Financial Protection Board and the Financial Stability Oversight Council, in both cases arguing that the new entities violate principles of separation of power by being (in the case of the Consumer Financial Protection Board, too insulated from presidential supervision; and in the case of the Financial Stability Oversight Council, too insulated from judicial review). Separation-of-powers cases are easy to understand, but hard to win, especially in light of various procedural hurdles that face litigants worried about agencies that have not taken many concrete actions yet.
The cases that were in response to the bailouts, which are known as takings cases, are interesting because the shareholders of A.I.G., led by the former chief executive, Maurice R. Greenberg, and the various auto dealers are essentially arguing that their property was taken without process (and the bailouts were, in fact, orchestrated very quickly), leaving them disproportionately on the hook for government action that should have been borne more equally by taxpayers. The trick in these cases will be pinning the taking on the government, rather than on the boards of the bailed-out firms, which agreed, at arm's length, to restructure their corporate arrangements in exchange for the infusion of cash. That looks less like eminent domain and more like vulture investing, but these cases have met with some early favorin the courts.
But generally, this sort of litigation has been minimal. The stimulus package has received no judicial review, the various takeovers engineered by the government were not subject to any of the Delaware Chancery Court suits that we usually see in the wake of a controversial merger, and the bailouts are being contested creatively, rather than through traditional means, like the Administrative Procedure Act, which is the usual way that government action is evaluated by the courts.
Ever since the acquittal of the failed Bear Stearns hedge fund managers, Ralph Cioffi and Matthew Tannin, for criminal fraud, the president's prosecutors have been remarkably reluctant to go after Wall Street denizens for financial crisis excesses in court. They have passed on prosecutions of subprime mortgage bundlerspar excellence like Angelo R. Mozilo of Countrywide Financial, structured product sellerslike the Goldman Sachs trader Fabrice Tourre and almost everyone else. 
Even civil efforts to single out executives have gone poorly. A Citigroup executive, Brian Stoker, was clearedof his role in selling a complicated $1 billion mortgage fund deal. The Securities and Exchange Commission's fraud case against the Bent family, which was behind the Reserve Primary Fund that broke the buck, ended up in personal victoriesfor the Bents.
There are a variety of explanations for the frankly surprisingdearth of individual penalties imposed in the aftermath of this crisis. During the savings-and-loan crisis of the 1980s, hundredsof financial executives were convictedof crimes. And in the wake of the dot-com collapse, more than 1,000were. But the inability of the government to convince juries that the desperate efforts of executives to persuade investors that things were under control in the depths of the crisis amounted to wrongdoing has perhaps played the most important part.
Individual responsibility has not yet been apportioned in court, but the government has recently gotten to work after a lengthy period of quiet. The government supervisor overseeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Machas sued almost 20 banksfor making false representations in the products sold to the housing giants. Wells Fargo and other banks have been suedfor the mortgages insured by the Federal Housing Authority under the Federal False Claims Act. JPMorgan Chase and Bear Stearns have been suedby the New York attorney general for failing to inspect the quality of the mortgages they put in mortgage-related products, which were then sold to investors. 
These suits have relied on a mix of statutes; they notably do not all turn on violations of the securities laws. With various agencies in action, and various bases for litigation, the best way to characterize the government's civil enforcement strategy would be as a diversified portfolio.
In many ways, this modest turn to the courts is underwhelming. Practicing finance during a recession should not necessarily be a criminal offense, but holding no executives responsible for the actions that led to the housing market collapse, after hundreds were imprisoned during earlier downturns, suggests arbitrariness. Even worse, it sets a different standard for Wall Street financiers of today and the bankers who went to jail in the wake of the 1980s bailout of the thrifts. 
And while the government has been criticized for not holding individuals accountable for the crisis, the really huge decisions it made - on whom to bail out, and how to stimulate the economy - will be subject to little judicial oversight. Even though those are precisely the kinds of decisions for which a second look might be helpful. 
 Instead, much of the judicial action will consist of suits between private parties. Many of these disputes are securities class action lawsuits against the financial institutions that originated mortgages that became toxic securities, or the monolines and banks that facilitated their packaging and resale. Kevin LaCroix's D&O Diary blog has already compiled a listof 55 settlements of these class actions, some of which have been settled, including Countrywide Financial's $624 million agreement. Approximately twice as many such suits have been dismissed, but many more are pending. 
Some shareholders have also sued companies like A.I.G., Bear Stearns and Merrill Lynch, thus far with little success. And a number of pension plan beneficiaries have sued financial institutions who have such plans for imprudent investments; Merrill Lynch and Countrywide have settled lawsuits on these grounds already. Add to that a few breach of contract suits, and you have a civil docket that will keep many lawyers busyfor a long time - even if it doesn't amount to the flood of litigation that one sees from, say, a man-made disaster like the Gulf oil spill.
But there is a cost to delegating responsibility in the financial crisis to the private sector. If the courts are focused on the resolution of disputes between private parties, we are likely to see settlements instead of sweeping opinions on the legality of what the banks did during and before the crisis, and what the government did to mitigate it. 
We may be waiting for a long time before the courts say anything definitive about the crisis.

HEADLINE: This Week In Small Business: YOLO!

BYLINE: GENE MARKS


HIGHLIGHT: The most annoying phrases of 2012, small-business predictions for 2013, start-ups to watch - and you won't believe how many people applied to work at Comcast last year. 

 BODY:
What's affecting me, my clients and other small-business owners this week.
 The Deal: A Not-So-Grand Bargain 
A "fiscal cliff" deal is reached and after all the drama this chart sums up the impact. One provision could head off a doubling of milk prices. Here's what's in it for small businesses.

 The Economy: Auto Sales Are Strong 
Many economic bloggers ended 2012 feeling pessimistic. The Restaurant Performance Index contracted, and SurePayroll's November small-business scorecard is down. Construction spending also fell, and small-business borrowing slowed. But manufacturing (pdf) picked up in December, and don't forget that the drilling boom for shale oil is remaking America's energy picture and has brought net oil imports to a 20-year low. Borrowing rates are as cheap as they have ever been in America, and domestic auto sales were very strong last month. The unemployment rate stays steady, online labor demand (pdf) increased, the private sector added 215,000 jobs, and the Philadelphia Fed's leading indexes (pdf) projected growth.

Bruno Aziza shares some advice from his start-up adventure: "Unless you are working on something truly different, or have a compelling story to tell, nobody will pay attention. ... Unless you can truly add value, nobody cares." This 15-year-old thinks he can reinvent how we consume news. A well-known blogger plans his own start-up. Jay Patani says interns are the unsung heroes of start-ups. Or maybe baby boomers are more essential?

 The Week's Bests 
 Eric Barker says there are 10 things you should do every day to improve your life, including laugh: "People who use humor to cope with stress have better immune systems, reduced risk of heart attack and stroke, experience less pain during dental work and live longer. Laughter should be like a daily vitamin."
 Scott Grannis says the fiscal cliff resolution goes a long way toward explaining why this has been the weakest recovery in history: "The burden of our debt binge is already upon us because we have borrowed trillions of dollars to support consumption, rather than new investment. What matters in the future is how productively we spend the proceeds of future bond sales, not how we pay off the bonds we've already sold. We can make progress on the margin if we can reduce federal spending relative to the size of the economy, since that in turn will reduce the amount of the economy's resources we waste. Allowing the private sector to increasingly decide how to spend the fruits of its labors will likely improve the overall productivity and strength of the economy, because the private sector is most likely smarter about how it spends its own money. We've got to get the government out of the way if we are to move forward."

HEADLINE: Deficits Forever?


HIGHLIGHT: Why a structural-deficit stalemate currently looks like a plausible American future. 

 BODY:
 Okay, smart guy, I can imagine a reader of the preceding post saying, you've just explained why you don't think a grand bargain is going to resolve our fiscal dilemma any time soon. But just last week, you were explaining why the Democrats' willingness to define "rich" upward made it seem less likely that they would be able to raise tax rates high enough to pay for the government they want, and in the same post you noted the conservative, entitlement-reforming path to fiscal sustainability also has "an air of fantasy about it." So if liberals can't win, conservatives can't win, and the two sides can't strike a deal, how are we actually going to get our fiscal house in order? 
I think one all-too-plausible answer is that we aren't. That might mean a genuine debt crisis, a near-default scenario that forces a combination of spending cuts and tax increases, perhaps with some swift inflation worked in, that's uglier than any grand bargain either side would countenance. But given the resilience of global confidence in the United States over the last two years, it might just mean living with structural deficits that drag on growth for years and decades to come. Indeed, if I were rank-ordering scenarios for the American future right now, the latter possibility would probably rank highest: Neither a massive crisis nor a sweeping legislative solution, but an ugly equilibrium in which muddling-through politicians win enough small victories and reach enough small deals to gradually stabilize the debt-to-GDP ratio ... but at a level that all-but-ensures a generation or more of economic stagnation and lurching, shortsighted, crisis-driven domestic policymaking.
That seems like a scenario worth avoiding. But its seeming plausibility makes me skeptical when liberals like Jonathan Chait respond to critiques of their party's cravenness on middle class taxes by saying confidently that "at some point, we will likely face a choice of cutting benefits or raising taxes, and in the face of a simple, zero-sum choice like that, voters would overwhelmingly favor tax hikes." It isn't just that I don't think that "overwhelmingly" is true (though I don't!), it's that such a zero-sum choice may never present itself quite so starkly. Instead, the option of some sort of can-kicking may always be available, and so a broader solution to our fiscal problems will require more from politicians than just defensive maneuvering and an assumption that the public will choose their side when push really comes to shove.
In this landscape, no matter which painful solution polls better in the abstract, a political coalition that's actually laid the groundwork for what it wants to do seems more likely to succeed in doing it. The Republican Party is an unserious party in many ways, but it has leaders (from Paul Ryan to Tom Coburn) who understand that crucial point, and who have spent the last few years elaborating the kind of entitlement reforms that the conservative vision of government requires, and putting their fellow Republicans on the record in support of them. From Barack Obama on down, I don't see the same thing happening on the Democratic side; instead, I see a party that's still loath to acknowledge that its program requires sacrifice from anyone save the wealthy, and that just responded to a moment of maximum leverage by narrowing its definition of who constitutes the rich. If Democrats want to raise middle class taxes - and I mean really raise them, not just cut deals that nudge revenue upward a little here and there - they need to lay the political and policy groundwork for that kind of push, and they need to start relatively soon. Until that starts to happen, it seems reasonable to give conservatism slightly better odds than liberalism of winning the long-term fiscal war outright ... with the aforementioned structural-deficit stalemate, unfortunately, remaining the most likely outcome of all.

HEADLINE: The Benefits of Uncertainty

BYLINE: BINYAMIN APPELBAUM


HIGHLIGHT: After Congress relieved executives of the need to guess what future tariffs with China might be, the United States paid a price of four million manufacturing jobs, a new study finds. 

 BODY:
When people argue that uncertainty about taxation and regulation is freezing corporate decision-making, they are generally arguing that more certainty would be a good thing for the economy. The idea, deemed so self-evident that it sometimes is left unspoken, is that corporations are hesitating to invest in the United States. 
But an interesting study flips this story on its head. It finds that manufacturing employment in the United States declined sharply as a direct result of a 2000 government decision to fix in place the level of tariffs on imports from China.
The level of tariffs had remained constant for years, but only because Congress acted each year to extend the status quo. Without that annual vote, tariffs on many goods would have increased, in some cases quite sharply. Then in 2000, Congress granted "permanent normal trade relations" to China. The legislation mostly left the existing tariffs unchanged. What it eliminated was uncertainty about next year.
The result was a burst of corporate decision-making. Newly confident that tariffs on imports would not increase, executives responded by firing workers in the United States and moving production to the other side of the Pacific.
The effect was huge, according to the paper, by Justin R. Pierce, a Federal Reserve economist, and Peter K. Schott, a professor at the Yale School of Management.

"Absent the shift in U.S. policy, U.S. manufacturing employment would have risen nearly 10 percent between 2001 and 2007, versus an actual decline of more than 15 percent," they wrote - a difference of roughly four million manufacturing jobs.
The analysis is based on the fact that before 2000, in the absence of Congressional action, tariffs on different goods would have increased by different amounts. The larger the potential increase, the greater the weight of uncertainty before 2000 - and, the authors found, the larger the decline in employment after 2000.
There's an abundance of ancillary evidence, too: imports from China increased in those sectors, as did the number of American companies importing from China and the number of Chinese companies exporting to the United States. And surviving domestic manufacturers invested heavily in technology to remain competitive.
Job losses cause a great deal of pain. But mainstream economists have long maintained that moving manufacturing to China is good for the United States in the long run, because it reduces prices and shifts resources to more productive uses. Even that consolation, however, has lately been called into question by research showing that dreaming up new things is easier if you also are making things. Put differently, the other jobs eventually will follow the manufacturing jobs.
There is some evidence that the worst is over now. Last year was the third straight year of job growth in manufacturing. But the increases are tiny in comparison to the jobs lost since 2000. Manufacturing employment fell from 17.2 million at the end of 2000 to a nadir of 11.5 million in 2009, and has since climbed to 12 million at the end of 2012.
