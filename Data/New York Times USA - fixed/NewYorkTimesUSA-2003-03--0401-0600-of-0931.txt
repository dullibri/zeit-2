HEADLINE: S.E.C. Chief Says Fixing the Agency Will Take Time 

BYLINE:  By STEPHEN LABATON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
Despite a huge budget increase after years of financial neglect, the Securities and Exchange Commission will take longer than previously thought to shore itself up with the hiring of 800 lawyers, accountants, investigators and other employees, the agency's new chairman testified today.
 In his first appearance before Congress since his arrival at the S.E.C. three weeks ago, the chairman, William H. Donaldson, tried to lower political expectations after lawmakers had rushed to give him money to fix the agency's long-simmering problems. He said that he would make good use of the budget increase but that it would take time to restore the agency. 
 "The unprecedented new resources for the agency present many challenges, but more importantly, many opportunities," he said. "We will hire aggressively but thoughtfully, not just to increase head count. As a result, these hiring targets may only be met over a longer period of time, but they will be met with people that we are sure can perform the vital tasks that we assign to them." 
Aides to Mr. Donaldson said that his two biggest priorities were finding a chairman of a new accounting oversight board and shoring up the management and morale of the agency. He emphasized his commitments to those areas again in testimony today before a House appropriations subcommittee. 
He noted that Friday would be the last day of the first phase of the commission's search for a permanent chairman of the accounting board, when the agency will complete its list of potential candidates. The five S.E.C. commissioners are then expected to reduce the list by each proposing three candidates, who will be reviewed for potential legal and ethical problems before that list is winnowed again.
At the hearing, and in a brief meeting with reporters, Mr. Donaldson also expounded on policy issues for the first time as the agency's chairman. He said, for instance, that he thought companies needed to account for stock options granted to executives, though he questioned whether recording them as expenses was the most accurate way of reflecting their cost. He said that before making a final decision he would await rules being planned by the Financial Accounting Standards Board.
Mr. Donaldson said he did not see a need for a new regulatory organization to oversee the mutual fund industry, an idea that was floated by his predecessor and was supported by some Republicans. He also defended the decision of the new accounting oversight board to award its members salaries that exceed that of the president.
But the day was largely dominated by budget issues.
Mr. Donaldson, a former corporate executive and founding dean of Yale's management school, made clear that one of his biggest priorities would be reshaping the agency. He has spent his first month studying how to reorganize the personnel in his office and reconsidering the agency's overall operations. His review has large and small implications, from how the commission approaches investigations and processes and analyzes the flood of corporate filings it receives each day to whether more employees can work from their homes.
The agency's enlarged budget will enable it to increase its staff by 25 percent over the next year, to 4,000 employees. But even though the sluggish economy has made it easier to do some hiring, the agency, like other federal agencies, has encountered some difficulty in finding accountants, who are typically able to command significantly bigger salaries in the private sector.
The increased budget is also to be used to upgrade the agency's antiquated computer system and to raise salaries as part of an effort to reduce the historically large attrition rate among the S.E.C.'s more valuable employees.
Although the agency has managed to file a record number of cases in the last year and has adopted new rules in response to the corporate scandals that have shaken the markets, officials say the commission's divisions have lost ground in their efforts to keep up with the growth of business and the expansion of stock ownership to new investors. 
Two of the most important units of the commission, its enforcement division and its office of compliance inspections, are short of hundreds of officials, experts say, sharply limiting their effectiveness. The corporate finance department cannot keep up with the deluge of company filings. The market regulation division has for years been unable to persuade the agency's five commissioners to adopt rules that could change the way the markets set stock prices.
Unlike virtually every other domestic agency not involved in national security, the commission received a budget increase this year that far exceeded what was sought by the administration, and the White House, hoping to defuse a potential political issue, has announced support for an even larger budget next year.
Congress acted after a wave of criticism followed the administration's backpedaling on its financial commitment to the commission last year.
But as the budget deficit has increased, anxious lawmakers today sought assurances that Mr. Donaldson would wisely spend all of the money the agency has been given. Congress has provided the agency with $711.7 million this year, about $170 million more than the White House requested. President Bush has said that the administration will recommend a budget for the next fiscal year of $841.5 million, or 92 percent above last year's budget of $438 million.
Some of the money this year is also being used to finance the new accounting board temporarily. The board today began the process of writing the rules to determine how much it will assess publicly traded companies to pay for part of its costs. The rest will be paid by fees to the companies' outside auditors.

HEADLINE: Atmosphere of Gloom Thickens Around G.M. and Ford 

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 13 

 BODY:
A century ago, American car companies were nearly as plentiful as 1990's Internet start-ups. Now there are just two independents left, General Motors and Ford Motor, and some prominent analysts rate their prospects as not much better than a dot-com's.
 Without "a material change" in the industry's business model, G.M. and Ford face a crisis that "will involve restructuring, consolidation, or possibly even mergers with other partners," said John Casesa, auto analyst at Merrill Lynch, in an interview. 
 Gary Lapidus of Goldman, Sachs wrote in a recent report entitled "Motown Breakdown" that "the status quo may be untenable." Sean Egan, an analyst at the independent credit rating agency Egan-Jones, was even more pointed recently, saying Ford would be bankrupt if not for its blue- chip brand name. 
Certainly, these are lean times for the Big Three, though Chrysler at least has its German parent, DaimlerChrysler, to lean on. 
The latest sign of economic trouble came from Ford, which said today that it would cut second-quarter production 17 percent. War worries appear to be halting years of booming North American sales. 
"It's pretty clear that consumer confidence has slipped," said George Pipas, Ford's top sales analyst. "It may be an equal measure of concerns about geopolitical instability, prospects for conflict, and there hasn't been much good news as it relates to jobs."
Rising gas prices are also wearing on a pivotal Detroit profit center, big S.U.V.'s. Making matters worse, after a year and a half, an incentive war led by G.M. appears to have lost its effectiveness, while many customers now take zero percent financing for granted. 
And there is themost basic problem: Toyota and Honda build vehicles that customers tend to like better. As if all that were not bad enough, now the domestics face a reinvigorated Nissan and an improving Hyundai. 
Ford looks weakest right now, for a variety of reasons. Its cost structure is bloated and its bonds are trading as if they had junk ratings. The company, which celebrates its centennial in June, has lost $6.4 billion in the last two years. 
And there is continuing turmoil in the corner offices. The management team, assembled by William Clay Ford, Jr., the chairman and chief executive for nearly a year and a half, has yet to coalesce. Nicholas V. Scheele, Ford's president and chief operating officer, sent a memo Wednesday to company officers that tried to squelch rumors of a rift with David Thursfield, another top executive. And Ford is currently looking for its sixth chief financial officer in four years while Allan D. Gilmour, retired until last year, fills in. 
This has not bolstered Wall Street's confidence in the turnaround plan Mr. Ford's team laid out last January, 2002, and analysts wonder whether Ford is worth taking a flier on even after hitting a 10-year low Tuesday.
Mr. Egan told Grant's Interest Rate Observer in an article last month, "if it didn't have the name Ford, it would be in bankruptcy."
But Ford does have the name Ford, and almost all other analysts dismiss talk of bankruptcy. In fact, Ford stock got a boost Wednesday when Saul Rubin, a UBS Warburg analyst and a noted bear on Ford, upgraded the stock from "reduce-2" to "neutral-2," in effect telling investors that Ford may be bad, but not that bad.
"While long-term prospects look poor indeed, we believe that Ford simply does not have the balance sheet weakness to support any notion of imminent bankruptcy risk," Mr. Rubin wrote in his report, adding that while it was "a poor equity investment" it was also fairly cheap. 
After falling to $6.60 Tuesday, Ford stock rebounded 53 cents over the next two days to close at $7.13. Ford traded as high as $38.11 in 1999. 
Others were more pessimistic.
"The reality is that Ford is very bad," Maryann Keller, a longtime auto analyst, adding that the company's troubles are a holdover from the brief, but destructive, reign of Jacques A. Nasser, who was ousted by Mr. Ford in October 2001. 
She said Mr. Nasser "squandered billions," laid off the company's older managers and let product plans stagnate.
"Here they are with no products, no bench, no people," she said.
In recent decades, she added, Ford got by because it "was a little better than G.M." by such measures as quality and manufacturing efficiency, and pressures on the Big Three "were largely inflicted on General Motors."
"But now, by most statistical measures, G.M. is better than Ford," she said. "And the world's largest auto company doesn't need to be better than Honda or Toyota, just Ford."
With a potential war looming, things could get worse. "They were not making money over the last two years when auto sales were good," Mr. Egan said in an interview. "So what will it look like over the next two years?"
He also sees a company with total debt load of $166 billion last year versus $11.2 billion in shareholders' equity. But David Brandi, Ford's director of long-term financing, argued against combining Ford's automotive debt with Ford Credit's huge portfolio of car loans. 
"You have two very different kinds of businesses," he said, "and there is an appropriate leverage for each."
Most analysts see Ford's borrowing situation as ugly but under control. And there is adebate on whether G.M. really is in much better financial shape than Ford. 
"Ford is highly liquid and it has lots of assets to sell," Mr. Casesa of Merrill said. "I'm in the camp that sees the restructuring plan as credible and achievable and exactly what the company needs, but it will take time to create results."
"I think it's the most vulnerable in the market right now, but from a balance sheet standpoint Ford may have more staying power than G.M., primarily because Ford has a much larger net cash position and a much lower pension liability."
Part of G.M.'s problem is that it is the remnant of a much larger company and now supports two and a half retirees per worker in North America, compared with a one-for-one situation at Ford. 
Mr. Lapidus of Goldman, Sachs said "the conventional view would be that Ford operations are not performing as well," but he added that Ford's "balance sheet, at least in the short run, is in better shape." 
There are fewer short-term calls on their cash and they have more of it," he said.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Markets Rally as a U.N. Vote Is Delayed

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Investors bought beaten-down shares yesterday, as the United States expressed a willingness to delay until next week a vote on using force to disarm Iraq, propelling the stock market to its best daily performance since October.
 The Nasdaq composite index rose nearly 5 percent, climbing into positive territory for the year, while the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose more than 3 percent. The dollar strengthened, oil prices fell and Treasury securities, which have been a haven for many investors, suffered their biggest sell-off in two months. Gold, another safe harbor, fell 3 percent. 
 Stocks also soared in Europe, where benchmark indexes were up more than 6 percent after declines of as much as 4.8 percent on Wednesday. 
The emotions swirling around the threat of a war with Iraq have been mostly negative for stocks recently, but investors appeared yesterday to have found some relief in suggestions that a war would not start Monday, the date set in a resolution sponsored by the Bush administration.
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said, however, that it might be better to go to war without a United Nations vote.
Still, many market experts viewed the rally, not solely as a response to the back and forth on Iraq, but as an expected rebound after weeks of selling and cautioned that it could be short-lived.
"You can get these very sharp bear market rallies for a few days and then you have another opportunity to sell," said Joseph Liro, an economist and market analyst at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates.
Analysts also said that yesterday's rally was powered by investors who had been betting on a further decline in stocks but shifted their strategy after shares rebounded into positive territory late Wednesday.
All the buying and selling occurred against the backdrop of efforts by the United States and Britain to gain support in the United Nations Security Council for a new resolution that would set a firm deadline for the disarmament of Iraq, with a war to follow if it did not comply.
Because investors appeared in recent days to be worried about a growing split between the United States and its allies, including France and Russia, they might have been buoyed by an announcement from the White House just as the stock market was opening that President Bush might carry the debate on Iraq into next week and was "willing to go the extra mile for diplomacy." 
But the moves yesterday may also have been part of normal retrenchments. The price of oil started the day at a 12-year high and the dollar hovered near a 4-year low against the euro. Treasury yields were at or near their lowest levels since the 1950's, and gold had recently reached a seven-year high. Stocks were near the lows of at least five years reached in October. 
"A lot of it appears to me to be just reversal of big bets," said Henry Herrmann, chief investment officer at Waddell & Reed in Overland Park, Kan. "It is a very emotional move."
He said that some of the bet switchers were hedge funds, which in the current environment tend to move their money in and out of the markets very quickly, especially at the sign of the slightest change in atmosphere. 
He also said that he had heard unsubstantiated rumors that might have contributed to the market's big moves, including a report that the Central Intelligence Agency was talking to generals in Iraq.
From his pointof view, however, he added, "I don't see anything in the economic fundamentals to make me feel better."
The Dow surged 269.68 points, or 3.6 percent, to close at 7,821.75. On Tuesday, the Dow was at 7,524.06, just 237.79 points from the five-year low reached on Oct. 9.
The S.& P. 500 rose 27.71 points, or 3.5 percent, to close at 831.90. On Tuesday, it was just 23.97 points from its five-and-a-half-year low on Oct. 9.
The Nasdaq climbed 61.53 points, or 4.8 percent, to 1,340.77, putting it up 0.4 percent for the year. The Dow is still down 6.2 percent for the year and the S.& P. 500 is off 5.5 percent. The Nasdaq's six-year low on Oct. 9 was 1,114.11. All three gauges had their best daily percentage gain since Oct. 15.
Among the stocks leading the market higher were 3M, I.B.M., United Technologies, General Electric, Wal-Mart Stores, Citigroup, Microsoft and Intel.
Trading volume was 1.77 billion, modestly above the recent average.
Mr. Liro agreed about the influence of hedge funds. "From the data I look at, hedge funds had been very, very short," he said, referring to a trade in which a stock is borrowed and then sold on the hope that its price will decline and that it can be bought back at a profit. But when a market starts to move up rapidly, so-called shorts will buy back their stocks quickly to lock in profits or avoid losses, giving the market an added upward push.
The rally in the stock market came despite a report of unexpectedly weak retail sales in February, with the government reporting that they fell 1.6 percent, far more than the 0.5 percent decline expected by Wall Street forecasters.
The report was so much weaker than expected that Morgan Stanley cut its growth estimate for the first quarter to 1.2 percent at an annual rate from 1.5 percent, said David J. Greenlaw, chief United States fixed-income economist. 
The weak report on retail sales follows last Friday's report that 308,000 jobs were lost in February.
"The consumer is clearly vulnerable as long as gasoline prices remain elevated and labor market conditions are deteriorating," he said.
In London, the blue-chip FTSE 100, which fell 4.8 percent Wednesday to its lowest level since mid-1995, climbed 6.1 percent, its biggest one-day gain in 15 years. The CAC-40 index in France rose 6.3 percent after a 3.6 percent drop Wednesday, while the DAX index in Germany rose 6.9 percent after a 4.4 percent decline Wednesday. The main index in the Netherlands surged 10 percent.
Analysts attributed the giddy swings to strong earnings reports and investors who were chasing dividends and bargains after Wednesday's declines. Some also said investors were buying in anticipation of a rally if a war in Iraq ends quickly. But analysts remained cautious about the prospects for a sustained rally in Europe's bear markets.
Ruth Kelly, a senior official in the British Treasury, acknowledged that "no country can insulate itself from international events, and we are in a time of deep global uncertainty."
Part of the rebound in Europe was led by Royal Philips Electronics, whose shares gained 13 percent after the company said it would cut 1,600 jobs at two factories in the United States, saving more than $200 million.
In the American Treasury market, the price of the 10-year note fell 113/32 , to 101. The yield, which moves in the opposite direction, jumped to 3.75 percent from 3.59 percent on Wednesday. No matter what the news, Treasuries have had a habit recently of selling off when the stock market jumps higher, reflecting the move of money from one market to the other. 
The dollar rose 1.7 percent against the euro, to $1.0813 from $1.0998 on Wednesday. The price of crude oil for April delivery dropped $1.82, or 4.8 percent, to $36.01 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The price of an ounce of gold for April delivery plunged $10.60, or 3.1 percent, to $336.

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

"ALL THE REAL GIRLS," starring Paul Schneider, Zooey Deschanel and Patricia Clarkson. Written and directed by David Gordon Green (R, 108 minutes). Mr. Green follows "George Washington," his luminous found fable of Southern childhood, with a more conventional story of young love. Mr. Schneider plays a small-town cad whose easygoing promiscuity is derailed by Ms. Deschanel, whose character has just returned home from boarding school. Their sweet, fumbling romance is captured with scruffy, low-key lyricism.The film is an awkward hybrid of free-form, do-it-yourself filmmaking and professional discipline (supplied by the wonderful Ms. Deschanel, and by Ms. Clarkson), but its beauty and sincerity overcome its flaws and hesitations (A. O. Scott).

"DAREDEVIL," starring Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Colin Farrell and Michael Clarke Duncan. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (PG-13, 96 minutes). Sometimes playing a comic-book hero gives actors a chance to show suave, stylized moves. After stripping off their civvies, they emerge from the phone booth a star. Christopher Reeve gave a breezy, farcical charge to Superman and Clark Kent. As Batman and his alter ego, the wastrel playboy Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton seemed to have a thousand things on his mind, most of them unpleasant. But poor Ben Affleck is lost in the minor, passable "Daredevil," in which he portrays the blind, red-costumed and horn-headed crime fighter whose other senses -- hearing, touch, taste -- were exaggerated in the chemical accident that cost him his sight. A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role. Even his scarlet leather outfit makes him diminutive. The interlocked double D on his left breast makes him look like part of the food-service industry: "Hi, I'm Daredevil, and I'll be your superhero this evening" (Elvis Mitchell).

* "GANGS OF NEW YORK," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 165 minutes). Long awaited, enormously expensive, endlessly gossiped about, Mr. Scorsese's brutal epic of mid-19th-century Manhattan is a near-great film that, as time goes by, may well make up the distance. As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story -- a revenge tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Mr. DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Mr. Day-Lewis) -- is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. In his mouth the rough vernacular of the old New York streets becomes poetry. If Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is the way it brings history to life, not merely by meticulously recreating its details but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continue to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to reimagine the germs of America's historical identity. It suggests, with vivid plausibility, that clues to the national character can be found in the violent, contradictory and often tragic story of the urban immigrant working class (Scott).

"HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS," starring Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey and Bebe Neuwirth. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG-13, 100 minutes). Yet another mediocre New York romantic comedy, yes, but notably less mediocre than "Maid in Manhattan" and "Two Weeks Notice." This is because Ms. Hudson and Mr. McConaughey are an energetic, well-matched comic pair and because the writers have smuggled a few sharp, funny jokes into the lockstep conventions of the plot. The premise, too, has a nice frost of screwball cynicism, as the two principals woo each other for venal, professional reasons. Ben (Mr. McConaughey), a tomcatting ad man, must make a woman fall in love with him if he is to win a big account; to write a feature article for a women's magazine, Andie (Ms. Hudson) must drive a man away. Would you believe that they actually fall in love? Nobody would, but it's sometimes fun to pretend, just as it's fun to pretend that the advertising and magazine industries are untouched by recession, the Knicks are in the N.B.A. finals and Staten Island is full of people who talk as if they're from Texas (Scott).

* "LAUREL CANYON," starring Frances McDormand, Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, Natascha McElhone and Alessandro Nivola. Written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko (R, 103 minutes). Ms. McDormand is indelible as Jane Bentley, a leonine, free-spirited Hollywood record producer of a certain age in Ms. Cholodenko's followup to "High Art." Once again, the milieu is upscale bohemian, with the setting moved from the New York art world to the Los Angeles rock scene. Tensions build when Jane's son (Mr. Bale) by a former liaison and his wife (Ms. Beckinsale), both doctors, pay her a prolonged visit while she is completing an album with a British rock band. Although the music is more 70's and 80's than contemporary in flavor, this sexy movie, which portrays the Laurel Canyon neighborhood as a voluptuous lotus land, is a balanced, snappily written study of the reverse generation gap. Mr. Nivola smolders as Jane's much-younger lover (Stephen Holden).

"THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE," starring Kevin Spacey. Directed by Alan Parker (R, 130 minutes). In this would-be thriller, Mr. Spacey plays a death-penalty opponent facing execution for murder. As the title character, a downtrodden philosophy professor and activist who has become an alcoholic criminal, he evinces a weariness in his voice. The words float out of his mouth as if he were too tired to muster the strength for a single inflection, and this gives the picture the merest trace of believability. But that's before the crude, bullying narrative begins peppering the audience with kidney punches: "David Gale" may be the first liberal-leaning movie that could be brought up on assault charges since its director made "Midnight Express." Mr. Parker seems to think audiences are incapable of coming to their own conclusions, so he relieves them of that burden by doing it for them (Mitchell).

* "THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS," starring Glenn Close, Dermot Mulroney, Jessica Campbell, Joshua Jackson and Patricia Clarkson. Directed by Rose Troche (R, 120 minutes). Ms. Troche's adaptation of A. M. Homes's book of stories, which weaves together jarring comic-gothic vignettes of suburban misery into a somber, lurid tapestry, invites comparison to Robert Altman's "Short Cuts." But whereas Mr. Altman cobbled Raymond Carver's sorrowful deadpan into a vision of social disconnection, Ms. Troche mines Ms. Homes's jagged minimalism for its grim, compassionate metaphysics. The four families under scrutiny, who live within a few yards of each other, present a tableau of fallen humanity, trying to exercise free will in a cruel and absurd universe. Ms. Close is especially fine as a mother grieving for her comatose son (Mr. Jackson), but the rest of the cast comes close to matching her precision and restraint. Though it has some awkward patches, and occasionally risks melodrama, "Safety" is on the whole a remarkably graceful satire, out of which sympathy sprouts like an unruly weed (Scott).

* "SPIDER," starring Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson and Gabriel Byrne. Directed by David Cronenberg (R, 98 minutes). This bleak minimalist film adapted from Patrick McGrath's novel (with a screenplay by the author) crawls into the mind of Dennis Cleg (Mr. Fiennes), a paranoid-schizophrenic man in his 30's who is discharged from a mental hospital into a grim halfway house near where he grew up in East London. The desolate urban environment mirrors the mental condition of a man whose warped memories of a homicide two decades earlier come flooding back as he revisits childhood landmarks. Mr. Fiennes's mumbling, agitated psychotic is an uncompromising portrait of a sad, creepy wreck. Ms. Richardson is equally disturbing in the dual roles of his demure mother and a Cockney tart, who personify the mother-whore dichotomy that obsesses Dennis. The recurrent imagery of spider webs, jigsaw puzzles and tangled string adds a layer of poetic creepiness (Holden).

"TEARS OF THE SUN," starring Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (R, 118 minutes). And also of boredom, frustration and fatigue, as an honorable intention -- to explore the moral conundrums of humanitarian military intervention -- bogs down in dramatic and ideological incoherence. Mr. Willis plays a United States Navy Seal who parachutes into the jungles of war-torn Nigeria to rescue an American doctor (Ms. Bellucci). He and his men end up trying to save a few dozen refugees from becoming victims of a ghastly genocidal campaign. The film's sentimentality is so overpowering, and so dumb, that it fails as drama, as action and as geopolitical fable. The filmmakers have gone to the trouble to invent a fictitious civil war in a real country, and for what? To soothe the American conscience about its failure to prevent actual recent slaughters? To give Mr. Willis another opportunity to exercise his talent for weary, manly stoicism? To give the egregious Hans Zimmer, who wrote the score, a chance to incorporate drums and pseudo-African choral effects? (Scott).

HEADLINE: With Write-Offs, Europe Tries to Look Ahead 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN D. GLATER 

 BODY:
The losses reported in recent weeks by many of Europe's largest companies were so immense that future results cannot help but look like an improvement. And that may be the point, lawyers and accountants say.
 The financial carnage has been especially bad at Europe's hard-hit telephone companies. Deutsche Telekom said on Monday that it lost 24.6 billion euros ($26.6 billion) in 2002, more than any European company had ever done. France Telecom lost 20.7 billion euros ($22.4 billion), and phone companies and phone-equipment suppliers in the Netherlands, Norway, Spain and Sweden were also awash in red ink. 
 But other industries produced multibillion-dollar losers as well: Roche Holding in pharmaceuticals; Fiat in automobiles; the Credit Suisse Group in financial services. The runner-up to Deutsche Telekom is Vivendi Universal, the entertainment, media and utilities conglomerate, which lost 23.3 billion euros ($25.2 billion).
Such numbers inevitably raise the question of whether executives are trying to put all the possible bad news -- and then some -- behind them, assigning the blame to the weak economy or previous management. Accountants call this tactic a big bath: faced with having to report a large loss that investors will not like, the companies exaggerate it, reckoning that doing so will not make the immediate market response any worse but could make future earnings look better.
"There's going to be a fair bit of bad news around anyhow, and there probably has been a fair amount of temptation to lump everything in together," said Tim Jones, a partner in the London office of the Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer law firm.
There is no easy way to know at a glance whether companies are exaggerating their losses -- say, by taking too big a write-down on the value of an asset. Mr. Jones said he had not come across any obvious cases. And it is certainly true, he said, that the shaky economy has genuinely hurt many companies, especially in telecommunications.
Lawyers said that in the wake of accounting scandals on both sides of the Atlantic, European regulators were pressing companies to report bad news promptly. Shareholder lawsuits, which might discourage executives from reporting oversize losses, are a much smaller threat in Europe than in America, they said. Together, these two factors may make it attractive for European executives to err heavily on the side of reporting greater losses, to dispel any concerns that yet more bad news may still be lurking undisclosed. 
"The risk of shareholder suits is significantly reduced in Europe compared to the U.S.," said David Childs, global head of the corporate practice at Clifford Chance, a law firm. "One reason for that is that in most European jurisdictions, if you lose the suit you pay the other side's costs. That's a significant disincentive."
Complicating the picture is the fact that the shares of some companies that have reported colossal losses also trade on American exchanges, opening the companies to securities litigation in the United States. 
At first blush, overstating losses might sound like conservative accounting, perhaps compensating for exaggerated profits in the bubble market of the 1990's. But overdoing the pessimism can be just as serious an accounting problem as overdoing the optimism. 
Making future financial results appear better by understating the current numbers is no more acceptable than inflating current figures would be, said Roman Weil, who is a professor of accounting at the University of Chicago Graduate School of Business.
"It's against every rule you can imagine," Mr. Weil said. "The problem is, accountants like to be conservative." 
Top executives have reasons to be aggressively conservative in their accounting -- especially if they are new to the job. 
Troubled companies that change chief executives often start the new boss's tenure by tying any losses, or at least the worst of them, to the period when the previous boss was in charge. 
In the case of the telecommunications companies, there are specific reasons they have suffered disproportionately, according to lawyers who have advised such companies. They have had to spend heavily to acquire new digital cellular licenses at auction and then invest in costly new technology to build the new networks, without much return so far, Mr. Jones noted.
As the prospects of reaping revenue from those investments have receded, he said, the companies have had to write down their value.
"They've probably had to take a fairly realistic look at that," Mr. Jones said.
Financial services companies have also faced sour market conditions, and the losses at other companies reflect problems that may not be industrywide but are no less real for that, he said. "The market's not really easy for anybody at the moment."

HEADLINE: Bayer Says Baycol Costs May Exceed Its Insurance 

BYLINE:  By HUGH EAKIN

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 13 

 BODY:
Bayer, the German chemicals and pharmaceuticals giant, said today that its insurance coverage might not be adequate to cover its potential liabilities in connection with Baycol, a cholesterol-reducing drug the company withdrew in August 2001 after it was linked to more than 100 deaths. Bayer also reported a sharp fall in profits for 2002.
The company's chief executive, Werner Wenning, said that there were now 8,400 personal injury suits pending against Bayer over Baycol, and that 500 more had been settled out of court at a cost to the company of $150 million. A verdict is expected in the next few days in a Baycol case in Corpus Christi, Tex., the first to go to trial. 
 "It is possible that Bayer could incur charges in excess of its insurance coverage," Mr. Wenning said. "The uncertainty of the outcome and the financial effects of the predominantly American litigation makes it impossible to draw conclusions." 
 Mr. Wenning declined to give details about the company's insurance. He said the company might have to set aside some earnings to cover the uninsured costs, but that it was not yet possible to estimate how much money would be needed.
The company, based in Leverkusen, said it was also being sued by a group of American shareholders over the Baycol problem. The suit accuses Mr. Wenning and a former chief executive, Manfred Schneider, of improperly withholding and misrepresenting information about the drug.
Mr. Wenning defended Bayer's handling of Baycol and said the company would vigorously contest the suit. 
For 2002, Bayer reported a 46 percent drop in profits from operations, to 989 million euros ($1.07 billion), reflecting rising raw material costs and sagging demand, especially in its industrial chemicals division. The results in the agricultural chemicals division were hurt by the costs of integrating Aventis CropScience. The company's net income rose 10 percent for the year, to 1.1 billion euros ($1.2 billion), because of gains on asset sales. 
"It's not a good set of figures," said Andrew Benson, an analyst for Schroder Salomon Smith Barney in London. "Hopefully continued restructuring will bring improvement." 
The company said it expected better operating results for 2003 and set a goal of increasing its cash flow by 21 percent over the next three years. 
"The operating basis is weaker than expected," said Ulrich Huwald of MM Warburg in Hamburg. "On the other hand, the outlook isn't bad given this economic environment." 
Bayer has much of its hopes for improved performance pinned on Levitra, the anti-impotence drug that recently won approval in the European Union. American regulators are expected to follow suit later this year. The company expects that the drug can reach peak sales of more than 1 billion euros ($1.1 billion) a year.
"The view is, it's a best-in-its-class product," Mr. Benson said. "If it takes off and they can turn the company around, than Bayer is worth more than its current price."
The company is still searching for a partner for its pharmaceutical division, which is regarded in the industry as not quite big enough to compete effectively on its own with giants like Merck and Roche. In the meanwhile, it is striking individual deals, like its agreement to market Levitra in partnership with GlaxoSmithKline.
But analysts said the most important question for the company now is the Baycol litigation. 
"The key is uncertainty," said Andreas Theisen of WestLB Panmure in Dusseldorf. "Estimates of Bayer's liability costs now range from $1 billion to $10 billion. We simply don't know how much the damages will be." 
Shares of Bayer rose 2.8 percent today, to 10.85 euros ($11.72). Shares traded above 22 euros in January.
"The good news is, a huge amount of potential liability is already in the current share price," Mr. Theisen said. "If you could say for certain that the liability would be $5 billion, the share price would already be higher."

HEADLINE: Security, at a Price 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 The Office of Management and Budget's interest in applying cost-benefit analysis to homeland security measures is laudable (news article, March 11). 
Even if precise quantification of the benefits to security and harms to civil liberties is impossible, analytic consideration of the trade-offs is wise. 
As John Graham, director of regulatory affairs at O.M.B., says, "Simply identifying some of these costs will help understand them and get people to think about alternatives that might reduce those costs."
Cost-benefit analysis should also be used to evaluate the potential war in Iraq. The benefits of ousting Saddam Hussein should be measured against the costs of casualties, waging war, reconstruction, retaliatory terrorism and increased anti-Americanism. Such analysis would prompt us "to think about alternatives that might reduce those costs."

HEADLINE: G.O.P. Senators Oppose Size of Bush Tax Cut 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 13 

 BODY:
President Bush's proposal to spur the economy by cutting taxes $726 billion over the next decade was dealt a potentially serious setback today when two Republican senators said they would support no cut larger than $350 billion.
 The Republicans, Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and George V. Voinovich of Ohio, joined two Democrats, Max Baucus of Montana and John B. Breaux of Louisiana, to send a letter to their parties' Senate leaders stating that they were committed to vote against any tax cut beyond $350 billion unless it was offset by tax increases elsewhere or specific spending decreases. 
 If the Republicans stick to the pledge, the Bush proposal probably cannot win Senate passage.
The Senate has 51 Republicans, 48 Democrats and 1 independent. One Democrat, Zell Miller of Georgia, supports Mr. Bush, but the other 47 and the independent, JamesM. Jeffords of Vermont, are believed to oppose the tax plan. One Republican, Lincoln D. Chafee of Rhode Island, has said he will not vote for a tax cut this year under any circumstance. 
So if Ms. Snowe and Mr. Voinovich stand fast, at least 51 senators seem to be against Mr. Bush's proposal. Two other Republicans, John McCain of Arizona and Susan Collins of Maine, have also expressed strong reservations about the plan, but the pledge by Ms. Snowe and Mr. Voinovich seems to carry even more weight because it was written and signed. The two took the stand, they said in the letter, because of "international uncertainties and debt and deficit projections."
Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, proclaimed, "The president's plan is now officially dead."
But Claire Buchan, a White House spokeswoman, dismissed that notion.
"We saw the same thing in 2001," Ms. Buchan said. "Just as in 2001, we are confident that the president's proposals to create jobs and growth will prevail."
What Mr. Bush calls his growth plan has two main parts. The first would eliminate income taxes for individuals on most stock dividends. The other would put in place this year reductions in tax rates enacted in 2001 but not scheduled to go into effect until 2004 or 2006.
Tonight, the Senate Budget Committee voted along party lines to approve a budget that would accommodate the $726 billion in tax cuts and allow them to be considered in the Senate under a procedure that bars a filibuster.
The first test of Senate support for Mr. Bush's tax package could come next week when the budget reaches the floor. The plan, a budget resolution, does not carry the force of law, but it sets a framework for all tax and spending measures Congress will consider this year.
Mr. Voinovich said tonight that he might vote for the budget, but that if he did, he would make it clear he would vote against the tax-cut element if it came up in legislation.
The Senate budget would permit $800 billion in added tax cuts that the president wants over 10 years, including extension of the repeal of the federal estate tax. But these would be considered later and would not be protected against filibuster.
The budget President Bush sent Congress last month would require the government to run deficits for at least 10 years, the Congressional Budget Office has reported. The plan of the Senate Budget Committee shows a budget surplus in 2013.
The committee accomplished that through spending restraints from 2009 through 2013 that are much tougher than what the administration has contemplated.
Democrats on the committee offered amendments today to reduce the tax cuts and permit more spending, but all were defeated. One by Senator Kent Conrad of North Dakota would have blocked most legislation that would result in a higher deficit until Mr. Bush gave Congress a detailed estimate of the cost of a war with Iraq.
But the committee chairman, Senator Don Nickles of Oklahoma, asserted that no Congress had ever provided money for a war before it started and that it was impossible to estimate how much a war and its aftermath might cost. 
The House Budget Committee approved its version of a budget at 1:30 this morning. The plan was revised after midnight so money would be available for Mr. Bush's proposal to set some prescription drug coverage under Medicare only if most of the money for it was found by cutting spending elsewhere in Medicare or other benefit programs.

HEADLINE: George W. Queeg 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Aboard the U.S.S. Caine, it was the business with the strawberries that finally convinced the doubters that something was amiss with the captain. Is foreign policy George W. Bush's quart of strawberries?
 Over the past few weeks there has been an epidemic of epiphanies. There's a long list of pundits who previously supported Bush's policy on Iraq but have publicly changed their minds. None of them quarrel with the goal; who wouldn't want to see Saddam Hussein overthrown? But they are finally realizing that Mr. Bush is the wrong man to do the job. And more people than you would think -- including a fair number of people in the Treasury Department, the State Department and, yes, the Pentagon -- don't just question the competence of Mr. Bush and his inner circle; they believe that America's leadership has lost touch with reality. 
 If that sounds harsh, consider the debacle of recent diplomacy -- a debacle brought on by awesome arrogance and a vastly inflated sense of self-importance.
Mr. Bush's inner circle seems amazed that the tactics that work so well on journalists and Democrats don't work on the rest of the world. They've made promises, oblivious to the fact that most countries don't trust their word. They've made threats. They've done the aura-of-inevitability thing -- how many times now have administration officials claimed to have lined up the necessary votes in the Security Council? They've warned other countries that if they oppose America's will they are objectively pro-terrorist. Yet still the world balks. 
Wasn't someone at the State Department allowed to point out that in matters nonmilitary, the U.S. isn't all that dominant -- that Russia and Turkey need the European market more than they need ours, that Europe gives more than twice as much foreign aid as we do and that in much of the world public opinion matters? Apparently not.
And to what end has Mr. Bush alienated all our most valuable allies? (And I mean all: Tony Blair may be with us, but British public opinion is now virulently anti-Bush.) The original reasons given for making Iraq an immediate priority have collapsed. No evidence has ever surfaced of the supposed link with Al Qaeda, or of an active nuclear program. And the administration's eagerness to believe that an Iraqi nuclear program does exist has led to a series of embarrassing debacles, capped by the case of the forged Niger papers, which supposedly supported that claim. At this point it is clear that deposing Saddam has become an obsession, detached from any real rationale.
What really has the insiders panicked, however, is the irresponsibility of Mr. Bush and his team, their almost childish unwillingness to face up to problems that they don't feel like dealing with right now.
I've talked in this column about the administration's eerie passivity in the face of a stalling economy and an exploding budget deficit: reality isn't allowed to intrude on the obsession with long-run tax cuts. That same "don't bother me, I'm busy" attitude is driving foreign policy experts, inside and outside the government, to despair.
Need I point out that North Korea, not Iraq, is the clear and present danger? Kim Jong Il's nuclear program isn't a rumor or a forgery; it's an incipient bomb assembly line. Yet the administration insists that it's a mere "regional" crisis, and refuses even to talk to Mr. Kim.
The Nelson Report, an influential foreign policy newsletter, says: "It would be difficult to exaggerate the growing mixture of anger, despair, disgust and fear actuating the foreign policy community in Washington as the attack on Iraq moves closer, and the North Korea crisis festers with no coherent U.S. policy. . . . We are at the point now where foreign policy generally, and Korea policy specifically, may become George Bush's 'Waco.' . . . This time, it's Kim Jong Il (and Saddam) playing David Koresh. . . . Sober minds wrestle with how to break into the mind of George Bush."
We all hope that the war with Iraq is a swift victory, with a minimum of civilian casualties. But more and more people now realize that even if all goes well at first, it will have been the wrong war, fought for the wrong reasons -- and there will be a heavy price to pay.
Alas, the epiphanies of the pundits have almost surely come too late. The odds are that by the time you read my next column, the war will already have started.

HEADLINE: Schwab Joins Others Ending Contributions To 401(k)'s 

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH with PATRICK McGEEHAN

 BODY:
The Charles Schwab Corporation, which is struggling through the worst slump in its history, yesterday became the latest company to tell employees that it would stop making matching contributions to their retirement plans.
 The decision follows extensive layoffs at Schwab and is a painful cost-cutting move for its chairman, Charles R. Schwab, who has been a champion of the 401(k) plan, a retirement instrument that has been replacing traditional pensions for more than a decade. 
 Other companies that have said they are reducing or halting such contributions include Goodyear Tire and Rubber, Great Northern Paper, Tech Data, the El Paso Corporation and the CMS Energy Company.
Employees are usually free to choose whether to enroll in 401(k) plans, and benefits specialists say that company matches are a significant factor in an employee's decision to participate. Until now, survey data suggests, the incentive has been strong enough to keep employees from dropping out of the retirement programs even as market returns have waned. 
As more companies eliminate their contributions, the rate at which Americans save for retirement -- already considered inadequate -- may drop even further.
"Eliminating a match has potentially disastrous effects, based on all the empirical evidence," said Alicia H. Munnell, director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College. "People are not good at saving. You have to have a long time horizon, and you really have to have something that induces you to do it. Employer matches are a very attractive incentive."
Matching contributions have been popular, helping to make 401(k) plans the second-most-prized company benefit, after health care, according to a survey by the Principal Financial Group, a provider of plan administrative services. But as the economy sputters, companies are reviewing retirement plans, health insurance and other benefits, trying to reduce costs without cutting jobs. However painful it may be to cut 401(k) matching contributions, it can still be easier than cutting other benefits, like traditional pensions, which are tightly regulated and cannot be reduced once they have been earned.
"That's one reason why these plans are popular with employers," said Ed Ferrigno, vice president of the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America. "They allow them to adjust their program in conjunction with the business cycle."
There are few statistics tracking the availability of company matching contributions; most surveys go to 2001 and then stop. But some consultants who help companies set up benefit programs say a number of them are reviewing whether to reduce contributions, link them to profitability or eliminate them.
"You see a trend toward saying, 'Here's a smaller match, and if we do better at the end of the year, there will be a larger match,' " said Robyn Credico, a senior consultant with Watson Wyatt who specializes in 401(k) plans and similar retirement programs.
Ms. Credico, who works mostly with large corporations, said that so far, many cutbacks had been confined to certain struggling industries.
"The place where you'll see the trend is primarily in the automotive industry," she said. "They either reduced the match or eliminated it completely."
Ford Motor and DaimlerChrysler, for example, suspended their 401(k) matches for 2002 as part of cost-cutting programs. The cuts applied only to salaried workers; hourly employees did not receive the match. A Ford spokeswoman, Anne Marie Gattari, said the company planned to reinstate its matching contributions when finances improved.
Ms. Credico said the companies that she worked with were also considering temporary suspensions.
"They're not saying to employees, 'This is forever,' " she said. 
One client, a technology company that Ms. Credico declined to identify, plans to base its decision on whether to cut its 401(k) contribution on its health care costs. The company's health insurance costs are rising so steeply, she said, that something else has to give. 
"Rather than making the employees pay a whole lot more for their health insurance, they're considering doing this," she said.
Goodyear, which is struggling financially, suspended its 401(k) match for 2003. In 2001, Goodyear contributed $37.8 million to employees' accounts, a Goodyear spokesman, Keith Price, said. The company has also eliminated its dividend and is asking employees to pay more of their health insurance costs. 
So far, the suspension affects only salaried employees, but Goodyear plans to extend it to hourly workers when their contract expires next month. Wayne Ranick, a spokesman for the United Steelworkers of America, said from the union's perspective, the 401(k) match was a "third tier" benefit and was less important than preserving traditional pension benefits and opposing the creation of private Social Security accounts.
To the extent broad statistics exist, the numbers suggest that reductions in 401(k) matching contributions began in 2000, the year the technology bubble broke. 
A survey by the Profit Sharing/401(k) Council of America, a group that represents employers, showed that in 1999, the average matching payment to a 401(k) account was 3.3 percent of participants' pay. The average fell to 2.5 percent in 2000 and stayed the same in 2001. The organization had no data for 2002.
At Schwab, the 401(k) plan has been generous. Until now, the brokerage firm offered participating employees $2 for every $1 they put into their accounts, up to $250 a year. After that, a Schwab spokesman said, the company matched each dollar contributed by employees with a dollar, up to 5 percent of their annual compensation.
Christopher V. Dodds, Schwab's chief financial officer, said that suspending the contribution would save a "reasonably significant" amount, though less than $15 million a quarter. 
The end of matching contributions follows other cost-cutting measures at Schwab. The company, based in San Francisco, has eliminated 9,000 jobs since the end of 2000, a reduction of 35 percent. 
Mr. Dodds said the company had to make some tough choices about how to reduce expenses because customers were making fewer stock trades. He said the company chose to cut the retirement benefit rather than make another round of layoffs.

HEADLINE: Private Talks, Public Silence 

BYLINE:  By JENNIFER STEINHAUER

 BODY:
When it comes to labor and contract disputes that affect the citizens of New York City, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's public position is almost always neutral, if not dismissive. From a bus driver strike in Queens to a protracted dispute between a cable channel and a cable company to the Broadway musicians' strike, Mr. Bloomberg repeatedly said that the city had no business getting involved. 
 But in each of those cases, the city did intervene, at roughly the same time that Mr. Bloomberg was suggesting it would not. City Hall's role was never insignificant: Indeed, it was essential to ending the musicians' strike and the cable dispute. 
 Mr. Bloomberg's penchant for understating his role is typical of this mayor, who believes that serious problems cannot be solved in public. His behind-the-scenes approach permeates almost every important matter of city government.
When it comes to labor disputes, unlike former mayors, Mr. Bloomberg is not fond of using his bully pulpit to pressure parties to come to agreement, and even less fond of taking sides. (A notable exception was the conflict between transit workers and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, in which he clearly favored the authority.) 
"There is a long tradition of mayors getting involved in private and public sector disputes," said Josh Freeman, a professor of labor history at Queens College. "But one thing that is striking about this mayor is how low key he is. He is not quick to castigate labor -- the transit strike was an exception -- and not that quick to grab a whole lot of credit, either." 
Mr. Bloomberg's first brush with a labor dispute came last summer, when bus drivers in Queens went on strike, demanding job security among other items from the city. Over and over, Mr. Bloomberg insisted that the matter was between drivers and the owners of the private bus lines, which the city subsidizes. 
"I am sorry to see the public suffering because of a private dispute," Mr. Bloomberg said at a news conference late last July. "But the law certainly allows a private union to strike a private company, and the private company to negotiate, and they will continue to do that, and the city will not get involved." 
But in early August, when the drivers and the companies settled their dispute, Mr. Bloomberg surprised reporters with the news that his labor commissioner, James F. Hanley, had long been involved in negotiations. "We've got a very good commissioner who doesn't try to negotiate through the newspapers," he said on that day. "He tried to be a facilitator from the very beginning."
The mayor took a similar approach when he was asked about what role he would play in a long running dispute between the YES Network and Cablevision, which infuriated local cable subscribers by preventing them from watching 130 Yankees games. In April, Mr. Bloomberg said "government has no part" in the battle. But on Wednesday the mayor announced at Gracie Mansion that a deal had been reached over eggs and bagels in his Upper East Side town house, through mediators he chose. 
When it came to the Broadway musicians' strike, Mr. Bloomberg sent mixed messages. On March 9, the mayor said that he was willing to provide a site for negotiations but stressed that the city's role would be limited.
But by then, Mr. Bloomberg and his deputies had already reached out to both parties, offering Gracie Mansion as neutral ground. The mayor's involvement did not end there. Mr. Bloomberg went to Gracie Mansion and impressed upon the musicians and theater owners that their dispute was hurting the city's economy. He even went back in the middle of the night after consoling the grieving families of two police officers killed on Staten Island. 
The degree to which the mayor likes to keep things under wraps depends somewhat on the dispute, aides said. For instance, in the Queens bus strike last summer, the drivers were insisting that the city come tothe table, and Mr. Bloomberg did not want to give any appearance of being susceptible to their financial demands.
Said one senior official: "When labor relations play out in the papers, people are more interested in positioning themselves than in trying to roll up their sleeves and get business done." 
Mr. Bloomberg's preferred method is to choose and insert impartial mediators into disputes, which so far has been remarkably successful in ending conflicts that seem to be intractable. It doesn't hurt that the mayor's Blackberry runneth over with big-name contacts in many industries, and that he has a town house and Gracie Mansion at his disposal.
But his role is always more of a facilitator than a bargainer, his aides insist. "What he does is get people together and put people in an environment where they can focus on their discussions," William T. Cunningham, the mayor's director of communications, said. 
The mayor's own history in cutting deals in business clearly informs his view of private and public disputes. "There is a time in every negotiation when progress is possible," Mr. Bloomberg said on Wednesday at the cable announcement. "And there is a time when you just go through the catharsis of figuring out where you are and where you stand and what your strengths and what your weaknesses are."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS; 
Another Day of Gains for the Dow; Nasdaq Falls Slightly

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Momentum from Wall Street's big rally spilled over to yesterday's session, lifting most stocks for a third consecutive day and helping the market snap a two-week losing streak. 
 But investors exhibited some caution, not surprising after Thursday's gains, which were the best the market had experienced in five months. While investors seemed more confident that a United States war with Iraq would be short and successful, they were wary of making further commitments ahead of the weekend. 
 Analysts were impressed that Wall Street added to its rally, a sign of strength rarely seen in a market beaten down by a tepid economic recovery and war jitters. But yesterday's gains were hard fought and the market had to fight off earlier declines. 
"Normally, you would expect some profit taking after a big run like yesterday," said John Caldwell, chief equity strategist for the McDonald Financial Group, part of KeyCorp. "But you have to be pretty encouraged that the market is holding up pretty well." 
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 37.96 points, or 0.5 percent, to close at 7,859.71, having surged 269.68 points Thursday in its biggest one-day advance since Oct. 15. In three sessions, the Dow has gained 335.79 points. 
The broader market was narrowly mixed. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 0.44 point, to 1,340.33, after Thursday's advance of 61.53 points, also its best one-day climb since Oct. 15. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index gained 1.37 points, or 0.2 percent, to 833.27, after gaining 27.71 points on Thursday, its second-best day of 2003. 
Moving higher since Wednesday, the market's gauges were able to break a two-week losing stretch. For the week, the Dow rose 1.5 percent, the Nasdaq climbed 2.7 percent and the S.& P. advanced 0.5 percent. 
Analysts attributed this week's advances to investor hopes that a war would be short and that the United States would win. But they are dubious of the market's ability to truly forge an upward path as long as there is uncertainty about Iraq. 
"We saw a huge run up, and the situation in the Middle East is still very cloudy," said Lynn Reaser, chief economist and senior market strategist at Banc of America Capital Management. "At this point, it is certainly premature to see any kind of sustained rally." 
Analysts said the market was unmoved by disappointing economic news, this time on inflation and business inventories. Investors are more preoccupied by war developments, as shown by the Thursday rally, which came despite weaker-than-expected retail sales for February. 
The Labor Department reported yesterday that inflation at the wholesale level, as measured by the Producer Price Index, jumped 1 percent in February, with energy prices surging by the largest amount since the buildup to the gulf war 12 years ago. Last month's increase followed a 1.6 percent rise in January, which had been the biggest one-month gain in 13 years. 
The Commerce Department said January business inventories grew for a ninth consecutive month, rising 0.2 percent, but the pace of inventory building slowed, indicating that companies are wary about restocking. 
Corning rose 19 cents, to $5.89, after UBS Warburg upgraded the company, which makes fiber optics, to buy. 
The software maker Adobe climbed $2.27, to $30.79, on fiscal first-quarter profits that topped analysts' expectations by 3 cents a share. 
The price of Treasury notes rose yesterday. The 10-year note was up 14/32 , to a price of 101 14/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, fell to 3.7 percent from 3.75 percent on Thursday.
The price of the 30-year Treasury bond jumped 23/32 , to 110 12/32 . The bond's yield declined to 4.71 percent from 4.75 percent on Thursday.

HEADLINE: INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; 
U.S. Brands Abroad Are Feeling Global Tension

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: PARIS, March 14 

 BODY:
If the United States does invade Iraq, some of the first casualties may be the cachet that American brands and products have enjoyed around the world and the globalized marketplace they helped to build. 
 In Muslim nations, franchised stores like McDonald's and KFC have already been attacked, threatening to brake a recent surge of investment in franchised businesses, many of them originating in the United States. 
 At the same time, a growing number of knockoff products have appeared in Europe, imitating popular American brands but appealing to anti-American sentiment in Europe's large Muslim population and among other Europeans opposed to American policy in Iraq. 
"From a business perspective," said Bilal Hallaq of Franchise Development Services, a British consulting firm, "it has catalyzed a move to more insular markets." 
There is no easy way to know whether the effects of anti-American sentiment on American businesses in Europe will be substantial. They may be masked somewhat by the general economic slowdown, which has already reduced investment. 
But Mr. Hallaq said that a wave of Middle Eastern investment in franchised businesses, as an alternative to putting money in sour stock markets, appears to have halted. An important meeting scheduled for April in Riyadh, where one Canadian and two American companies had planned to recruit Middle Eastern franchisees, has been called off, he said, and a similar meeting meant to bring together investors and franchise holders in Cairo next month has been put off until September. 
Arab-owned companies are postponing expansions into Western Europe. In recent months, Mr. Hallaq said, several Arab-owned chains, including one modeled on the Body Shop and another of Arabian-style coffee shops, shelved plans to open in markets like France, Britain and Germany.
Similarly, Muslim countries seeking to attract American investment have suffered setbacks. A recent effort by Morocco to attract American franchisers was canceled after no Americans came. 
But business links among Muslim regions, like those between Malaysia and the Persian Gulf, remain strong. 
"Anything with a foreign flavor, especially from the United States and the United Kingdom, is not on the agenda," Mr. Hallaq said. 
Some local companies that appeal specifically to Western Europe's 12 million Muslim consumers have continued to expand. In the Netherlands, for example, Chicken Cottage, a chain of fried chicken restaurants promising that all its poultry is prepared according to Muslim religious standards, is thriving in large cities like Amsterdam, though its success in the countryside is modest. 
Soft drinks challenging Coca-Cola and claiming solidarity with Muslim causes are multiplying. After a Coke knockoff called Mecca Cola was introduced in November, two similar drinks, Muslim Up and Arab Cola, were rolled out in France this month. Though meant to appeal to young Arabs and to support Muslim causes, the products also seem to be cashing in on general anti-American sentiment. 
Muslim Up's advertising promotes "an alternative for all who boycott Zionist products and big American brands." But Gerard Le Blanc, the Algerian-born French businessman who started Arab Cola, was quoted by the French daily Liberation as saying that "we are above all a beverage manufacturer; we are apolitical, and not at all ideological." 
These brands may stoke competition, but they usually remain narrow niche products, according to Jagdish N. Sheth, a marketing expert at the Goizueta Business School of Emory University in Atlanta. (The school is named for a former Coca-Cola chief executive.) In some situations, he said, they even present opportunities for the market leaders: two earlier Coke imitators, Thumbs Up in India and Inca Cola in Latin America, ultimately were bought by Coca-Cola and turned into successful regional brands. 
The problems that anti-American sentiment in Europe may be causing for American companies already operating in Europe and the Middle East are harder to gauge. The Starbucks franchisee for Switzerland and Austria, the Bon Appetit Group, sold its 21 stores back to the Starbucks Coffee Company in March, less than two years after opening them, prompting speculation in the Swiss media that concern that anti-American sentiment would harm sales played a role as well.
In the Middle East, McDonald's introduced a product this month -- the McArabia, a chicken sandwich on Arabian-style bread -- with a sales and promotion campaign that overshadowed the flagship Big Mac, an effort that one French newspaper said was meant to "relaunch McDonald's in the Muslim world." 
Both Starbucks and McDonald's denied that their moves had anything to do with geopolitical tensions. Indeed, Starbucks said that buying out Bon Appetit's interest in the stores reflected its determination to expand ambitiously in Europe; Bon Appetit's main businesses, institutional catering and food distribution, had been struggling lately and the company had no spare cash to finance additional Starbucks stores in its territory. 
"It's not at all connected to Iraq," said Karin Vogt, a Starbucks spokeswoman in Zurich. "We're online with our stores. It's not had an impact." 
McDonald's said the McArabia had been in the works for two years and was not a response to recent anti-American sentiment over Iraq. Rather, the company said, the new sandwich is part of a worldwide effort to adapt its menu more closely to local preferences. 
"There is no liaison between the McArabia and politics," said Rafiq Sakih, the owner of several McDonald's restaurants in Dubai, where the new sandwich has been a big hit. "It's a local taste finder, like the McFelafel in Egypt," he said in a telephone interview, referring to a dish McDonald's offered for a while but discontinued. 
Ricarda Ruecker, director of marketing and communication for McDonald's in the Middle East, said that after April 2002, when tensions between Israel and the Palestinians worsened sharply, "We, like every global brand, suffered definitely." But she said the company's local franchisees reacted with an advertising campaign. "We educated people; we have a 100 percent local ownership model, 80 percent local suppliers; we do a lot of charity," Ms. Ruecker said by phone from Dubai. "Now people understand more." 
Even so, in recent weeks two McDonald's restaurants in Saudi Arabia, at Kharj and Dammam, were the targets of unsuccessful firebomb attacks. 
The growing drive to tailor products and advertising to varying national tastes and cultures is gradually eroding the progress of globalization, Mr. Sheth of Emory said, by breaking up world brands into a network of localized versions. "It is a question of saying, 'When in Rome, be Roman,' " he said. In the process, experts said, the magnetism of American flair as a promotional tool is waning. 
When Crestcom International, a provider of management teaching tools based in Greenwood Village, Colo., began seeking franchise partners abroad several years ago, one attraction was the glowing reputation of American management methods. Now, the American angle risks becoming a liability.
In its video recordings of management gurus giving lectures, "anything specifically American is taken out," said John Harris, Crestcom's marketing manager, who recently attended franchising fairs in Milan, Athens and Paris. When promoting its products abroad, he said, Crestcom positions itself not as an American but as an international company. 
As far as Iraq goes, he said, "I'm speaking to businesspeople talking business -- I am not running into that." 
But Mr. Hallaq, the British franchising consultant, said that American companies, brands and ideas may get a much chillier reception if bullets fly in the gulf. "Everything was starting to open up," he said. "If we go to war, it will be a setback."

HEADLINE: City Seeks Land Upstate Where It Can Put Garbage 

BYLINE:  By KIRK JOHNSON 

 BODY:
Wanted: A little hideaway somewhere in the wilds of upstate New York. Must be quiet, preferably rural -- oh, and one more thing -- willing to accept thousands of tons of New York City garbage every day.
 "We want a landfill," the city's sanitation commissioner, John J. Doherty, said yesterday at a breakfast speech in Manhattan. "The city definitely needs its own landfill." 
 Mr. Doherty is not the first official to dream of a dump the city can call its own. Ever since New York's last landfill, at Fresh Kills on Staten Island, began closing down in the late 1990's, sanitation engineers have worried that the city was becoming vulnerable. Landfill owners and legislators in Pennsylvania and Virginia, where most of the waste was going, might suddenly cut New York off, the doomsayers warned, leaving it buried in its own rubbish. Eventually, they said, the city would need to take control of its garbage destiny.
But then the pressure seemed to fade. New out-of-state landfills opened, keeping disposal fees down.
At the same time, as the regional economy boomed, many upstate residents found little appeal in the idea of taking trash from the big city.
A lot of that has changed, Mr. Doherty told an audience of civic leaders, businesspeople and sanitation buffs at New York Law School. Landfill fees have recently begun going up, he said, and even worse problems -- outright restriction on interstate garbage shipments, for instance -- are perhaps not far in the future. Meanwhile, he added, the job of selling an upstate community on the idea of a partnership with the city has probably gotten easier because of the recession.
"In today's economy, landfills are a pocketbook issue," he said.
Mr. Doherty said later in an interview that Sanitation Department officials would be going out soon to start their search, though no timetable had been set.
A spokesman for the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation, Dan Gilbert, said that if the city proceeds with its plan, a formal application will be required that will include an environmental impact review.
Waste experts say that more than economics are behind the city's new push to have its own landfill. The department is devising a long-term disposal plan, a barge-transport system in which trash would be packed into sealed cargo containers at transfer stations in all five boroughs. This system would lend itself to an upstate solution, they say, far more than any system the city has ever had.
Under the new system of transfer stations, which is supposed to be completed by 2008, garbage, like most goods that are transported these days, would leave the city in sealed containers that could be put on trains, barges or trucks, allowing shipment at what city officials hope will be greatly reduced costs.
But perhaps most important, they say, a system of containers would allow negotiators to head off some of the objections that arose the last time the idea of an upstate landfill plan was raised, in the 1990's. Many of the communities approached then were worried less about the garbage than about the swarms of smoke-belching trucks that would clog their highways and change the nature of their towns.
"I think the pieces really fit together," said Benjamin Miller, a former Sanitation Department official who has written widely about the city's waste stream. "Getting the stuff in containers makes it possible to put it on barges or trains, and that makes the transportation cost less and environmental impact less."
Mr. Doherty said in his speech that rail connections would be the first requirement for a candidate community. Sites that would require delivery by truck would not even be considered, partly because trucks would be disruptive and harder for residents to accept, but also because they would have no appeal for the city because of the higher costs.

HEADLINE: New 'Living Wage' Ordinance Creates Divisions in Santa Fe 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M., March 14 

 BODY:
For more than two decades, Lynda Feman has watched residents struggle to make ends meet while money rolled into this picturesque city, which caters to the tastes of well-heeled tourists.
 "Santa Fe is impossible," Ms. Feman, an artist peddling her ceramics on Santa Fe Plaza, said. "I've lived here for 25 years, and I'm maxed out. It needs to change." 
 The frustration has led to a fight pitting some of Santa Fe's biggest employers against its poorest residents over the nation's most sweeping "living wage" ordinance.
Approved by the City Council last month, the ordinance will raise hourly pay for thousands of workers to at least $8.50 next January, more than $3 above the federal minimum of $5.15. The city's minimum is supposed to reach $10.50 by 2008.
The Council's action makes Santa Fe the only municipality in the country to extend a minimum wage to all businesses with at least 25 employees. Hotels and shops will be affected, as will fast-food restaurants and discount stores.
Many cities have living-wage laws, but they apply only to municipal workers or employees of businesses that contract with a city or county.
Santa Fe, a high-desert city of 62,000 people, sits at the foot of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. At the heart of town is the bustling plaza, where Indians and others sell turquoise jewelry and pottery. Nearby are several old churches, galleries and museums. The city is also New Mexico's capital.
Nearly a quarter of the city's 26,000 nongovernment workers now make less than $10.50 an hour, and supporters of the ordinance insist that a higher minimum wage is desperately needed to help a work force stuck in low-paying tourism-related jobs.
"People who live in Santa Fe these days work two or three jobs to make ends meet," said Frank Montano, a former city councilman who has pushed for the wage increase.
Santa Fe business owners, however, have filed a lawsuit saying that the living-wage ordinance violates state law and the city code.
Joe Hoback, owner of the Pink Adobe restaurant, contended that the ordinance would result in higher prices and cutbacks in employee benefits.
"I'm going to have to spread the pain around," Mr. Hoback said. "The majority of my staff is very much against this because they want to have a choice on how they are going to receive their compensation."
Michael Chaplin, owner of a construction business, argued that city leaders had no right to tell him what to pay his workers.
Other business leaders predicted job losses, and some said they expected companies to close or move, especially in an already tight economy.
"We're going to have to consider all the possibilities to maintain a competitive advantage," said Jim Weyhrauch, chief executive of Nambe Mills, which sells handmade metal bowls and candleholders.
Last year, New Orleans and Santa Monica, Calif., enacted living-wage ordinances nearly identical to Santa Fe's, but both were overturned, New Orleans's by Louisiana's Supreme Court and Santa Monica's by a narrow margin of voters.
In Santa Fe, "the fact that it passed reinforces this continued movement to raise wages when Congress does nothing," said Jen Kern of the Association of Community Organizations for Reform Now, which has promoted many living-wage campaigns, starting with the first one, in Baltimore, in 1994.

HEADLINE: Mexican Consulate in Los Angeles Exudes Power and Energy 

BYLINE:  By SAM DILLON 

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, March 14 

 BODY:
It was 7:30 a.m., and 1,000 Mexicans, many of them recent immigrants, jammed the gritty sidewalks outside the Mexican Consulate here recently, waiting for everything from medical examinations for the sick to legal help for the imprisoned.
 Consul General Martha I. Lara Alatorre, who with a bulldog's persistence has become an influential advocate for millions of Mexican-born workers in Los Angeles, was backslapping her way through the crowd. 
 "How're we doing, paisano?" Ms. Lara greeted a man who was waiting for consular help in shipping the body of his wife, dead of cancer, back to Mexico. She bear-hugged a young hotel maid, an illegal immigrant who hoped to apply for an identification card issued by the consulate that would allow her to open an American bank account. 
"I have more constituents than the mayor of Los Angeles," Ms. Lara, a former senator for the State of Chihuahua, said, only half in jest.
She and her 70-member staff offer services to 4.7 million Mexicans in the sprawl of greater Los Angeles, while the population of Mayor James K. Hahn's core city is 3.6 million.
Ms. Lara's consulate is one of the busiest diplomatic missions in the world, serving a city that includes the largest concentration of Mexicans outside Mexico City. Its range of services often makes Ms. Lara seem more like a governor than a diplomat. She inaugurates immigrant-owned businesses, certifies births, marries lovers and crowns beauty queens. 
Her work opens a window on the extraordinary growth and evolution of the Latino population in the United States as it moves into the political and economic mainstream after decades in the shadows. 
Most of the Mexicans who visit the consulate are janitors, garbage collectors and other menial workers who keep Southern California humming. But Ms. Lara also entertains a stream of visiting Mexican politicians, and she attends to Mexican-born glitterati like the boxer Oscar De La Hoya and the actress Salma Hayek, whom the ambassador recently whisked into the consulate through a basement entrance, out of the glare of the Hollywood paparazzi, to process a passport. 
In an interview, Ms. Lara said her greatest achievement was to persuade Wells Fargo, the bank based in San Francisco, to accept consular ID as proof of identity for opening an account at its thousands of branches in 23 states. Since Wells Fargo took that decision, in November 2001, at least 70,000 Mexicans have opened accounts, said Miriam Galicia Duarte, a spokeswoman for the bank. 
Dozens of other banks, including Citibank and JPMorgan Chase, have also agreed to honor the ID, as have many American cities and counties. Ms. Lara's consulate issued 160,000 ID's last year, and other consulates issued thousands more.
Immigration experts said the widespread acceptance of the ID was a watershed in the lives of millions of Mexicans who work in the United States without valid immigration documents and previously lacked any legal identification. The card allows them not only to obtain banking services, but also to participate more fully in American life in ways like reporting crimes, traveling on planes and renting videos. 
But groups seeking to curb illegal immigration are outraged.
"This is an attempt by the Mexican government to bring about a de facto amnesty for illegal aliens," said Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, a group in Washington that seeks tighter enforcement of immigration laws. "These Mexican officials are meeting with mayors, police chiefs and newspaper editors to make the case that this Mexican card should be accepted as legitimate within the United States. Why are we permitting it?"
In the 1990's, some politicians blamed illegal immigrants for many of California's economic woes, and Mexican diplomats often drew criticism if they spoke up for immigrants. Last week in San Diego, there was a new dispute after law enforcement authorities used a spike belt to stop a pickup speeding along an Interstate. The truck crashed, killing two people and injuring 20, most of them illegal immigrants. Rodulfo Figueroa Aramoni, the Mexican consul general in San Diego, criticized the authorities for "gross negligence." The California Highway Patrol and the Border Patrol faulted smugglers suspected of jamming the truck with illegal immigrants. 
"Mexican diplomats are very much on the front line," said Wayne Cornelius, the Gildred professor of political science and international relations at the University of California at San Diego. "Anything they do to defend their constituents can offend people who believe undocumented immigrants shouldn't be coddled."
In contrast, Ms. Lara's relations with the powers that be here are cordial, a measure, perhaps, of the increasing power that Hispanic voters enjoy. In November 2001, she accompanied Mayor Hahn and several City Council members to Mexico City to meet President Vicente Fox. In June, the 15-member Council unanimously approved an ordinance recognizing Mexico's consular ID for use in transactions with city agencies, including the Police Department.
"This was good for economic development, human dignity and public safety," said Eric M. Garcetti, the council member who proposed the bill. "If you have thousands of people out there with no ID, they are not trackable. So it improves security to bring them out of the shadows."
Processing applications for some 500 cards each day is a small part of the consulate's work. On Thursday, one of Ms. Lara's aides was at the county jail, visiting some of the estimated 4,500 Mexican inmates there. Another diplomat worked the telephones, seeking to persuade American officials to permit the mother of an 11-month-old with leukemia at a hospital in Los Angeles to cross from her home in Mexicali, Mexico, to visit the infant.
On the top floor of the consulate, Ms. Lara met Health Department officials to discuss a new clinic at the consulate that will offer free tests for diabetes and other diseases. Minutes later, she sat down with 12 aging men in cowboy hats who said they had been cheated of Social Security payments after working as braceros, or field hands, in the United States during and after World War II.
Later she traveled to a hospital to process an official document for a Mexican man with meningitis. Back at her office, Ms. Lara worked out details with Los Angeles school officials to be a co-sponsor of classes in Mexican art at the consulate. She denied being tired.
"Representing Mexico in Los Angeles," she said, "fills me with adrenaline."

HEADLINE: Oil Prices Decline For a Second Day In Jittery Trading 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER 

 BODY:
Oil prices continued to fall yesterday, bringing the two-day decline to 6.5 percent. Still, at the end of the day prices were rebounding from even steeper losses, reflecting persistent concerns about the effect of a possible war with Iraq.
 In New York, crude oil for April delivery fell 63 cents, or 1.75 percent, to $35.38 a barrel, after being down by as much as $2.16 earlier in the session. 
 The downward pressure on the price of crude oil started with a report that Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil producer, had lined up enough tankers to transport nearly 30 million barrels of oil to the United States this spring.
The arrival of that much oil would help rebuild American inventories, which have fallen to the lowest levels in almost three decades. On Wednesday, the price of oil jumped to $37.83 a barrel -- its highest level since the fall of 1990 -- after a report from the government that crude oil inventories had fallen to 269.8 million barrels in the week ended March 7. That total represented a 1.4 percent decline from inventories the week before, and a 16 percent decrease compared with a year ago.
Traders said comments from Spencer Abraham, the secretary of energy, also helped send crude oil prices lower. Mr. Abraham said that the United States would release oil from its Strategic Petroleum Reserve if it deemed that move necessary.
Mr. Abraham, according to Reuters, said in Hungary that the United States would, of course, consult with the International Energy Agency before deciding to open up the United States reserve. "But," he added, "certainly the U.S. always reserves the right to make its own ultimate decision of what it's going to do with our reserves." The international agency is the coordinator for emergency oil supplies that could be used in the case of a major supply disruption.
The higher price of oil is a serious concern for the Bush administration because it acts as a tax on the American consumer and is already slowing spending. The price of crude oil has jumped 40.5 percent in the last four months while gasoline prices have increased 25.9 percent over the last three months, forcing many economists to reduce their economic growth forecasts for the year.
Oil prices fell $1.82, or 4.8 percent, on Thursday. The price on Wednesday of $37.83 a barrel was approaching the $40.42 a barrel that was reached in October 1990, during the run-up to the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
Rick Smid, an energy trader at Fimat USA Inc., said that the fact that President Bush planned to meet with the prime ministers of Britain and Spain in the Azores over the weekend had put off the start of a war with Iraq and that was an excuse to push the price lower.
"If, in the real short term, it appears that war is not imminent, it is an opportunity for some traders to move this market lower," he said. "If war is not imminent, there is no need to own product at this high price."
But Mr. Smid said "the risk is still on the upside" because many traders fear that a war with Iraq could curtail the supply of oil at least temporarily.

HEADLINE: As Revenues Plummet, a Charity Lays Off 20 Workers 

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE STROM 

 BODY:
City Harvest, one of New York City's best-known charities, laid off 20 of its 100 permanent staff mambers yesterday as it struggled to cope with a severe decline in fund-raising and contract revenues.
 The charity, which supplies soup kitchens and food pantries, has cut delivery routes, reduced deliveries and scaled back its plans for next year in its effort to offset a $2.4 million budget shortfall at the same time that demand for its services and those of emergency food providers around the city are skyrocketing. 
 In part because of the cutbacks, City Harvest will be able to handle only 16 million pounds of food next year, compared with 19.5 million pounds this year, said Julia Erickson, the organization's executive director.
"This is not just a tragedy for City Harvest," she added. "This is a tragedy for New York City." 
City Harvest's woes are emblematic of the problems confronting most nonprofit organizations these days, and particularly those in the city, where the economy is weaker than it is elsewhere in the country.
The combination of a weak stock market, rising unemployment and consumer debt, stagnant incomes and higher costs have produced one of the weakest fund-raising environments in recent memory.
This week, the Rand Corporation reported that cash contributions to institutes of higher education had fallen for the first time in 15 years. In addition, the endowments of 9 of the nation's 10 largest foundations fell last year.
"Very bad things are happening," said Fran Barrett, executive director of the Community Resource Exchange, an agency that assists nonprofit groups citywide. "We're in the dark, and we're about to enter into a room with fluorescent lights, and what we're going to see there is going to be ugly."
Given all the bad economic news, many charities were surprised last year when revenues held steady. Some organizations, including City Harvest, even saw their income rise. "Somehow, everybody thought that after 9/11 was over, people would be in a mood to give because they had gotten such a good feeling from giving then," Ms. Erickson said.
Jon Small, executive director of the Nonprofit Coordinating Committee, which represents some 200 charities in the city, said he expected there would soon be a flood of ailing organizations.
"Our take is that nonprofits are in the process of discovering how bad things are going to be," he said, noting that many organizations did not yet know how much city and state financing would fall. "The coming months are going to be awful because of this vise of increased need and reduced funding." 
City Harvest's budget for the fiscal year that will end on June 30 was $11.2 million. But its direct mail campaign, which it increased after the World Trade Center and Pentagon attacks, has produced 27 percent less than anticipated, and Ms. Erickson said she expected a further decline of as much as 12 percent in the next year.
Corporate giving fell 35 percent, and the organization's special events have generated 19 percent less than they did in the last fiscal year.
The organization is also losing its contract to run the city's hunger hot line because the Human Resources Administration decided to automate that service. That will eliminate $288,000 from City Harvest's budget next year and has already caused the layoff of four permanent and two temporary staff members, in addition to the layoffs announced yesterday.
Ms. Erickson said that City Harvest's board had authorized the use of $1.4 million from a $2.8 million reserve the organization maintains, and that it was implementing Street Fleet, a program in which volunteers pick up leftover food from restaurants and caterers and deliver it on foot.
Meanwhile, emergency food providers are reporting soaring demand. Last year, the Community Food Resource Center's Community Kitchen in Harlem was serving 550 meals a night, said Hiram Bonner, its programs director. This year, it is serving more than 750.
At the same time, food is becoming less abundant, Ms. Erickson said. "The food chain is breaking down. People are eating out less, there are fewer events and people can't afford to buy as much food, so we're getting less leftovers. Distributors are not supplying their customers with as much, and manufacturers are not making as much."
Lucy Cabrera, president of the Food Bank for New York City, said that food contributions from companies like Kraft and Perdue had fallen by 5 to 10 percent over the last two years. The Food Bank's surveys show that one in five food pantries and one in six soup kitchens in the city have had to turn people away since 2001.
"The increases in the needs of the community have far surpassed what we had imagined," Dr. Cabrera said.
Nancy Mahon, executive director of God's Love We Deliver, which takes hot meals to people with AIDS and other illnesses, said that revenue had fallen 3 percent this year. The organization has cut its head count 25 percent through attrition and cut deliveries to five a week instead of twice a day, allowing it to eliminate six trucks.
But it is serving 1,450 people a month from 1,050 a month last year.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 18, 2003

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Saturday about layoffs at the charity City Harvest misstated the number of employees affected and the previous size of the staff. The layoffs numbered 22, not 20; the total had been 108, not 100.

HEADLINE: Energy Drives Up a Price Index, But Other Sectors, Like Cars, Fall 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
Wholesale prices rose in February for a second consecutive month, led by the greatest surge in energy costs since the buildup to the Persian Gulf war in 1990, a Labor Department report said today. Prices excluding energy and food unexpectedly fell for the third month in four.
 The Producer Price Index, a gauge of prices paid to factories, farmers and other producers, rose 1 percent last month after gaining 1.6 percent in January. The so-called core index, which excludes food and energy, fell 0.5 percent as automobile, computer and apparel prices plunged. 
 Higher energy prices may hurt the economy by cutting into corporate profits and reducing the amount consumers have to spend. With weak demand holding down other prices, companies have little choice but to absorb the increase in energy costs.
In another report, consumer confidence fell this month to the lowest level in more than a decade as heightened concern about a war and soaring energy bills threaten to slow spending and economic growth. 
"The overhang of the war is clearly a damper on the economy," the Treasury secretary, John W. Snow, said after a speech in Columbus, Ohio. "When people are nervous they don't spend as much."
The University of Michigan's index of sentiment fell to 75, its lowest level since October 1992 -- a time when the economy had trouble creating jobs -- from 79.9 in February. Confidence has dropped each month this year and consumer demand is easing, prompting manufacturers like Ford Motor to cut production. 
Business profits "are being squeezed as input costs rise but finished goods' prices remain soft," said Stephen Stanley, an economist at RBS Greenwich Capital in Connecticut, who forecast a 0.7 percent drop in core prices. "A quick resolution to the Iraq situation, hopefully accompanied by a sizable drop in energy prices, is a must for the health" of corporations, he said.
The consensus among economists was for a 0.6 percent increase in the Producer Price Index and a 0.1 percent rise excluding food and energy, based on the median of 64 forecasts in a Bloomberg News survey. 
Energy prices jumped 7.4 percent in February, the largest increase since October 1990, after rising 4.8 percent in January. Home heating oil prices rose 25.2 percent, the greatest gain since February 2000. The price of gasoline increased 18.8 percent, after a 13.7 percent increase the month before.
Aside from energy, prices have been relatively tame. Wholesale auto prices fell 0.6 percent, as carmakers offered rebates amid a second consecutive decline in monthly sales. Light truck prices fell 3.9 percent, the most since February 1982.

HEADLINE: Germans Revisit War's Agony, Ending a Taboo 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD BERNSTEIN 

DATELINE: DRESDEN, Germany, March 10 

 BODY:
The photograph, a precious possession, shows gracious, dignified Holbein Street in Dresden before World War II, where the childhood friends Nora Lang, now 72, and Vanila John, 71, lived in apartments across from each other.
 "It's nice that Dresden is being restored," Ms. John said, speaking of the many monuments in this once ruined city that are still being rebuilt, stone by stone. "But the old Dresden is gone forever -- the houses, the homes and also the people whom I knew, who are gone, too." 
 Ms.John, who witnessed the nighttime firebombing of Dresden by the Royal Air Force on Feb. 13, 1945 -- an attack that killed about 35,000 people and destroyed one of the most beautiful cities in Europe -- was doing what many Germans have been doing lately: talking about their own suffering in World War II. 
For the last few months in fact, television has been showing endless documentaries and discussions of the air war waged by Britain and the United States against Germany in World War II. While this is not exactly a new subject in Germany, there are at least two ways in which the discussion is different from the past.
First, the emphasis in today's articles and discussions is on what Jorg Friedrich, author of a best-selling book on the Allied bombing campaign, calls "Leideform," the form of suffering inflicted on the German civilian population.
In other words, a taboo, by which Germans have remained guiltily silent, at least in public, about their experience of the horrors of war, has been suddenly and rather mysteriously broken. 
Second, the new awareness of the Allied bombings and the devastation they wrought has become an important element in German opposition to the expected American war on Iraq. What people like Ms. Lang and Ms. John, both antiwar activists in Dresden, have been saying is something like this: We have direct knowledge of the gruesome effects of war and we don't want anybody else to experience what we have experienced.
In Germany, where all consideration of World War II bears a special weight, this new national attention to German suffering has generated plenty of commentary of its own. Much of it focuses on the wildly successful book by Mr. Friedrich, which is titled "Der Brand," or "The Fire," a work that describes in stark, unrelenting and very literary detail what happened in city after city as the Allies dropped 80 million incendiary bombs on Germany.
"Der Brand" is about mass deaths by fire and suffocation, the fearsome technology of incendiary bombing and the obliteration of architectural and cultural monuments. But it describes as well the effects on the spirit, what Mr. Friedrich in a recent interview in Berlin called "the slow destruction of psychic endurance, the living day and night in fear of death."
It is not that Mr. Friedrich is the first to write on this. There have long been books and photographic collections on many of the cities destroyed in the bombing, including an authoritative one on Dresden by Gotz Bergander, a 76-year-old survivor of the firebombing. Five years ago, the novelist W. G. Sebald, who has since died, aroused considerable emotion here with a book, "On the Natural History of Destruction," whose main point was that German wartime suffering had been strangely absent from postwar German literature.
But the reaction to Mr. Friedrich's book is something special, more visceral and widespread, and it brings questions to mind: Is there a danger that the Germans will conflate their suffering with the vastly greater and more unforgivable suffering they inflicted on millions of others, including both the genocidal slaughter of the Jews and the bombing raids on London, Coventry, Warsaw and Rotterdam?
Have the Germans attached themselves to Mr. Friedrich's book and, similarly, have they used Mr. Friedrich's book to fuel their rejection of war with Iraq -- because it gives them a rare and intoxicating taste of the moral high ground?
One element in the picture is Mr. Friedrich himself, a respected writer and commentator who bears not the slightest resemblance to some ultraright, neonationalist eager to exonerate Germans of responsibility for the war. His earlier work includes a study of German war crimes in in the conquered territory of the East. Germany, he said in the interview, "lived in submission" to Hitler's "genocide, slavery and aggression."
With the splash made by Mr. Friedrich's book, some here have begun talking about Allied war crimes against Germany. But the author makes no explicit claims to that effect.
"My book is pure description," he said. "There's nothing about war crimes. I am a historian, not a judge."
But there is also an edginess to Mr. Friedrich's writing and commentary, an emotional power, a sense that what a critic in the newspaper Die Zeit called "the emotionalized channeling of his narrative" carries with it an accusation of tremendous wrongdoing by the Allies. In person, Mr. Friedrich clearly believes that much of the air war was unnecessary and atrocious.
Moreover, in what has stirred perhaps the greatest amount of criticism, here and there in his book Mr. Friedrich uses language that until now has been reserved to describing the Holocaust. He refers to the deaths in bomb cellars caused by the carbon monoxide produced by the fires raging above as "death by gassing."
He also uses the word "crematoria" to describe the fires' incinerating effect.
Where he describes attacks on cities that had, in his view, no military significance, he calls the havoc and deaths that resulted "massacres."
"I use the word 'massacre' in the case of Swinemunde, which was attacked on March 12, 1945 by the American Eighth Air Force," he said. "It was packed with refugees driven West by the Red Army."
"If the Americans are allowed to talk of massacre in My Lai," Mr. Friedrich said, referring to the Vietnam war atrocity committed by American troops, "why can't I describe 23,000 dead in Swinemunde as a massacre?"
Swinemunde, which was a German naval base, passed to Poland at the end of the war.
In the interview, Mr. Friedrich pointed to two photographs in a book that documents the destruction of the industrial city of Kassel. One of the photographs shows a tangle of burned and twisted bodies, including those of children, women and old people, filling up an entire square. 
"You cannot look at pictures like that without being reminded that there's only one other situation where you have seen such scenes," he said. While he did not say so, the other situation is, of course, the death and concentration camps where Nazi victims were slain.
"Between genocide and fire warfare there is no similarity," Mr. Friedrich said, "but the similarity is drawn by mentality and consciousness."
Many in Germany and elsewhere, of course, will disagree even with a similarity drawn by mentality and consciousness. Mr. Bergander, interviewed in his home in Berlin, took exception to Mr. Friedrich's use of words like "death by gassing," which, Mr. Bergander argues, "is not a word you can use as a German."
Mr. Bergander also believes that some of the bombing war was criminal, including the bombing of Dresden, his hometown, but he is nonetheless troubled by the possibility that Germans will be swept into a mood of victimization.
"So many people feel that if Mr. Friedrich, who is a man of the left and who works for good relations with Israel, can say, 'We Germans are victims too,' that then they can say it also, and they can say it more loudly and more freely."
Then there is the whole debate about the bombing itself, and whether it was militarily necessary. Richard Overy, a historian at King's College, London, who has written several well-regarded books on the war, argues against the notion that what was called "area bombing," the destruction of whole cities, had no military purpose.
"The bombing of Germany was carried out under a clear military strategy, which was to degrade the military and economic infrastructure and reduce the war willingness of the population to the point where the allies could enter Germany with a real prospect of victory," Mr. Overy said in a telephone interview.
That is not the view in Dresden, at least not in Ms. Lang's modest living room, which overlooks the square where old Dresden once stood. Near the apartment is the blackened Tinitatis Church with its permanent exhibition of signs saying "No to war with Iraq," and for Ms. Lang there is a clear connection between that sentiment and the collective memories stimulated by "Der Brand."
"We had to suffer from Hitler and then from that bombing," Ms. Lang said. "I was 8 when the war started and 14 in 1945, so my childhood was all war. And I have to ask myself the question, What I have done? The answer is nothing. That's why I think I have to do something to prevent another war."

HEADLINE: Uncertain Economy Hinders Highly Precise Supply System 

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
In an economy subdued by the threat of war, is just-in-time becoming just too difficult?
 During the boom of the 1990's, whole industries embraced just-in-time supply chains and lean manufacturing techniques to make their output more sensitive to customers' needs. Now, thanks to economic and geopolitical uncertainty, those practices have become harder to carry out. 
 Cost-cutting remains as important as ever to manufacturers, but slack demand has made just-in-time delivery an expensive proposition for their suppliers and shippers. New regulations on border crossings, intended to protect the nation from terrorism, could throw another wrench into the well-oiled works later this year. 
"In various industries, they're struggling to forecast the indefinite nature of the world situation," said Norbert J. Ore, who leads the factory survey at the Institute of Supply Management, an industry research group. "Are we going to war or are we not going to war? What's happening to energy prices and transportation costs? Those things have made forecasting very difficult, and just-in-time really operates on a good forecast."
The Chrysler group of DaimlerChrysler unloads about 8,000 truckloads of materials at its plants each day, including 1,500 that travel across the border between Detroit and Windsor, Ontario. Sourcing needs that used to stay constant for up to a year have been changing along with economic forecasts and predictions for impending war, and the company has constantly had to juggle the links of its supply chain.
"In the last 12 months, we've redesigned probably four or five times our whole collection system," said Edward T. Sprock, director of logistics for Chrysler.
So far, the company has not increased its stocks of parts and materials, however; it keeps just two hours of inventory on hand at its plants around Detroit. Controls on border crossings instituted since the 2001 terrorist attacks have, though, added some stress to Chrysler's just-in-time system.
"Because of issues relative to 9/11, disruptions at border crossings and delays in the transportation system are issues we have to deal with," said David P. Hodgson, vice president for worldwide supply at Chrysler. "But we aren't going to change the philosophy." In terms of cutting costs, he added, "the pressure is the same."
That statement holds true at smaller manufacturers, too.
"Whether you're in an up economy or a down economy, that's still what you have to survive on -- what your costs are, relative to people that you're trying to compete with," said Gus Zeller, president of Powell Electrical Manufacturing, a subsidiary of Powell Industries in Houston. His company recently expanded its just-in-time practices to cover every part of its business, from quoting rates for customers to developing engineering specifications and shipping products like circuit-breakers and other power-distribution equipment.
Cutting inventories saves cash immediately. It also reduces the chance that goods will become obsolete as they sit on factory shelves. That is exactly what happened to some clients of Davis Tool Inc. of Hillsboro, Ore., a maker of customized parts for aerospace and other high technology industries, when the economy suddenly turned sour in 2001.
"We built it and had it, they had to pay for it, and unfortunately many of them have warehouses full of the stuff that they can't use today," said Barry C. Houk, Davis Tool's chief financial officer. 
When the economy appeared ready to recover in the middle of last year, a similar series of events unfolded across the nation. "People got to a decision point: 'Do I expand and make sure I'm ready, or do I hold back?' " Mr. Ore said. "Last year, the answer was, 'I'm going to go ahead and expand and be ready.' A lot of people got burned with that. This year the answer's going to be just the opposite."
Economic data released yesterday underlined the lackluster mood in the manufacturing sector. The Federal Reserve reported that manufacturers used just 73.4 percent of capacity in February, only a shade above the 20-year lows of late 2001. Over all, industry operated at 75.6 percent of capacity last month. Manufacturing activity, which accounts for the vast majority of industrial production, dropped 0.1 percent in February.
Also yesterday, the Commerce Department announced that business inventories in manufacturing, which include goods sold to consumers, remained at about $431 billion in January, less than 1 percent higher than their six-year lows of last summer. All the figures were adjusted for seasonal changes.
As chastened manufacturers have squeezed their inventories using just-in-time methods, suppliers like Davis Tool have come under increasing pressure. Orders have been shrinking, but customers still want the parts as soon as they need them, and not before. With fewer economies of scale, costs at Davis have been rising.
Clients are "not ordering 10 or 15 percent over like they used to, they're ordering 1 or 2 over, and just getting what they need to build the product they have to sell," Mr. Houk said. "They'd like to have them at the same price, but unfortunately if you're a machine shop and a large component of your pricing is setup, you can't hold that price."
The same pattern is holding on the shipping side of just-in-time practices.
"The cost per unit goes up when the demand drops," said John H. Williford, president and chief executive of Menlo Worldwide, a subsidiary of CNF that handles logistics for companies including General Motors. "You change pickup routes and, in some cases, modes. You reoptimize to make that increase as small as possible."
As more suppliers face the same tension, wholesale prices are bound to rise. Prices of intermediate goods -- the kind manufacturers turn into final products -- rose 1.3 percent in January and 2.1 percent in February, the Labor Department reported yesterday. Excluding food and energy, prices for intermediate goods rose 0.7 percent in February -- the biggest jump since April 1995.
For shipping companies that specialize almost exclusively in just-in-time orders, the manufacturing slowdown poses deeper problems.
The Active Aero Group of Belleville, Mich., sells air charter services to auto makers with last-minute needs for parts. "Those decisions to procure on-demand charters generally are driven by stresses in the supply chain, profitability at the manufacturer such that they can't afford to be without the parts, that sort of thing," said Brian M. Hermelin, Active Aero's president. Unfortunately for him, he said, "supply chains aren't stretched right now."
New regulations requiring shippers to notify border officials in advance of freight entering the United States by air, rail and truck -- the main channels for just-in-time supply chains -- could further unsettle the system. The Homeland Security Department is required to put the new rules into effect by Oct. 1. Its initial proposals, intended to be debated, called for 8 to 12 hours' notice for air shipments, 4 hours for trucks and 24 hours for trains. An advisory committee was set to submit a counterproposal yesterday.
William E. Primosch, director of international business policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, a lobbying group, said that the sensitivity of logistics today cannot be overstated. "Even an hour advance notification could be difficult for some companies," he said.

HEADLINE: Subway Token, Currency of the City, Dies at 50 

BYLINE:  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA 

 BODY:
The New York City subway token, tool and talisman of city life since Vincent R. Impellitteri was mayor, is dead at age 50, transit officials said yesterday.
 The causes of death were technology and economics. 
 Tokens will be sold for the last time on Saturday, April 12, said Lawrence G. Reuter, president of New York City Transit. After 12:01 a.m. on Sunday, May 4 -- the moment at which fares will rise, with the price of a single trip jumping to $2 from $1.50 -- any token plinked into a turnstile will be spit back out. Bus fareboxes will still accept the token -- along with 50 cents cash, thank you -- through the end of the year. 
The death of the token has been a planned, gradual demise, conceived in the 1980's and set in motion in 1994, when the first electronic turnstile was installed and the first MetroCard sold. Handling all those tokens -- emptying them from turnstiles, delivering bags of them to token booths, counting them out to riders -- is cumbersome and expensive, and transit officials have long looked forward to the day when most of their business with riders would involve exchanges of electrons, not metal and paper.
"In this time of dwindling resources, the shift away from tokens will allow us to be more efficient," Mr. Reuter said.
The token can look forward to an afterlife as a nostalgia fetish, a cherished little piece of a bygone New York, like Brooklyn Dodgers gear, Automats and Checker cabs. "Tokens will become cuff links and buttons and watches and who knows what else," said Kenneth T. Jackson, president of the New-York Historical Society. But for now, there is little lament for the token's passing. "All that rummaging through your change, all that standing in line at the booth -- who needs it?" Mr. Jackson asked.
Tokens are used for only about 8 percent of transit rides. When the Metropolitan Transportation Authority held public hearings on the fare increase, no more than a handful of people stood up to protest the elimination of the token.
"We're not in mourning," said Gene Russianoff, staff lawyer for the Straphangers Campaign, the riders' advocacy group. "The MetroCard is a better deal for riders. I have such powerful associations with the token from most of my life, so yeah, there's some emotional attachment, but it's no more than nostalgia."
The agency will not say what will become of the remains, 60 million of them, except that it has no plans for disposing of them.
The system has kept older tokens in storage, occasionally dangling the prospect of bringing them back into circulation, but that never happened.
The token was born in 1953, and then, too, the reasons were technology and economics.
For 44 years, until 1948, the subway fare was a nickel. Not five cents, but a nickel, the only coin that would open the turnstile. For five years after that, it was a dime (not two nickels or 10 pennies).
Then, with the fare set to rise to 15 cents, engineers could not design a turnstile that would accept two different coins. Thus, the token.
In fact, there have been five tokens over the half-century, not counting commemorative ones issued in 1979, to mark the 75th anniversary of the subway system, and 1988, for the opening of a set of new stations in Queens. The original, a small disc with the letters "NYC" in the middle and the "Y" cut out, lasted the longest, 17 years, through multiple fare increases. A larger "Y" cutout token followed in 1970, and it was retired in 1980 in favor of the solid brass token. The "bulls-eye" token, with a lighter-colored center, was introduced in 1986, and finally, in 1995, came the last incarnation, with a pentagonal cutout in the center.
Each fare increase over the last five decades has been accompanied by a bluffing game by the transit system as it sought to prevent hoarding of tokens at the pre-increase price. Each time, officials said they would either introduce a new token or bring back a former one, but just as often, they announced at the last moment that the token would not change.
New York's was one of the last major transit systems to adopt an electronic fare system, and it is hard now to remember that just six years ago, transit officials were still complaining about how reluctant New Yorkers were to use the MetroCard. Not until the card was sweetened in the late 1990's with volume discounts, free transfers and weekly and monthly passes did it really catch on.
"I don't know if New Yorkers are any more resistant to change than anyone else, but obviously, for a lot of people, being forced to move to the MetroCard was like my 84-year-old mother being forced to learn to use the computer," said John Mollenkopf, director of the Center for Urban Research at the City University of New York Graduate Center.
"It's not as though the token was a cherished part of life, though I think it will become a cherished relic," he said. "It was just what people were used to."
The token is survived by the turnstile and the farebox, as well as Fun Pass and other members of the MetroCard family.

HEADLINE: If the U.N. Were Being Created Today . . .; 
Keeping the Peace

BYLINE:  By JORGE G. CASTANEDA 

 BODY:
 The threat of war between the United States and Iraq has deeply shaken the United Nations. Although feverish diplomacy is still continuing, it looks increasingly doubtful that the 15-member Security Council will endorse a resolution authorizing war. President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain will meet tomorrow to try to devise a proposal to win United Nations support. But the Bush administration has already made clear that it is only continuing diplomatic efforts at the request of Britain and Spain, and that it will go ahead with a military campaign with or without the permission of the United Nations. 
 With many people questioning the continuing relevance of the organization, Arts & Ideas asked scholars and diplomats: if the United Nations were being created today, what would you want done differently? Patricia Cohen compiled the responses.
There are two issues that need rethinking if the United Nations is to remain a relevant international player in the coming decades. One is the veto of the Permanent Five in the Security Council; the second is peacekeeping.
First, the Security Council is still hostage to institutional arrangements -- most clearly the veto -- that no longer dovetail with the existing international conditions or the real distribution of power. Clearly, the Permanent Members will not give up their veto power voluntarily, and the United Nations Charter allows them to block any proposal that the veto be removed. Regardless of the debate on the expansion of the permanent members to include new powers (Japan, Germany or the European Union) and a fairer regional distribution (India, Mexico or Brazil, South Africa), the question thus becomes whether they can willingly agree to a more constructive interpretation of the veto's nature and the uses to which it can legitimately be put. Permanent membership in the Security Council and its associated veto power is a privilege, not a right.
Second, a new vision of peacekeeping is required, one that fully embodies regional solutions to regional problems by regional organizations. This approach has proved its merits in confronting ethnic and religious violence in East Timor (where Australia led an Asean peacekeeping and nation-building operation) and in the continuing European peacekeeping presence in Kosovo. Ironically, much of this "new" vision of peacekeeping is provided for in the United Nations Charter (in the long-ignored Chapter 8). This approach would align national interest with humanitarian or peacekeeping interventions and strengthen the Security Council's legitimacy, in cases of humanitarian horrors, as the sole arbiter of armed interventions.

An Island of Its Own

BYLINE:  By ANDRE LEWIN 

 BODY:
 The threat of war between the United States and Iraq has deeply shaken the United Nations. Although feverish diplomacy is still continuing, it looks increasingly doubtful that the 15-member Security Council will endorse a resolution authorizing war. President Bush, Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain will meet tomorrow to try to devise a proposal to win United Nations support.

 With many people questioning the continuing relevance of the organization, Arts & Ideas asked scholars and diplomats: if the United Nations were being created today, what would you want done differently? Patricia Cohen compiled the responses.
If the present United Nations charter of 1945 were perfectly respected by all, the result would not be so bad. But let us dream about some ideas to improve its structure and behavior in order to obtain a viable and more credible United Nations:
*Establish a permanent military force at the sole disposal of the secretary general. This force would be completed by civil observers who could suspend unfair and illegitimate election returns or constitutional changes. 
*Complete budget financing by a tax on speculative movements of capital, sales of armaments, as well as seizure of bank accounts fed by Mafia traffickers or corruption. 
*Enlarge the Security Council by introducing as permanent members some countries according to their population and to their budgetary contribution. 
*Endow the United Nations with a territory (perhaps an island) where dictators or systematic violators of human rights and United Nations resolutions could be taken, even by force, pending their presentation to new international penal jurisdictions.
*Establish a new organ to represent civil society (nongovernmental organizations, economic, social, cultural and religious forces, academics, Nobel Prize holders, journalists and the like. Representation only by governments is contradictory to the first words of the charter ("We the peoples of the United Nations").
*Erect effective sanctions against countries that do not respect resolutions, like depriving them of the right to vote, establishing penalties that would apply solely to the leaders and not to the people, and by setting deadlines beyond which military interventions would be automatic. In the most serious cases, a temporary trusteeship by the United Nations could be established.
*Establish an automatic right to intervene in and manage areas where there is a danger of massive human rights violations or genocide. ANDRE LEWIN

HEADLINE: The Guns of Kabul 

BYLINE:  By Said Tayeb Jawad; Said Tayeb Jawad is chief of staff for President Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan.

DATELINE: KABUL, Afghanistan 

 BODY:
Just over a year ago at the conference in Bonn on organizing a post-Taliban government, the factions of Afghanistan pledged "to withdraw all military units from Kabul." A glance around this city, especially at night, reveals the emptiness of those words. Clumps of armed Afghans in olive fatigues loom up out of the darkness. Kalashnikovs slung over their shoulders, they search, harass, shake down or wave on, at whim. 
 My country is at peace. And yet Kabul, once a vibrant and sophisticated capital, is like an armed camp. It is time to demilitarize our major cities. 
 For Afghans, who have seen horrors beyond human imagination committed at the point of a gun, the unjustified armed presence here and in the provinces is a terrifying sight. In Kabul but also in the provinces, where the rule of gun should have been mitigated by the presence of the International Security Assistance Forces, the sight of the armed men is enough to deter most Afghans from participating in rebuilding their country, even as we move toward national elections in 2004 as called for in the Bonn agreement. 
These armed groups can turn Afghanistan once again into a dangerous and explosive place, a menace to Afghans and the international community. For the truth is this: Afghans are a moderate people. But the violence of the militias opens the door -- as it did in 1992 -- to fundamentalism and dictatorship by pushing a desperate population to seek refuge in groups like the Taliban.
Afghans are acutely aware of this danger. In my work with President Hamid Karzai, I am constantly approached by Afghans who are concerned about the persistent presence of the militias. "My constituents didn't ask me for schools or clinics," said one delegate to last summer's loya jirga, the grand council that selected the president. "They wanted the weapons collected. They wanted the warlords disarmed." 
To fulfill this wish, President Karzai last month unveiled a comprehensive disarmament, demilitarization, and reintegration program, including job training and incentives for men-at-arms to return to civilian life. But Afghans cannot do this alone. We need the strong backing and unequivocal support of the United States and other members of the international community to bring about the withdrawal of the armed groups from our cities that was solemnly pledged in Bonn. 
Kabul should receive immediate attention, for it is a special case. Provincial visitors and dignitaries in their distinct local dress are subject to humiliation and browbeating from armed men. They conclude that Kabul, the capital, is not really theirs. They return home with their faith in the unparalleled Afghan experiment in nation-building eroded. 
But the problem holds in the provinces as well. In many places, regional commanders who have usurped the trappings of legitimacy hold the population hostage. The Afghans have repudiated them, but their gunmen impose silence, while they violate human rights and expand their hold on power and the economy in their regions. Until these men are disarmed, the Afghan people cannot invest themselves in the future of their country. 
The international community needs to help us to move militias out of urban centers to barracks and confine them there, and to put into effect President Karzai's disarmament, demilitarization and reintegration program, which includes recruiting a limited number of irregular fighters into the national army and channeling the rest toward productive employment.
We can maintain order in the cities by means of a national police force working closely with the International Security Assistance Force in Kabul and the newly formed Provincial Reconstruction Teams elsewhere. The United States should expand the mandate of these teams to include some temporary role in law enforcement. 
The United States, the United Nations and leading international groups have built up an impressive track record in the disarmament and demobilization of local militias in other countries. In Kosovo, a carefully developed if imperfectly run program led to the surrender of tens of thousands of weapons, the demobilization of the bulk of the Kosovo Liberation Army resistance fighters, and the transformation of the rest into a civil defense force that could at least be monitored. Meanwhile, an international police force maintained order and helped train graduates of the Kosovo police academy. 
We want the international determination that drove the Kosovo disarmament process to focus now on Afghanistan. With the international community's assistance, we can ensure peace and prosperity in our country.

HEADLINE: The Education Sellout 

 BODY:
George Bush promised to revolutionize public education when he signed the No Child Left Behind Act last year. But his failure to finance the law properly has discouraged recession-strapped states from embracing it fully. His administration has further endangered the reform by emphasizing peripheral parts of the law that win points from religious conservatives while ignoring vital provisions. The Department of Education seems more interested in promoting prayer in the schools -- and giving religious groups access to federal education dollars -- than in pursuing the most crucial part of the reform, which is providing every child with a "highly qualified" teacher by 2006. 
 The federal government took the unusual step last month of warning schools that get federal aid for the poor that they could lose that money if they did not permit students to exercise "constitutionally protected prayer." The Department of Education is pressing schools to provide tutoring for students in low-performing schools, but without providing sufficient money. The department is also pushing a provision that allows students to transfer to other public schools, a strange priority given that schools are underfinanced and overcrowded. 
 Members of Congress, like George Miller, Democrat of California, have grown steadily more incensed at the way the Department of Education seems to ignore the law's most important provision: the one requiring that by 2006, all teachers in core academic subjects be highly qualified. The states must first define what a highly qualified teacher is and then show how they will reach the goal.
If left to their own devices, many states will define mediocrity as excellence and declare the problem solved. This is what California tried to do last year, before Mr. Miller forced the state to reverse course. The Department of Education seems to have learned nothing from the episode, however, and seems to be favoring an honor system in which the states would decide the issue of teachers' qualifications with no real oversight.
The administration's decision to starve reform has played into the hands of those who wish to preserve the mediocre status quo. By ignoring core issues like teacher quality -- while pandering on religion -- it could leave the schools weaker than they were when this effort started.

HEADLINE: As Doubts Grow, So Does Speculation On Rate Cut 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, has said for months that the biggest weakness in the economy is anxiety about "geopolitical risks" -- namely the threat of war in Iraq. Once that is "resolved," he has said, confidence should rebound and growth should resume to more normal levels.
 But as the Iraq debate has dragged on longer than expected and the economic news has become worse, Mr. Greenspan has come under increased pressure to reduce interest rates when the Fed's monetary policy committee meets on Tuesday. 
 The drumbeat of bad news -- the economy lost 308,000 jobs in February, retail sales slumped more than expected and oil prices surged to nearly $40 a barrel before easing back -- has heightened fears that the economy is suffering from more than just war jitters and has increased speculation among investors that the Fed may lower interest rates.
Most analysts say the Fed is much more likely to stand firm on Tuesday. Rather, they say, the central bank is likely to warn that the risks of a slowdown have increased and that it will "closely monitor" events.
That would be a signal of its readiness to pump money into the economy quickly, without waiting until the next scheduled meeting of the Federal Open Market Committee, if a war with Iraq went worse than expected or if confidence failed to bounce back afterward.
"I don't think there is much chance of a rate cut next week," said Diane C. Swonk, chief economist at Bank One in Chicago. "Greenspan has been pretty clear that he thinks Iraq is the major disturbance in the economy."
Thus far, neither Mr. Greenspan nor any other top Fed official has hinted at a willingness to cut rates immediately. Indeed, Mr. Greenspan went so far as to say at a Congressional hearing last month that he saw no need for stimulating the economy through special tax cuts like those proposed by President Bush.
But if Mr. Greenspan does not push for lower interest rates on Tuesday, economists say, it will probably not be long before he does, perhaps before the next policy-setting meeting in May.
"If it were not for the background of war uncertainty, the fundamental data would be pointing unambiguously to an aggressive move," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney, who is among economists who have become noticeably more pessimistic in the last few weeks.
"All of us have edged our numbers down," he added.
Richard B. Berner, an economist at Morgan Stanley, said the economy was suffering from more than just the paralysis caused by war anxiety.
"The big story is the energy situation," he said. Higher oil prices stem not only from concerns about the loss of Iraqi crude oil, Mr. Berner said, but also from the dropoff in production from Venezuela after a national strike, low inventories in the United States and limited additional production in the major oil-producing countries.
Mr. Greenspan has long paid close attention to oil prices, and Fed officials are well aware that big surges in oil prices have been followed by recessions in the 1970's, 1980's and after the Persian Gulf war in 1991. 
But some Fed officials have suggested that the current jump in oil prices may be less threatening than it seems. Ben S. Bernanke, a Fed governor, contended in a speech last month that previous recessions were driven less by high oil prices than by the Fed's reaction to them.
"My reading of the evidence suggests that the role the conventional wisdom has attributed to oil price increases in the stagflation of the 1970's has been overstated," Mr. Bernanke said. The real problems, he said, stemmed from deeply rooted inflationary expectations at the time and the Fed's decision to tighten monetary policy in response to the surge in oil prices.
Today, analysts say, the Fed has much more latitude -- and the markets know it. Inflation expectations are so low right now, sometimes bordering on worries about deflation, that most economists say the Federal Reserve can cut rates without igniting inflationary fears.
"They have a lot of running room," Mr. DiClemente said.
At the same time, analysts say that Mr. Greenspan has good reason to be cautious. The biggest reason is that the federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks is already at 1.25 percent, and monetary policy would move into uncharted territory when the rate dropped to zero.
If the Fed were to lower rates next week, it would have less ammunition to stimulate the economy if a potential war with Iraq turned out to be more costly and protracted than expected. Mr. Greenspan has said the Fed can stimulate the economy even if overnight interest rates drop to zero, by buying Treasury securities. But the Fed has almost no experience with that approach.

New Turkish Prime Minister
Recep Tayyip Erdogan, the leader of the Islamic-based political party that rules Turkey, assumed the post of prime minister and assembled a new government against a backdrop of national anxiety over possible war in Iraq. Although he has supported the deployment of American troops in the country, he has not set a timetable for a new vote on the issue. A10

Liechtenstein's Prince Problem
Prince Hans-Adam II of Liechtenstein has said he will move to Austria if he does not win increased powers in a referendum on Sunday, leaving his citizens, most of whom believe their country's identity depends on the presence of its monarch, in a quandary. A5

Germans Discuss War Woes
Talking about the firebombing of Dresden, which killed about 35,000 people and destroyed one of the most beautiful cities in Europe, Germans are breaking a longstanding silence, at least maintained in public, about their experience of the horrors of World War II. A3

Kidnapping Suspect's Wife Says He Wanted 7 More
The wife of the man charged in the kidnapping of Elizabeth Smart said that the girl was taken to be the first ofseven additional wives a divine vision told him to wed, according to a social worker who visited the jailed woman. A1

It seems clear that Elizabeth Smart had chances to run away from her kidnappers, but did not try to do so. Psychologists say hostages often behave as she did, and may form emotional bonds with their captors. A13

Ashcroft Builds a Powerhouse
Attorney General John Ashcroft has significantly broadened the reach of the attorney general, legal scholars and law enforcement officials agree. His reach extends beyond counterterrorism to issues like the death penalty and gun policy. His critics and some of his conservative peers are worried. A1

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: WHITE HOUSE; 
BUSH AND ALLIES WILL MEET TO SEEK WAYS TO SWAY U.N.

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON with WARREN HOGE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
The White House said today that President Bush would meet on Sunday with the leaders of Britain and Spain, his staunchest allies in demanding that Iraq disarm, to determine if there is a last-ditch way to bring the United Nations together on an ultimatum to Saddam Hussein.
 But the meeting, to be held in the Azores in the eastern Atlantic, bore no promise of a diplomatic breakthrough. As much as anything, it seemed intended to show the three leaders' willingness to explore all alternatives before Mr. Bush authorizes military action. 
 Not invited to the gathering were the six nations whose votes the United States, Britain and Spain are seeking in their effort to win the Security Council's imprimatur on a new resolution authorizing war if Iraq fails to disarm. The White House today rejected the latest effort by the six nations -- a proposal put forward by Chile seeking three more weeks for Mr. Hussein's government to meet five tests of his willingness to disarm -- hours after it was made public. 
Ari Fleischer, the White House spokesman, said "all final diplomatic options" would be on the table when Mr. Bush met in the Azores with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain. The three countries sponsored a Security Council resolution imposing a deadline of Monday on Mr. Hussein to give up his weapons of mass destruction or face an invasion. The resolution has so far attracted the firm support of only one other nation on the 15-member Security Council, Bulgaria.
After insisting for a week that it would force a vote in the Council, the White House has over the last few days waffled about its intentions Today, administration officials did not rule out the possibility that the three leaders would decide on Sunday to abandon the resolution altogether.
Adding to the sense that the United States is closing out its diplomatic playbook before unleashing the military, Mr. Bush appeared in the Rose Garden this morning to announce that he is prepared to proceed with a new international effort to bring peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Mr. Blair said the move was intended to signal that his country and the United States were sensitive to the concerns of Arabs even as they prepare to deal with Mr. Hussein.
President Jacques Chirac of France, whose pledge to veto any United Nations resolution in the Security Council has infuriated both the United States and Britain, called Mr. Blair today to discuss Iraq. But aides to Mr. Blair said there was no indication of any movement toward a compromise that might allow the Security Council to take a unified position, and American officials said they saw little value in engaging France in any high-level last-minute diplomacy. 
"This has gone on long enough," Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser, said in an interview with Al Jazeera, the Arab television network, referring to diplomatic efforts to disarm Iraq.
Mr. Fleischer said that if Mr. Bush decided to go to war, he would address the nation before the start of hostilities and would have "much information to share with the American people" about the risks and costs of the conflict. 
At the United Nations, the frenetic activity of the last week gave way to canceled meetings and a growing sense of resignation that the war would start with the world deeply divided over whether Mr. Bush was acting precipitously in resorting to military action.
As the diplomacy entered what White House officials said could be its final days, the Pentagon continued to put its fighting forces into position. The Navy sent a number of cruisers and destroyers from the Mediterranean through the Suez Canal into the Red Sea. The shift will enable the warships to launch cruise missiles at Iraq without the missiles' entering the airspace of Turkey, which has yet to provide the United States with overflight rights or permission to base ground troops on its territory.
Diplomats and administration officials said Mr. Bush and Mr. Blair had been considering a meeting to discuss the diplomatic endgame for several weeks. Mr. Fleischer had denied as recently as midday on Thursday that the president had any plans to travel. 
Mr. Fleischer said today that the idea of a trip had come up again late on Thursday, and had come together only early this morning. This left the White House scrambling to make arrangements for the president, his staff and reporters to descend on the air base, shared by the United States and Portugal, on the island of Terceira. The Azores are part of Portugal.
But the White House also made clear that the last-minute push to mend the deep divisions that have riven the Security Council and left the United States at odds with France, Germany, Russia, China and other nations had little to do with Mr. Bush's desire for further United Nations authorization. More important, officials said, were pleas from Britain and Spain, whose leaders face intense domestic political opposition to their support for Mr. Bush, to give diplomacy one last chance.
"This is important to our friends and our allies," Mr. Fleischer said. "And if it's important to our friends and our allies, it's important to President Bush."
The White House said it already had all the authorization it needed for war with Iraq. "The United States -- and the president has said it repeatedly -- does not need a second resolution," Mr. Fleischer said. He maintained that the authority to disarm Mr. Hussein's government by force was inherent in previous United Nations resolutions.
At the United Nations, diplomacy was clearly losing momentum. This morning, the envoys of the six uncommitted Security Council members met to work on a suggested draft of a compromise. The six countries are Angola, Cameroon, Chile, Guinea, Mexico and Pakistan. 
But before the envoys carrying copies of the draft in their briefcases got 100 yards from the Council chamber, they learned that President Ricardo Lagos of Chile had unveiled something very much like the same proposal and that Mr. Fleischer had dismissed it as a "nonstarter."
Envoys from Mexico and Angola subsequently distanced themselves from the proposal, both saying in separate interviews, "It's a Chilean proposal." A United Nations official said late in the day that the unified front of the six had "fallen apart."
In an escalation of the low-grade air war in southern Iraq, two Air Force B-1 bombers attacked anti-aircraft radar systems in the country's western desert today. It was the first time the Pentagon had used B-1's to strike Iraqi targets since the punitive bombing missions in December 1998, and came in response to Iraq's firing at allied warplanes patrolling the southern "no-flight" zone.
Also late today, according to Mohammed Aldouri, the Iraqi envoy, the Iraqi mission faxed to the office of Hans Blix, one of the chief weapons inspectors, a 25-page document in English and Arabic that was Baghdad's response to Mr. Blix's recent report on the "key remaining disarmament tasks." A spokesman for the weapons inspectors said that they had received the document but that it would take some time to translate and distribute. 
But the administration carried on with efforts to win support for its position. Ms. Rice said talks with other countries would go on through the weekend, apart from Mr. Bush's trip.
The president today also extended a waiver of all sanctions imposed on Pakistan after the 1999 coup d'etat by Gen. Pervez Musharraf. This paves the way for Congress to approve an aid package that includes $1 billion of debt relief and $104 million of economic and military assistance, a State Department official said. Congress first waived the sanctions in October 2001 after Pakistan became a crucial ally in the war in Afghanistan.

HEADLINE: United Says if a War Erupts It May Have toCut Flights 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
United Airlines said yesterday that a war with Iraq could force it to reduce further the number ofits flights, to furlough more employees and to again cut the wages and benefits of workers.
 Glenn F. Tilton, chief executive of United's parent, the UAL Corporation, said the airline would also ask lenders to revise the schedule for payments it must make on $1.5 billion in debtor-in-possession financing, which it obtained when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in December. 
 In a message to employees on United's telephone hot line yesterday, Mr. Tilton said that the measures would be imposed "only as a last resort." But he cited a report this week by the Air Transport Association, the industry's trade group, that warned that a war could be devastating for the industry, already reeling from the weak economy. 
Mr. Tilton told employees the airline had already had a drop in bookings, in advance of any conflict, and thus it would act swiftly if war occurred, and possibly even sooner. Its first action would be to reduce schedules by 10 percent to 12 percent. United, which operates 1,700 flights a day, has already cut flights by 25 percent since the September 2001 attacks, in which it lost two aircraft.
Next, it would meet with lenders to revise the timetable for its loans, which have various due dates the airline must meet to maintain access to financing.
After that, Mr. Tilton said United might have to lay off an unspecified number of its 72,500 employees, and impose temporary concessions on top of the $1 billion in wage and benefit cuts the airline made after filing for bankruptcy. "Our hope is that these steps will enable us to weather the war's impact," Mr. Tilton said, adding that no one could predict the duration of a conflict. 
The Air Transport Association said this week that a war could cost the industry 70,000 jobs, and force losses of up to $10.7 billion, compared with the $6 billion the airlines are expected to lose even if there is no conflict. Should the war be accompanied by a significant terrorist attack, industry losses might approach $15 billion, the association said.
Mr. Tilton's comments came as United continued negotiations with its major labor groups on $2.56 billion in wage and benefit concessions the airline said were needed to return it to solvency. On Monday, United is expected to file a motion in bankruptcy court seeking permission to abrogate its contracts if it cannot agree with its unions on new contracts. Officials at United and its unions said it was unlikely that agreements would be reached before Monday. They expect negotiations to continue for several weeks.

 KHRUSHCHEV
The Man and His Era.
By William Taubman.
Illustrated. 876 pp. New York:
W. W. Norton & Company. $35.
 HE was one of Stalin's most trusted henchmen, up to his elbows in blood -- yet he dealt Stalinism, the Soviet system and the world Communist movement a wound from which they would never recover. He brutally crushed the Hungarian revolution -- yet he opened the gates of the gulag for millions, and authorized the publication of Solzhenitsyn's "One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich." He built the Berlin Wall and put nuclear-tipped missiles into Cuba -- yet he ordered deep unilateral cuts in Soviet conventional forces and initiated the first detente with the United States. He was crude, dogmatic and merciless; also generous, public-spirited and forgiving.
He was Nikita Sergeyevich Khrushchev: a top Soviet leader since the mid-1930's, the dominant member of the post-Stalin leadership (1953-57) and the Soviet Union's unchallenged dictator-ruler between 1957 and 1964. Although eminently worthy of a serious biography, Khrushchev until now has been the subject of rather thin Kremlinological exegeses. In "Khrushchev: The Man and His Era," which took almost two decades to research and write, William Taubman, a professor of political science at Amherst College, finally gives us what we (and Khrushchev) deserve: a portrait unlikely to be surpassed any time soon in either richness or complexity. 
Taubman has made use of materials from over two dozen Russian and American archives, of more than 70 personal interviews (including ones with Khrushchev's children, grandchildren, in-laws and other relatives), of published and unpublished memoirs, innumerable newspaper and magazine articles, even Soviet newsreels. The list of published books and articles consulted by the author extends across 13 pages. This volume, with its brisk, enjoyable narrative, succeeds in every sense: sweep, depth, liveliness, color, tempo. Each chapter shines with mastery and authority. 
A conscientious biography of a worthy subject cannot help being a portrait of the times, and Taubman's book fully lives up to the "and his era" of the subtitle. It is a multifaceted study of the key political and economic forces of the first 47 years -- almost two-thirds of the total -- of the Soviet civilization: from the revolution of October 1917, which found the 23-year-old Nikita (with only four years of parochial school) a skilled metalworker in the heart of Russia's coal mining region, to Oct. 13, 1964, when, returning from a Presidium meeting in the Kremlin, he pushed his briefcase into his son's hands and sighed: "It's over. I'm retired." 
In between, as he climbs up the increasingly bloody pole to the pinnacle of Soviet power, we follow Nikita Sergeyevich through virtually all the key events of Soviet history. Some he witnessed, some he helped to shape: the doomed struggle of the anti-Stalin opposition inside the party during the 1920's; the horrors of Stalinist "collectivization"; the Great Purge of 1936-39, when, as a member of tribunals, he sent thousands to torture and death; the wholesale arrests, deportations and executions that he supervised in western Ukraine after Hitler and Stalin divided Poland in 1939; the Kiev and Kharkov disasters during World War II and the Stalingrad triumph, in all of which he played a role as Stalin's political emissary to the armies in the field. 
Khrushchev was one of the three Soviet leaders closest to an increasingly insane and paranoid Stalin during the post-World War II years (the two others were the secret police chief Lavrenty Beria and Deputy Prime Minister Georgy Malenkov). Following the tyrant's death in 1953, he first disposed of the universally feared Beria (who was arrested and shot as a "spy") before proceeding gradually to outmaneuver Malenkov and another top rival, Stalin's foreign minister, Vyacheslav Molotov.
Then came February 1956 and the weightiest of Khrushchev's claims to a place in history (and one of the 20th century's greatest surprises): the "secret speech" to a party congress detailing Stalin's crimes. There were, to be sure, obvious tactical reasons for it: Khrushchev lessened or obscured his own very formidable culpability in the regime's war on the Soviet people, and he also undermined his rivals Molotov and Malenkov, whose complicity in the purges was demonstrably greater than his own. Yet power struggle considerations cannot fully account for Khrushchev's de-Stalinization, especially since he resumed his attack on Stalin in broad daylight at the 1961 party congress, four years after all his competitors had been vanquished. 
Even though he limited his description of Stalin's crimes solely to Communist victims (passing in silence over millions of "class enemies" and other categories), Khrushchev knew how enormous the stakes were. "Stalin personifies the multiple victories of the Soviet people," one Presidium bigwig objected. "Examining possible mistakes . . . will raise doubts about the correctness of our whole course." Another top leader lamented: "If these are facts, can we really call this Communism? This is unforgivable." 
The four-hour speech was listened to by several thousand people in "deathly silence." The shock was palpable. Two weeks later, after he read the speech, Poland's Communist dictator Boleslaw Bierut had a heart attack and died. Within months, workers rose up in Poznan. Then the Hungarian revolution exploded.
Taubman provides a number of explanations, all plausible and helpful, as clues to Khrushchev's de-Stalinizing impulse, but characteristically he respects the reader and refrains from ex cathedra pronouncements. This is as it should be: here was an instance of human mystery of the highest order, of an inextinguishable spark that ignites an irresistible human inclination to choose, albeit often inconsistently and by degrees, good over evil, liberty over slavery, truth over lies. Even decades of brutalization and degradation by so supremely talented an "engineer of human souls" as Stalin proved no match for these imperatives of the human spirit. 
Those who successfully plotted against Khrushchev in October 1964 cited many perfectly valid reasons for his removal: the failures in agriculture, the embarrassment and loss of face caused by his boorish behavior abroad (including the famous shoe-banging episode at the United Nations), the "adventurism" of the Cuban fiasco, the man's rudeness and arrogance. Still, to the neo-Stalinists who would rule the Soviet Union for the next 20 years, Khrushchev's cardinal sin, without doubt, was the secret speech. Summoned six years after his ouster to the Party Control Committee to be berated for publishing his memoirs in the West, a very sick 76-year-old Khrushchev told his accusers: "I too was infected by Stalin, but I also freed myself from him, whereas you did not." As late as 1984, 13 years after his death, Politburo members railed against the "scandalous disgraces" Khrushchev had committed "in relation to Stalin." "He soiled and stained us," one said. "He dealt an irreversible blow to the positive image of the Soviet Union in the eyes of the world," another added.
Even in defeat Khrushchev proved dangerous to them -- perhaps, in the end, more dangerous than ever. For his demise demonstrated to a young and up-and-coming Mikhail Gorbachev, along with his liberal alter ego, Aleksandr Yakovlev, a key lesson of Soviet (and Russian) history: liberalizations from above are subverted by the resistance of functionaries (and the liberalizer-in-chief is inevitably overthrown in a palace coup) unless a project of liberty is protected by an alliance with the Russian people, who, like any other people, thirst for truth, justice, dignity and trust. 
When in power, Gorbachev and Yakovlev pursued that alliance by permitting the intelligentsia to tell people the truth in newspapers, magazines, books and television programs. Indeed, Gorbachev acknowledged his debt to Khrushchev after he became general secretary in 1985 by scheduling the first party congress over which he presided to coincide, 30 years to the day, with Khrushchev's secret speech. There followed the firestorm of glasnost, and within three short years (1988-90) the entire legitimizing mythology of the Soviet party-state went up in smoke, leaving behind a charred empty shell that Boris Yeltsin kicked aside in August 1991.
Khrushchev had a hand in it all, and his life represents a hefty slice of history, admirably served up in this monumental biography, one that is likely to be definitive for years to come. In the end, it is hard to summarize this man better than Taubman does: "complicit in great evil yet also the author of much good."

 WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA?
The Truth About Bias and the News.
By Eric Alterman.
322 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $25.

DEMOCRACY
AND THE NEWS
By Herbert J. Gans.
168 pp. New York:
Oxford University Press. $26.
 "THE only authors whom I acknowledge as American are the journalists," Alexis de Tocqueville wrote. "They indeed are not great writers," he added with Old European disdain, "but they speak the language of their country and make themselves heard." Of course, merely because Tocqueville said it does not mean that it was true (he also urged remedial instruction in Greek for our underachieving writers). But in this case, our favorite cheese-eating surrender monkey was quite correct in his diagnosis. Journalism is still essential to the health of democracy in America, and two new clinical studies argue that the patient is not faring well.
Eric Alterman and Herbert J. Gans write from very different perspectives. Alterman, the louder of this odd couple, is an outspoken columnist for The Nation and MSNBC.com. As its title implies, "What Liberal Media?" issues a riposte to the notion that a vast left-wing conspiracy controls America's airwaves and newsprint, recently argued in Bernard Goldberg's "Bias" and routinely promoted as gospel on the right. Gans, a mild-mannered Columbia University sociologist, is less concerned with political nuance and more with the declining quality of the information peddled as news. Both have important things to say. 
Alterman is ready for a bar fight, and he comes out swinging. His first targets are Goldberg and Ann Coulter, the acidulous commentator whose mini-skirts and mini-thoughts have ensured her a wide following on the paleolithic end of the political spectrum. Alterman dusts off some of her more outrageous quotations (wishing that Timothy McVeigh had blown up The New York Times, to cite one example), which more or less refute themselves, and then proceeds to the more serious argument that "the right is working the refs" the way loudmouthed coaches do -- to gain whatever tactical advantage they can. 
In fact, Alterman argues, the bias is hard to find. The Times was hardly soft on the Clinton administration, chasing after Whitewater for years, and The Washington Post has been slouching rightward for some time. Talk radio is Death Valley for the left, and the world of television punditry is not much better. Throughout the book, the idea of a liberal reporter seems a faint anachronism -- like the typewriter or Jimmy Olsen's bow tie -- when contrasted to the disciplined nexus of private foundations, talk shows and dirt-seeking oppo men that the right uses to get out its message. Alterman vividly presents this nether world as something out of Dante's "Inferno" -- the trust-funders with deep pockets, like Richard Mellon Scaife; the Internet bottom-feeders who traffic in rumors and half-truths (Matt Drudge); the braying hosts and guests on shows like "The O'Reilly Factor" and "The McLaughlin Group," who never shut their mouths to listen to one another (where's the duct tape when you actually need it?). 
But it's one thing to rant about the right, and it's another to show tangible proof that democracy is being tampered with. This Alterman sets out to do in his two best chapters, detailing the press's dismissive treatment of Al Gore in 2000 and its indifference to the actual counting of the votes in Florida. Alterman suggests persuasively that the press mollycoddled George W. Bush in the months leading to the election. Another interesting revelation is that the Republicans were poised to launch a "massive talk radio operation" to attack the verdict if Gore won the electoral count but lost the popular vote. History turned out differently, as we know, and Gore was excoriated as a sore loser for even questioning the result. By working the refs, the Bush team ended up winning the Super Bowl. 
Alterman is not afraid to name names, and he goes after many of the sacred cows of his profession. David Broder may need smelling salts after reading his portrayal. Chris Matthews is quoted gushing that George Bush proved his leadership quality and fulfilled Hemingway's "very definition of courage" (grace under pressure) by throwing a strike at Yankee Stadium to open Game 3 of the 2001 World Series. On that basis, I would like to nominate Pedro Martinez as secretary general of NATO and Roger Clemens as secretary of agriculture. Tim Russert, on "Meet the Press," asked Laura Bush if her husband had become president because of divine intervention (tactfully, she said no). 
The book appears to have been written quickly, and at times it shows. From a historian's perspective, Alterman could have spent far less time on the minutiae of recent television broadcasts and more on the deeper background of the changes in the media industry over the last two decades. He makes a good case that a narrow federal appeals court decision in 1986 paved the way for the corporate control of radio that now slants the news (the two votes in the 2-1 decision came from Antonin Scalia and Robert Bork). But there is little on the rise of the Internet and the cable industry, the purchase and collapse of local family-owned newspapers around the country (abetted by USA Today), the 1996 Telecommunications Act, the AOL Time Warner merger and other steps toward the dumbing down of political reporting. All have something to do with the story. Nor is there much on the long prehistory of media bashing in this country, from both sides. There's another book's worth of material in the story of our evolution from muckraking to H. L. Mencken to Joe McCarthy, Richard Nixon, Dan Quayle and their successors (on second thought, evolution may not be the right word). To some extent, a book seeking to explain Rush Limbaugh's popularity must explore cultural as well as political factors. And it would be strengthened if it examined liberal shortcomings more forcefully -- why is it that liberals fare badly on live radio and on television? That is a difficult but important question. Still, "What Liberal Media?" is bold, counterintuitive and cathartic. 
"Democracy and the News" is a more modest offering, clocking in at under 170 pages. Gans has enjoyed a long and eminent career, and if his writing is a tad academic, he still radiates decency and common sense. Like Tocqueville, he also brings something of the neutral tone of a foreign observer (he arrived in his early teens as a refugee), and he is refreshingly free of partisan bias. 
But that does not mean Gans is less worried than Alterman. From his more sociological perch, he fears that an economic and political "disempowerment spiral" is removing citizens from meaningful participation in the life of the Republic, endangering democracy by making it "upscale," like so much froth on a caffe latte. He finds a convenient villain in a press that has grown corporate and corpulent, seeking excessive rates of profit, replacing hard news with soft features and blurring the once inviolable division between church (the editorial side) and state (the business end). 
These are all fair critiques. The problem is that Gans, like the rest of us, has no workable idea about what to do next. Yes, if more people voted, we would have truer democracy. Yes, if the press did a better job informing people and helped them to vote for the best candidates, based on real comprehension of the issues, government would improve. And if frogs had wings, they wouldn't bump their bottoms. Near the end of the book, Gans issues a series of cautious recommendations, most of which are quite plausible. He thinks that more of the media costs of running for office should be subsidized by the government. Reporters should make national stories local so that their implications are easier to understand. And journalists should pay more attention to the enormous power of lobbyists in Washington. But despite his good intentions, there is a wistful, elegiac quality to this book that does not translate easily into hard policy recommendations. 
Recent news suggests that the story may soon need updating, however. A group of investors led by venture capitalists from Chicago is seeking parity through the creation of an alternative radio network that tilts left. Predictably, Hollywood talent is being lined up, although that could doom the effort from the start. What would excite Limbaugh more than a long soliloquy on globalization from Barbra Streisand, perhaps set to the tune of "The Way We Were"? Or Harry Belafonte reprising Paul Robeson's classic Chinese Communist ballads? Still, the planning of this network, like the writing of these books, is a sign that democracy is once again recalibrating itself. We can all hope that a genuine debate will ensue.

HEADLINE: FILM; 
A Director Whose Life Could Have Been a Movie

BYLINE:  By DAVID THOMSON; David Thomson's books include "The New Biographical Dictionary of Film" and "Rosebud: The Story of Orson Welles."

 BODY:
THERE was a time when the director Nicholas Ray was the battleground for critical thinking about movies. "Ray or Ray?" asked the London magazine Sight & Sound. They meant Satyajit or Nicholas? -- moral purpose or mere beauty? A deeper question lurked, one we have never solved: is film an art form? Or something far more complicated?
 It seems clear, though, nearly 24 years after his death, that a full life of Nicholas Ray might make a remarkable American portrait -- the moments of glory, the years of chaos; the aching integrity and the corruption; his chronic seductiveness, and the way so many admirers once regarded him as a model of the besieged American film director. Just to list the Ray films taken from him, re-cut without his permission and rendered less than he intended because "they" (the money people) were hostile would make a classic panorama of Hollywood horrors. But then you'd have to recount the ways in which Ray himself betrayed his own ventures. He's the director as auteur and shambles, glory and ruin. You can't have one without the other. And if that difficult diet leaves you less sure that you have a stomach for the movies, so be it. 
 Does this preamble register today? Twenty-four years is time enough for so much forgetting, even if the Museum of Modern Art is doing the best it can to remember. On Thursday it began a monthlong retrospective in which it is showing everything by Ray in the best available prints so that anyone can have a fresh chance on a big screen to encounter one of the most dynamic fillers of the frame that film has ever known. Yes, there are poor scripts, conventional subjects, miscastings, but there is Nick Ray using color, form, movement, music, sound and actors. And it is still intoxicating. To be conservative about it, if you haven't seen "They Live by Night," "In a Lonely Place," "The Lusty Men," "Rebel Without a Cause," "Bigger Than Life" and "Bitter Victory" before, and if you love film, there's nowhere else to be.
If you prefer the romantic approach, here's Jean-Luc Godard: "There was theater (Griffith), poetry (Murnau), painting (Rossellini), dance (Eisenstein), music (Renoir). Henceforth there is cinema. And the cinema is Nicholas Ray."
That cryptic writing on the wall is a short course in film history, based on the notion that these master directors encapsulated the achievement of entire art forms, leaving the imagination clear for the fresh splendor of movies. It's dotty and heady, and it's Godard in 1958, bursting to make his own feature debut and declaring the terms by which he wanted to be judged. And no one ever bothered to establish with Nick Ray himself (increasingly a European figure at that time) whether he agreed or was anywhere near understanding Godard's blazing, austere praise. Probably not, for as Ray drifted into unemployment, exile and illness, he was also staggering toward the state of living disaster that had always threatened. That specter had loomed in the mind of John Houseman, Ray's first producer in Hollywood, the man who helped him get "They Live by Night" done.
Ray was from Wisconsin, born in Galesville, near La Crosse, in 1911. But Nick Ray (his birth name was Raymond Nicholas Kienzle) was a wanderer and drifter and a slow developer. He had worked in theater, after studying architecture with Frank Lloyd Wright. He was also a tall, beautiful guy, ready to fall in love with anyone. As Houseman put it, in his autobiography: 
"Reared in Wisconsin in a household dominated by women, he was a potential homosexual with a deep, passionate and constant need for female love in his life. This made him attractive to women, for whom the chance to save him from his own self-destructive habits proved an irresistible attraction of which Nick took full advantage and for which he rarely forgave them. He left a trail of damaged lives behind him -- not as a seducer, but as a husband, lover and father."
Now, if you say, What has that got to do with art? -- go straight to the screen, and put away the life. Actually, Houseman's brief portrait is model criticism, for it gets at the self-pity that often smothers the burning beauty of Ray's imagery. It shows the cunning melancholy that harped on emotional rescue yet employed it as a trap, and ended up muttering about the fatal impossibility of everything. He was a manipulator, who worked first on himself -- because no one interested him as much.
Consider "Bitter Victory." The Modern has the fullest version of it that anyone will ever likely see (20 minutes longer than the version released in the United States in 1957). It's about two officers in the North African campaign in World War II -- Curt Jurgens and Richard Burton. Jurgens is married to a woman (Ruth Roman) who was once Burton's lover. Jurgens is cold, afraid, officious, calculating; Burton is dreamy, self-destructive, fatalistic. Only one of them comes back from their secret mission.
The film is black and white CinemaScope and vibrant and riveting: the terse action scenes are so economical; the desert is a lesson waiting for Antonioni and Bertolucci; the scene where Burton's character has to attend to the wounded, which ends with him saying, "I save the dead and kill the living," is unbearably moving.
Hardly a frame is lacking grace and danger. And yet -- Jurgens is miscast, Ruth Roman is hopeless, and Burton behaves like someone trying out for "Lawrence of Arabia." In the end, the contradictory impulses of the two men -- their struggle to identify real courage and honor -- is a wordy game, an evasion of the latent homosexuality. It's worth recalling that Ray wanted Burton and Montgomery Clift for the officers, in war yet in love. But in his mainstream Hollywood career, Ray, the troubled bisexual, never reached that point of true danger.
Nearly every film has some such riddle within it -- and all the outward signs of disaster in the production. Ray thought and spoke very slowly. Producers always mistrusted those secret plans he must be hatching. They made his life hard -- or they fell into his trap of becoming the bad cops who haunted him. The deviousness of the man -- the drugs, the gambling, seducing Natalie Wood (age 16) on "Rebel" when he was 43 -- all that stuff needs to be spelled out, along with the four marriages, the son from the first marrying the second wife (Gloria Grahame), and the ways Ray sabotaged his own career. Yet admirers from Godard onward have guarded the lofty paragon and wounded victim Ray dreamed of being.
Why urge the truth? Because so many of the films are so half-baked and adolescent -- as dramas, as stories, as material. And we need to know that having the eye and the urge to be a great picture-maker is wondrous, but not enough. So Nicholas Ray made a few great films, and several that are so marred that it's time to challenge his own credo, "If everything was in the script -- why make the movie?" That sounds fine, but if there's confusion in the script, or worse, then why trust imagery to clear it up?
American film needs what Ray lacked: a mind for difficult ideas and adult material and daring conclusions. Ravishing self-absorption is not enough.

It's All a Game, and Only He Knows the Rules

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL WHITE; Michael White is a columnist for BBC Music Magazine and writes for The Sunday Telegraph in London.

DATELINE: LONDON 

 BODY:
IN the 21st-century culture of oversupply and underdemand, it's small wonder that every second musician in the marketplace is sold by agents, impresarios and record companies as unique. It doesn't mean much.
 But just occasionally it does. And Mikhail Pletnev -- arguably the most distinctive and idiosyncratically remarkable of living pianists -- is a case in point. 
 Only in the last 10 years have Western audiences had the chance to come to terms with him, although he made his mark a quarter century ago, when -- at 21 -- he took first prize at the Tchaikovsky International Piano Competition in Moscow and immediately stacked up invitations for impressive world tours. 
Then the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan and, as he says, "the doors closed."
"Cultural relations stopped," he adds, when we meet here in a discreetly empty restaurant of his choice. "I couldn't do 'the career.' Concerts outside the Soviet territories, all canceled. So for years I played Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, East Germany. No further."
And how did he feel about that?
"Philosophical," he says. "I stayed at home and taught. And this was not bad for me. Many young artists make success, become stars, play everywhere. Then disappear. They don't have time to take in. They just give. Then they run out of ideas, of energy, of repertory. You could say I was spared."
Mr. Pletnev, who plays at the Metropolitan Museum on Thursday, tells me this in a confiding tone, heavily Russian but half whispered, with long pauses during which he thinks, draws deeply on a cigarette (he chain-smokes) and insists on pouring me another vodka, which I make an ineffectual effort to decline. I've never liked the taste.
"In Russia," he says, filling the glass, "we do not drink vodka for taste. We drink for effect. For consequence."
And, no doubt, to assist the philosophical approach to life that Mr. Pletnev holds to on and off the stage. Like a Russian Buddha smiling quietly to himself, he comes across as self-contained, inscrutable: the guardian of some vouchsafed secret that he may or may not reveal.
It's all a game, played to a book of rules that only Mr. Pletnev knows. And though he's serious about his art -- about the piano, about conducting (roughly one-sixth of his dates these days are with a baton rather than a keyboard) and about composing (a lifelong sideline) -- a latent mischief infects the presentation. Usually encased in a veneer of gloom.
You see it when he walks onto the stage, slowly, like a pallbearer at a funeral. "I have a bad knee," he says laconically.
But even more, you hear it in the playing: in the teasing virtuosity of his Beethoven bagatelles disc for Deutsche Grammophon, in the outrageous license of his award-winning Scarlatti sonatas for Virgin Classics and in the way he milks the encores in his live Deutsche Grammophon recording from Carnegie Hall.
You also get it on a plate when he conducts. Last year he was in London with the Philharmonia Orchestra and what, in other hands, would have been a standard program of Tchaikovsky bonbons. But in Mr. Pletnev's hands, it raised the currency of easy-listening to exalted heights of style and substance.
And its special pleasure was its wit: immaculately wry and sharp but somehow lovingly extracted from the orchestra with an absurdly modest repertory of gestures. Just a shrug here or a lifting of the finger there. He hardly bothered to beat time: a curiously inverted kind of showmanship, and very Russian. (Yuri Temirkanov, the artistic director of the St. Petersburg Philharmonic, plays the same game.)
But playing games in concerts is dangerous. Especially when you're playing them with an orchestra.
"Let me tell you a story." says Mr. Pletnev, and it's an old one. "A conductor gives a concert, charges a million dollars and five cents, and barely moves a finger. One single gesture, no more. People say after, 'How do you justify your fee?' He says, 'Five cents is for the single gesture. The million dollars is for knowing when to make it. This" -- a deep drag on the cigarette -- "is conducting."
Mr. Pletnev's story comes with a mock-geriatric gravitas appropriate to the heavy, hooded, slightly swollen details of a face no longer that of the alluring young Slav in the 1978 Tchaikovsky competition. It takes some effort of will to remember that he's actually just 45: born in Archangel, the only child of parents who were both musicians. His mother, with whom he still lives on the outskirts of Moscow, is a pianist -- "a good one, a real example," he says -- and his father, now dead, played the bayan, the Russian accordion.
In the circumstances, his musical education started late: at 13, when he went to the Central School in Moscow, a famous forcing-ground for prodigies.
"But I wasn't forced," he says. "I had a happy childhood."
"I'm still happy," he adds, staring at me with the solemn features of a bloodhound. "Ecstatic. I praise God I'm not ill, not crippled, except for my knee and my finger" -- an injury that caused him to cancel concerts earlier this year -- "and still alive. What should I complain about?"
In fact he does complain -- a lot -- about contemporary Russia which, he says, is run by "rich persons with money but no culture." As a pianist he's emphatically old-school: a natural heir to Sviatoslav Richter, Emil Gilels and Sergei Rachmaninoff, concerned to make the piano sing, with plenty of color but emphatic stress on melody.
"Rather old-fashioned, of course," he says. "And it won't survive. Times are changing. Mobile phone, Internet -- national schools will go. There's no community among Russian pianists now. If there is, I'm not part of it. I met Evgeny Kissin, sure, for five minutes. Otherwise I see him only on TV. He plays his way, I play mine."
It sounds as though he's not interested in other pianists. "Not so much," he says. "In fact I'm not interested in piano music, whoever plays. I find it boring. It surprises me that other people don't find boring what I do. I can't say I don't enjoy it. It's a nice thing to play good piano in a nice hall. But listen to someone else? No."
This, presumably, is one of Mr. Pletnev's games. He's after a reaction. How could any credible musician be so insular? Or so incurious?
He shrugs his shoulders. As he does to criticism of his interventionist approach to music-making.
Mr. Pletnev's repertory is selective, rooted in Russia but with lifelines out to Chopin, Liszt, Scarlatti and the Austro-German classics. No Ravel, Debussy, nothing modern (other than his own scores). "I only play what I understand and feel I could compose myself," he says. "The rest I leave to others. They do it better."
But within those tight parameters he gives himself a wide interpretive freedom that wins friends (for its imagination) and occasionally enemies (for its distortion of the text). His art is truly recreative.
"And why not?" he says. "As a composer myself, I know a score can never say exactly what the composer wants. Even if he knows. They're like children, compositions. They have your name, you think they belong to you, but no. They have their own life."
So does he consciously set out to liberate the offspring of Tchaikovsky and Mussorgsky? Is he trying to be different?
"If it's like everyone else, why do it?" he asks. "The audience can always get a CD. But difference -- this is a result of how I play, not the reason why. A result of how I feel on the spot, in the concert hall."
Making up for lost time, Mr. Pletnev has been highly visible in American concert halls during the last decade. For one thing, the Russian National Orchestra, which he founded in the new economic freedom of 1989, is largely financed from the United States, courtesy of the oil magnate and musician Gordon Getty.
On its home ground the orchestra was, and remains, a controversial undertaking. The first nonstate orchestra in Russia since before the revolution, it began as a commercial challenge to the old-guard ensembles and made its presence felt by stealing their best players. This did not boost Mr. Pletnev's popularity among orchestra managements.
But no one could deny the Russian National's quality, which ranks beside that of Valery Gergiev's Kirov Orchestra, outclassing the venerable St. Petersburg Philharmonic. Having seen it through its first decade and then withdrawn for a break, Mr. Pletnev is now back in the driver's seat as artistic director -- complaining of the lack of support the orchestra gets in Russia (despite connections in high places) but proud of its achievements.
"To conduct this orchestra is not a job," he says. "It's a privilege. We have a budget 60 times less than the budget of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, but still, a privilege."
Another vodka, and another cigarette.
"Of course, I say this philosophically."

Rites of Spring: Gambling? What Gambling?

BYLINE:  By LISA BELKIN 

 BODY:
I AM not really a gambler. I'll buy a lottery ticket once in a while, or put a few coins in a Las Vegas slot machine, but for the most part I keep my money in my pocket. I'd like to say this is because I am wise enough to fear the grasp of addiction; heaven knows I am already far too hooked on vices like reality TV and the Snood games my children have downloaded onto my laptop. But the real reason I don't gamble is I really hate to lose.
 That said, even I feel safe wagering this: that a lot of you will be placing a lot of bets over the next few days. And even I am feeling the tug of office pools that sprout, like signs of spring, at this time of year. 
 I didn't know anything about March Madness until after I graduated. My alma mater has a tradition of coming "close, but not quite" to the finals and even in its best years the team is usually eliminated early. So when I entered the work world I was completely unprepared for the way college basketball can take hold of people who are eons away from their days at school.
Not quite a decade ago I wrote a profile of Christine Todd Whitman, who was then the governor of New Jersey, for this newspaper's magazine. There was a budget crisis looming at the time, and rumors swirled that she would be tapped for the vice-presidential spot on the Republican ticket. But the chatter among her staff was all about who would get tickets to the N.C.A.A. finals, which were being held at the Meadowlands that year. There was also a bracket pool circulating in the office, but that was off the record. After all, these things are illegal.
And yet every office seems to have one. It's been estimated that 30 percent of all employees, or 40 million people, enter an office pool every year. I'd also wager that similar numbers of people would refuse to admit that to the newspaper. I called more than a dozen companies at random while writing this column, and not one was willing to describe their setup publicly. 
"The fact that it's taboo, at least technically, is part of the fun," said a manager for a company who this year will be turning to a Web site -- www.hoopsfrenzy.com -- which is designed specifically to coordinate the office pool. Run by digitalBANG Technologies in Cincinnati, the site received 1.2 million hits during March Madness last year and has ramped up for even more activity this time.
But even if no one is talking, their distraction can be statistically measured. The Xerox Corporation, for example, tracks the monthly print volume for the office copiers and printers that it services nationwide. Research over the last three years shows that the month with the heaviest copying volume is March.
"All those brackets being printed and copied," Kara K. Choquette, the manager of corporate public relations for Xerox, says of the familiar forms on which participants scribble their picks. "Of course, there are more business days in March what with the lack of holidays," she admits, (adding that her own office "might or might not" have its own pool), "but the March Madness theory is more fun."
The outplacement firm of Challenger, Gray & Christmas has taken this statistical approach one step further and has calculated the economic effects of all the hours spent wagering and copying. March Madness could cost the nation's employers as much as $1.4 billion over the 15 days of the tournament, they've concluded (with their tongue firmly in cheek.)
Specifically, every 10 minutes of basketball talk could cost an average of $2.56 a worker, concludes John Challenger, the firm's chief executive. Multiply that by a work force of 138,907,000, he says, and the loss for every 10 minutes of talk grows to $347,921,920.
Of course, not everyone spends even a minute on such talk, so Mr. Challenger then computed the loss if only college graduates were included. There are 36.6 million people in the workplace with college degrees, meaning that lost productivity would reach $93.8 million for every 10 minutes. Multiply that out over two weeks and that's far more change than you are likely to win in any office pool.
But losing millions of dollars is not necessarily a bad thing, Mr. Challenger added. It might, to the contrary, be just what an office needs.
"The anxiety over a possible war and more terrorist attacks, not to mention decreased job security, has sunk employee morale," says Mr. Challenger (who admits that his staff has held these pools "in the past.") "If filling in brackets for an office pool or simply chatting about one's favorite team at the water cooler provides some relief, then it seems worthwhile."

In a Slow Time, Some Builders Try School Projects

BYLINE:  By ANTOINETTE MARTIN

 BODY:
WITH New Jersey's commercial real estate market remaining weak, many firms are particularly eager to do school work -- designing schools, building schools, repairing worn-out school buildings and developing commercial areas around schools and universities.
 "School construction is a major source of work for architects and contractors at this very sluggish time," said the architect Edward N. Rothe, whose firm in Edison recently merged with a larger firm that specializes in school design. 
 The state's schools are aging and, according to state Education Department statistics, 53 percent need at least one important repair. Sixty-nine percent of the schools in the state have at least one unsatisfactory environmental condition, according to the state figures. Because of overcrowding, about 12,000 New Jersey youngsters attend class in trailers. 
Last month, despite the $5 billion state budget deficit, Governor James E. McGreevey announced the state would allocate $111 million in the 2003-4 budget to finance 254 new school buildings and additions, all scheduled to open by 2005. A portion of the allocation is to be used to acquire 100 sites for future projects.
Many of the school projects are designated for 30 poor and urban districts -- including Newark, Elizabeth and Asbury Park -- that were part of the Abbott vs. Burke school-financing lawsuit decided by the state Supreme Court almost five years ago. The court ordered that all schools in those communities had to be brought up to code, and overcrowding eliminated.
In July 2000, Gov. Christie Whitman signed a law authorizing the sale of bonds to raise $8.6 billion for school construction -- about $6 billion for the districts in the Abbott decision and the rest for suburban towns beset by overcrowding. By the time Governor McGreevey took office last year, however, there had been only a single groundbreaking as a result of the court order.
Last July, Mr. McGreevey created the New Jersey Schools Construction Corporation as a subsidiary of the Economic Development Authority, to speed up the process. The corporation is now using a multitasking approach to managing construction, said its chief executive, Alfred T. McNeill, so that necessary permits are obtained at the same time a school is being designed and put out to bid for construction. 
Mr. Rothe said his architecture, planning and design firm began efforts about two years ago to position itself to win more school construction contracts.
"We engaged a consultant to assist us in finding a firm that had special expertise in the K-12 marketplace," he said. Mr. Rothe, a co-founder of the company formerly known as Rothe-Johnson-Fantacone, announced two weeks ago that the company had joined Fletcher-Thompson Inc., a Connecticut architectural firm that specializes in school, health-care and technology buildings. The new company is called RJF Fletcher-Thompson Architecture. 
Mr. Rothe said the firm is employed as the construction manager for the new Belmont Runyon Performing Arts School in Newark, a $20 million project planned before the Abbott decision took effect.
"Also, we were recently selected to design a $30 million performing arts school in Elizabeth; to do work on an arts high school in Camden, and we're on the short list for two new high schools to be built in Newark," Mr. Rothe said. The firm designed the recently completed Middlesex County Academy for Science, Mathematics and Engineering Technology in Edison on the campus of Middlesex Community College. 
Like other contractors, Mr. Rothe noted that the increase in state financing is not the only catalyst for school building plans. "Some wealthy suburban towns have grown so rapidly that they are forced to build schools, on their own," he said.
When Governor McGreevey announced the school construction push, he held a press conference in Washington Township, where a $49.9 million high school is being built. The state is financing $16.5 million of the cost, and the remainder comes from local taxpayers in the Mercer County suburb, one of New Jersey's fastest-growing towns.
Mr. McNeill, the head of the Schools Construction Corporation, has said that most of the construction in the early part of the school-building program will take place in the suburbs -- even though conditions in some Abbott districts are "enough to break your heart." That is because suburban schools were ahead on planning before Abbott was decided, he said. By 2005, he said, the majority of spending will be for urban school construction. Also, Mr. McNeill said, the major priority right now for urban schools is completion of more than 400 health-and-safety repairs and additions to ease overcrowding in existing buildings.
Among renovation projects to be completed by the end of the year are additions to schools in Berkeley, the Central Regional District in Ocean County and the Toms River Regional District.
Mr. McNeill and various local officials pointed out that suitable large plots of land are hard to find or assemble in many urban areas -- and when they are assembled, they often require environmental cleanup. 
Some real estate-related companies are focusing on projects that involve reusing existing buildings for schools. These older building sites often need cleanup, too, said people in the field.
In Union, a 50-year-old industrial building that had been empty and abandoned for five years is to be retrofitted as the new home of the Deron School, a private nonprofit school for special-needs students that is "state approved," meaning it is eligible for some state financing. 
The 37,000-square-foot building on Commerce Street that will be Deron's new home was in terrible shape, said Matthew B. Jarmel, a principal with Jarmel Kizel Architects & Engineers, based in Livingston, which will transform the structure. "There was water pouring in through huge holes in the roof," he said. "It had been a shop where they made and repaired forklifts, so there was some oil and grease cleanup that had to be done before anything else."
But the building is near a Union public school and next to a new housing development in Union, and the site is ideal for Deron, which has been searching for adequate space for five years, according to school officials. The industrial building will be converted into a 17-classroom facility, including a gymnasium, cafeteria, music room, workshop and specialized speech rooms. Construction is set to begin by the end of the month. 
Meanwhile, the Aztec Corporation, which has also expanded its work on school buildings in the past few years, is working on retrofitting a manufacturing building at the intersection of Route 10 and Okner Parkway in Livingston -- originally built for NASA -- for the private Gibbs College, which will move from Montclair. 
AND the Staubach Company, which set up a new educational and municipal services group last summer, is working on a project that would redevelop land in a depressed area around a state college in Jersey City. New Jersey City University is working with planners to buy and remediate environmental conditions at contaminated properties in its neighborhood off Route 440, said Susan Bagley of Staubach. 
"They'd like to create a university village around the campus," she said, "containing a blend -- very mixed use -- some retail, dining and entertainment, along with maybe some academic buildings."
Ms. Bagley noted that her company had been instrumental in developing similar projects in other states, including New Town in Williamsburg, Va., a public and private joint venture to create a mixed-use community around the College of William and Mary, and in Cincinnati, where it assisted two neighborhood organizations in preparing a plan to revitalize the area around the University of Cincinnati campus.
"We know that public higher-ed institutions are not deep-pocket entities," said Ms. Bagley. "We do project management, helping them with the bidding process, overseeing cost and timing, and helping them arrange financing."
In addition to the fact that school-related projects are "paying jobs in a slow time," as Ms. Bagley put it, she and Mr. Rothe pointed to a more ethereal satisfaction that comes with working in this field.
"School construction programs make a generational impact," Mr. Rothe said, "developing the children and young adults of the communities. It's a wonderful thing to be part of."

F. D. Rich Is Busy Again in Downtown Stamford

BYLINE:  By ELEANOR CHARLES 

 BODY:
AFTER a hiatus of 14 years, the F. D. Rich Company is back as a developer of major real estate projects in downtown Stamford. 
 Since 1989, when the company completed four major office buildings that were part of its urban renewal contract with the city, nothing comparable apart from UBS Warburg's 673,901-square-foot headquarters, has been constructed in downtown Stamford. During the ensuing calamitous 90's, the Riches surrendered to banks about 80 percent of their $500 million real estate empire inStamford, Florida, Maryland and Puerto Rico. 
 Now, Thomas L. Rich, 44, the company's president, has several projects in the works for the development and management group founded by his grandfather. His father, Robert N. Rich, is vice chairman and chief executive, and his uncle, Frank D. Rich Jr., is chairman. 
Most advanced among the projects is the construction under way at the corner of Broad and Summer Streets of the $17.5 million Stamford Courtyard by Marriott. The 115-room hotel is expected to be completed in March of next year.
The company acquired control of the property two years ago on a 98-year ground lease from two local families. The company razed a 9,000-square-foot building that formerly occupied the site and was built by the Riches in the 50's, relocating six small businesses. "If the families had sold it, they would have had to pay substantial capital gains taxes," Thomas Rich said. "This was a good solution for them." 
"Ground leases are an excellent way to put together a deal with very little capital," said Rick Redniss, president of the Stamford land use consulting firm of Redniss & Mead. "You can finance the balance because of the value of the land. It's a smart way to do business in this economy." 
The eight-story hotel will have 3,500 square feet of ground floor restaurant space and a 6,000-square-foot lower level containing a health club, pool, two meeting rooms and a buffet-type breakfast restaurant. Two elevators will carry cars to and from the 118 valet parking spaces in the garage on the second and third floors. Harvey Kaufman of New Canaan is the architect, and the Haynes Construction Company of Seymour is the general contractor.
A construction loan from Union State Bank for $10 million and a permanent loan from the General Electric Business Asset Funding Corporation for another $10 million are to augmented by $7.5 million in cash. The company would put up $4 million. "We are attempting to raise $3.5 million of the $7.5 million because we have other projects we are working on," Mr. Rich said. "We are in the market for a financial partner."
Summer Hotel Partners L.L.C., the development company for this project, got a special exception to current zoning for the half-acre site, allowing it to increase the hotel size by one-third while reducing the number of parking spaces by one-third. The city exempted ground floor retail and basement space from floor area calculations because it preferred to have an attractive building without unsightly parking rather than the allowable alternatives, including 41 apartments or 40,000 square feet of offices and 300 parking spaces.
AS the holder of a Marriott franchise, Mr. Rich said, "our franchise fee is based on a percentage of gross revenues from room rents," which he projected to start at $6 million a year with rates escalating from $143 to $183 a night in four years. "In return we get the Marriott name recognition, access to their reservations system, national advertising, and frequent-travel programs," he said. 
Marriott and the Rich company are no strangers to each other. The full-service 505-room Stamford Marriott was built by F. D. Rich in 1977.
In addition to building the Courtyard, Thomas Rich has a $26 million, 150-suite Residence Inn by Marriott on the drawing board. It is planned for 40,000 square feet adjacent to the north side of the main post office on Atlantic Street. Construction is to start in September and the building is to have a pool, dining facilities, health club, meeting rooms and parking for 150 cars. An opening is scheduled in January 2005.
Mr. Rich acquired control of the site and an adjacent 35,000-square-foot site that runs to the corner of Atlantic and Tresser Boulevard on a 98-year ground lease from the St. John's Urban Development Corporation. St. John's is the nonprofit owner and operator of 360 units of moderate income rental housing that the Rich company built behind these parcels in the 60's. "We have the right to buy out the lease and own the land," said Mr. Rich, who would eventually lease the land to the hotel and a 150,000-square-foot $43 million office building he plans for the smaller site.
For the present, the office proposal is being marketed by Ken Nordstrom and Michael Siegel of Insignia/ESG. "It will not be built without preleasing 100,000 square feet," said Mr. Nordstrom. "We think it will appeal to local companies and to financial services companies in New York. The majority of tenants are not seeking large spaces today, and the developer will build to suit committed tenants." 
If the Rich plans are completed, there will be four Marriotts in Stamford. The strategy, said Roger Conner, spokesman for the hotel company, "is different brands meet different travel needs."
A low-priced Marriott Fairfield Inn on Harvard Avenue was built by the Rich company as contractors in 1975. "Courtyards," Mr. Conner said, "generally charge $20 to $30 less than a full-service Marriott. They have less meeting space, no lounges, bars, and sometimes no restaurant." Residence Inns, he said, are in the extended-stay category, with kitchenettes, living areas and separate bedrooms. They may be rented for one night, but their appeal is to people on jobs away from home for weeks or months. 
While this is a bad time to be running an existing hotel, Steven Rushmore, president of Hospitality Valuation Services of Mineola, N.Y., said, "it's a good time to start hotels." He added: "They take one to three years to begin operating, and most people think by then the war will be resolved and the economy will be back on track. For its size Stamford generates a lot more hotel demand than many cities around the country because of its concentration of high-end companies, its proximity to New York and access to I-95 and railroad lines, and the fact that its hotels cater primarily to business travelers."
Still, Diane Holliday, general manager of the Westin, which like the Marriott is one of the city's four full-service hotels, said, "Occupancy has been flat at 55 and 60 percent last year and this year, compared to 2000 when it was 75 to 80 percent." Referring to the new Marriotts, she said, "We're not happy to have this new inventory."
The office market is no better, according to Jeffrey Dunne, a senior vice president at CB Richard Ellis, who is representing F. D. Rich in seeking a buyer for its six-building High Ridge Office Park, priced at $103 million. "If I were building an office building, I would certainly do that smaller size," he said, "but I'm not sure I would build one today -- maybe in two or three years." His company's latest figures show that office vacancies in Stamford reached 16.4 percent of the total 16.3 milion square feet of office space in the fourth quarter of 2002. 
One more major Rich venture is under way at 33 Broad Street, the company's 120,000-square-foot parcel opposite the Stamford branch of the University of Connecticut. It is being sold this month to Target Stores for $9.2 million. A mixed-use 180,000-square-foot building to be built by Target has been approved for the site by city boards and commissions. It will contain 16,000 square feet of ground floor retail space and three levels of parking for 550 cars that are exempt from floor area calculations; the top two levels of 82,000 square feet each to be occupied by a Target Super Store.
Mr. Rich has retained the right to buy back a 25,000 square foot corner parcel at Broad and Washington Boulevard, where Target will initially install a temporary park, and Rich has an option to buy the ground-floor retail space at Target's cost as a retail condominium unit. 
In 1996 Mr. Rich bought a one-acre site at 118 Summer Street at auction for $505,000, and soon sold a ground lease to Crown Theaters, which built and opened the 1,600-seat, six-screen Majestic Crown Theater on the site in 1998. Mr. Redniss, representing the Rich organization and the theater, struck a deal with the city to encourage more night-time activity by exempting downtown theaters from the expense of building on-site parking. A formula was devised whereby thousands of parking spaces that are unused at night are calculated into a per-seat fee paid by the theater and property owner. The Bell Street public garage, for example, was renovated using $400,000 from this fund. 
"Most of the major things that Tom is working on," said his father, Robert Rich, "still have to do with downtown Stamford. It's like glue; we never seem to get unstuck."

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living In/Cortlandt Manor; 
Country Living With a Commuter Link

BYLINE:  By CHERYL PLATZMAN WEINSTOCK 

 BODY:
WHEN Michael and Anne Devine were buying their first home in 1998, they visited Cortlandt Manor, a section of the northern Westchester town of Cortlandt. "We loved the area," said Mr. Devine, a tax manager at PricewaterhouseCoopers, whose wife also commuted, to a job in the marketing group of Neuberger & Berman, "and the fact that it still had a main train line so we could commute into the city." But, he added, "We couldn't afford the kind of home we wanted."
 So they bought a home in Bergen County, N.J., but they did not forget Cortlandt Manor. When their finances allowed it, the Devines returned and bought a house. "Where else could I buy a four-bedroom, almost 3,000-square-foot colonial on a cul-de-sac in the $550,000 range and still be able to get into the city within an hour," he said. 
 As for his home's proximity to the Indian Point nuclear power plant in nearby Buchanan, which has been the subject of controversy over the adequacy of safety plans in the case of an accident or a terrorist attack, Mr. Devine said: "Indian Point doesn't bother me. It wasn't a large consideration or detriment for us." 
Carol Kope, president of the Westchester County Board of Realtors, said, "As I see it, there's been no effect of people buying and selling homes in Cortlandt Manor, near Indian Point since 9/11." 
She added: "The prices in neighboring Yorktown have always been slightly ahead of those in Cortlandt Manor. In 1998, the median housing prices between the two neighborhoods varied by as much as $50,000. But now they're only $20,000 apart. Not only has there not been a major bailout of home buyers in Cortlandt Manor, but the area is coming up in price."
In the last decade, many new subdivisions and new parks have been built on the hilly terrain of Cortlandt Manor. The main shopping area of the town, the Cortlandt Town Center, off Route 6 has recently been renovated and expanded.
But despite the recent changes, vestiges of the old and familiar remain in Cortlandt Manor. St. Peter's Church is a one-room Episcopal church where Gen. George Washington is said to have read morning prayers; it was used as a hospital for French troops during the American Revolution. It is on the National Register of Historic Places, as are the adjoining Van Cortlandtville Cemetery and the Little Red Schoolhouse, which operated until 1972.
Linda D. Puglisi, supervisor of Cortlandt, said the town's preservation efforts are not limited to historic buildings. "We've put a lot of time into preserving its open space," she said. "About a third of the land has yet to be developed and over the last few years we have been acquiring land that has been deeded to us." The open space that has been preserved has increased 65 percent, she said. The town is in its second year of a building moratorium as it re-evaluates its land use policies.
Housing demand in Cortlandt Manor is strong, real estate professionals say. "We're one of the first affordable stops in Westchester where people from the city can come to get that country feeling, a choice of two good school districts and a good commute at a good price," said Cynthia A. Lippolis, the principal broker at River Towns GMAC Real Estate in Croton-on-Hudson. "They can choose everything from a small starter or turn-of-the-century home to a big new home."
Mrs. Lippolis said the current inventory is low in Cortlandt Manor, which is made up of many tiny neighborhoods or subdivisions, and "if they're priced well, houses in Cortlandt Manor sell right away."
There are several 700- to 1,600-square-foot cottages, Capes and ranches on the market, listed from the mid-$200,000's to $300,000. "They make good starter homes that someone can build onto," Ms. Lippolis said. In the $300,000 to $400,000 range, buyers can expect to find three- and four-bedroom Capes and high ranches on roughly one-half acre.
Nancy Kennedy, an associate broker at Coldwell Banker Perry Kennedy, said that for $400,000 to $600,000 buyers can find 2,300-square foot colonials or contemporaries with four bedrooms and two-and-a-half baths built in the last 10 years. They can find larger farmhouse colonials in some of the area's newest subdivisions, like Brookview Estates and Cranberry Meadows.
From $600,000 to $1 million, she said, buyers can find 4,000 square-foot, five-bedroom, three-bath resales in such new subdivisions as Old Oaks and Cortlandt Chase.
Besides more than 10,000 single family homes in Cortlandt Manor, Ken Verschoor, the town deputy planning director, said, there are 247 condominium units. Ms. Kennedy said two-bedroom units range from $160,000 at Wild Birch Farms to $400,000 at Valeria, an 800-acre 80-unit condominium built of fieldstone on property that was once the estate of a New York City financier. It has a swimming pool, golf course, tennis courts and pond used by rowboats. 
A two-bedroom rental in a two-family house in Cortlandt Manor is $1,000 per month, Ms. Kennedy said.
CORTLANDT MANOR is divided between two school districts. Approximately one-third of its students attend the 2,835-student Hendrick Hudson School District, an economically diverse district that also serves Montrose and Verplanck and parts of Croton-on-Hudson and Peekskill. About 5 percent of the students qualify for free or reduced-price lunch based on federal guidelines.
"We have been working very hard over the past 10 years to improve our standards and assessments," said Joan Thompson, the superintendent. "Two of our elementary schools, Furnace Woods and Verplanck, have improved over 20 percentage points or more in assessment tests over the last four years, and we have been spending most of our efforts over the last three to five years in the high school, where we've done major construction and renovation."
Hendrick Hudson High School now offers 13 advanced placement courses. "Our district's goal is not just to offer advanced placement courses for the highest level students," Ms. Thompson said, "but to offer a wide variety of entry level college courses so that all students, if they choose, could have college opportunities."
Of last year's 154 graduating high school seniors, 65 percent went on to four-year colleges and 25 percent to two-year colleges. They averaged 535 in the verbal section of the SAT reasoning test and 546 in math, considerably above the statewide averages of 494 and 506.
The biggest challenge facing the district is that $17 million to $18 million of its tax revenues comes from the Indian Point power plant. If the plant were to close, as many critical of evacuation plans for the surrounding area have demanded, residences in Cortlandt Manor would face a 74 percent property tax increase, said Nancy Bocassi, the assistant superintendent for business.
"Without financial support from the state and federal government, this district could not, in the short term, three to five years, continue to exist," she said.
Two-thirds of the students living in Cortlandt Manor attend the 6,352-student Lakeland Central School District, Westchester's largest suburban district in both area and student population. It covers more than 40 square miles of northern Westchester and western Putnam Counties.
Barnett Sturm, the superintendent, said, "We have expanded services for both gifted and challenged students." The district has a 40-student alternative high school for students "who have not experienced success in the regular high school setting and need a smaller, individualized environment," Dr. Sturm said.
Last November voters approved a $22.8 million bond issue that authorized the district to, among other things, build classrooms and renovate others and expand the kindergarten program from a half day to a full day, beginning in September 2004.
In the last three years the district has doubled its advanced placement course offerings in the two high schools from 11 to 22. It also has a science research program, in which students in Grades 6 through 12 study with scientists from I.B.M. and Wheelabrator, and a senior internship program, in which a student can get academic credit for a semester of outside work in an area of particular interest. The combined debating team from Lakeland and Walter Panas High Schools has won more championships than any other school district in the state.
Of last year's 246 graduates from Panas, the school that Cortlandt Manor residents attend, 67 percent went on to four-year colleges and 24 percent to two-year colleges. Students there averaged 502 in the SAT verbal test and 514 in math.
St. Columbanus Roman Catholic Church has an elementary school covering preschool through eighth grade; tuition averages $2,000 a year for parishioners.
Cortlandt Manor offers an array of recreational facilities. The Steven Herbert Memorial Skate Park is a new skateboard park with quarter-pipes and rails. Residents can swim and play volleyball at the 22-acre Sprout Brook Park, which has a man-made lake, enjoy the scenic overlooks of the 350-acre Hudson Highways Gateway Park and swim in the Olympic pool at the 51-acre Charles J. Cook Recreation Center.
Cortlandt Manor residents can also use hundreds of acres of other facilities in the town of Cortlandt, including the new 30-acre Steamboat Riverfront Park in the hamlet of Verplanck, which includes a dock. The county-owned Blue Mountain Reservation has more than seven miles of trails.
In addition, there is Camp Smith, named for Gov. Alfred E. Smith, a military reservation used for weekend training of local, state and United States Army reservists.
The Hudson Valley Hospital Center, a 120-bed nonprofit hospital in Cortlandt Manor, claims to have the second busiest emergency room in the county.
The area traces its recorded history to 1677, when Stephanus Van Cortlandt, a merchant and the first American-born mayor of New York City, began purchasing land from the Croton River north and east to Connecticut from several tribes of Indians. Probably the first outside visitor to the area was Henry Hudson, who anchored his boat, the Half Moon, in 1609 off the shores of Verplanck in the river that would later bear his name, said Laura Lee Keating, the town historian for Cortlandt. The town was incorporated in 1788 but for years residents used Peekskill as their mailing address. But in 1947, Peekskill broke away from Cortlandt and incorporated as a city.
In the 1990's, she said, the northern part of Cortlandt, about a third of the town, got its own ZIP code and the name Cortlandt Manor to distinguish itself from the rest of the town and the upstate city of Cortland.

In the book "Copland: Since 1943," written with Vivian Perlis, he wrote: "One look at the grounds with the Hudson in the distance, the gardens and woods, and the house with the separate studio, and I was sold. When I first saw the studio, I said that it looked like a room where a composer could write music." When Copland died in 1990, most of his assets, including the house, were left to the Copland Fund for Music, intended to help young composers. When the organization put the house on the market in 1993, it was acquired by local music lovers, and in 1995 it opened as a creative center, known as Copland House, to encourage the knowledge of American music, said Florence Stevens, its president. About a half dozen composers are chosen annually to spend a week or two in residency there, where they "can sleep in the same bedroom that Aaron Copland did," she said.

HEADLINE: New Vitality Around Old Railroad Stations 

BYLINE:  By JOHN HOLUSHA 

 BODY:
AFTER a career as a schoolteacher and administrator in New York City, Frances Fein moved to Maplewood, N.J., five and a half years ago to be closer to a daughter and grandchild. Last June, she rented an apartment in the newly opened Gaslight Commons in neighboring South Orange.
 Like many New Yorkers she had neither a car nor an inclination to own one, an anomaly, to say the least, in the auto-oriented suburbs. 
 In her new location, she can easily walk to the stores in "the village," South Orange's downtown area. Just as important, she is only a short distance from the New Jersey Transit railroad station, where Manhattan Direct service can take her to Pennsylvania Station in about 25 minutes. "I still love New York, so the train is really important," she said. "I take the train into the city two or three times a week." 
Gaslight Commons -- named for the town's retro street lights -- was developed by LCOR Inc., which is actively seeking to take advantage of improvements in mass transit and a change in public attitudes in creating both commercial and residential developments. LCOR has developed more than 20,000 residential units and 16 million square feet of commercial space nationally since 1978.
"Transit-oriented development will be to this century what suburban development was to the past," said Anthony L. Marchetta, a vice president of LCOR, which is based in the Philadelphia suburb of Berwyn, Pa. "People do not want to drive to the city anymore; they would rather take a train."
"We were suburban developers," said Peter T. Gilpatric, a senior vice president of LCOR. "We took cornfields and potato fields and built on them. But we are driven by barriers to entry, and the barriers to entry in the suburbs are driving us back to the cities."
Development linked to transit hubs is not limited to New Jersey, where the state government's policy is to preserve open space by directing development to urban areas with established mass transit and utilities. In New York, LCOR has begun leasing a recently completed development it is calling Bank Street Commons, a 500-unit apartment complex in White Plains, adjacent to a Metro-North Railroad station.
Another developer, Forest City Daly, has acquired 2.75 acres of land in Mamaroneck, N.Y., about one and a half blocks from the Larchmont train station. It is seeking government approvals to develop 185 rental apartments and town houses that will be marketed to commuters.
LCOR is also planning a 300,000-square-foot office building in downtown Jamaica, Queens, close to the Long Island Rail Road station and the AirTrain to Kennedy International Airport. Executives of the company said LCOR has developed a mixed-use project, including 1,400 units of housing, 200,000 square feet of retail space and 1.2 million square feet of office space, in the Washington suburb of Bethesda, but noted that the New York region, with its highly developed mass transit systems, presents numerous opportunities.
Indeed, Mr. Marchetta said, the Hudson River Gold Coast in Jersey City and Hoboken could be regarded as a transit-related development because of the PATH rail line and ferry links between the housing and offices there and Manhattan.
The increased attractiveness of railroads is attributable both to improvements in passenger rail service and to the realization that no more highways are likely to be built in crowded urban areas like metropolitan New York, said James W. Hughes, dean of the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. "Over the last 20 years, office growth in the suburbs has become an increasingly important part of the economy," he said. "But the problem is that sprawl has produced crawl and the crowding has spread to the periphery of the region."
He said the spread of office development in New Jersey followed the pattern of the Interstate highway system, which was largely complete by the 1970's. By the end of the 1990's, people began to notice -- as they sat in traffic jams -- that no highway capacity had been added in at least a decade. "The highway budget these days goes to repair existing bridges, not to add capacity," Dr. Hughes said.
Meanwhile, the state was improving its transit system. It added Manhattan Direct service, which takes passengers into New York City without having to change in Hoboken to the PATH lines. Meanwhile, the system plans to add to capacity by ordering double-decker passenger cars and more powerful locomotives to pull longer trains. 
In addition, a $450 million rail transfer station is nearing completion in the Meadowlands in Secaucus. It will allow riders on New Jersey Transit's Bergen County and Pascack Valley Lines to bypass Hoboken and the PATH as well. 
Rail-related developments are mainly marketed to those without school-age children, developers say. Apartments with easy access to New York City are attractive to young singles and childless couples not interested in the maintenance of a house and unconcerned about the quality of school systems. They are also attractive to older people whose families are grown and who, similarly, want to be connected with the city, if not actually live in it.
"The baby boom generation is now 39 to 57 years old, and there are plenty of empty nesters who are rattling around their McMansions," Dr. Hughes said. "The developers are going after this market by providing a suburban housing option that is more affordable than Manhattan."
Or put another way, a given number of dollars buys or rents more housing in the suburbs than it would in Manhattan. "For a person who still has a job in the city, living in White Plains means an extra room and a place to park the car," Mr. Marchetta said.
Developments of this type are attractive to towns that fear additional housing will bring in an influx of children whose presence will force expensive expansions of school systems. In South Orange, there are a total of three school-age children in Gaslight Commons, a development of 200 apartments, Mr. Marchetta said, and one is a high school senior about to depart for college.
The importance of the proximity to the railroad station can be found in the parking lots of the complex, which are nearly full on weekdays, the LCOR executive said, because most residents take the train to work and typically use their cars on weekends. 
Office workers like proximity to transportation as well, LCOR executives say. The company's proposed JFK Corporate Square development in Queens, a $30 million office building, is to be close to terminals for the Long Island Rail Road and the AirTrain to J.F.K. Airport. "It'san eight minute ride to the airport once service begins," said Mr. Gilpatric. The train had been scheduled to start running last year, but a fatal derailment has postponed service indefinitely.
In Connecticut, a $200 million commercial development approved for a 35-acre site next to the Metro-North tracks in the town of Fairfield includes construction of what would be the town's third train station. The zoning at the site, to be called Black Rock Park, allows for one million square feet of offices, a hotel, day care center and health club. An agreement to develop the property drawn up by the town, the Connecticut Department of Transportation and Black Rock Realty, a private developer, cites the creation of a station as essential to attracting tenants to the planned office buildings.
In Westchester, the short walk to the Larchmont station on Metro-North is what motivated Forest City Daly, a subsidiary of Cleveland-based Forest City Enterprises, to assemble a 2.75 acre site in Mamaroneck for a residential and retail development. "What drew us here was that it is a great neighborhood and it is close to the train station and downtown Mamaroneck," said George P. Kruse, the company's vice president for development.
He said the proposed development would include 185 market-rate apartments in a seven-story building with retail stores and parking in the base. "It is one and a half blocks to the train station and three blocks to one of the nicest downtowns in Westchester County," he said.
While officials in Westchester seem willing to accept transit-related developments only after long and careful planning, municipal leaders in New Jersey are counting on them to help revive down-at-the-heels neighborhoods that have stops on passenger lines.
Forest City Daly is developing plans to renew the downtown shopping area of Bloomfield Township, a blue collar Essex County suburb that was once a shopping destination, before the development of suburban malls. Plans call for 500 market-rate apartments, 170,000 square feet of retail space and a 900-space parking deck.
The development would transform a 13 acre site in the "Six Points" part of town that had been designated an area in need of redevelopment several years ago. Forest City Daly expects to be designated as the developer within weeks, Mr. Kruse said. If that happens, he said, demolition work would begin by fall. The $160 million project is expected to take five years to complete, starting with acquisition of the needed land.
Mr. Kruse said his company had been drawn to the project because the site surrounds a New Jersey Transit rail station that is benefiting from the opening of the Montclair Connection a mile or so away. The connection, which joined two rail lines, puts Bloomfield's station on the main line to New York rather than on a truncated branch as it was in the past.
"Midtown Direct train service is what drew us to the site," said Mr. Kruse. He said the expectation was that the easy access to New York and lower rentals than some nearby towns like Montclair would draw residents to the area. They, in turn, would establish a base of shoppers for the new retail development. The additional parking would be a lure for shoppers from other towns in the area, because parking is chronically scarce in an region that developed along train lines before automobiles were invented.
One possible drawback is that the station itself is not owned by New Jersey Transit, having been sold years ago, along with others in the area. Some stations have ended up as offices for real estate agents and lawyers,while today's commuters stand on cold platforms waiting for trains.
A far more ambitious plan linked to rail service has been proposed for Harrison, a former manufacturing center on the Passaic River to the east of Newark. There is a PATH train stop in Harrison; it provides a link to Pennsylvania Station in Newark, which has access to Northeast Corridor trains and a link to Newark Liberty International Airport.
Since much of the 235-acre site designated for redevelopment is currently covered with abandoned factory buildings, persuading people to move there will be a challenge, even those involved in development plans acknowledge.
"Urban development is not for the faint of heart," said Joseph Romano, a vice president of Advance Realty Group, which plans a mixed use development on 135 acres of the site. The plans include 3,500 apartment units, 2.5 million square feet of office space and 500,000 to 1 million square feet of retail space phased in over 10 years.
A key to the project will be building a stadium for the MetroStars professional soccer team. A 25,000 seat stadium would be ideal for the team, which regularly draws close to 20,000 people a game, but they are lost in Giants Stadium, with a capacity of more than 70,000, Mr. Romano said.
But public transportation remains at the core of the project, said David B. Barry, president of Applied Development, which plans to build housing on 30 acres near the PATH station. "The overwhelming thing driving Harrison is the train station," he said. "Without the PATH, it is a completely different redevelopment."
It would be foolish to ignore the fact the Interstate 280 runs through Harrison, providing easy access to the New Jersey Turnpike and other major roads in the area, said Jeffrey Babikien, a senior managing director with Insignia/ESG, the brokerage and services company. He said current plans include an improved two-way connection with the highway. "A project like this cannot survive on mass transit alone," he said. "You have to give people the opportunity to drive to work."
Conceding that there is little ambience in the area now, Mr. Barry said several projects needed to be developed at the same time to convince people that it is a suitable location for living, working and shopping. But he said today's Harrison is no more an eyesore than Jersey City was when its waterfront was littered with abandoned rail lines and decaying warehouses. The Lefrak Organization led the way in developing new housing and office towers in the city with its 600-acre Newport project. "Jersey City, prior to Lefrak, looked like Harrison does now," Mr. Barry said.
The coming of Manhattan Direct rail service has brightened up the downtowns in places like South Orange, where new retail stores have opened to cater to commuters and close-by residents, and in Morristown, where a development of 10 new town houses costing close to $1 million each has all but sold out, according to town officials.
AS a result, the state has designated the area around the train stations in some towns as "transit villages" which are eligible for assistance by a variety of state agencies. In Morristown, a 300-space surface parking lot adjacent to the train station is to be developed into a project with about 200 rental apartments, 8,000 square feet of retail space and a parking deck for 700 cars, according to Michael Fabrizio, executive director of the Morristown Partnership, a business-backed improvement group. The project has a budget of $35 million.
In South Orange, in addition to Gaslight Commons, several other residential projects are being planned, including one that would replace a closed supermarket.
Transit villages are areas within one-quarter to one-half mile from a train station that have been designated for mixed-use redevelopment, said Jack Lettiere, the commissioner of New Jersey's Department of Transportation. "There is a strong residential component and some focus on commercial development as well," he said. "The object is to reduce traffic congestion by making transportation less of a burden on people's lives."
A related objective is to help older downtown areas, which tend to be close to the railroad stations, flourish once again, he said. He said Gov. James E. McGreevey wants to double the number of designated transit villages by next year as part of a plan to curb sprawl in the outer suburbs.
Besides South Orange and Morristown, existing transit villages include Rahway, Riverside, Rutherford, South Amboy and Pleasantville, near Atlantic City. Metuchen was recently added to the list, with the state contributing $600,000 to build a pedestrian bridge, flashing signals at pedestrian crosswalks and other improvements.
Most of the towns being designated for redevelopment were originally settled as train lines stretched across the state in the mid-1800's. In Montclair, where the price of housing increased sharply with the completion of the Montclair Connection and the advent of Manhattan Direct service last year, started attracting commuters to New York in 1856, the year rail service began.
Because they developed in a pre-automobile era, the downtown areas tend to be compact and easy to walk around. (The corollary, of course, is that parking is a annoyance for those who have to drive.)
But government programs are not needed to persuade executives to pursue private sector opportunities at some sites close to passenger trains. "We are looking at a site in Bronxville," said Mr. Gilpatric of LCOR. "It could be a condo project with the sales prices at $1 million." He noted the success of the similarly priced project in Morristown.
Mr. Kruse of Forest City Daly said his company is looking at additional transit-related projects as well. "We are talking to officials in New Brunswick about a residential development," he said. "And, yes, it is close to the train station."

HEADLINE: Executive Life; 
A ToughTransition: Friend to Supervisor

BYLINE:  By DAVID KOEPPEL 

 BODY:
WHEN Cheryl Kahn was promoted from sales manager to director of catering for the Glazier Group of restaurants in New York last April, she realized that things would never be the same with her former co-workers, now her subordinates.
 She would would miss the water-cooler gossip, the easy back-and-forth about life outside the office. Now she was management, and she could no longer shrug off an employee's chronic lateness or poor work habits. 
 Ms. Kahn had worked for 11 years at the Glazier Group, which owns the Monkey Bar and Restaurant, Michael Jordan's: The Steak House N.Y.C. and Bridgewaters, the downtown banquet hall, and adjusting to her new role was daunting. In fact, she pushed people too hard and managed to alienate just about everybody, she said. 
"At first I was like a bulldozer knocking everyone over, and that was not well received," she said. "I was saying, 'It's my way or the highway,' and was forgetting that my friends were also in transition."
It is a classic quandary for managers making their way up the corporate ladder: how to redefine their relationships with colleagues who were once their equals, or even their bosses, but who now report to them.
Allaying the jealousy and winning the trust of those left behind, while still asserting authority, requires a diplomacy and agility that many newly minted executives lack. But they must master those skills if they hope to get ahead, management consultants say.
In a corporate world shaken by scandals, layoffs, economic uncertainty and early retirements of seasoned executives, this balancing act is playing out in more workplaces.
"It's a tricky thing to handle," said S. Joanne Murray, director of the Center for Work and Service at Wellesley College and a management consultant. "If you're internally promoted, they assume you know the lay of the land. It's a big transition. You need to be patient and not attempt to change everything at once."
On the other hand, Ms. Murray said, the new manager should get out the message immediately that he or she will be evenhanded in dealing with subordinates. Thus, Ms. Murray urges clients to steer clear of lunches with former workplace buddies to avoid the impression of favoritism, and to repair any troubled relationships with former co-workers to let them know all is forgiven.
In any case, the new manager will probably encounter some resentment among old colleagues who think their new boss has become too big for his or her britches.
Rob Carstons, a technical manager at International Business Systems in Folsom, Calif., recalls the uncertainty he felt after being promoted to a manager from a junior programmer in 1997. "It was a little bit challenging to be suddenly giving directives to peers, when just the day before you were one of them," Mr. Carstons said. "You try to be careful not to offend anyone. It's strange walking into a room and the whole conversation changes. People don't want to be as open with you when you become the boss."
OR as nice. Linda McGee, the president of Medex Insurance Services, a unit of the Medex Global Group in Baltimore, who started as a customer service representative in 1989 and leapfrogged over colleagues in a series of promotions, remembers the occasional digs. "They would say, 'Oh, here comes the big cheese now,' " Ms. McGee said. "God only knows what they talked about behind my back."
As she rose through the ranks, she said, her former office mates didn't invite her out as often, and she became more guarded about what she discussed with them. Even so, she said, she probably was too lenient with some of them.
She remained close, however, with a former colleague, Deneen Detorie, and that raised prickly workplace issues. In 1986, Ms. Detorie, a sales representative, hired Ms. McGee, then a college senior, as an intern. By 1995, Ms. McGee had risen to vice president for sales and marketing at the Medex Assistance Corporation and had become supervisor to Ms. Detorie, who by then was in charge of account services. 
At work, the two refrained from talking about the family vacations they took together, though it was no secret thatthey were close friends. For Ms. Detorie, the connection was a mixed blessing.
She recalled a particularly insecure salesman who used her as a sounding board to rehearse conversations he wanted to have with Ms. McGee. "He seemed afraid of her," Ms. Detorie recalled. "He'd come to me to get clearance for things he wanted to say."
Other employees approached her to see if she was privy to confidential information or to gauge Ms. McGee's opinions.
The friendship also enabled Ms. Detorie to take liberties with her boss that other subordinates would be unlikely to try. The day Ms. McGee gave birth to her son in 1996, for example, Ms. Detorie called her to discuss a proposal that she was putting together to land an important corporate client. And when she was late in responding to an urgent "request for proposal" from a higher-up, the friendship helped avert what might have been a severe reprimand for a less well-connected employee, they said.
"The hardest thing is acting like a boss in front of friends," Ms. McGee said. "I think sometimes you temper your reactions. I remember with Deneen feeling a lot of anger when I found out the request for proposal didn't go out. But I controlled my anger, stepped in and helped fix it."
Ms. Kahn, the new catering chief at the Glazier Group, has also learned to control her emotions. Previously, her strength had been in managing corporate accounts. Managing people, she found required making unpopular decisions, like telling her sales staff that they could no longer give bottles of Grey Goose vodka to customers to help close a deal. "I needed some time to figure out how to handle my new role," she said. "I realized I needed to loosen up and enjoy it more."

With Property Taxes, the Bill Isn't Always Certain

BYLINE:  By ALINA TUGEND 

 BODY:
ACROSS the country, many homeowners watched gleefully as their property values soared in the last few years. In some cases, however, they have found that their property taxes have also climbed. The weak economy is now adding to some homeowners' woes: many states have had to reduce local aid, forcing cities and counties to raise taxes to bridge budget gaps.
 Of course, you can't change the actual tax rate, which is set by state or local statutes, short of staging a voter revolt. But you can contest the house assessment value that local governments use in the formula to set property taxes. Now that home prices are stabilizing in many parts of the country, you may be able to build a case for an appeal. 
 The time for filing a challenge, though, is fast approaching in some areas: in New York City, for example, the so-called grievance day for most homeowners is tomorrow; for many counties in other parts of New York State, the appeal day is on the fourth Tuesday in May. 
Judging by interest from prospective clients, "we're going to see a lot more appeals," said Caryn S. Luntz, a property tax consultant in Westchester County. When the economy was stronger, and house prices were skyrocketing, she said, most people knew it was fruitless to try to lower their taxes. In Los Angeles County, for instance, there were only 14,000 assessment appeals in fiscal 2000, down from about 110,000 in fiscal 1996.
The National Taxpayers Union, based in Washington, estimates that as much as 60 percent of taxable property in the country is overassessed, but it says that only one in 50 taxpayers tries to lower it. About half who do mount a challenge win some kind of reduction, said Peter J. Sepp, a spokesman for the group. "All it really takes is an afternoon going to an assessor, a weekend preparing your own case and an evening rehearsing," Mr. Sepp said.
Many strategies can be pursued. You can try to prove, for example, that similar properties carry lower values than yours, or that errors were made -- four bedrooms were listed by the assessor when there are only three, or the dimensions of the property were wrong.
Not everyone feels comfortable braving the byzantine world of taxes. Specialists, including real estate lawyers and property tax consultants, can help, and most will charge clients only if cases are won, usually taking about half of the tax savings of the first year or two. Gabriel E. Khawly, 70, an accountant from Eastchester, N.Y., said he tried about 20 years ago to lower his property taxes on his own. It wasn't until two years ago, after hiring a property tax consultant who specializes in challenging assessments, that he was successful. He said the consultant saved him $648 a year in property taxes on his four-bedroom split-level ranch home, valued at $421,281.
Andrew J. Miller, a businessman from Pound Ridge, N.Y., hired a lawyer last year to challenge the assessment on his $1.4 million, 7,000-square-foot colonial home. "My feeling is that I would rather get people who deal with this on a regular basis," he said. His lawyer, he said, helped him get a decrease of about 12 percent on the assessment.
But James E. A. Lumley, author of "Challenge Your Taxes: Homeowner's Guide to Reducing Your Property Tax" (Wiley, 1998), says that most people can easily challenge their taxes on their own -- if they have clear grounds and follow the proper steps. "We're not talking about rocket science here; people shouldn't feel intimidated," Mr. Lumley said.
Challenging your assessment on your own may still require a certain amount of mathematical skill -- and knowledge of the tax bureaucracy. Determining property taxes involves a convoluted mixture of numbers -- usually including local, county and school taxes, along with the property assessment. In most counties, cities or towns, the tax assessor determines the market value of houses, usually by comparing them with the value of similar properties sold in the same area, and deducting for differences like the age of the property, the absence of certain luxuries, like fireplaces, or the presence of damage like dry rot. 
To keep current, many municipalities perform reassessments. In small towns, assessors may make physical reappraisals every year, although that may consist of simply peeking in a window or driving by. In large cities, they often rely on records of past assessments and new improvements. (In some states, like California, new assessments are made only when a house changes hands. California has a law capping property tax increases at 2 percent annually.)
"There's lots of technical ways assessing is done," Mr. Lumley said. "But whether you're talking a co-op in New York or a rural cabin in Vermont, it's still a matter of comparable value."
Sometimes, tax challenges are settled on the spot. If a homeowner convinces the tax assessor that a reduction should be made, "many assessors will be happy to reach an informal compromise, rather than have to defend their assessment of your property before an appeals agency," according to the guidebook of the National Taxpayers Union. If an assessor rejects the case, the next step is to go before an appeals board -- a process, again, that differs by locality. The hearings are usually short -- in New York City, for example, they are typically limited to 10 minutes.
Some local and national consumer tax groups supply guidelines on how to challenge an assessment. The Macomb County Taxpayers' Association in Michigan provides a 12-step process in its handbook, "How to Effectively Appeal a Property Tax Assessment," and since 1978 has been offering two-hour seminars. The National Taxpayers Union (www.ntu.org) offers for $6.95 its guidebook, "How to Fight Property Taxes." The New York State Office of Real Property Services offers a guide on filing for a review (www.orps.state.ny.us).
TOO often, said Michael Sessa, chairman of the Michigan association, property owners lose appeals after going to hearings unprepared. He suggests that taxpayers contemplating appeals select 15 to 20 nearby properties that are most similar to their own, then go to the assessor's office and check the properties' records. 
Mr. Sessa says people sometimes become emotional when arguing their cases before assessors. He says his seminars help to reduce the anger that many taxpayers may feel. "We explain what an assessor can do and what he can't do," Mr. Sessa said.
One seminar participant, Philis DeSaele, 59, of Sterling Heights, Mich., said she won a reduction in the assessment of a vacant lot she owned, worth thousands of dollars in tax savings, by showing that zoning restrictions prohibited her from building on the lot. She had tried appeals unsuccessfully several times before in the 1980's. "Before, I didn't thoroughly document what I was saying," Ms. DeSaele said. "I didn't know I could get documents at city hall that showed how they valued the property."
Of course, there is always the possibility that your assessment could be adjusted higher, though experts say that this rarely happens. Ms. Luntz said that it was a possibility in an informal process -- when a homeowner casually talks to an assessor, for example -- but that in some areas, like Westchester County, it cannot happen if a homeowner files a written grievance.
The best overall strategy for winning a case is to "be correct," Mr. Lumley said.
"Too many people are lazy, complain without substance and don't compare like to like," he said. "And remember, emotionality gets you nowhere."

Basic Rules for Making Appeals
 HERE are some steps that could help lower your property tax assessment, according to experts.
* Carefully review the assessment on file. Are the recorded descriptions and dimensions of the property correct? Make sure, too, that they take into account any defects that would tend to reduce the value of a home -- a cracked foundation, for example.
* Check out the neighbors. Make a list of similar properties in the area and compare their assessments with yours. Take notice of items like fireplaces, garages and backyard sizes. 
* Consider an independent appraisal. If you think your property is overassessed, you may want to hire a certified appraiser to provide an independent valuation that can be used to help make your case. Such a service doesn't come cheaply: appraisers typically charge $200 to $500.
* Meet with the tax assessor. This may be difficult in larger cities. But if presented with enough convincing evidence, an assessor may sometimes make a reduction on the spot.
* Seek a formal appeal. Homeowners can usually challenge tax assessments at any time, but many governments have scheduled specific days for formal appeals. In many parts of New York State it's the fourth Tuesday in May; in several California counties, it is Nov. 30.
* Be prepared at the appeal hearing. Before your appearance date, get a copy of the board's procedures, then gather the necessary evidence. That may include records of comparable property assessments and photographs of your home.
* Stay focused -- and calm. You may be angry about your taxes in general, or frustrated about the quality of government services, but the assessment appeals process is not the place to deal with them. The only job of the assessor and the appeals board is to estimate the value of your property.

Taming Roommate Chaos

BYLINE:  By ABBY ELLIN; Abby Ellin is a Manhattan writer. Her column on starting out in the world of money appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: preludes@nytimes.com.

 BODY:
IN 1994, my college friend James and I decided to share a 600-square-foot apartment in the West Village of Manhattan to help save money. We lived there for four years, sharing everything from kitchen appliances to CD's. Although we were clearly not romantically involved, we were a couple in many ways. We traveled together, did yoga together and befriended each other's friends, many of whom spent months crashing on our couch.
 Then he bought a duplex apartment, and I got the upstairs. I had a great deal -- $1,200 a month for a beautiful studio -- but our relationship became strained. Were we housemates, friends, or tenant and landlord? Could I traipse through his apartment if I forgot my keys? Should he have the right to ask me to leave my apartment when his family visited? The boundaries were murky; we had arguments over who had taken advantage of whom. 
 Our parting was not unlike a divorce. After all, we had been together for a few years and had had endless discussions about personal property: Who would get custody of the silverware, which we had bought together at Bloomingdale's? What about the Leonard Cohen CD that I swore was mine and he knew was his? (Forget about the iron, which our friend Lee gave to both of us and is still a sore spot.) Perhaps we should have had a written agreement -- a prenuptial without the nuptials.
Any type of relationship can benefit, including that of parents and their grown children who move in with them after college. Their agreements, for example, could outline house rules and responsibilities and include mandates about meal preparation, laundry, personal hygiene and other specifics. 
Some college students are already familiar with so-called roommate agreements, which many schools have them sign before they move into dormitories. The roommates often negotiate, in detailed language, everything from the preferred method of message-taking to the number of nights a guest is allowed to stay. 
"It helped a lot," said Jasen Lomnick, 18, a freshman at the Rochester Institute of Technology, who signed such an agreement. "My roommate and I have a lot of disputes and we look back on it every week -- like if he was studying and I had company over, or if I had the music too loud, we'd pull out the agreement and see what it says."
His roommate, Michael Howard, also 18, agreed, saying they would check the agreement "and compromise or change things as the semester went along."
But students -- and their parents -- aren't the only ones who can use agreements on living arrangements. 
"It makes sense for long-term roommates to have some kind of written agreement with each other in the event that one moves out," said Thomas F. Coleman, a lawyer and executive director of the American Association for Single People, in Glendale, Calif. "If you are living in a family-like environment -- you take vacations together, share some expenses -- you are potentially on the books for a lawsuit" if something goes wrong and you don't have an agreement. (Conversely, you could also be hit with a lawsuit if you violate the agreement; as in any business transaction, you have to adhere to the rules.)
Sheridan Falvo, 28, owns a two-bedroom, two-bathroom condominium in Union City, N.J., that she shares with her friend Marian Woodworth, 27, an editor at Heyman Associates, an executive search firm in New York City. Ms. Falvo's father, a real estate lawyer, suggested that she draft a written agreement before Ms. Woodworth moved in.
"In a lot of ways it is like a marriage," said Ms. Falvo, who works in human resources at Ruder Finn, a public relations firm in Manhattan. "I cook and she cleans, or if I'm home early I'll go to the dry cleaners and if she is she does. If one doesn't have money the other covers it and we work it out later."
It's hardly surprising that roommate agreements are gaining popularity, especially as the weak economy forces more people to double up to cut expenses. Frederick C. Hertz, a lawyer in Oakland, Calif., draws up agreements for roommates, unmarried couples who are homeowners, and people who live in communes. This work is about 80 percent of his practice, up from 1 percent in 1987. A third of these clients are under 35.
"Many young people lost a lot of money in the dot-com bust and can't afford to live alone, so they buy apartments with friends or take on roommates," he said. "When people who love and care about each other get into business situations they're afraid to deal with the issues -- 'Well, you earn more than me so you should contribute more,' or 'If I made the whole $100,000 down payment why should the profit be split 50-50?' Write it down."
Some households operate as informal communes. Consider the six college buddies who live at the "Half Street Community," as they call it -- actually just a three-bedroom house in Washington. Each contributes to a group account for rent and groceries, and each chipped in for a 1992 Plymouth Voyager. And each is responsible for cleaning a room in the house. They have even given titles to one another: the "Rockefeller" is in charge of finances while the "Swinger" leads all social events and the "Pooh-bah" runs the weekly meetings.
"WE'VE had six-hour meetings, but we make it a point to get to the same page," said Chris Lewis, 24, who is known as the "Professor." They have even drafted and signed a household constitution.
James and I, meanwhile, are slowly rebuilding our relationship; it's a lot easier now that we're not living together. But every so often I'll find something that belongs to him -- like a book about Picasso -- or I'll notice my glass bottles on his shelf. Those aren't big deals, of course. The iron, however, is still up for grabs.

HEADLINE: MONEY & MEDICINE; 
For Patients, Unpleasant Surprises in Arbitration

BYLINE:  By MICHELLE ANDREWS; Michelle Andrews is a freelance writer in Manhattan specializing in health care. Her column on its economics appears the third Sunday of each month. E-mail: moneymeds @nytimes.com.

 BODY:
THE parents of Jesica Santillan, the 17-year-old girl who died last month after a bungled heart-lung transplant, have yet to decide whether to sue for medical malpractice, according to the family's lawyer, Kurt Dixon. But there is a chance that they won't be able to, anyway -- they may have signed an agreement with Duke University Hospital before the operation to settle any medical malpractice claims through binding arbitration. Mr. Dixon said last week that he was still awaiting medical records, so he's not sure if that was the case. 
 More and more health care providers are pushing for binding arbitration -- in which an arbitrator or panel of arbitrators unconnected to a case hears arguments from both sides and renders a decision -- to reduce their costs. 
 "We all have the impression that medical malpractice arbitration agreements are expanding, and expanding rapidly," said John Vail, senior litigation counsel at the Center for Constitutional Litigation in Washington. It advises the Association of Trial Lawyers of America on constitutional issues.
The Florida Medical Association held a series of well-attended seminars around the state in December and January to teach doctors how to put arbitration agreements in place. In Utah, the Legislature passed a bill recently that allows doctors and hospitals to turn away patients who will not sign arbitration agreements. (Emergency services are excluded.) Governor Michael O. Leavitt is expected to sign it this month.
"Insurance for some specialists and for ob-gyns is rising substantially," said State Senator Leonard Blackham, the bill's sponsor. "We're going to do this as a trial and see if premiums can't come down."
Patients who go through arbitration instead of a jury trial, however, may feel as if they have been hurt twice: first by their health care provider, then by the system that is supposed to resolve the problem. They generally have little choice in the way claims are handled. Gary and Sharon Rushford of San Jose, Calif., certainly didn't.
In 1998, Mr. Rushford, then 51 and the owner of a general contracting business, noticed pain and tingling in his foot when he worked out at the gym. He said that over three months, his doctor in the Kaiser Permanente H.M.O., who worked at its hospital in Santa Clara, Calif., never examined him and instead prescribed painkillers over the phone and referred him to a podiatrist and physical therapy. The pain became so bad that he went to the emergency room, where doctors diagnosed a blood clot in his leg. Doctors broke up the clot, but it kept coming back. The vascular surgeon then in charge of the case failed to prescribe enough blood-thinning medication, standard treatment in a case like his, Mr. Rushford said. The clot worsened in a few weeks, and despite three operations to try to re-establish blood flow to his foot, he said, his leg had to be amputated above the knee.
The Rushfords went to arbitration, as Kaiser requires for all malpractice claims. At first, they said, they could not find a lawyer to represent their case, despite several attempts. Many lawyers are hesitant to take these cases, because arbitration awards are often lower than jury trial awards and are perceived as being harder to win. The Rushfords eventually turned to Sharonrose Cannistraci, the lawyer who handled legal matters relating to their construction business.
Selection of arbitrators varies by health care provider and by state. In California, Kaiser arbitrators are chosen by an office overseen by a 13-member board composed of Kaiser stakeholders and members of the public. The parties in a case choose an arbitrator from a large pool assembled by the office, but if they cannot agree on one, the office chooses. The arbitrators are usually retired judges.
In the Rushfords' case, Kaiser said it had asked State Superior Court in San Mateo County to pick the arbitrator. The Rushfords were not comfortable participating in the selection early on because they had no lawyer, according to Ms. Cannistraci.
Their arbitrator was a retired judge who had dealt with 13 other disputes involving Kaiser; in four of them, Kaiser used the same lawyer it used in the Rushfords' case.
In December 2001, the arbitrator ruled in favor of Kaiser. In his decision, he said that although the surgeon had breached the standard of care by twice failing to give Mr. Rushford enough blood-thinning medication, the Rushfords didn't prove that failure to do so resulted in the loss of Mr. Rushford's leg.
Ms. Cannistraci said the couple is challenging the decision, based in part on their contention that Kaiser doctors had engaged in false testimony by saying they had done tests that had not been performed.
Ms. Cannistraci said she had no complaints about how the judge handled the case. "But there's an inherent conflict of interest," she said. "These retired judges are making their living based on arbitrations, and they do repeat arbitrations on Kaiser cases. That's their bread and butter."
A 2000 report on managed care arbitration, compiled by the California Research Bureau, a state-financed public policy research group, found that none of the few arbitrators who awarded patients more than $1 million from April 1999 to March 2000 were selected by health care providers to serve again during that time.
Kaiser declined to comment on the specifics of the Rushfords' case. Matthew Schiffgens, a company spokesman, said: "We feel the arbitration process we have is fair, fast and efficient for resolving member disputes. We stand by the decision of the independent arbitrators, be they for or against the health plan."
ARBITRATION isn't cheap. The two parties generally split the cost of the arbitrator's time, whose rates are often several hundred dollars an hour. Mrs. Rushford estimates that she and her husband spent more than $200,000 making their case, which included hiring medical experts.
Critics say one troubling aspect of arbitration is its secrecy. Proceedings are often confidential. There is no public airing of issues or acknowledgment of error, and no development of case law or establishment of precedent. "Part of the value of the Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury is that the public sees the facts," said Jamie Court, executive director of the Foundation for Taxpayer and Consumer Rights. 
A hearing on the the Rushfords' challenge is scheduled for April 2 in the court in San Mateo. Under state law, if their petition is granted, the case would go to a different arbitrator, selected by the two parties. The Rushfords instead have asked for a jury trial, based on a previous case in which the California Supreme Court found that evidence of fraud during arbitration could constitute a waiver of the right to arbitrate.
The Rushfords say they won't give up. "It's something that Kaiser banks on, that you're not going to be able to afford to fight them," Mrs. Rushford said, adding that they are fortunate to have the financial means to pursue their fight. "Well, they picked the wrong person in this case."

HEADLINE: Trying to Sweeten a Bitter Pill By Getting More Severance Pay 

BYLINE:  By MARCI ALBOHER NUSBAUM 

 BODY:
YOUR company is cleaning house. Pink slips are flying like pollen in springtime, and you hear that one of them may be blowing your way. Is there anything you can do to extract added concessions when your supervisor delivers the bad news?
 In all likelihood, yes. As an employee, you may have more leverage than you think, even in this grim job market. Believe it or not, employers want to stay on your good side, because they know the time may be coming when they will want to have you back -- or at least, want you to speak well of them. 
 And believe it or not, the boss who is letting you go has feelings, too, and might even weaken if you come up with a compelling sob story. 
To be sure, the law does not generally require employers to give anything to people being let go unless there is an employment contract, says Philip M. Berkowitz, a partner at the law firm Seyfarth Shaw in New York who advises companies on employment matters. Typically, Mr. Berkowitz says, the legal obligation to pay severance or provide other benefits when employees are laid off comes from policies or procedures that an employer has voluntarily put into place.
Still, he says, an employer may respond to a situation of real need, like a medical condition for which you require extended health insurance coverage. "If you can show a particular hardship you could not have planned for, and if you're reasonable about it, most employers will at least consider whether there is a way to alleviate the problem," Mr. Berkowitz said. "The employer wants to have a trouble-free work force reduction. The more people who agree to go away quietly and sign releases the less the headache will be on everyone's part."
Vicky Oliver, a creative director who was laid off from the New York advertising agency DDB Needham three months before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, takes that advice one step further. Companies basically have a maximum dollar figure that they are willing to give in severance pay, she says. According to Ms. Oliver, if you negotiate hard, and make the case that your financial picture is dire, they are likely to let you have a bigger piece of the severance pie.
She recommends playing on your employer's heartstrings by describing the financial hardships you face, whether it is children to support, a life-threatening illness to treat or just the prospect of a long job search. Ms. Oliver, who has been doing research on workplace issues for a book she is writing about giving yourself a career makeover, says this approach really works.
You should do some research, too, she believes. Before she was laid off, she says, she took a look at the materials someone else in her company had received as part of an earlier downsizing. "I got a chance to see what the standard severance package was, and when it was delivered to me I went back and acted like I really needed more money, saying there were no jobs -- which turned out to be quite true," she said. "I even brought Kleenex with me. Tears work. In the end, I got more than the standard package."
Money is not the only thing on the table. Other benefits may be available, and according to experts, some things are easier for an employer to provide. Alexandra Duran, a New York-based career coach, says that outplacement services may be negotiable. "If you are offered the services of a large outplacement firm, you may be able to trade that benefit for the same amount of money applied to one-on-one counseling so that you don't get lost in the midst," she said.
She also suggests asking for a letter of reference, in writing, from a person in a position of authority. It is not enough for it to be beautifully written, she says; for maximum credibility, it should be filled with examples of your specific accomplishments. 
Richard Bayer, the chief operating officer of the Five O'Clock Club, an outplacement and career counseling firm in New York, says that even in the current economic environment, employees have some bargaining power. A company wants to maintain its good reputation, keep up morale, and most important, wants to be able to hire again when the market is good, he said, explaining that companies who mistreat employees on the way out risk losing all of those things, and can even suffer negative effects on their stock price.
His advice is to review your history with the company to see if you have done anything extraordinary, like relocating or contributing to a critical project. "You're looking for something that gives you a basis to say, 'I just want to be treated fairly,' " Mr. Bayer said.
The best way to survive a mass layoff is to avoid being on the dismissal list in the first place, of course, and there are strategies for that. Mr. Bayer suggests seeking assignments that make you more valuable to the company, for example.
The employees who tend to fare best in the face of a layoff are those who have planned for the possibility that their jobs will not last forever. Jonathan Levy, who was laid off in 2001 by Exodus Communications in Sunnyvale, Calif., an Internet data-center business, says the most important lesson he has learned is the value of having an employment contract with a negotiated severance provision. "If you don't have an agreement in place, you'll likely get the standard two weeks' notice and Cobra benefits," he said.
When Mr. Levy signed his contract, he said his primary responsibilities were to reorganize a department and to complete the construction of several Internet data sites which would help prepare the company for an eventual sale. Because of that, he says, it was important to him that the company would give him a choice of either receiving the remaining payments on his two-year contract or accelerating the vesting of his stock options in the event they terminated him at any time for reasons other than cause.
He says that the terms of such provisions should be carefully considered. For example, he says, a severance clause should be activated not only if you are terminated but if there is a change of control in the company that materially changes the nature of your job. He also suggests thinking of ways to get monetary value that are not connected to salary, like car payments, expenses for setting up a home office, or reimbursement for health care benefits.
While talking to a lawyer before beginning a job may be prudent, hiring one to put pressure on your employer on your way out may not be so wise.
"What a lot of employees do is come up with a claim that they've been a victim of discrimination because they feel they can put more pressure on an employer that way," said Mr. Berkowitz, the employment lawyer. "That's not what I'd recommend. If it's never been pursued before and comes out of left field, your employer won't want to establish the precedent of bowing to a frivolous claim."

HEADLINE: Mechanical Problem, Marketing Headache 

BYLINE:  By CHERYL JENSEN 

 BODY:
VOLKSWAGEN OF AMERICA is still struggling to mollify angry owners and nervous dealers over an ignition-coil problem that potentially affects more than half a million Volkswagen and Audi cars in the United States.
 The problem has been aggravated by Volkswagen's initial inability to replace all the coils on the cars instead of just the coils that failed. The affected cars have at least four coils, and some customers have had to return to their dealers three or four times -- sometimes waiting weeks for each coil replacement. The failure of a coil, which produces the high-voltage current that fires a spark plug, causes a loss of power. 
 As Volkswagen built up a supply of new coils, it changed the replacement policy, telling dealers to replace all coils on the second coil failure. Last week, the automaker told dealers they could replace all coils on the first coil failure, but only if the dealers had sufficient replacement coils in stock.
Dealers are receiving shipments of new coils weekly, said Steve Keyes, a spokesman for Volkswagen of America. If more coils fail than expected, dealers may not have enough new coils to replace all coils upon the first failure. If that happens, the customer could wait to bring in the car or could leave the car in the shop until the coils arrive, and the dealer will provide alternative transportation, Mr. Keyes said.
Ultimately, Volkswagen wants to replace all coils on potentially affected vehicles -- and may be able to do so by late May or early June, Mr. Keyes said. But the automaker must also keep enough coils for cars on the assembly line.
Based on the irate reactions of consumers to date, some dealers are expecting a decline in business.
"I think it hurts potential sales," said Fritz Hitchcock, owner of Puente Hills Volkswagen in City of Industry, Calif. "Repeat visits, even when they are paid for and handled properly, are not endearing."
Worried about the impact, Volkswagen's National Dealer Council asked the company to give current owners a $1,000 "loyalty coupon" for the future purchase of an Audi or Volkswagen. VW declined because of the cost.
"We are trying to take care of our customers by replacing their parts and making sure they have loaner cars," said Jennifer Cortez, a spokeswoman for Audi.
 EVEN without loyalty coupons, the price of replacing all the coils on the potentially affected cars in the United States could be $83 million, according to an analysis by Automotive News, an industry trade weekly.
Volkswagen and Audi have been consistently weak in customer satisfaction with dealer service, according to surveys by J. D. Power & Associates, a marketing research firm in Westlake Village, Calif.
Customers are complaining mainly about an inability to get quick service appointments, said Joe Ivers, executive director of J. D. Power's automotive quality and customer satisfaction research. He said the ignition-coil problem could make things worse. "The reason it matters, of course," Mr. Ivers said, "is that many customers will vote with their feet."

HEADLINE: Investing; 
Opportunitiesfor the Steely of Heart

BYLINE:  By CONRAD DE AENLLE 

 BODY:
VENTURE capitalists are regarded as smart money -- wealthy professional investors who earn outsized returns by committing their capital and management experience to fledgling companies, mainly in fields like technology, communications and health care, before they are sold to the public.
 Though venture capital, a relatively obscure group of assets, has not been immune to the impact of the bear market of the last few years, its losses have generally been relatively mild. And its long-term returns remain high. 
 The United States receives more venture-capital investment than any other country, but small investors interested in stepping in have to travel a roundabout route to do so. The market is dominated by institutions and wealthy individuals who have an entree through private banks or other advisers; for the most part, American mutual fund managers have passed it by. 
But 20 venture capital funds, with track records of at least a year, are listed on the London Stock Exchange. They are available through brokers who trade on the exchange. Some are also listed in the pink sheets, the American over-the-counter market for small, infrequently traded securities.
The funds invest mainly in companies in the United States and Europe. 
When their returns are expressed in dollars, the funds listed in London lost 7.6 percent, on average, in the year through Thursday, according to Standard & Poor's, and 9.7 percent, annualized, over three years. They had an average annualized gain of 4.4 percent over five years, and 17.5 percent over 10 years.
Such performance suggests to venture-capital bulls that the period since the bursting of the technology bubble has been an aberration -- and that it has resulted in a buying opportunity.
"The whole global venture-capital industry went through a period of explosive growth in the late 1990's and 2000 on the back of expectations of a reworking of the world," said Jonathan Russell, global head of transactions at the 3i Group, the largest publicly traded venture capital fund. "People shouldn't confuse that short-term period of market excess with the long-term view of investing in venture capital."
The fund's portfolio contains a mix of technology businesses, including OmniGuide Communications, a Cambridge, Mass., company that is developing optical transmission systems; Top Layer Networks, based in Westboro, Mass., a maker of software for detecting attacks on computer systems; and SiGe Semiconductor, a company in Ottawa that supplies integrated circuits for optical and wireless communication systems.
Excesses of the technology bubble may have been purged, but if a buying opportunity is near, it will require buyers. And there are few of those. Investment in venture capital has declined practically every quarter since early 2000.
VENTURE capital investors focus as much on the amount of money flowing through the market as they do on price movements. Many transactions involving embryonic businesses are made privately, but in boom times like the late 1990's, stock offerings increase, allowing a graceful, and often very profitable, way out for venture capitalists. Until the number of deals picks up noticeably and new sources of capital enter the market, pessimists warn, prices are likely to remain depressed.
"There has been an increase in activity, but I wouldn't call that a turnaround," said Kamal Tabet, head of the European financial entrepreneurs group at Citigroup in London, which seeks investors for small companies. "The stock market would have to come back so that many of these people are going to feel good about exiting their investments and making additional ones. A key reason for people not moving is that they don't see the exit."
Doug Wurth, who is in charge of alternative investments, including venture capital and hedge funds, for Europe at the J. P. Morgan Private Bank, said the dearth of buyers had made prices more attractive for the few who can take the plunge.
"With investors likely reeling from losses in their public portfolios," he said, "this may be the exact right time to purchase private equity opportunities at what are relatively very good values."
In difficult market conditions, buyers in venture capital often have a lopsided advantage, said Bill Blevins, managing director of Blevins Franks International, a large firm of financial advisers in London that caters to wealthy individual investors. "The investor has to a larger extent than usual been able to carve out a better deal than would conventionally be the case," he said, "as the recipient has few other financial choices when the markets and the economy have been is such bad shape."
Blevins Franks does little venture capital investment, though it occasionally plays matchmaker, linking clients with small companies that are looking for financing. For investors with modest bank balances, it is best to stick with a fund that spreads money among many smaller businesses, Mr. Blevins said.
Small investors interested in venture capital could do worse than to enter the market through the funds listed in London, said Paul Locke, who follows British closed-end funds for HSBC.
"Some have done quite well; they certainly have their fans, and I'm one of them," Mr. Locke said. He finds opportunity in the fact that many people disagree. Share prices for the funds are typically far below the intrinsic values of their portfolios, in extreme cases close to 40 percent, after having traded at premiums two or three years ago. So it is possible to buy a fund that has beaten the stock market consistently and pay barely more than 60 cents on the dollar.
MR. LOCKE explained that some venture-capital funds, including 3i, Candover, Dunedin Enterprise Investment Trust , Graphite Enterprise Trust and JZ Equity Partners, build their own portfolios. Others, like Schroder Ventures International Investment Trust, Pantheon International Participations and Standard Life European Private Equity Trust, are funds of funds, in which the managers invest not directly in companies but in broad venture capital portfolios, providing an additional layer of diversification.
Among the first group, Mr. Locke says he especially likes JZ. A strong performer in the past, it has fallen on hard times, losing 10.3 percent in dollars in the year ended Feb. 21, though that reflects a widening in the discount to 32 percent, near its highest ever.
The 3i fund, which always finds market demand because it is included in the benchmark FTSE-100 index, recently carried a 22 percent discount, which Mr. Locke called "quite attractive." Another fund that he says has a wide and "slightly overdone" discount is Mercury Grosvenor Trust.
A good fund of funds for investors interested in global diversification is Schroder Ventures, he said. It has risen 40.1 percent in the last year, the best performance in the sector. The fund "always seems to do a good job," Mr. Locke said.
"It has the liquidity to sit out these bumps, the discount is fair, and it has had pretty good performance lately," he added.
He suggested that the bumps would give way to a smooth ride over the long haul. "The enterprise culture is still there, and there are always people with good ideas," he said. "These funds are out of vogue and will remain so for at least another year, but when risk appetite comes back, these funds are going to come good again."

HEADLINE: At School Auctions, Prestige Is the Prize 

BYLINE:  By ALEX KUCZYNSKI 

 BODY:
ON any other school night, Tuttle Hall -- as the gymnasium of Grace Church School in Manhattan is known -- would have been dark, the children long ago dismissed and the thumping of their sneakers on the parquet a forgotten echo.
 But on the March weeknight the school held its "Caribbean Jump Up" party and benefit auction, the gym rocked with the calypso music of a steel band. School parents, do-rags on their heads, sipped rum drinks and danced barefoot in the sand (trucked in for the evening) beneath potted palms. 
 And then they began to spend their money, on items up for bid that included a vacation in the Tuscan countryside, donated by two school parents; two tickets to the Vanity Fair Oscar party, donated by Graydon Carter, also a parent; artwork by Barbara Kruger, donated by Geraldine Ferraro, a Grace Church School grandparent; and a chance to be an extra on "Law & Order," donated by a parent who is a television producer.
As the auctioneer spurred the crowd on, a few dutiful husbands clutched their plastic glasses of rum punch and stood guard over the more coveted items in the accompanying silent auction, ready to alert their wives if anyone wrote in a higher bid for the Tod's weekend bag or the Temple St. Clair Carr ring. 
At the end of the night, Grace Church School, a private day school for boys and girls from prekindergarten through eighth grade, had cleared a good chunk of change. Although the tally was not quite complete at week's end, "we're hoping to net $300,000," said George P. Davison, the school head.
It's spring auction season at private schools from coast to coast, a staple of the annual fund-raising drive that has assumed even greater importance at a time when endowments are stalled by the stock market plunge. More than a fund-raising tool, the school auction, as thousands of parents know, is an exquisitely calculated social occasion replete with opportunities to flaunt one's good fortune, feel the sting of humiliation and swell with self-satisfaction at belonging to such a select community.
Part pep rally and part cocktail party, the school auction -- mostly held at private schools but sometimes at parochial and public schools -- is effective even in a down market, because parents are typically lubricated with cocktails and then pitched dizzily into a battlefield where egos and normally hidden agendas can clash in the open. The bidding can drive Type A parents into a frenzy.
"It is at the very tippy-tippy-top levels, when the bidding starts and it gets moving, that at the best schools there is always a core group that buys the big items," said Victoria Goldman, a co-author of "The Manhattan Family Guide to Private Schools and Selective Public Schools" (Soho Press). "Of course, it is good for the school, but it's not exactly anonymous paddles. People look -- they know."
At past auctions at Grace Church School, parents have engaged in public bidding battles for items like a trip on the Orient Express.
"One year there were two very determined fathers battling over the class quilt," Mr. Davison said. "That can get sort of embarrassing."
And if parents can become aggressive participants in a "my wallet is bigger than yours" competition, the catalogs showing off the merchandise -- which are sent out in advance -- can also convey messages about status.
"The catalogs are meant to whet the appetite but also to showboat," said Sandra R. Bass, a private-school parent who is also the publisher of The Private School Insider, a newsletter. "Everybody sits and looks through the catalog and says: 'Oh my goodness, look what our parents have been able to put together. Look at how wonderful it is that we're at this school, with this group of very high-powered people.' "
Some parents construe the catalogs as not so subtle hints about other families' wealth or connections. In the list of items up for auction at Grace Church School, for instance, parents learned that one couple has houses on not one but two Greek islands, that another family has an art collection so vast and spectacular that it can afford to donate expensive pieces for auction and that yet another owns a famous restaurant.
The school auction, one Grace Church parent said, is a chance to feel . . . well, puny.
"You get to see where they have a country house, or whether they have a yacht, or whether they have access to famous people," said this parent, who spoke on the condition that his name not be used. "So of course you're going to feel like a jerk if you give something small."
Mr. Davison said that part of his school's dynamic is that it has students from every sector of the financial spectrum. No parent, he said, is meant to feel belittled by the size of his donation. "In order for a school to be economically diverse and an event to be successful at all levels," he said, "we need to have donations that go for $125 and for $12,000."
The fact that the only gifts listed as anonymous for the Grace Church School auction were the small ones -- things like "a pair of burgundy sheepskin slippers with gray curly lining in European size 27" and a bottle of Donna Karan Cashmere eau de cologne spray -- suggested to one parent that having one's name attached to such a donation was considered just too embarrassing. But a parent on the auction committee said that many items listed anonymously are actually examples of recycling -- "regifting," as she put it.
At the Calhoun School in Manhattan, which held its live auction on Wednesday, it was the reverse. The expensive items, like a trip to a private ski-resort chalet, were listed as having been given by "a Calhoun family." Smaller ticket items, like a tooth whitening by a "Calhoun parent/dentist," clearly stated the donor's name.
"Unfortunately, there is a lot of ego involved in who is giving this and who is giving that," said Jean C. Joachim, the author of "Beyond the Bake Sale: The Ultimate School Fund-Raising Book" (St. Martin's Press, 2003). Ms. Joachim, who ran an auction at Public School 87 on the Upper West Side for several years, said school auctions can be opportunities for embarrassment, especially among private-school parents -- "the Type AAA-plus personalities."
Listing donors' names alongside their gifts, she said, turns the auction into a competition that ultimately damages overall parental feelings of good will. Instead, she said, the catalog should separate the donors' names from their gifts, so that nothing is immediately associated with one family or one student.
"To be honest, I have never noticed any differentiation," Mr. Davison said. "Besides, I don't think that's the case."
For every parent who complains about feeling not rich enough and not cool enough, there is one who is positively, goofily exuberant.
At the City and Country School, a private school for prekindergarten through eighth grade students on West 13th Street, this year's auction, held last Sunday, raised about $120,000, said Becky Ann Baker, one of the parents on the organizing committee."It was a real bonding experience for the parents," she said. "To be honest, it was thrilling."
Erica Stearns, a parent who also worked on the City and Country auction, said the auction was fun, a social evening -- and she liked the 80's theme.
"After the live auction, we turned the music up, and it was like, whoa, 80's flashback!" she said. "I got dressed up -- Cyndi Lauper meets Madonna, fishnets and Doc Martens. We had a blast."
In the past decade private schools have been putting a lot of muscle into the benefit auctions. At the stratum of society from which they draw most of their students, there are more stay-at-home mothers with time to participate in the organizing drives, which take months. Parents are also concerned about showing their commitment to their children's schools at a time when some private kindergartens are turning hundreds of applicants away for each class.
But mostly, it's about the money.
Mr. Davison of Grace Church School said all the money raised by the auction goes to help financial-aid recipients. "We're not using this money to buy baseball uniforms, or fancy toys for our children," he said.
That is not the case at all schools. Generally, the bulk of the money raised is unrestricted, Ms. Bass said, "so they can do with it what they will."
Jamie Niven, the Sotheby's auctioneer, who has officiated at many private school auctions, said he has sold a Memorial Day weekend in a private home in Newport for about $4,000, Super Bowl tickets (several thousand dollars, he said) and dinner for four at Rao's ($2,800). Because the auctions are charitable, there are typically no reserve bids, or minimum prices that will be accepted.
Schools and parents especially like one-of-a-kind donations that have no measurable cash value, like a walk-on part in a television show, because of their favored tax treatment.
"The beauty of that is that if something has no cash value and you buy it at auction, everything you pay is tax-deductible," Mr. Davison said. So parents have an incentive to to bid high.
At the 92nd Street Y nursery school in Manhattan, celebrity parents like Michael J. Fox and Kevin Kline have in recent years donated such big-ticket items as a walk-on part in "Spin City" or a chance to have Mr. Kline recite postprandial sonnets to the winning bidder's dinner guests, a former 92nd Street Y parent said.
The Center for Early Education, a nursery and elementary school in West Hollywood, has auctioned off a meal for 16 cooked by Wolfgang Puck at the buyer's home and a round of golf with Michael Jordan. At the City and Country School, bidders could vie for a consultation with a Botox-dispensing dermatologist, the use of a villa in the Dominican Republic and tickets to a party held by Teen Vogue.
This year, perhaps the most talked-about item at any auction is one for the Riverdale Country School, which will hold its auction at Sotheby's in April: dinner with Alex Rodriguez, the star shortstop of the Texas Rangers, donated by Steven C. Witkoff, a real estate investor and parent.
Despite the pall over the economy, many school officials said they have not noticed that parents are any less willing to raise their auction paddles. Receipts are comparable with those in previous years.
But some describe a slight chill this season. One mother called it "the Grubman effect" -- a reference to Jack B. Grubman, the former Salomon Smith Barney analyst who boasted in e-mail messages that he had used his financial influence to get his children into the nursery school at the 92nd Street Y. She said that the example of Mr. Grubman, who has resigned from Salomon and has been barred from the securities industry for life, has become a cautionary tale among private-school parents, who see him as an Upper East Side Icarus whose ego outmatched his ambitions for his children.
This woman, whose daughter goes to the Nightingale-Bamford School in Manhattan, said she would attend this year's auction in May, but did not plan to hold up her paddle on any big-ticket items for fear of prompting other parents to think she was a financial braggart.
"We're definitely sitting on our hands during the auction," she said.
"It's not about not giving money this year. You have to do that. But it's about looking quieter about it."

HEADLINE: INVESTING WITH -- Robert W. Gadsden and Samuel A. Lieber; 
Alpine Realty Income and Growth Fund

BYLINE:  By CAROLE GOULD 

 BODY:
BARGAIN real estate is the focus of the $77 million Alpine Realty Income and Growth fund, which owns shares of real estate investment trusts, or REIT's, and of companies in the industry.
 "We want to buy real estate on Wall Street for discounts to what people pay on Main Street," said Samuel A. Lieber, the chief investment officer of the fund, in Manhattan. 
 But how they define bargains depends on the turning of the economic cycle, added Robert W. Gadsden, the fund's manager. Right now, he said, "we're looking for companies that are niche leaders in a specialized aspect of the real estate business, either by property type or business model." 
The fund returned 19.9 percent a year, on average, for the three years through Thursday, placing in the top 3 percent of real estate funds tracked by Morningstar Inc. The group returned 13.6 percent, annualized, compared with a 14.4 percent loss in the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
The fund returned 4.4 percent in the last 12 months, versus losses of 3.2 percent for its group and 27.3 percent for the S.& P. 
Mr. Gadsden is also the senior real estate analyst at Alpine Management and Research, the fund's investment adviser, while Mr. Lieber is chief executive of that firm. Mr. Lieber was the fund's original manager, beginning in 1998; Mr. Gadsden joined him as co-manager in September 1999 and became manager at the end of 2000.
In January 2003, Alpine merged with Saxon Woods Advisors, owned by Mr. Lieber's father, Stephen, to create Alpine Woods Investments, now the parent of both firms.
To pick the fund's 60 or so issues, Mr. Gadsden and Mr. Lieber make an economic forecast for the next year and evaluate how various real estate sectors might perform. They expect economic growth to accelerate later this year, Mr. Lieber said, but he added that "we're not sure that it will be strong enough to absorb the existing supply for the next couple of years."
Next, they review supply and demand in property markets around the country, looking at variables like existing capacity and job formation. "New jobs create demand for office space and industrial space," Mr. Gadsden said, "and, ultimately, homes and shopping centers."
The fund has a 28 percent stake in the retail sector, including regional malls and suburban shopping centers, versus 22 percent for its benchmark, the Morgan Stanley REIT index. "Consumer spending appears more resilient than corporate spending," Mr. Lieber said.
The fund has 10 percent of its assets in residential apartments, versus 20 percent for the index. "Landlords have had very high occupancy rates and pricing power, but lower interest rates make homebuying a more attractive alternative," Mr. Gadsden said.
In researching individual companies, the fund seeks annual returns on equity of at least 12 percent, growing dividends and manageable debt. Because real estate is so cyclical, Mr. Lieber said, experienced management is important.
"People who are great deal makers may do well in the growth part of the cycle but flounder when the cycle turns," he said. "We like all-weather management."
The fund recently added shares of the Chelsea Property Group, a REIT in Roseland, N.J., that owns, develops and manages outlet malls like Woodbury Common Premium Outlets in Central Valley, N.Y.
Chelsea Property dominates the outlet-mall niche of the market, Mr. Gadsden said. The fund began buying shares in January 1999 and has paid $27.76, on average, adjusted for stock splits, for the entire position; the shares now trade at $36.50.
The fund has also added shares of Alexandria Real Estate Equities, a REIT based in Pasadena, Calif., and a specialist in laboratory space. "They rent to companies to use for research and development," Mr. Gadsden said, "so their assets are where these companies want to be" -- markets like Boston, Washington and the San Francisco Bay area. The company also has the technical expertise to develop the infrastructure these companies need, he added.
The fund first bought shares in September 2000, and its average cost for the entire position has been $39.46. The stock now trades at $41.52.
Another holding is iStar Financial, formerly Starwood Financial, in New York, which finances commercial real estate. The company has expertise in complex financial transactions that give it a bigger profit margin than competitors who write typical mortgages, Mr. Gadsden said.
The fund started buying shares in November 1999 and has paid $27.15 a share, on average, for its position. The stock closed on Friday at $28.50.

Recent History Benefits A Preserver of Documents

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH KELLEHER 

 BODY:
IRON MOUNTAIN INC., which stores and shreds documents for other businesses, has benefited from recent corporate worries. It has found customers among managers who want to back up data in case of terrorist attacks and among executives who, at a time of heightened corporate scrutiny, want to make sure that records are maintained properly.
 C. Richard Reese, the chief executive of the company, which is based in Boston, said those factors helped it do well in 2002, "in the face of an economy that has gone to the dogs." Its shares have risen 17.8 percent in the last 12 months, versus a 27.7 percent decline in the Standard & Poor's 500 index. 
 Revenue from Iron Mountain's data protection unit, which copies computer data and stores it off site, grew 13 percent in 2002, a record. Mr. Reese attributed much of that to fears of executives who have sought to avoid a loss of corporate records like those destroyed in the attack on the World Trade Center.
While he expects slower growth in that unit in 2003, he said he anticipates a big increase in the paper-records management area, in part because of the impact of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, which established penalties for the untimely destruction of audit records. "Records management has moved from the back room to the boardroom," said John F. Kenny Jr., Iron Mountain's chief financial officer. Other legislation, safeguarding the privacy of medical and financial records, has also increased demand for secure storage and shredding of documents, the company said. 
Management of paper records accounts for 80 percent of Iron Mountain's overall revenue. The company tags and stores boxes holding 2,500 pages each on racks in warehouses around the country, retrieves files on request and shreds documents when they are no longer needed. It earns roughly $6 a year for storage of a box (usually 15 inches long, 12 inches wide and 10 inches high), which it typically keeps for 16 years. Existing customers tend to add to the boxes they store by 5 percent annually, according to Iron Mountain.
Marc Shapiro, an analyst at Awad Asset Management in New York, which manages mutual funds and private accounts that hold about 500,000 Iron Mountain shares, said he expects demand for the company's services to grow steadily. "This business doesn't depend on companies adding employees like the other business services do," he said. 
Andrew Steinerman, an analyst at Bear, Stearns in New York, said Iron Mountain is "a defensive growth company" and rates its shares "outperform."
The company has little competition, said Philip W. Ruedi, an analyst at T. Rowe Price in Baltimore, which owns eight million shares. Iron Mountain operates 650 records centers globally and controls one-third of the $3 billion American market for outsourced records management. Its nearest competitor -- Recall, a unit of Brambles Industries, an Australian conglomerate -- controls 4 percent. Iron Mountain's biggest competition is from businesses that decide to store their own records.
Iron Mountain merged in 2000 with Pierce Leahy Archives, then the second-largest records-management company, after making many other acquisitions. Mr. Kenny, the chief financial officer, said that the company was no longer making large acquisitions and that it would invest in digital archiving services to preserve corporate e-mail messages and to back up computer systems.
Some critics say the company's shares are overvalued. David W. Tice, whose firm manages the Prudent Bear mutual fund, shorts the stock, betting on a decline in its price. "This is an economically sensitive business that has acquisitions no longer making up the major part of its growth rate," he said. Mr. Tice said its debt -- about $1.7 billion at the end of 2002 -- is excessive. 
Kevin Ferguson, the portfolio manager of the Lord Abbett Growth Opportunities fund, which invests in Iron Mountain, said: "The company has taken on a lot of debt over the years, but is going free-cash-flow positive. That is a major catalyst to improve valuation." He said that as Iron Mountain paid down debt, investors would face less risk in owning shares. 
Last year, Iron Mountain attained positive cash flow ($57 million) and turned a profit ($58.3 million) for the first time since going public in 1996. Analysts have closely monitored the company's cash flow as an indicator of its business strength. "We think cash flow could double in '03 and double again in '04," Mr. Steinerman of Bear, Stearns said.
Some analysts focus on the ratio of the company's enterprise value, or its market capitalization plus debt, to Ebitda, its earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. The ratio historically is between 8.1 and 14.4 and is now at 11.3. Mr. Shapiro of Awad Asset Management said he expected the ratio to rise, lifting the share price. He has a 12-month target price of $42 on the stock, which closed on Friday at $35.68. 
Todd Krieg, a senior portfolio manager at U.S. Bancorp Asset Management, said that while the company's revenue has grown every quarter for 20 years and the stock has outperformed the S.& P. 500 since 1996, "the outlook is actually getting better." Mr. Krieg said that Geico, an insurance company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett's conglomerate, bought eight million shares of Iron Mountain in 2002. Mr. Buffett, he said, "has a good batting average on the long side." 
Mr. Ruedi said T. Rowe Price has held Iron Mountain shares for many years. Because the company is generating free cash flow and because scandals have focused corporate America's attention on records management, he said he believes that for Iron Mountain, "the party is just beginning."

HEADLINE: A Sputtering VW Aims Higher 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER

DATELINE: FRANKFURT 

 BODY:
JENS NEUMANN knows how quickly a car company can total its image. He was the chief lawyer for Audi, the sporty German manufacturer, in the mid-1980's, when owners of the Audi 5000 began reporting that their cars sometimes accelerated without warning, with deadly consequences for those unlucky enough to be in the vehicle's path.
 Audi's owner, Volkswagen, blamed drivers for confusing the brake and accelerator pedals. That claim was later backed up by an American government study, but the clumsy, insensitive manner in which Volkswagen handled the episode alienated nearly a generation of car buyers. 
 Last month, Mr. Neumann, 57, found himself back in the soup -- scrambling to prevent a relatively minor technical defect from ballooning into a major public relations blunder for Volkswagen. 
This time, it was faulty ignition coils in the engines of many Volkswagen and Audi models produced in 2001, 2002 and early this year. The complaint about Volkswagen was much the same: that it refused to acknowledge a problem until clubbed into it by irate customers and embarrassing news reports.
"I know what it is like to lose the confidence of customers," said Mr. Neumann, who now oversees strategy and North American operations for Volkswagen. "We won't let that happen again."
Mr. Neumann said that by midyear, Volkswagen would have enough new coils to replace those in any car potentially affected by the problem. In the meantime, Volkswagen of America has written to the owners of about 530,000 cars, offering to replace any defective coils.
For Volkswagen, Europe's largest carmaker, it was a tough start to what promises to be a brutal year. Last week, Volkswagen issued a profit warning that caught some analysts by surprise -- less for its timing, given the well-publicized troubles in the company's home market, than for the depth of its gloom.
"Due to profound changes and considerable uncertainty in the economic and political framework," the chief executive, Bernd Pischetsrieder, said, Volkswagen's first-quarter profit will be significantly lower than that of last year. Full-year profit is also likely to fall short of that for 2002.
To some extent, Volkswagen is simply reflecting the malaise in the global auto industry. From the economic shocks in Brazil and Argentina to the stagnation in Germany to the worldwide fear of war in Iraq, there are few places on the map that an auto executive can look for comfort.
Volkswagen, however, has problems all its own, ranging from an aging product lineup to its vulnerability to the rising euro, which increases the prices of its cars overseas. It is also embarking on a bold, risky and expensive campaign to lift its proletarian brand name -- Volkswagen translates as the "people's car" -- into the luxury market.
At the very moment that consumers are squeamish about spending, Volkswagen is rolling out a $40,000 sport utility vehicle, the Touareg, and a majestic sedan, the Phaeton, which starts in Europe at $55,000 and is likely to sell in the United States at $60,000 to $75,000.
With dreams of challenging Mercedes-Benz and BMW, the last thing VW needs is the ignition-coil problem, even if it is unrelated to safety. The trouble is, Volkswagen faces a growing perception on both sides of the Atlantic that its once-vaunted quality standards have slipped.
While American drivers have been fuming about faulty ignition coils, which cause their engines to lose power, the drivers of some Volkswagen subcompacts in Europe have had a problem in which ice blocks an engine hose, causing breakdowns.
Volkswagen now has only one model, the Passat, on the recommended list put out by Consumer Reports. That compares with three last year. It finished below the industry average in a satisfaction survey of German consumers conducted last fall by J. D. Power & Associates, the research firm.
"If you read consumer surveys and reports, Volkswagen's quality and reliability is consistently lower than the public's perception of it," said a senior executive at General Motors, which makes Opels in Germany and Saabs in Sweden.
Volkswagen's outsized reputation may irk competitors like G.M., but perception is a double-edged sword. It took Audi 13 years to rebuild its sales in the United States after the sudden-acceleration fiasco, even though the government exonerated the company in its 1989 study.
THE recent reliability problems, and Volkswagen's balky response, could have a disproportionate effect on how it is perceived in the United States. Some owners whose cars had the failed ignition coils -- requiring several trips to dealers -- said they would not buy another Volkswagen.
"Volkswagen did nothing proactive in terms of communication to their customers about this failure," said Pat Navin of Evanston, Ill., whose 2002 Passat station wagon lost power after two of the four coils on the 1.8T four-cylinder engine had failed. The car had just 3,100 miles on the odometer. "It's the head-in-the-sand mentality, in this highly competitive marketplace, that is hard to fathom," Mr. Navin said.
Mr. Neumann disputes that Volkswagen dragged its heels in responding. He said the company would have been wrong to tell customers about a problem before it had enough parts on hand to fix the problem. Volkswagen has scrambled to ramp up production of coils and has lined up a second supplier.
"There are no miracles in the world that it suddenly rains ignition coils from the sky," Mr. Neumann said in the slightly weary tone of a man accustomed to handling indignant dealers and customers.
In hindsight, he acknowledged, Volkswagen should have tipped off customers about the problem rather than letting them read about it in the newspaper. Volkswagen officials first heard reports of defective coils in October, but Mr. Neumann said the company needed time to pinpoint the problem's source. "Somehow, the breaking news and our preparedness to communicate went in the wrong sequence," he said.
As for the broader doubts about Volkswagen's quality, Mr. Neumann said its standards were more rigorous than ever. He noted that Mr. Pischetsrieder, who last year succeeded Ferdinand Piech as chief executive, oversaw quality control before taking the helm. Before that, he was the chief executive of BMW, the top-rated German carmaker in the J. D. Power survey. 
Mr. Piech, now the chairman of Volkswagen's supervisory board, still casts a long shadow over the company. A passionate engineer who turned around Volkswagen in the 1990's with hit cars like the New Beetle, he also masterminded the company's risky foray into the luxury market. He pushed the Phaeton project, building a spectacular glass-encased factory in Dresden to assemble the cars, and bought two rarefied Italian sports-car makers, Lamborghini and Bugatti. Volkswagen also owns Bentley, maker of the stately English motor car that is used by Queen Elizabeth.
 MR. PIECH'S dream, loyally articulated by longtime deputies like Mr. Neumann, is for Volkswagen to compete in virtually every segment of the automobile market. It now covers 75 percent of the segments.
Mr. Neumann said the rate of failure of Volkswagen's components had declined in recent years. But because the company uses the same parts in more models, one defect can have a ripple effect. The ignition coils turned up in six VW and Audi models, from the Golf to the Audi A6.
While the problems were most acute in North America because of the size and type of engines affected, they popped up across Europe and even in China, affecting more than 800,000 vehicles in all.
How does Volkswagen explain the spate of poor ratings? Mr. Neumann said the staff of Consumer Reports tested cars randomly bought from dealers. He said some of these might be "Monday cars," a term that refers to cars that might have been built by workers nursing post-weekend hangovers. Mr. Neumann said Volkswagen's actual quality was probably never as high as its peak level in the surveys nor as low as the latest results would suggest. "I don't want to play down quality issues; we have quality issues," he said. "But I want to say that we've addressed them properly."
Preserving Volkswagen's reputation for solid German engineering is crucial for the company, which has used that reputation to build an extraordinarily successful market in the United States during the last decade.
Volkswagen sold 338,000 cars in America in 2002, a sevenfold increase from 1993. Its midsize Jetta is the most popular European car in the United States -- almost as many Jettas were sold in the country last year as the entire annual volume of Mercedes or BMW.
The car that may most symbolize the deep, even sentimental ties that Volkswagen has forged in the American market is the New Beetle; the company has sold more than 400,000 in the United States since introducing the car in 1998. In some ways, however, the car is also emblematic of the company's woes: Last year, VW scaled back production of the New Beetle, which depends heavily on American buyers, by 18.5 percent.
"The fun factor is somehow gone because the mood of people has changed," Mr. Neumann said. "We need more smiles in this world." To do that, Volkswagen has rolled out a convertible New Beetle.
Volkswagen, based in Wolfsburg, an industrial city northeast of Frankfurt, also hopes to expand into the thriving market for upscale S.U.V.'s. The Touareg, which will start at $34,000 with a six-cylinder engine and $40,500 with an eight-cylinder engine, has won enthusiastic notices from the automotive news media.
Dealers, who had been yearning for an S.U.V. to compete with those of other German and Japanese manufacturers, are excited about the Touareg. "We've got a home run here," said Gene Langan, who runs VW dealerships in Glastonbury and Meriden, Conn. "It puts us right where we should be, against BMW, Lexus, Acura and Mercedes."
Mr. Langan is more reticent about the Phaeton, which is scheduled to arrive in the United States at year-end. Available in Europe with various engines, among them a 12-cylinder monster, the car can cost more than $100,000 and is designed to compete with the most deluxe Mercedes and BMW sedans. The German chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, a former Volkswagen board member, uses one as his state limousine.
The trouble is, Volkswagen produced only 3,403 Phaetons last year. Some dealers question whether the company, in aiming at the pinnacle of the market, is stretching its utilitarian brand too far. "We don't have customers who would buy the Phaeton," said Rudy Koch, a dealer in Oberursel, a Frankfurt suburb. "It will take time for people to accept that Volkswagen also sells high-class cars."
 FOR Mr. Koch, the smaller VW's -- the Golf and its even littler European cousins, the Polo and the Lupo -- are the bread and butter of his business. He is wringing his hands because Volkswagen is phasing out the current Golf later this year in favor of a redesigned model. While the new Golf should draw interest, he is discounting aggressively to sell out his existing inventory.
Volkswagen plans to redesign the Passat next year, which could cause another lull in sales as people wait for the new model. These cars will not be introduced in the United States until June 2004 at the earliest.
In the meantime, Volkswagen is vulnerable to the vagaries of the market, not least in its home country. It introduced a compact minivan, the Touran, at the Geneva International Motor Show this month, which it hopes will appeal to Europeans. But overall sales in Germany dropped 4.7 percent in 2002. With the German economy adrift, few analysts expect a rebound this year.
"Consumers, especially in Germany, are just not showing up," said Thomas Aney, an analyst at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein.
Even China is proving to be a mixed blessing. Volkswagen staked its claim there early, and its Santana, a stripped-down version of the Passat, is a common sight in Beijing.
Sales in China rose 42.8 percent in 2002, vaulting it ahead of the United States as Volkswagen's second-largest market. But Volkswagen's share fell to 38.5 percent from 50 percent, as G.M. and others have begun vying for what will be the world's largest automobile market.
Mr. Aney said he believed that Volkswagen's long-term prospects were strong. But shareholders abandoned the company in droves after its profit warning last week. Part of the problem was that Volkswagen did not say much, beyond a general prediction that things would be worse before they were better.
That uncertainty was palpable at the Geneva motor show, where Mr. Neumann found it easier to discuss how Volkswagen planned to replace broken ignition coils than how many cars it hoped to sell.
"If you tell me when the Iraqi war will start," Mr. Neumann said, with a tone of exasperation, "when it will be over, what the business environment will be, I can tell you what my prognosis will be."

HEADLINE: For Far Smaller Fuel Cells, aFar Shorter Wait 

BYLINE:  By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
AMERICANS may have to wait 20 years, if not longer, for cars powered by fuel cells to become a familiar sight. But much smaller forms of fuel cell technology may well power electronic devices like laptop computers, video cameras and cellphones by the end of this decade. 
 Prototypes of long-lasting fuel cells that can replace batteries are being tested in laboratories in the United States and overseas. "Every big electronics company in the world is working on fuel cells in one way or another," said Jerry Hallmark, manager of Motorola's Energy Technology Lab in Phoenix. Some, like Intel, are going a step further and investing millions of dollars in start-up companies like PolyFuel and Neah Power Systems to accelerate development. 
 "There are some applications that are getting very close to commercialization," said Mike Lynn, head of a unit at the 3M Company thatmakes fuel cell components. 
Mr. Lynn declined to be more specific, but many analysts expect fuel cells for consumer electronic devices to begin appearing next year in Japan. The betting is that the first to reach the market will be Toshiba, which is demonstrating a prototype of a methanol-powered cell this week at a trade show in Hanover, Germany. Toshiba says the cell could be sold next year with laptops.
Some 200 million to 500 million of the small cells, sometimes called microcells, might be sold annually by 2011, according to Allied Business Intelligence, a market research company in Oyster Bay, N.Y., that tracks new technology. Annual revenue to the fuel cell companies could be as much as $5 billion, said Atakan Ozbek, Allied's director of energy research.
But Mr. Ozbek and others said that despite the momentum of research and development, widespread microcell commercialization is not yet a sure thing.
"People underestimate the complexity of the system, and start-up companies have been cavalier about the availability of all the components they will need," said Dr. Brian M. Barnett, director of the electromechanical systems practice at Tiax, a technology consulting and development company based in Cambridge, Mass.
Like the fuel cells for cars promoted by President Bush and the even larger units being developed to provide electric power to factories and homes, most microcells generate electricity by chemically stripping hydrogen of its electrons. The electrons form a current running outside the cell while the positively charged ions left behind move through the cell. The ions and the electrons are recombined in a reaction with oxygen to form water, the only byproduct if pure hydrogen is used. 
The basic concept for fuel cells was discovered in 1839, but researchers differ on the most practical way to design them to generate the most energy in the least space. 
Fuel cells run most efficiently on pure hydrogen, but storing hydrogen compactly and safely is a huge hurdle. Many designers of large and small fuel cell systems are trying to get hydrogen from solid compounds that contain hydrogen or hydrocarbon fuels like methanol and ethanol, even though those fuels add other elements like carbon dioxide to the waste stream. 
MICROCELLS have several economic advantages over their bigger cousins in the race to commercialization. Energy experts expect to cut the smaller cells' production costs to be competitive with those of batteries long before larger cells can be manufactured at anything close to the cost of internal combustion engines. 
It should also be easier and less expensive to persuade retailers to sell fuel cells the size of battery packs than to transform the huge national infrastructure of gasoline stations. 
But the biggest reason the smaller cells are expected to become popular sooner is their appeal as a convenience -- something that consumers have shown a willingness to pay for -- and not as an answer to energy and environmental problems. 
Fuel cells that last far longer than do rechargeable batteries would free laptop computer users and television camera crews, for example, from the need to lug heavy and expensive backup battery packs. For similar reasons, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency and other military research groups have been investing in research on small fuel cells for more than a decade.
Fuel cells also offer the promise of "hot swapping," the ability to switch to a fresh power source without turning off a computer or phone. The user would simply add a new fuel cartridge to the cell before the reservoir ran dry.
"Half the interest in fuel cells is out of frustration with batteries," Dr. Barnett said. 
Fuel cells for consumer electronics cannot come too soon for many product designers. Battery researchers have managed to double the capacity of lithium ion batteries in the last 10 years, making them the best-performing power source for mobile consumer electronic devices.
But sophisticated color displays, wireless access to the Internet, multiplayer games on cellphones and tablet computers for note-taking all demand more power than earlier generations of electronic devices. For these new products, consumers want power sources that last days or weeks instead of hours.
Batteries are likely to continue to improve slowly as researchers overcome drawbacks and develop new materials, like supercapacitors that store enough energy to allow the user of a hand-held device to quickly replace a dead battery without losing power. But the advantages of fuel cells will be hard to beat in the long run, according to energy experts.
Consider the number of hours that a kilogram of fuel can deliver a watt of power, one common benchmark in the portable-power industry. A kilogram of pure hydrogen can deliver one watt of power for 38,000 hours under ideal conditions. Methanol, a widely available fuel from which hydrogen is extracted in many fuel cells, delivers the watt for 6,000 hours. A fully charged lithium ion battery will do the job for just 150 hours.
Most consumer electronics products draw more than one watt of power. Laptops, for example, draw up to 20 watts, which is why batteries are often drained within a few hours. Travelers often need access to a recharging source (and plenty of time) or backup batteries, which can cost $100 or more for a laptop.
The cost of battery power for electronic devices is also high enough to entice businesses to invest in micro-cell development. Rechargeable-battery power costs roughly $3,000 for each kilowatt of power. By contrast, the fuel to power internal combustion engines costs roughly $50 a kilowatt. The fact that consumers already pay high prices for battery power is a central reason why many start-up fuel cell companies regard microcells as a quicker path to profits.
 FOR all that, however, completing the last few steps to commercialization of microcells is still a big challenge. Some analysts wonder whether fuel cells might not turn out to be useful for only a few specialty applications.
"It's still an open question whether they will ever achieve practical value," said Dr. Jason Howard, head of the energy technologies team at Motorola's Energy Systems group. 
The fuel cell's biggest shortcoming is that, unlike the battery, it cannot deliver large bursts of power, according to Dr. Howard. 
Many fuel cell companies are coming around to the view of energy experts at potential customers like Motorola and Nokia that the first application for small cells may be as backups to batteries. Fuel cells could both recharge a cellphone and keep it working when a battery is drained. Alternatively, consumers could use the batteries only for spikes in power demand -- when a laptop is turned on, for example, or when a cellphone call is placed -- thus extending battery life.
In fact, using fuel cells with batteries makes enough sense that James D. Balcom, president and chief executive of PolyFuel, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., expects almost all applications to be such hybrids. "Fuel cells and batteries were made for each other," Mr. Balcom said.
But even getting that far posestechnological problems because of the complexity of complete fuel cell systems. The basic hydrogen processing requires catalysts like platinum to speed up reactions and specialized membranes to separate the fuel. Then, there are tiny pumps and valves for moving air and liquids to where they are needed, components to collect and channel the electricity and methods for handling the reaction byproducts.
Typically, it takes a stack of fuel cells, rather than a single cell, to deliver the needed power. And so far, designers have been unable to make fuel cells operate as well as batteries across a range of temperature.
Other hurdles loom. Consumers are accustomed to looking for double-A, C or D batteries. But no comparable standards exist for the cartridges containing pure hydrogen, methanol or other fuel that users would pop into their fuel cell systems. 
No one in the business expects widespread use of the cells until sizes are standardized, and no such efforts are under way.
Safety also remains an issue. The various fuels used are flammable, which is why they are prohibited on aircraft. PolyFuel has clearance from the Transportation Department for a prototype that dilutes the methanol in its cell by mixing it with water to be carried on aircraft, but other fuel cell designs have not yet been approved. PolyFuel itself would have to go back to federal regulators if it increased the percentage of methanol in its fuel cell design to improve performance. 
The industry will also need to develop fuel cell cartridges that cannot be easily broken. Most analysts, though, expect fuel cells to be approved eventually for air travel. 
In the meantime, some fuel cell designers are concentrating on niche markets that would not face regulatory tangles. MTI MicroFuel Cells, an Albany-based subsidiary of Mechanical Technology, recently signed an agreement to develop systems for Intermec, a leading supplier of mobile devices used to record inventory data in warehouses. And Jadoo Power Systems, based in Folsom, Calif., has delivered its first prototype fuel cell systems to a federal agency for use with video surveillance cameras; Jadoo declined to name the agency. 
Jadoo expects to begin supplying similar systems, which are slightly larger than those used in consumer electronics, to local television news crews for use in video cameras later this year, according to Larry Bawden, the company's president and chief executive.
THIS is a market in desperate need of reliable, long-lasting power," said a senior executive at a company that supplies video crews to television stations. "It's a $50 million to $100 million market that's going to adopt it very rapidly if Jadoo can produce it," said the executive, who did not want to be identified because negotiations with Jadoo are in progress.
Selling to specific industries or the government also reduces the pressure to immediately develop ways to distribute fuel to consumers. In the long run, the major battery companies and companies like Bic, with long experience in distributing lighters, are the most likely candidates to bring the fuel cartridges to the consumer market.
A new realism about the final hurdles may be the best indicator that the cells really are moving closer to market. Mr. Ozbek of Allied Business said he has had to push his projection for when annual sales of microcells will hit 200 million units to 2011 -- three years later than last year's projections.

HEADLINE: Reinventing Tommy: More Surf,Less Logo 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON

 BODY:
ON the glossy pages of magazines, young men and women frolic on a beach, wearing unlogoed T-shirts and short shorts, their aura that of sun and surfboards. In their relaxed, vaguely privileged demeanor, this photogenic crowd presents an undeniable contrast to the urban image of the same brand a decade ago, when the models wore their hair in dreadlocks and swaggered down the street, bold and cool, with a big "Tommy Hilfiger" on their oversize sweats.
 Now the dreadlocks are gone from the advertisements -- and the big red, white and blue "Tommys" are pretty much gone from the streets. The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation has announced that it is moving away from its logo after many of the company's earlier urban constituencies abandoned Tommy for designers they call more "authentic": Fubu, Ecko, Phat Farm, J. Lo and Sean John. 
 "Tommy, Polo Jeans and Nautica are big losers." said Todd D. Slater, an analyst at Lazard. "But the biggest loser is Tommy; he's lost the most market share. Ralph has not lost his core customer the way Tommy has," he said, referring to Polo Ralph Lauren. 
"As a company," he added, "Tommy has to reinvent itself."
Many analysts, investment bankers and other industry watchers say the company is struggling to find new direction; they see its latest advertising campaign and the bus trip company officials are making to winter vacation spots this week -- a Florida beach tour complete with amateur model contests -- as only the latest signs of desperation. The company's stock has plummeted from its May 1999 high of $41.06; it closed on Friday at $5.73, near its all-time low.
The company is now closing 37 out of 44 Tommy Hilfiger specialty shops in the United States -- some of which were opened with great fanfare only months before. For the three months ended on Dec. 31, the company lost $22.1 million on sales of $477.3 million.
And while its sales of women's and children's clothes were up from a year earlier, men's wear, echoing a national trend, was down 11.7 percent. And the company's jeans business, once a mainstay, has fallen off precipitously, analysts say. Joel J. Horowitz, the company's chief executive, last month lowered earnings projections for 2004.
Recent management changes at the company illustrate the term "revolving door." Mr. Hilfiger himself assumed the job as chairman in October, but quit last month to reclaim his longtime title as honorary chairman. He remained the principal designer. Mr. Horowitz, who said earlier that he had wanted to wind down his day-to-day responsibilities in 2004, assumed the additional duties of chairman; he said he has been interviewing candidates to succeed him as chief executive. Lawrence S. Stroll resigned as co-chairman last July, leaving Silas K. F. Chou, the other co-chairman, in the post. Then he left, and Mr. Hilfiger took over.
"Maybe a new C.E.O., maybesome new ideas will help, but I view the Tommy business as essentially mature," said Margaret Mager, an analyst at Goldman, Sachs and the author of several reports on the company. "I don't think it's going to come back. The froth is off the cappuccino, and it's not going to get frothy again."
 MANY clothing companies have trouble appealing to fickle teenage customers, but Hilfiger has additional problems. It does much of its business in department stores -- Ms. Mager estimated 50 to 60 percent of the company's business. And department stores themselves, as everyone knows, are in trouble. In a rush to separate itself from the other mainstream stores, Bloomingdale's -- known as a longtime loyal customer for Tommy Hilfiger's goods -- has cut back its Hilfiger men's boutiques to one from 23. Bloomingdale's has also reduced its Tommy Hilfiger women's boutiques, to 9 from 23, looking to bring in clothes that consumers find more distinctive.
"Tommy Hilfiger has been a great partner to Bloomingdale's for many years," said Anne Keating, a spokeswoman for the chain, "but we have to differentiate ourselves from other department stores." In a weak retail atmosphere, Bloomingdale's, like other chains, has been seeking fashions that it can call its own.
The Tommy Hilfiger Corporation, based in Hong Kong, declined to make Mr. Hilfiger or other senior executives available for interviews. It referred a reporter to its taped conference calls with securities analysts. During the call in early February, Mr. Horowitz, while announcing that he had lowered earnings estimates for fiscal 2004, which begins on April 1, said the company was still strong, especially in Europe. 
In fiscal 2002, European sales were 10 percent of the company's business; in fiscal 2003, they were expected to have grown to 15 percent and in 2004, to 25 percent. Germany, despite its economic stagnation, is considered a particularly vibrant market for Hilfiger, followed by Spain. The company owns 18 stores in Europe; 56 are owned by franchisees. Of the 74 European stores, 17 are outlets.
The company's chief executive, Mr. Horowitz, also said Tommy Hilfiger Woman -- the division for its plus-size clothing -- was doing well: last year, its clothes were stocked in 300 stores. Now there are 700. Mr. Horowitz also reported a 14.7 percent increase of sales of children's wear, to $70.6 million, and said the outlet business -- which accounts for 10 to 15 percent of the company's sales -- remained strong. Yet he said that primarily because of the increasing number of markdowns and bargain sales, the business outlook was uncertain. Sales of junior sizes, mostly worn by teenagers, had softened; industry analysts said they had declined considerably. And the men's business suffered, "only partially offset by growth in Europe," Mr. Horowitz said. 
He told analysts that besides diminishing the number of logos, the company was trying to come up with fresh styles. The denim business, he said, is now dominated in the department stores by what he called the urban brands. Because those brands are now as successful in using their own logos -- much as Tommy Hilfiger was in the past -- Mr. Horowitz said his company now "needs to be more fashion-right with the denim details that we put forth through fabric or sophisticated washes, and compete more on the product side versus the logo side. 
"It's more about going away from logo than changing the demographic of who we think that consumer is," he said. "We have always said that jeans are for teens, and that's our focus customer."
NEVERTHELESS, analysts and others in the retail industry wonder why the company's advertising campaign has swung so far away from the urban look.
"Now it's Robert Redford," said one fashion designer, who knows the brand well. "Why would he try to go back to being Ralph Lauren -- when that market is already saturated?"
A huge billboard for Tommy Jeans, high above the West Side Highway in Manhattan, shows a preppy bunch of young adults, standing in what appears to be a beach hut with the ocean behind it. The other side of the billboard was described by a competitor as "Pacific Sunwear meets Ralph Lauren meets 'From Here to Eternity,' " and shows a man on a sandy beach with a drenched blue shirt embracing a woman as the waves roll in.
A stylized American flag, once prominent in Mr. Hilfiger's designs, is no longer emblazoned on the clothes. 
"The inspiration for the spring lines comes from Tommy's own interest in Mustique," said Caren Bell, a spokeswoman for the company, referring to the Caribbean island where Mick Jagger has a house and where Princess Margaret vacationed for many years. Mr. Hilfiger "has a house down there, and the whole spring line is influenced by Mustique," she added. (The fall line is influenced by the Beatles and the swinging 60's.)
Ms. Bell, asked why the images of the new campaign have changed so much, said that the company's advertising "is always evolving and changing," and that "the images speak to where the clothing is right now: slightly more sophisticated, slightly sexy."
While the company is altering its image, it also is focusing on fundamentals.
During the Feb. 5 conference call on its earnings, Mr. Horowitz said the company was debating how to use its substantial cash on hand -- $485.6 million at the end of 2002, when its long-term debt was $513.4 million. In the conference call, one analyst suggested that the company might be better off spending part of the money to buy back some of the stock, showing confidence in itself.
Mr. Horowitz replied that the uses of cash had been discussed by the board, which had decided unanimously to maintain "a very healthy balance sheet." 
"We know that the stock is a very attractive stock," he said. "However, with all the uncertainties that are going on today, we don't feel that's the best use of cash for long-term shareholder value."
Mr. Horowitz pointed out that the company did repay $4.4 million of its debt in the final three months of 2002. But he said that the company was looking at a number of priorities. The first is consolidating operations. "Second is to continue to pay down debt," he said, and third is to consider opportunities that can diversify our revenue base." 
Most analysts said they assumed that meant buying some other companies that have more growth potential than the Tommy brand. (Ms. Bell, the spokeswoman, said she had no comment on whether the company was interested in acquiring others or if it was on the market.)
Marvin S. Traub, the former chairman of Bloomingdale's and the chairman of Financo Global Consulting, said that he thought the company was in better shape than most people realized.
"Everyone is jumping up and down, implying that Tommy's in big trouble," he said. "But look at the financials: Tommy once had a very profitable business -- he was one of the first to build such an enormous business in the department stores. Now his stock is incredibly depressed because people are concerned about where the company is heading."
Nevertheless, the brand is still selling, Mr. Traub said, "and earnings are almost the same as they were a year ago." 
"It's nota disaster, although it certainly has leveled off," he said.
Mr. Traub said he disagrees with people who say the company has run out of steam. "He may have lost his ethnic business," he said, "but the company is still strong." Still, he added, "it would be healthy for him to take a fresh look at the business."
With annual sales of nearly $1.9 billion, Tommy Hilfiger is bigger than Donna Karan International, and close to Polo Ralph Lauren. 
And Mr. Hilfiger is still one of the highest-paid fashion executives in the world. Last year, he made $27.9 million in total compensation; Mr. Lauren received nearly $8 million.
Other apparel stocks have had problems, too. After Ms. Karan's company went public in 1996, its stock plummeted and the company was later sold to LVMH Moet Hennessey Louis Vuitton, the French luxury goods conglomerate. Polo Ralph Lauren's stock fell from a high of $33 in June 1997 to a low of $12.75 in May 2000, though it has since rebounded to $20.63.
 MANAGEMENT'S view of the future is mixed. Although the children's wear business has improved, and women's clothes have continued to be consistently strong, Mr. Horowitz is not being particularly optimistic. 
"Based upon current negative trends in apparel spending, we believe it is unrealistic to expect improvement in sales and earnings in the upcoming year, and we are planning both the wholesale and retail businesses accordingly," he said.
For the year beginning April 1, Mr. Horowitz predicted that revenue would fall by "mid- to high single digits percentage range" from the current fiscal year. Retail sales are expected to grow 5 to 10 percent, driven partly by the stores opening in Europe and elsewhere abroad. But Mr. Horowitz predicted that wholesale revenue would fall -- 5 to 10 percent for men's and women's and 20 to 25 percent for children's, where the company plans to abandon some of its worst-performing markets. 
Altogether, the company plans to withdraw its clothing from several hundred stores, largely in the United States, that are not producing enough revenue and may be further diluting an already diluted brand name.
But the biggest question for the company has to do with acquisitions. Is Tommy Hilfiger for sale? Or is it looking to buy other companies, to freshen its own brand?
Ms. Bell, the spokeswoman for the company, declined to answer questions about its acquisitions strategy, again referring a reporter to conference calls with analysts.
Most industry insiders -- investment bankers and retail analysts -- said the company is not for sale. Ms. Mager, of Goldman, Sachs, said the company would not be for sale because the brand is "mature" or has less growth potential than a smaller, nimbler clothing company.
Several analysts compared Tommy Hilfinger's condition to that of Liz Claiborne in the 1990's. Known as a troubled company, Liz Claiborne hired Paul R. Charron as chief executive in 1995. Under his leadership, it revitalized its core business -- selling sportswear to women -- and started a series of major acquisitions, which included Sigrid Olsen, Lucky Brand jeans, Mexx shops and, just last fall, Ellen Tracy.
"They bought companies that could sit beside each other, and were not cannibalistic," Ms. Mager said, "They found a way to keep their core business vital, but didn't expect it to grow. They kept their cash for acquisitions."
On Feb. 20, Liz Claiborne reported that sales for the final quarter of last year were $993.9 million, up 12.1 percent from the period a year earlier.
It was a record for the company. In a news release, Mr. Charron attributed the results to "the multibrand, multichannel, multigeography diversification strategy which we have employed over the last several years."

How to Win Friends and Influence Small Countries

BYLINE:  By TOM ZELLER

 BODY:
EVEN the most committed pacifist might feel a twinge of empathy for the United States, Britain and Spain -- sponsors of a deadline-setting, war-launching and now apparently moot resolution on Iraq, submitted to the United Nations Security Council three weeks ago. It's one thing, after all, to be stonewalled by France, which promised a veto, or by Germany, which, while lacking veto status, has long opposed the American war posture. Russia threatened a veto as well, but at least Russia, like France and Germany, is sort of . . . big.
 But Cameroon? Almost from the start, it was among the Security Council's fence-riders -- Guinea, Chile, Angola, Mexico and Pakistan, as well as Cameroon -- upon whom anything resembling United Nations backing for war in Iraq rested. Nine of the council's 15 members must approve a resolution for passage, although a veto by any of the five permanent members would nix it. But nine supporting votes, or even a simple majority of eight, the administration seemed to reason, might still look like a mandate, veto or not. 
 So began a diplomatic opera of odd courtships, arm-twisting, compromises and back-room deal-making that thrust a few of the world's bit players, all short-timers on the council, into starring roles.
Not that anything was asked of, offered to or taken away from them. "The president is not offering quid pro quos," the White House press secretary, Ari Fleischer, told reporters after the resolution was submitted. He was asked if deals were on the table. "You're saying that the leaders of other nations are buyable," he said, "and that is not an acceptable proposition."
Yet the six nations in limbo were surely mindful that in 1990, minutes after joining Cuba in rejecting the resolution authorizing force against Iraq, Yemen was told by an American diplomat that it would be "the most expensive 'no' vote" it had ever cast. Soon after, the United States cut off Yemen's $70 million aid package.
At a press briefing on Wednesday, the State Department spokesman, Richard A. Boucher, responded to questions about the give-and-take this time around. "We have relationships with these places, we have aid programs with these places, we have high-level discussions and visits with these countries," he said. "The fact that those things go on is not a surprise to anyone."
But, he added, "When we discuss what's going on in the Security Council, we discuss what's going on in the Security Council, that the Security Council decisions need to be based on their merits by the countries that take on this responsibility. We have relationships with these countries that we do work to improve. But that is also part of our broader relationship."
Those broader relationships run the gamut, from the minor patronage afforded Guinea and Cameroon, to a pending trade pact with Chile, to the close economic and social ties linking Mexico and the United States. Mexico, for example, has long sought more favorable immigration deals with the United States. 
"I don't expect for there to be significant retribution from the government," President Bush told reporters two weeks ago, when asked if a Mexican "no" vote would strain relations. "I expect Mexico to be with us." 
Hispanic Democrats in Congress called this a threat. The White House denounced their charge as partisan.
In any case, none of the levers appear to have worked, if applied at all. At week's end, Bulgaria remained the only other Security Council member supporting the three-week-old resolution, which stipulated tomorrow as the deadline for Iraq's compliance. A British compromise plan fudged that deadline, and the Bush administration indicated that the Monday cut-off could be somewhat flexible if nine votes were possible. But on Friday, this outcome remained far from certain. Instead, Chile offered its own proposal, Guinea said it might abstain and the leaders of the United States, Britain and Spain announced plans to meet in the Azores, off Portugal, to discuss the situation.

GRAPHIC: Chart/Map: "Profiles of the Fence Riders"The U.S. and its allies spent the last few weeks charming six undecided members of the Security Council some of whom don't ordinarily hold much sway over world affairs to gain support for a new resolution authorizing force against Iraq. A look at the countries on the fence: They're Not Exactly Wealthy . . .Even the most wealthy among the holdouts are relatively poor.

Converting the scores into the scale below shows that some holdouts have better reputations than others. . . . But Who Is?The U.S. scored only one step above Chile, at 17.

Fee for a Patch of Sidewalk? The City and Its Cafes Duel

BYLINE:  By DAVID KIRBY 

 BODY:
Sidewalk cafes may add a touch of decorous charm to an otherwise hectic city. But a battle over the cost of that charm has turned unexpectedly rancorous. And in the wake of opposition, the city may be backtracking on just how much restaurant owners will have to pay to operate a cafe. 
 Last month, the city's Department of Consumer Affairs began informing restaurant owners that as part of an effort to streamline the process of applying for a cafe permit, the fee for operating a cafe would rise steeply this year. 
 Over the past few weeks, when restaurant operators began getting notices of the increases, some of them realized that they faced rises of up to 600 percent.
 They quickly geared up to fight back.
 On Thursday, more than 50 people representing local restaurants packed a Consumer Affairs hearing on the increases. The mood in the small hearing room was solemn as owner after owner described the impact of the new fees. After each presentation, the audience applauded.
 "Please, don't push us into unemployment," pleaded Dmitri Polimenakos, whose mother owns Uncle George's Greek Tavern, in Astoria. "We were hit with a 300 percent increase. What if I raised prices by three times? People would stay home." 
 Under the new formula, annual fees for unenclosed cafes south of 96th Street would rise from $10 per square foot to $1,290 for the first 20 square feet, and $30 for each additional square foot. Fees for enclosed cafes in that area, which are about twice as high, would rise at roughly the same rate. Elsewhere in the city, the fees would be about two-thirds of that.
 Although owners had been bracing for higher fees, many were taken aback by the size of the hike. Joan McNaughton, a co-owner of Fuel, at East Fourth Street and the Bowery, said her fees would soar to $59,000 this year from $13,000 last year. "I almost fainted," she said. "We expected an increase, but this is crippling." 
 In the wake of the hearing, Consumer Affairs Commissioner Gretchen Dykstra is reviewing the fees and is expected to issue a final ruling by the end of the month.
 State Senator Carl Kruger of Brooklyn, an opponent of the proposed increases, said he hoped Ms. Dykstra would scale them back. Failing that, he hopes the City Council will rescind them. "Otherwise," he said, "I'm prepared to go to court to challenge the legality of this measure."

HEADLINE: Straining at the Leash 

BYLINE:  By CAROLINE F. CAMPION; Caroline F. Campion is an editor at GQ.

 BODY:
ON a midwinter's afternoon in Alphabet City, the neighborhood once known by the alarming if not particularly clever acronym of Assault, Battery, Crime and Death, a young man wearing a scarf and combat boots makes his way toward Tompkins Square Park, tugged along by an impatient companion. Passing dress shops that were once punk bars, the young man follows a panting, furry charge on the end of a frayed leash as they head to their daily ritual, a romp in the park's dog playground.
 Over the past decade, denizens of the one of the city's most historically divisive parks, located in a neighborhood known as one of the city's most politically radical, have gingerly embraced one of the most provincial of urban staples, the dog run. 
 At the same time, all manner of ethnic, racial, economic and class-related conflicts have played themselves out at the run. Gentrification, ownership of public space, animal rights, self-expression, politics -- all these issues have reverberated in the dogs' play space. Since its inception in 1991 as the official dog run, it has been the cause of contention, debate and activism, in a neighborhood where one expects nothing less. 
 The run is a fenced-in area about the size of two tennis courts at the northern end of the park. One section, which is layered with mulch and dotted with trees, has been set aside for small dogs. The main part, a more ragged stretch, is centered around a primitive-looking sculpture known as the Bone. 
 Carol Vinzant, the owner of a shepherd mix named Jolly, has the clear-eyed look of a New England college dean that suits her role as the elected "co-mayor" of the large dog run. During her tenure, she has not only organized cleanups and seen a few romances blossom, but has also been called upon to enforce rules and mediate heated disputes. One involved a longtime resident whose dog used to attack other smaller dogs; when confronted, the woman complained that the problem was the new people, "the yuppies," whose dogs deserved getting roughed up because they wore sweaters.
 Even mundane issues like the variety of gravel that will replace the mulch in the large dog run produce angry e-mail exchanges, arguments and flurries of fliers. Last summer, the divisiveness reached a fever pitch when owners of small-breed dogs wanted to cordon off a section of the run for their dogs. The small-dog run was established in July. 
 "You could propose putting the Fountain of Youth in the middle of Tompkins Square Park, and people would get upset," Ms. Vinzant said. "There would be a controversy." 
 Heather Malin, a 27-year-old freelance writer, learned this lesson quickly when she became co-mayor of the small dog run in July. "The characteristic that has not changed in the East Village," said Ms. Malin, the owner of a short-haired dachshund named Neo, "is the need for confrontation."

A Hotbed, With Sushi
 No one would confuse Avenue A for a street in Des Moines, oreven the Upper East Side. But the East Village has experienced major shifts in a relatively short period; the old hotbed of radical activity now has significantly more police officers, higher-priced apartments and destination restaurants. Many people believe the changes are for the best, allowing them to walk around safely without confronting a drug dealer on every corner. But for those with a nostalgic attachment to the good old days of lawlessness, the place has lost its edge.
 It is debatable whether a neighborhood sacrifices its rebellious nature when it welcomes police officers, evicts Hare Krishnas and squatters (although some have been allowed to buy back their building), and allows a sushi restaurant to replace the infamous biker bar Alcatraz. What is not debatable is that the dog run has become a flashpoint for virtually every local tension. 
 Henry Stern, the highly visible advocate for cleaning up the parks during his 15-year reign as the city's parks commissioner, is an enthusiastic advocate of dog runs. The owner, famously, of a golden retriever named Boomer, he oversaw the founding of the Tompkins Square Park dog run.
 "While I was commissioner," he recalled, "Boomer would have his birthday party at the run every July 18, and there would be 60 dogs there and a parade and refreshments. This was symbolic of the recapturing of the park, and all the dog owners in the neighborhood would come to celebrate."
 The 10-acre park was developed by the city in 1834 as a haven where immigrants could escape from overcrowded tenement apartments and gulp fresh air while socializing with their neighbors. Over the years the park also became a staging ground for protests, from marches during the depression of the late 1850's to debates during the Civil War to the love-in and antiwar gatherings of the Vietnam era.
 The surrounding neighborhood has always been characterized by ethnic -- and later racial -- diversity; residents were first German and Irish, then Jewish and Eastern European, and most recently Puerto Rican and African-American. This mix, combined with the volatile politics of various eras, and the neighborhood's relative isolation (the nearest subway is at Astor Place) created a charged and highly individualistic community.
 "This was the most difficult park over the years," said Mr. Stern, who witnessed some of the most violent confrontations at Tompkins Square Park. "The struggle that occurred at Tompkins was the metaphor for all the city parks, and it has required a lot of effort to fight it."
 Irene, a woman in her 50's who is a regular of the dog run with her Yorkshire terrier, Jesse, and who, like many local dog people, would not give her full name, has lived in the neighborhood ever since she arrived as a teenager in the 1960's with her Ukrainian parents. For years she lived across the street from a bar where there were loud fights almost nightly. Customers would spill out noisily and use drugs in front of her building. (The bar is now the pricey Northern Italian restaurant I Coppi.)
 She came home one night in June 1991 to be greeted by a full-blown riot spurred by squatters who had camped in the park and were furious at the city's attempts to evict them. "There were police on the roofs and people with bats in the streets," she recalled of that fabled event. "I think by the next day things were O.K., but the repercussions and the ill feelings stayed for a long time."
 Sanitation trucks and police in riot gear rumbled in quickly to destroy the rioters' tent city. The destruction signified the end of the park's use as a private campground for the disenfranchised. After the park was renovated and reopened, several residents established the dog run, and although it took time for many in the neighborhood to feel comfortable entering the park they had once shunned, people like Irene started creeping back.

Roll Over (and Roll Film)
 The dog run has been such a microcosm of both the joys and woes of urban life, it will have a star turn in a movie, albeit a modest one. Erica Isaac, a 28-year-old filmmaker and the founder of Siren Media, is working out of a railroad apartment on East Ninth Street to finish an independently funded documentary -- working title "First Run" -- that is expected to be shown this fall at the New-York Historical Society.
 "After 9/11, especially living downtown, I felt really uncomfortable with the notion that we were suddenly all New York City-centric," said Ms. Isaacs, her legs folded under her like a lotus origami, explaining her decision to focus on the dog run and its environs. "The flag-waving and all these terms of community and unity that were written about, like they always existed here. 
 "But I don't believe that togetherness and community should come out of crisis," she continued. ""So I was on a quest to find community that existed before the crisis in a neighborhood, and I found the East Village and the dog run were an example of that."
 In one scene, David Ores, a doctor who runs a local clinic, said of the citizens of the East Village: "People love to argue, they have their opinions. If someone says, 'Hey, how about the Hubble telescope?' someone else will say, 'Oh, I hate that thing -- what does it do again?"'
 In another scene, a homeless veteran and longtime park fixture explains articulately, if somewhat impatiently, why he hates the run: "Homeless people were moved out to make room for the dogs, dogs that have been enslaved for domesticity. They should be in the countryside. Not a pleasure for rich people, the rich homosexuals and freaks of society."
 Ms. Malin was filmed conducting a vote on the maximum size for dogs in the small dog run. After the results showed a tie (half for 20 pounds, half for 25 pounds), two new options were offered: 23 pounds or revote. As the trees blurred into the twilight sky, some 50 dog owners clutching pugs and Chihuahuas to their breasts circled Ms. Malin as she tried to keep the arguments from escalating into a NATO-style debate. 
 Arms aloft, Ms. Malin sought to pacify an overweight French bulldog's high-strung owner, who was fighting desperately for a limit of 25 pounds. In the end everyone agreed on 23 pounds, with no dog actually having to be humiliated with a weigh-in upon entry.

Refereeing at the Run
 As the East Village has evolved since the fall of tent city, so have the types of dogs that frequent the run. Once there was mostly a motley selection of mutts accompanied by their equally motley owners -- bartenders, graphic designers, out-of-work actors. Now the animal population includes Dalmatians, pugs, golden retrievers and other purebreds, called "frou-frou" dogs by one professional dog walker. And the owners now include celebrities like Molly Ringwald and John Leguizamo, both of whom have been spotted with their pets. 
 Although the run is officially under Parks Department jurisdiction, the general belief is that it should be run by those who use it. And governed it is. There is a Web site, a newsletter, called The Scoop, and a day-to-day manager, Henry Greenberg.
 "It's a hands-off approach," said William T. Castro, the Manhattan parks commissioner. "We haven't had any incidents where we've had to come in and referee."
 But things sometimes get out of hand. 
 Rough dogs, notably pit bulls owned by teenagers who live in the housing projects between Avenue D and the East River, still make an appearance. Barry, an out-of-work computer programmer, recalls two tussles involving the pits and Bird, his large black Newfoundland. 
 "I got bit twice, but it was my fault," he said. "I didn't know to pull the dogs off by their hind legs. I pulled by the collar and got bit in the bicep. I passed out and ended up laid out on one of the benches, where people in the run annoyingly tried to revive me out of unconsciousness."
 Pit bulls have been one of the run's most sensitive issues. A great many pit bulls or pit bull mixes are found at the run, largely because a high proportion of local pets were once abused or abandoned strays and because, in a still tough neighborhood, a tough dog offers a degree of street cred.
 Middle-class owners of pit bulls have complained of breed profiling, saying pit bulls are not inherently vicious animals; they call dog owners who discriminate against pits and try to evict them from the run "breedist," a term plastered on one of the neighborhood's ubiquitous fliers. But many owners worry about pits because they believe their dogs could be attacked by a particularly aggressive dog or dog-napped for use as bait in a pit bull's training. 
 There are also cultural differences that separate the owners of "frou-frou" dogs from the pit bull owners who live in the projects. Last summer, when a Hispanic teenager brought his pit bull puppy into the small dog run, the act sparked an instant confrontation with heavily racial overtones.
 "A model with a Chihuahua came running over to me and said he had threatened to come after her with a knife," Ms. Malin said. "That's when people start throwing around 'these people.' It was immediately confrontational, 'us versus them.' For the boy, it was a pride thing more than anything else. He was a 14-year-old kid trying to be bad."
 Mr. Greenberg, who has been supervising the park for over a decade, tries to stay out of such disputes. But when he was asked to mediate the altercation over the pit bull puppy, he had trouble understanding what all the fuss was about.
 "I could see it was not a vicious dog," he said. "He was even nice to my cat."
 Robert Shapiro, the owner of Social Tees, a combination animal rescue group, T-shirt business and bicycle repair shop on East Fourth Street, sees his storefront as an "oasis from the madness of dog runs." Mr. Shapiro does not run a shelter, but he does help people place unwanted or abandoned animals, which, besides dogs and cats, have included a mountain lion, pygmy goats and (urban legend confirmed!) a baby alligator. 
 "The pit bulls issue has been happening ever since dog runs existed," said Mr. Shapiro, who has lived in the neighborhood for 30 years. "The nice people have a lot of animosity towards the kids who bring the dogs in, but they are only condemning ignorant people. 
 "Some of these kids are abused," he added. "They don't have happy lives. The dogs are the only thing in their life that is beautiful." As for the police intervening to curb overly aggressive dogs, Mr. Shapiro said, "They have drug dealers to deal with."
 Officer Vincent Amadeo of the Ninth Precinct is part of an extensive patrol that monitors the park around the clock. He was one of the officers called to the scene involving the teenager with the pit bull puppy. 
 "People wanted us to kick him out," Officer Amadeo said. "But as cops, we can't do anything if he isn't breaking the law, and this kid was doing precisely what you are supposed to use the area for. He's from the housing projects; where else is he supposed to go with his dog?" 
 With the city in the throes of an economic downturn, and downtown struggling to regain lost business and tourism, there may yet be hope for residents sentimental about this grungy little hamlet's rebel past. A sign outside the community gardens at Avenue C and Ninth Street, "This is a community park" has been crossed out and now reads, "This is a Yuppie catering service."

Private Pain, Public Anger Over a Plan to Close Two Hospitals

BYLINE:  By SETH KUGEL 

 BODY:
Situated just off the Hutchinson River Parkway near I-95, the 13-story, 360-bed Bronx Psychiatric Center and its smaller neighbor, Bronx Children's Psychiatric Center, are an institution in the borough. The two hospitals are filled to capacity. Poor and working-class patients, many of whose families do not have cars, count on them for inpatient and outpatient services. 
 These families, along with local politicians and the hospital staff, are among those who are protesting a plan to close both facilities by 2005, leaving the Bronx as the only borough with no state psychiatric hospital. 
 In their campaign to fight the proposed closing, which was announced Jan. 29, labor leaders have lobbied in Albany, local politicians have called news conferences and families have made public the intensely private stories of private afflictions.
 Their battle cries are much the same: The Bronx is being dumped on again. Poor people are perceived as less likely to fight. And doesn't that land near I-95 look suspiciously like prime real estate? 
 They also note that Bronx Psychiatric has the only wards in the system designated exclusively for Spanish-speaking patients. The Bronx has 645,000 Hispanic residents, the most of any county in the state. 
The State Office of Mental Health referred calls about the proposed closing to the State Division of the Budget. Ken Brown, a spokesman for the division, said the Bronx sites would be closing in part to avoid significant renovation costs; the money saved, he added, would be invested in community-based services. It would cost $165 million to renovate the two centers, Mr. Brown said.
 One person who is dreading a change is Mildred Gaines, from Melrose in the South Bronx, whose 11-year-old daughter, known to friends and family as Z, suffers from bipolar disorder. The child has been a patient at the children's hospital and attends a special school there. 
 "It would be a hardship, to say the least, to travel to any other place and go and visit her," said Ms. Gaines, who works as a school nurse. "She likes the security of knowing she has Mommy close by." 
Adult patients will face similar problems, said Dr. Oliver Sacks, the author of "The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat" and a doctor at the hospital for a quarter of a century. "People who have been going there know the place," he said, "they know the staff, they know the grounds, they know the trains and buses. It's going to be a heavy additional adjustment to them and their families."
 Patients at both the adult hospital, which, according to the state's Web site, had the fourth largest inpatient census of 33 state centers in 2001, and the children's center will be transferred to other sites in the metropolitan region, which could include centers as far away as Islip on Long Island. 
 Economic development motives may have played a role in the decision to consider closing the hospital. "The Bronx campus is an excellent candidate for redevelopment, and we've already received some inquiries," said Mr. Brown of the state budget division.

In Texas, Texas-Size Injury Expenses

BYLINE:  By JULIA MEURLING 

 BODY:
 Each year, hundreds of thousands of workers in the United States file medical claims for injuries that occur on the job. Last year, the Workers Compensation Research Institute, whose members include insurers and employers, released the findings of a three-year investigation of work-related injuries in eight states in 1998. 
The group found that companies paid $1,568, on average, per medical claim. But in 22 percent of the cases, an injury kept an employee out of work for more than seven workdays and the cost jumped to $5,583. 
Claim payments varied widely among the eight states studied. Texas had the highest, at $2,413, about 54 percent more than the average. That was partly because chiropractors were involved in 20 percent of claims, about twice as often as in other states. In Texas, chiropractors provide more services and require more visits than some other health care providers, according to the study. JULIA MEURLING

HEADLINE: Finland's Close Race Isn't a Cliffhanger 

BYLINE:  By LIZETTE ALVAREZ 

DATELINE: HELSINKI, Finland, March 15 

 BODY:
This Nordic center of high-tech leadership is about to have a national election, but it is one in which candidates do their utmost to avoid irritating their opponents, national parties promote their similarities, not their differences, and the outcome has little bearing on policy.
 It is no wonder, political analysts say, that voter turnout is expected to drop once again when people go to the polls on Sunday. 
 While the election is expected to end with a paper-thin margin between the governing Social Democrats, led by Prime Minister Paavo Lipponen, and the opposition conservative Center Party, nothing is likely to change too much, no matter who wins. That is because none of the 18 parties in Finland ever comes close to collecting 50 percent of the vote, so a coalition must be formed to get anything through Parliament. That is also why the party leaders tend not to want to anger one another. 
"These parties have been cooperating for a long time, and nothing ever changes," said Sami Borg, a political analyst who heads the Finnish Social Science Data Archive at the University of Tampere, remarking on the growing sense of apathy in the country in the past decade.
With such practical politics at play, it is surprising that voters turn out at all in Finland, a country of 5.2 million people. The last election, four years ago, had a turnout of 68 percent, huge by American standards but piddling compared with those in the other Nordic countries.
"Leading politicians really feel embarrassed about the matter," said Tuomo Martikainen, a political science professor at Helsinki University.
Still, the election goes forward. After eight years of a Social Democratic government -- in which Finland's prosperity grew along with the fortunes of its cellphone giant, Nokia -- the opinion polls indicate that the Finns are seriously contemplating a change in power, at least on paper.
Anneli Jaatteenmaki, 48, a confrontational lawyer, is the leader of the Center Party and of the challenge to the Social Democrats. If they form a government, she is likely to become the first woman to be Finland's prime minister. She has turned Finland's unemployment rate -- at 10 percent, the third highest in Europe -- into her chief campaign weapon. She has proposed reducing the amount that employers must contribute to the social welfare system, to promote hiring.
Prime Minister Lipponen, 62, is running on his experience, especially in times of international upheaval, and the country's economic success.
"Our theme is continuity and renewal," Mr. Lipponen said at a news conference on Thursday. The Social Democrats, he added, "have turned the Finnish economy around" by stabilizing interest rates and the labor market. Although unemployment is high, he said, Finland is one of the few European countries that has lowered its unemployment rate.
Ms. Jaatteenmaki has surprised analysts by straying from Finland's typically dry political script just a bit. She has criticized the nation's deteriorating health care system -- a major issue here -- and even Mr. Lipponen's position on Iraq, which caused only a minor row.
But unemployment has emerged as the central issue. 
"Unemployment has become the acid test of the political system," Ms. Jaatteenmaki said in an interview. "The promise of cutting unemployment by one-half has yet to be met. We all remember that our prime minister promised to cut unemployment eight years ago and now he has had two terms to do it, and his government hasn't managed it."
Nordic countries provide citizens with free health care, long maternity leaves and large unemployment checks, among other benefits. As a result, people here and in Scandinavia pay an average income tax rate of 40 percent.
One undesirable offshoot of this generosity is that there is little incentive for the unemployed to work at low-wage jobs and little incentive for employers to create jobs. "It's too expensive to take on an employee," Ms. Jaatteenmaki said. "It's easier and less expensive if you buy a machine."
Mr. Lipponen said he planned to combat unemployment by focusing on education and job training and increasing financing for research and development. He also acknowledges that the tax structure should be reviewed. 
Both candidates have proposed spending more money on the health system. They have pre-empted each other on other issues, as well.
The question of whether Finland should join NATO has been put off until the next election and any policy discussions about the European Union, of which Finland is a member, evinces a national yawn. 
In a short tussle over Iraq, Ms. Jaatteenmaki accused Mr. Lipponen of tacitly agreeing with President Bush's position. But Mr. Lipponen denied that vehemently, and the issue was short-lived.
"You don't do anything bold," Professor Martikainen said. "That would be suicide in Finland."

HEADLINE: Businesses Say Taxes Will Hit Economy 

BYLINE:  By HARLAN J. LEVY 

 BODY:
DUMB and dumber.
 That's what Jay Mazur , a Derby businessman, called the two new business taxes passed into law about two weeks ago to help close the approximately $640 million state budget deficit for this fiscal year. 
 Mr. Mazur, president of Gordon Rubber & Packing, is far from alone. Connecticut business leaders complained that the measures enacted by the governor and the Legislature have wounded a long-term source of jobs and jeopardized future tax revenues. 
One tax levies a 20 percent surcharge on this year's corporate income tax. It will raise $65.4 million, said Thomas Fiore of the Office of Policy and Management. Payment begins with the quarterly estimated tax return on June 15, he said.
The second, and perhaps more significant measure, allows cities and towns to collect property taxes on previously exempt purchases of equipment and machinery by manufacturers. It is expected to raise $13 million this fiscal year. 
"It's dumb to tax investment capital to begin with," said Mr. Mazur, whose company employs 34 people. "It's dumber to increase those taxes. And it's even dumber if you want people to make an investment in equipment to then tax it."
Under the new measure permitting cities and towns to tax equipment and machinery, the state reduced from 80 percent to 64 percent its reimbursement to towns and cities that have given manufacturers a five-year exemption on taxes on the gear they purchased. To make up the difference, the new law says, municipalities can now vote to collect a one-time-only tax next year on the previously exempt property that is on this year's grand list.
The 20 percent surcharge is strictly for 2003, but another one could replace it next year if the Legislature goes along with Gov. John G. Rowland's proposal of a 10 percent corporate income tax surcharge for 2004 to help close a projected $2 billion deficit for that year.
"They're shooting themselves in the foot," said Carl Eckblom, a third-generation owner of Manchester's Standard Washer and Mat, a maker of industrial washers and gaskets that employs 18. "Corporations have to pitch in and help," he acknowledged, but letting towns collect the property tax "changes the rules. When you're a small company like ours that's a big problem. It certainly dissuades us from buying anything new anytime soon. You're also discouraging us from hiring new people to run the equipment, and you're preventing us from being more profitable, which in turn keeps us from paying more taxes."
Mr. Eckblom said he was waiting to see what Manchester will do.
Indeed, the town of Manchester has a Hobson's choice: Either suffer the state's pullback on reimbursements -- about $270,000, according to Mark Pellegrini, planning and economic development director -- or inflict pain on the many medium-to-small manufacturers who may eventually have less tax revenue to contribute. Town officials don't know which way they will go when they vote in May, Mr. Pellegrini said.
"On the one hand this is an important economic incentive," he said. "On the other hand, we have a revenue problem."
The two new taxes hurt businesses that are tight right now, Mr. Pellegrini said. "Coming out of a recession, and with war jitters, a lot of people's plans for investment have been on hold, and this will just add to that reluctance to expand," he said. "I don't want to panic, but we just need to see how this affects everyone over the short term. Hopefully, it won't put anyone over the edge."
State officials rejected the notion they have made a mistake, arguing that the measures are temporary, will not prompt layoffs or relocations and will not stifle expansion plans.
Governor Rowland's budget chief, Marc S. Ryan, who is secretary of the Office of Policy and Management, said: "I think it's fairly minimal if you look at what other states are doing, "especially New Jersey, where they're increasing taxes on businesses by hundreds of millions of dollars permanently. In Connecticut, anything that hits businesses is only temporary."
When other states finish wrangling with their serious budget holes, Connecticut's effective corporate tax rate will be "less onerous" than that of traditional competitors, said Thomas Ciccalone, executive director of public affairs and strategic development in the State Department of Economic and Community Development.
"It's too soon to tell how this is all going to shake out because we understand that New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New Jersey are all facing bigger problems than we are facing," he said. Still, the surcharge will hurt, said Joseph Brennan, vice president of government affairs for the Connecticut Business and Industry Association. "One member said it's going to be over $1 million, and although other states certainly are doing more than Connecticut, it's going to have an impact on some companies' ability to invest more in the state, and in some cases it may necessitate layoffs," he said 
Small companies that operate only in Connecticut will bear the brunt of the 20 percent surcharge, said Fred V. Carstensen, University of Connecticut economics professor and executive director of the Connecticut Center for Economic Analysis. "Companies are very sophisticated at tax avoidance if they're larger firms," he said. "They have the resources and the distributed base that permits them to take advantage of the differentials between different tax environments. Smaller firms don't."
Taxing equipment and machinery purchases is "an erosion that's a major concern," Mr. Carstensen said. "It's a potential threat to the long-term vitality of Connecticut enterprise. Companies will make fewer investments. Activity growth will slow down. We will begin to lose our competitive edge in the national and international economy."
Manufacturing Services Corporation of Hartford, a maker of high-precision industrial devices, with 12 on the payroll, has resorted to layoffs as the economy has tightened, Wells Lindsay, the owner, said. He used to employ 28 and run two shifts. Starting in December he pared back to one shift.
"We prefer they tax the egg and not the goose," he said. "We're willing to pay taxes on profits rather than taxes on opening the door. Whether or not we make money, we have to pay that personal property tax."
He said the new taxes had made him even more reluctant to buy a new piece of equipment, which costs between $200,000 and $300,000.
More small manufacturers are "hanging on by their fingernails than ever before," Mr. Lindsay said, "and for a lot, it could be the straw that breaks the camel's back.
"The next fiscal year concerns us when the initial proposal from the governor is to take another $7 million out of the tax abatement program," he said.
The State Legislature, which is not expected to vote on a 2004 bailout package for several months, has yet another problem caused by this year's shortfall and the projected $2 billion deficit for 2004. In December, the national bond rating agency Moody's Investors Service placed Connecticut under review for a possible downgrade affecting about $12 billion in outstanding bonds. In a report, Moody's said it was monitoring the credit strength of Connecticut cities, towns, and school districts because of the uncertainty regarding reduced state aid levels to local government, created by the Legislature's and the governor's inability to agree on budget issues.
However, with the tax package approved two weeks ago for this fiscal year, Mr. Ryan expected Moody's to take the state off the credit watch and to maintain its Aa2 rating.
"We've been meeting with the rating agencies, and with the deficit mitigation plan we'll hopefully keep our rating the way it is and get off the credit watch," Mr. Ryan said.
But by burdening business to help solve the state's spending problems, Mr. Carstensen said, the Legislature is avoiding a better solution. The new tax law imposes an across-the-board 0.5 percent increase in income tax rates, but should have raised the rates another quarter or half a percent on people earning more than $75,000 or $100,000, he said. Frank Johnson, executive director of the Manufacturing Alliance of Connecticut, a state association of manufacturers, said the governor shouldn't have picked on manufacturers.
"We would have liked the Legislature to do more with spending cuts and state employee concessions," he said.
Mr. Lindsay said the state should do what manufactures have had to do.
"We've had to get leaner by constantly reviewing and rethinking everything we do," he said. "We've had to get smarter and do with less, and the government can do the same."

HEADLINE: This Old, Old House 

BYLINE:  By C.J. HUGHES 

 BODY:
ASK Jean McKee how the first floor of her Cheshire farm came to contain a trove of American antiques, like the autographed engraving of President George Washington, the rusted bolt from the U.S.S. Constitution, or the Civil War sword shattered into three pieces at the Battle of Gettysburg, and the answer will always be the same: "They've just always been there."
 The same could be said about her family. 
 Great-great-great-great-great-great (count them, six) grandfather Henry Brooks stepped off a boat from England in about 1670, and after the family built the Cheshire house on a sweep of hilly farmland a few decades later, one relative or another has lived in the two-story white clapboard home ever since. In fact, owing to the tremendous staying power of her relatives, it's likely the oldest house continuously inhabited by the same family in the entire state, maybe any state. 
For her part, Ms. McKee, 73, isn't bragging. She realizes imprecise dating techniques and inconsistent record keeping make any who-lived-where-for-how-long claim extremely tough to prove. 
Yet an informal survey of Connecticut's oldest towns turns up few challengers to the claim made by some state historians, and no one so far has disprovedit. Sure, there are older houses (Guilford, Windsor and Wethersfield), sometimes by as much as 70 years, and older families (Orange). But the Brooks clan, in a town without the "Washington Slept Here" plaques that older towns boast about, seems to have them beat. In a nation where wanderlust, economic booms and busts , and real estate developers have all helped to shorten how long anybody lives in one dwelling, that's no small accomplishment.
"I think people were drawn here because it was always such a beautiful spot, because the open spaces were maintained around it," said Ms. McKee, gesturing to snowy fields sloping behind a tall white barn. "It's always had an emotional grip on the people who lived there, especially when they come back and see how much of the history is retained."
That history stretches back well over two centuries, to 1733, the year the original central part of the house was built, according to town officials, who commissioned a study of it during America's bicentennial. That date puts it among the top 100 oldest houses in the state, historians said, its remote location in a mountain valley possibly explaining its survival.
An old home is one thing, but having the same family line reside in it is another. In Connecticut, many old homes became historical societies and museums long ago, like Guilford's 1639 Henry Whitfield House and Wethersfield's circa 1720 Buttolph-Williams House. No guided tours are shuffling through the Brooks kitchen.
The Hine family of Orange lives on a plot of land much older than the Brooks', purchased in 1639. Yet according to town officials, the family was in all likelihood feudal-style tenant-farmers who traveled from nearby Milford to till the land, so they didn't even build a home on the site until around 1725. The family still lives in the house, but they don't know if it is the original. Historians doubt it.
"The house the Hines live in now is not the house that was originally built there, by observing it from the outside," said Harry Jones, former president of the Orange Historical Society. "I dare say the original house was burned."
The only real challenge to the Brooks would come from early-colony states like Massachusetts, still teeming with 17th- and 18th-century homes. There was an older home in Dedham that had the Brooks beat until the family moved out in the early 1900's. Another serious contender had been the Pickering House in Salem, Mass., built in 1651, which still houses some Pickering relatives. Yet a few years ago, the owners incorporated the whole building as a museum, a regular stop on the Salem appreciation tour. Technically, the Pickering isn't a run-of-the-mill house anymore.
What does this mean? It means that the bedroom community of Cheshire may be home to a unique piece of pre-Revolution history.
"The Brooks claim doesn't seem that outrageous to me," said James Sexton, a Ph.D. candidate at Yale who has written frequently about colonial properties. "It's not a wildly old house for Connecticut, but the fact that it could be the longest lived-in house by one family is very much in the realm of possibility."
That's for scholars to figure out. For now, Ms. McKee, with her short brown hair, gold glasses and tweed jacket, has work to do. Specifically, she is sorting through yellowed letters, Bible pages and deeds to research her ancestors in earnest, to find out if those tales of Brooks ancestors swapped over the dinner table were tall, or true.
"Some people do crossword puzzles for a hobby," said Ms. McKee, who has in recent years traveled from the Great Lakes to Russia to chase down leads about Brooks relatives. "I do this."
What she has found confirmed every Brooks legend and explained in large part why those heirlooms have "just always been there." For instance: Great-great-great-uncle Micah Brooks, a congressman from upstate New York, did petition President Monroe about building the Erie Canal. Great-uncle David Brooks did help Samuel Morse develop special cables to carry electricity underground. And, first cousin, thrice-removed, "Fred" Law Olmsted did complete an early landscaping project in the front yard, planting hemlock trees that are standing to this day. (The Olmsted National Historic Site confirms it was a formative visit.)
"My mother always said we lucked into our ancestors," Ms. McKee said, "but we were also lucky that we were enough of a family to always come back and keep the farm going."
Politics seemed particularly attractive to the Brooks. By Ms. McKee's count, hundreds of relatives -- from among a roster of early-American Social Register surnames like Wooster, Chatfield, Hull and Van Buren -- became representatives, senators and governors. The family calling led Ms. McKee herself to Washington, where she had lasted through the terms of five consecutive presidents, employed everywhere from the Senate to the Federal Labor Relations Authority until she retired in 1994.
Ms. McKee still keeps a home in Washington, although she is only there for about four months a year, mostly to authenticate the Brooks oral tradition at the Library of Congress and National Archives. This stepped-up examination has yielded some prized finds, like: Great-great-great grandfather David Brooks gave a fiery sermon in 1774 to the citizens of Derby at the behest of his cousin-in-law Major General David Wooster urging them to revolt against the British. 
Over the decades, the family's property has shrunk drastically -- "Every time somebody needed money, they sold a piece of the farm," Ms. McKee said -- and what was once hundreds of acres, encompassing its own "Brooks Vale" postmark and railroad station, has been whittled down to just 55 acres. 
To protect the remaining property, Ms. McKee and her sister 10 years ago began placing conservation easements on most of the land through the Cheshire Land Trust, limiting its use to only farming. The last parcel, a three-acre brookside meadow across the street from the house, will be officially handed over to the trust in April, ensuring that future generations aren't tempted to subdivide the farm.
There is also the question of who will move in next, to appreciate a vast family history that never seems too distant, or inaccessible. Ms. McKee, who never married and has no children, counts on the two nieces and one nephew in her sister's family to migrate back to a property that has so far had a powerful sway over 11 generations.
"It's so old and historic and interesting," said Sean Lewis McCoy, 11, Ms. McKee's great-nephew from St. Louis, Mo., who has been coming to the Brooks farm to visit every summer since he was born.
"It's been in our family for years, and I want to show it to my children," he said. "I hope they can keep it alive as well."

HEADLINE: THE VIEW/From Bridgeport; 
Reading Globally, Buying Locally

BYLINE:  By JEFF HOLTZ 

 BODY:
GEORGIA F. DAY was frustrated with always having to go outside of Bridgeport to do her book shopping. 
At the same time, business leaders in the city believed an independent bookstore would be another ingredient for the downtown area's revitalization.
 A resulting convergence of the parties has led to the opening next month of Rainy Faye, the first full-service bookstore in the state's most populated city in a decade. 
 The store is owned by Dr. Day, an assistant academic vice president at Fairfield University, who is an admitted bookstore junkie who always wanted her own business. 
"When I travel, no matter where I go, I always go to a bookstore," she said. "Being inside of a bookstore is a whole new world."
Dr. Day, who is also the co-host of two local radio shows, said the store's location alone, at 940 Broad Street, could make Rainy Faye a success. It is situated directly across from the main branch of Bridgeport's public library, with its 5,000 visitors a week, and near the Housatonic Community College, with 4,500 students and a faculty of nearly 200.
"This seems to be the right spot at the right time and the right thing for me," she said.
Dr. Day said the store will carry an eclectic selection of books and newspapers. She also plans to have appearances by authors, art exhibitions, live comedy, poetry, storytelling and jazz, adding that there will be an emphasis on affordable pricing and customer service.
"I'm going to become their personal valet and try and to get them something in 24 hours if we don't have it," Dr. Day said, referring to the customers.
Although there are specialty bookstores in the city, Bridgeport -- where the Walden bookstore chain was founded -- has been without a full-service store since a Barnes & Noble that served as the University of Bridgeport's bookstore closed in 1993.
"I just think it's appalling that the biggest city in the state hasn't had a full-service book store," said Michael A. Golrick, Bridgeport's chief librarian. "There are three schools in the city that have fallen below all of the state testing standards for math, reading and writing.
"It is a demonstrable fact that kids who read more will write better. The fact that we haven't a book store has decreased their opportunities to buy books."
Experts in both the book industry and economic planning contend that the locating of bookstore chains in suburban malls has left many cities in a similar situation.
Daniel B. Houston, a partner in Civic Economics, a planning and consulting firm in Austin and Chicago that has studied the effects of bookstores on local economies, said Rainy Faye could be good for Bridgeport.
"Nobody from a small community is going to drive past one book store to go to another, unless there is something special," he said. "In Bridgeport, and other cities like it, the goal is not to copy suburban retail. The goal is to be something different, something that is intrinsically better."
Mr. Houston said that for each dollar taken in, independent owners like Dr. Day put roughly 45 cents back into the local economy, as compared with 13 cents by a chain store.
"They have local accountants, use local banks, have local lawyers and spend on local advertising," he said. "They spend a lot of money that disappears overnight if you shop in a chain store."
The American Booksellers Association, which is in Tarrytown, N.Y., and represents more than half of the 2,500 independent booksellers in the nation, said marketing ideas like Dr. Day's had stabilized the industry in the last three years.
"A lot of the independent are just becoming smarter marketers," said Michael F. Hoynes, the association's marketing officer. "They're becoming better at database management and customers service."
Dr. Day's new neighbors believe the store will enhance the area.
Mr. Golrick has already met with Dr. Day about coordinating events. He said the store would help promote literacy and learning in the city and draw more authors to the library for speaking engagements.
"The bookstore will probably advertise itself as being across from the library, he said. "So I'll get a little piece of that, too."
Mr. Golrick also notedthat an independent store would be especially beneficial.
"Independent bookstores are really important because they don't have the purchasing decisions made far away," he said. "Those local decisions can reflect the local community and its needs."
Housatonic Community College officials believe the store will enhance the students' experience.
"The mark of any vibrant college is the type of commercial development that springs up around it, especially bookstores and various arts centers," said Anson C. Smith, a spokesman for the college. "It sounds like Rainy Faye is going to be just that type of venue."
Philip J. Kuchma, the president of the Kuchma Corporation, which manages the Broad Street property for Peoples Bank, used a consultant to determine if a bookstore could work downtown.
He said the store must rely heavily on community outreach and product turnover to attract customers. 
"It is incumbent upon the people who said we needed this to support it," Mr. Kuchma said.
Dr. Day does face challenges, however. With large retailers and supermarkets also selling books, independents now control only 15 percent of the market, according to the American Booksellers Association. More than half of the nation's independent bookstores have closed in the last decade.
Yet, after exhaustingly researching the project, Dr. Day remains positive.
"There's a particular type of person that goes to the independent bookstore," she said. "We have Stop and Shop, and yet I still shop at a small grocery store, only because of the customer service and the fact that there is a limited menu and I know exactly where to go. I think that will happen here
"Truthfully, already the space is too small," she added. "I need a new place already. I see it growing."

HEADLINE: Commuters Bracing For Fare Increases 

BYLINE:  By STACY ALBIN 

 BODY:
SHAKIRA STEWART, a sophomore at Hofstra University, does not always have $4.25 to spare, the cost of train fare between the Hofstra campus, in Hempstead, and Brooklyn, where her mother and grandmother live. So Ms. Stewart, who is paying her own way through college, borrows it from a friend. 
 Now she will have to borrow a bit more. Ten days ago, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority voted unanimously to increase fares and tolls to close a $1.1 billion budget deficit. 
 Long Island Rail Road and Metro-North tickets will increase about 25 percent on May 1 -- specific fares have not been set yet -- and the cost of single bus and subway rides will rise by 50 cents, to $2. Tolls at bridges and tunnels will go from $3.50 to $4. 
To try to make ends meet, Ms. Stewart, 20, works two jobs, one as a security monitor, checking student identification cards at Hofstra, and the other as a pharmacy technician at a drugstore. What does she think of the increase? "That's ridiculous," she said. 
At the very least, Ms. Stewart said she would forgo the 10-block bus ride between the L.I.R.R.'s Flatbush Avenue station in Brooklyn and her mother's home in Bedford-Stuyvesant to save the $2 fare. She also plans to hitch rides all the way from Hempstead to Brooklyn to save the cost of the train.
Ana Rosu, a real estate lawyer who lives in East Hills, commutes to Manhattan on the L.I.R.R., paying $185 a month for a commutation ticket and a MetroCard, good for subway and bus fares. "It's your basic cost of living in New York," Ms. Rosu said. "Everything goes up."
New Yorkers have not experienced a transit fare increase since 1995, when Long Island Rail Road tickets increased about 9 percent and bus and subway fares in New York City rose from $1.25 to $1.50. The transportation authority, which has an operating budget of about $7.2 billion this year, attributes its projected deficit, the largest ever, to flat revenues and increasing expenses over the last several years. 
Long Islanders have little choice, it seems. There is few ways off the Island without paying a fare or toll. 
"The only way you can get into the city is the train or to drive," said Marco Fujimori, a teacher at Brentwood High School who used to commute from Lake Ronkonkoma to Manhattan, at a monthly cost $200. "I think no one really stands up for customers." 
James L. McGovern, the chairman of the Long Island Rail Road Commuters' Council, said that when Long Islanders had a chance to voice their opinions about the proposed increases, fewer than 50 people showed up at the two Long Island hearings in February.
"I was disappointed at the number of riders that actually took the time out and came and got involved," he said. "If it means something to them, then they need to get involved."
Mahir Huner, who owns a tailor shop in Port Washington and commutes from him home in Farmingdale by bus and rail, said he voiced his dissent his own way: by raising his prices. 
Kristine Gepes, a store clerk who lives in Sound Beach, said that she planned to make fewer trips to Manhattan, where she spends her free time going to concerts, shopping for CD's and hanging out with friends. "The economy's down as it is," she said. "They're just not making it any better." 
Although the bridge tolls will increase only 50 cents, Dr. Isaac Prohovnik, a radiologist at Mount Sinai Hospital in Manhattan, said he would be willing to pay more if only he didn't have such a long commute. Dr. Prohovnik, who lives in Stony Brook, spends about four hours a day driving to and from work. "I'd be happy to pay three times as much if there was a convenient public transportation alternative," he said. "I hate this drive back and forth every day."

HEADLINE: Gears, Ingenuity and Competitive Spirit 

BYLINE:  By BARBARA DELATINER 

 BODY:
THE competition begins with a bag of gears and sprockets and ends with a stack of plastic containers. In between is an education in the science of robotics for hundreds of high school students.
 More than 1,000 students from 30 Long Island schools and six off-Island schools will put their robots to the test in the Long Island Regional First Robotics Competition, to be held Thursday through Saturday at Suffolk Community College in Brentwood. (First is an acronym standing for For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.) 
 The winner will compete against 21 more regional winners for national honors next month at Reliant Park in Houston. 
The robot that places the most plastic containers in the highest piles wins this year's "Stack Attack." Last year the robot from Hauppauge High School won its regional trials, but failed to place on the nationals; the robot from East Islip came in second nationally. More than bragging rights are at stake; in 2002 $1.7 million in scholarships were up for grabs, with Long Islanders earning $175,000 of that sum.
"Those scholarships are a great inducement," said Jessica Moore, 18, the president of the Hauppauge club here, who is headed for Emory University in the fall to study pre-med.
Describing herself as "strong in science," she said that when she joined the club as a freshman she had no hands-on experience with robots -- "just with Legos."
Since then, she has learned "that a strong understanding of robots leads to a further understanding of science." She added, "And it's fun."
Jeffrey Yablon of Bellport, who teaches biology and a one-year robotics course, is the lead adviser to the Hauppauge club. 
"Besides adding a real-world application to a scholarly pursuit," he said, "the game playing -- a team can compete in as many of the 22 regional competitions as it wants -- is great competitive fun."
Last weekend the Hauppauge robot came in third among 45 schools in a regional competition in Manchester, N.H. The students' creation is a nameless, remote-controlled 35-inch wide, 29-inch long and 14-inch high box of skeletal aluminum and steel; the robot is set on a motor that not only moves it about, but also, on command, produces slender, lattice-like arms that extend outward. 
The robot competition was founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen, the inventor of the Segway Human Transporter, to inspire an appreciation of science and technology in young people; locally the program is coordinated by the School-Business Partnerships of Long Island. 
Festo, a German manufacturer of automation components with its American headquarters in Hauppauge sponsors the program there. Previously, Festo had contributed a major part of the program's $46,000 budget; this year, however, said Scott Schuler, its representative, "with the economy the way it is, we've had to cut back the funding." The district is picking up most of the bill, with students and parents helping to cover some costs.
The competition is carefully orchestrated. Six weeks before the regionals, each school receives a bag of parts for the motor -- gears, sprockets, sensors and electronics -- along with detailed ground rules like the size of the robot and the competition's goals. There is a limit to how much each team can spend. 
"This evens out the playing field, leaves the final product to the kids' imaginations and their ability to transfer their learning to doing," said Mr. Schuler, who added that adult mentors can help the students. 
"The opportunity for young students to sample different aspects of engineering is marvelous," said Gary DiBiccari, an electrical engineer whose son Michael is a freshman club member. "I wish I'd have had something like this when I was in school."
Practice sessions for the Long Island First Regional Competition at the multi-purpose building at Suffolk Community College's campus in Brentwood are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Thursday. Competition is from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. on Friday and Saturday. Information: (631)851-6700.

HEADLINE: IN BUSINESS; 
Someone to Watch Over Baby

BYLINE:  By MARC FERRIS 

 BODY:
BY the end of the month, a gleaming infant day care center is scheduled to open in Sleepy Hollow. A satellite of the Elizabeth Mascia Child Care Center in Tarrytown, the new center has been designed with wee ones in mind: a laundry room sits off the airy main space, which is partitioned with waist-high barriers to foster a sense of community. There are lots of windows. 
 Yet the center can accommodate only 15 infants age 8 weeks to 18 months, a tiny fraction of the total number of infants in the county for whom there is no room. Last month, for example, the Child Care Council of Westchester fielded 191 calls from parents seeking help placing a child under 1 year old. 
 Of the 180 child care centers in the county that are licensed by the New York State Office of Child and Family Services, only about half have space for infants ages 6 weeks to 18 months old, said Susan Poltarak, the director of training at the Child Care Council, based in White Plains. Despite the demand, she said, only four new facilities opened in the county last year. 
"The reason child care centers are not being built as fast as golden arches is because the start-up cost today is well over $1 million," said Anthony Ross, the director of Center Management Associates, which runs four centers in Westchester and one in Rockland. "And if someone had $1 million to invest, the last place they would look at is child care." 
With local and state governments experiencing a budget crunch, public support has been cut. Raising tuition is rarely an option, since many parents already find child care costs prohibitive. The market rate countywide is $231 a week for full-time infant care and $210 for toddlers, according to statistics compiled by the Child Care Council. Tuition rarely covers costs, which leaves administrators of child care centers scrambling for grants and other financing to make up the deficit.
"The child care market doesn't work because the product quality can only be produced at a cost greater than what most consumers can afford to pay," said Anne Mitchell, president of Early Childhood Policy Research in Albany, who has studied the economics of child care for the last 30 years. 
Coincidentally, state mandates that ensure small teacher-child ratios and provide adequate space in classrooms add to the cost, she said. "It's more severe for infants than for preschool or school-age children." she said, "because the state mandates at least one adult for every three babies, which is why salaries are so pathetic."
Head teacher salaries average around $20,000 a year in the county -- usually without benefits. 
"It's a sad commentary," said Ms. Poltarak, whose office helps new centers meet the regulatory requirements and provides continuing training. "Ideally, the literature tells us that very young children are best cared for when they have an opportunity to develop a relationship with their caregiver, as opposed to a revolving door. We have worked closely with new centers to get them off the ground, getting to know the staff, then we go back six months later and everyone is new except for the director."
The new Elizabeth Mascia infant center, the product of unusually deep community roots, is an anomaly. The original center, which serves preschoolers ages 18 months to 4 years and offers an after-school program for grade schoolchildren in the Irvington and Tarrytown school districts, dates to 1967, when it became the second day care center in the Hudson Valley corridor between Yonkers and Peekskill, said Elizabeth Mascia, 82, the institution's co-founder. 
Maureen Barbelet, the director for the last 18 years, is not shy about cultivating her connections. The 2,500-square-foot center cost $200,000 to establish, due largely to in-kind contributions from people in the community. Sam Vieira, an architect who is a member of the center's board, donated his expertise and coordinated the renovation.
The search for a suitable space, the cobbling together of sufficient grant sources, and the marshaling of community support took seven years, said Ms. Barbelet. 
"I looked at hundreds of spaces before I found this one," she said. "This is a rough time to do something like this, but the need is so great." 
A $95,000 grant from the New York State Dormitory Authority -- which she referred to as her "five-pound grant" -- stipulated that recipients get at least an 11-year lease, which Ms. Barbelet obtained from her landlord. Five full-time staff members, an administrator, an office manager and a handful of part-time workers will tend to their clients' needs. The cost per week for full-time care: $300. Some subsidies are available, but all the slots are already filled. 
The space required some alterations to comply with the building codes aimed at child care centers, including the addition of a second exit at the end of a five-foot-wide, 60-foot-long passageway and the addition of a handicap-accessible bathroom. 
Three slots are reserved for the children of students at Sleepy Hollow High School, whose tuition is covered by public subsidies, and who will be provided with a battery of services, including parenting courses. 
The state of child care in general has prompted calls for reform. Policy experts and researchers have proposed remedies, including voucher programs that offer incentives for improved care, new grant initiatives and a universal preschool program modeled on the federal Head Start program, which is aimed at 4-year-olds from disadvantaged households.
"We're the only country on the planet that doesn't have some kind of national commitment to early childhood education or to paid family leave," said Ms. Mitchell. "It's barbaric. If the Legislature sat down to design a system that worked and was easy to use and operate, it would be the opposite of the patchwork Band-Aid that we have now. Many economists have argued for more collective responsibility, treating it much like public schools, or roads and bridges, and when the economy improves, I think things will start moving in that direction." 
Gov. George E. Pataki eliminated $204 million in spending for universal prekindergarten, money first dispersed in 1997 with the goal of instituting comprehensive early learning opportunities for all 4-year-olds in five years -- an expansion of Head Start. 
For now, centers operate on shoestring budgets that are getting slimmer. 
"People need day care no matter what; it crosses economic boundaries," said Camille Failla Murphy, the director of the county's Office for Women, whose grant to help new infant and toddler centers was cut 20 percent in this year's budget. 
"Our society has to look at the child care situation from the federal level on down and develop some different attitudes," she said. "It's time to put the money where everyone's mouth is. People talk about putting children first, but they don't seem to really be a priority."

HEADLINE: A Musical Maverick Rooted in Trenton 

BYLINE:  By BRIAN WISE 

 BODY:
ONE of the great curiosities of 20th-century music is "Ballet mecanique," a 25-minute percussion-and-piano extravaganza featuring 16 player pianos, electric bells, airplane propellers, an alarm clock and a siren, by Trenton-born composer George Antheil (1900-59). Composed from 1923 to 1925, the work is a clangorous ode to the dawn of the mechanized age, with its pounding rhythms and industrial-level dynamics. 
 The piece created such a stir at its premiere in Paris in 1926 that it established Antheil as a maverick and has overshadowed the accomplishments of his eclectic career, which included a dozen serious keyboard works, a few Romantic symphonies, ballet music, chamber works, jazz songs, film scores and at least one opera. Over the past decade, Antheil's life and work have been the subject of a growing body of scholarship. This Friday through Sunday, at the Conduit arts complex in Trenton, and at various sites around the city, the Composers Guild of New Jersey will sponsor a festival and symposium dedicated to Antheil and his present-day influence. 
 The festival brings together a wide array of performers and scholars for concerts, discussions, lectures, film screenings and even a techno dance party at Trenton's Conduit Nightclub, featuring remixes of "Ballet mecanique." Performers will include Guy Livingston, a pianist who is director of the festival, and the College of New Jersey Percussion Ensemble. Also present will be a number of historians, authors, representatives of Antheil's estate and his nephew, Arthur Antheil McTighe.
Antheil, who took up the piano as a child, left Trenton for Berlin at age 22. There, he quickly made a splash as a pianist with performances of modern pieces in a signature aggressive style that often provoked physical reactions from the audience. His concerts frequently included his own syncopated and dissonant works.
Antheil moved on to Paris in 1923, where he mingled with James Joyce, Ezra Pound, Gertrude Stein, Pablo Picasso, Salvador Dali and Igor Stravinsky, among other famous artists of the time. At one point, he lived in an apartment above Shakespeare & Company, the bookstore owned by Sylvia Beach, who the original publisher of Joyce's "Ulysses."
Suddenly, though, he abandoned this life, returning to the United States, and adopted a neo-classical style in his work. By the late 1930's, he settled in Hollywood where he became a prolific movie composer, a career move that destroyed his credibility among supporters of serious music.
"He never quite managed to make it," said Mr. Livingston, 34, who helped catalog Antheil's manuscripts for the New York Public Library and has recorded Antheil's piano sonatas and performed several recitals of his music, including a program last year program at Princeton University's Taplin Auditorium. "The 'Ballet mecanique' was the high point of his career. He's been viewed as a footnote in 20th-century music."
Mr. Livingston said Antheil's seemingly random stylistic leaps did little to help his reputation. This view is shared by Frank J. Oteri, a New York-based composer and editor of www.newmusicbox.org, a Web site devoted to contemporary American music, who will moderate a discussion on "Futurism vs. Neo-Romanticism in Antheil's Music" at the festival. 
"Antheil was a polystylist who in later years wrote very accessible music that probably hurt his reputation as a maverick," he said. Mr. Oteri added that at the same time, Antheil's "reputation as a maverick hurt his more accessible music from ever finding a wider audience."
Organizers say the festival is designed not only to celebrate Antheil's work, but also to stimulate discussion about New Jersey artists today. They point out that Antheil never abandoned his home state, moving back there toward the end of his life.
Antheil himself described his Trenton upbringing in his entertaining and self-mythologizing autobiography, "Bad Boy of Music," (1945), noting that he was born "across the street from a very noisy machine shop, thus in all probability giving ammunition into the hands of those who claim there is such a thing as prenatal influence."
The composer's loyalty to Trenton is reflected in several piano pieces based on the mechanical sounds of the city's factories, including "The Death of Machines" and the angular "Sonata Sauvage." Scholars say some of his music was inspired by the rural surroundings of Washington Crossing and Titusville. "McConkey's Ferry (Washington at Trenton)" is a 10-minute work inspired by George Washington's crossing of the Delaware River during the Revolutionary War, and "You Can Tell You're in New Jersey" is a work for chorus and piano peppered with references to the region.
Antheil died in Trenton, and is buried in the city's Riverside Cemetary.
Aside from composing prolifically, Antheil was a contributor to Esquire magazine, and also wrote books, including one on endocrinology. In 1942, he co-invented and -patented, with Hedy Lamarr, a device for radio control of missiles that could be used against the Germans. A refined version of this device was used by the American military in the 1960's. 
Antheil had a flair for sensationalism. For example, in his autobiography, he claimed to be an expert sharpshooter, writing that during a 1923 recital in Paris, when the audience was incited by the composer Erik Satie to whistle and heckle, he kept his cool, in part, because he packed a pistol onstage in a silken holster. But as his diverse interests suggest, Antheil was more than a "bad boy." He possessed an original, searching intellect, an aspect of his personality that the festival will underscore this fact with the discussion "Ballet frenetique: The Multiple Lives of George Antheil." 
The festival is a somewhat curtailed version of what was to be alarger celebration sponsored by the city's museums, educational institutions and arts presenters. Financing difficulties stemming from the weak economy and cuts in state arts subsidies forced some of these entities to withdraw. Yamaha Artist Services stepped in at the last minute to provide more financial support.
Frank Brickle, president of the guild, said he hoped a similar event could be presented every two years, drawing attention to other major New Jersey composers and artists.
"Very few people are aware of the position that New Jersey composers have had on the American music scene," he noted. "We want to look back and show New Jersey what they're sitting on, and provide context for present-day composers to function."
The George Antheil Festival 2003 will be presented from Friday through Sunday at the Conduit arts complex in Trenton and at various sites around the city. Information: (917)770-6083 or www.paristransatlantic.com/festival.

HEADLINE: A Peek Inside The Country Club 

BYLINE:  By FRAN SCHUMER

 BODY:
"But when I called, Brenda Patimkin wasn't home. She's having dinner at the club, a woman's voice told me. Will she be home after (my voice was two octaves higher than a choirboy's)? I don't know, the voice said, she may go driving golf balls." 
"Goodbye Columbus" Philip Roth
TO Neil Klugman, Philip Roth's fictional poor boy from Newark, life at the Green Lane Country Club sounded impossibly wonderful. These days, after a winter of orange alerts and endless snow, many people wonder if life at Green Lane's counterparts remains as lush as it was in Mr. Roth's 1950's New Jersey.
 And most of them may never know, since the kind of club that could take a person's mind off duct tape and plastic sheeting is open only to members and their guests. Still, as the season approaches (and in country club parlance, the season is any time a person can subsist on tennis and golf), some clubs are willing to open their massive doors just a crack. Inside, a picture emerges of a style of playing (and living) that is in some ways vastly different from what it was in the halcyon 1950's, and in some ways, remarkably the same. 
 First, some facts about the industry.
There are about 125 country clubs in New Jersey, and -- at least until the stock market's past annus horribilis -- they were hardly suffering. Membership at New Jersey clubs, as in the rest of the nation, rose by about 10 percent to 15 percent during the last two decades, said Kevin Scullen, director of marketing and membership for the National Club Association in Washington. One reason was the healthy economy and the other, the coming of age of the baby boomers or, as Mr. Scullen put it, their coming of "club age," which is the late 40's and upward. 
"People at those ages are more established in their careers and have more time for leisure," he said.
Then there is the money; people over 40 are more likely to have it. At the higher end, membership requires $100,000 or more in initiation fees, at least $10,000 in annual dues and monthly minimums for food and beverages. The extras, of course, are extra -- golf carts, special events, massages.
No wonder when the Dow and the Nasdaq fall, so does membership. Although most clubs in New Jersey remained full during the past season, their waiting lists dropped by about 20 percent, said William G. Hoferer, president of the New Jersey Club Managers Association, which represents 66 clubs in central and northern New Jersey. 
Beyond the numbers, clubs have experienced other changes in the last few decades. In an earlier time, men played with men, women played with women and children were seen only at certain times and in certain places -- usually the pool. These days, however, as the age of the average club members drops (from 60 in 1990 to about 55 today, said Mr. Scullen), these younger members want more exciting family-friendly activities than the annual Mother's Day brunch.
Perhaps for this reason, Echo Lake Country Club in Westfield is offering its first sock hop for families, complete with vintage cars parked around the clubhouse, and the Alpine Country Club in Demarest has installed Sony PlayStation in its fully equipped (and supervised) game room for the children. 
"I never thought I'd be spouting the virtues of a country club, but it's really very family oriented," said Julie Karlitz, a member at Alpine along with her husband and daughters, ages 6 and 8.

Change, by Statute, Has Come
As the clubs have been forced to become more family oriented, the status of women has also changed. In other words, the days of the Men's (Only) Grill are over -- less because of a changed attitude on the part of the members than because of changesin the law. In 1998, the statutes in New Jersey were amended to prevent clubs from discriminating among members on the basis of gender and other factors. 
Until 1998, at Cedar Hill Golf and Country Club in Livingston, for example, there were a main grill and a men's grill. Now there are a main grill and a small grill. Navesink Country Club in Middletown used to specify that during the height of golf season, only men could dine in its members' grill. Now, that privilege is limited to golf members and their guests. (Still, of the club's 230 golf members, 218 are men.)
The men's grill at the Manasquan River Golf Club in Brielle is an exception, but only because its men's grill is adjacent to the men's locker and "it wouldn't be appropriate for women to see men coming out of their lockers for a beer in their BVD's," said Michael Zusack, the general manager.
A final aspect of club life that has changed drastically is the food. Once offered mainly for the convenience of members, food service is now a major area in which clubs compete, snatching up chefs from three- and four-star restaurants (the ex-chef at the Plainfield Country Club was the executive sous-chef at Lespinasse) to satisfy a more food-savvy clientele. Yes, you can still get comfort food like hash and eggs and liver and onions, but also fusion dishes like panko-fried shrimp with ponzu sauce, mahi-mahi in sake broth. At Alpine, which is renowned for its food, the menu offers wagyu Kobe beef carpaccio with white truffle oil and fleur de sel.
"Our club members spend a lot of time in Europe and Florida, particularly in the winter; some have businesses in New York and many are in the Social Register," said Jozsef de Kovacs, general manager of the Deal Golf and Country Club. "We try to keep current with the European restaurants."
Some aspects of club life, however, have not changed as quickly. Ask club managers which ones have the best food, and they will invariably say the Jewish clubs, reflecting the larger reality that many clubs are still largely divided along racial and ethnic lines. Although few managers will speak publicly on the subject, most agree that clubs that would not or did not admit people from certain racial or ethnic groups in the past now probably do, although not in large enough numbers to affect their profile.
"I don't think that any club in this day and age would say that it doesn't admit members of a particular race or ethnic group," said Stephen Wolsky, the general manager at Mountain Ridge, a predominantly Jewish club in West Caldwell. "Just as we have some members who aren't Jewish, Canoe Brook has members who are Jewish, but it's a predominantly Protestant club. Is it by design? Oh, sure. Most of these places started out with a group of people, whether they came from the same city or country, and they tended to band together."
Such tribal tendencies are hardly limited to country club members, but the issue is particularly touchy because of the conflict it raises between various freedoms, the freedom to associate, for example, and freedom of access. Legally, people can associate with anyone they want as long as they do so in private. The question is: are country clubs private? In Georgia, home of the all-male Augusta National Golf Club, they are, and therefore can admit anyone they want. That is not the case in New Jersey, where clubs are more likely to be considered public accommodations and therefore subject to state laws against discrimination, said Frank Askin, a professor at Rutgers Law School. 
Still, the matter has to be decided case by case,and these days, said Jeffrey Burstein, an assistant state attorney general, "I'm not aware of any golf club cases that have gone to the point where there was a final decision -- either by the courts or a state anti-discrimination agency."
People join clubs for many reasons, but some join precisely because they are exclusive.

'Your Own Kind'
"What gives a club its cachet is that it is restricted," said Suzanne Keller, a professor of sociology at Princeton. "In a mobile social system, nobody is very secure. There is always either the threat from below or from above; somebody is always wealthier or brighter, or has the newest or the latest. The country club allows you to display your status and to confine that status to your own kind." 
Of course, people also join for more pedestrian reasons. "You have to be careful not to jump to conclusions and say 'they're all bigots,' or 'they want to separate themselves from the masses,"' said David Wilder, a professor of psychology at Rutgers. "For one person, it may be status to join a certain club; for another, it may be that that's where he can get a tennis court on a Saturday morning."
Then there is the deeper sense of belonging a person is likely to find at a club than at the local mall. "One of the common criticisms of our suburban culture, to paraphrase Gertrude Stein, is that there's no there there," said Professor Wilder. "Geographically, as we spread ourselves out, the club serves some of the functions of the old New England town hall. It's a place to gather, to socialize and to the extent that clubs make their own policies, to perform a civic function."
Here, beyond the Members Only sign, is a glimpse of what you're missing.

Surf and Turf
The Bay Head Yacht Club may be one of the most exclusive clubs at the shore, but for golfers the Manasquan River Golf Club, 10 minutes to the north in Brielle, is surely the better option. The varied course with its 12th through 17th holes on the river attracts so many serious players that the waiting list for golf members remains at four to five years, regardless of stock market malaise and pre-war anxiety.
Manasquan's club was founded in 1922, but part of the clubhouse was built in 1780. Age is one factor that gives this part of the building its dignity; service is the other. Budge and a waiter -- who invariably knows your name -- will rush to freshen your drink or push the cashews closer, or lead you and your party to your favorite table overlooking the river. 
All clubs pride themselves on the degree to which they pamper their members, but Manasquan has reduced the art of coddling to a science. As soon as a member arrives, the server punches the member's number into a computer and up pops notations like: "Both drink vodka martinis up with olives," or "likes to eat in a timely fashion" or "nice but challenging."
The menu on a recent Friday, prepared by Dan Palsi, a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America, featured the basics like steak and potatoes, but also lemon grass and mint-spiked risotto and homemade lemon cookies so light that they melted on your tongue. Fresh lump crabmeat glistened beside a frail Dendrobian orchid. Given the heavy traffic at the shore, members value their affiliation for another reason. "In summer, if you don't belong to a club, you're not going to go out for dinner," said Nancy Ness, a member from Mantoloking.
As one staff member put it, "We have multigazillionaires here and we have plumbers, and we treat everyone equally."
To which a guest replied, "I bet you have multigazillionaires who areplumbers." 
But even multigazillionaires like bargains. Aside from the Sunday night barbecues in summer, one of the club's most popular events is Member Appreciation Night on Wednesday, when a three-course dinner is $16.95.
Mention Alpine Country Club in Demarest and even nonmembers will reminisce about the duck consomme with foie gras they sampled during a visit, or the bottle of Clos Martinet '95 on the club's extensive wine list.
At the club's expense, Nicholas Gatti, the chef, is regularly dispatched to places like France, Italy and the Napa Valley in California to refine his techniques -- and for obvious reasons. One-fourth of the members live in Manhattan, and most of those are on the Upper East Side, where the competition isn't other clubs but three- and four-star restaurants like Il Monello and Daniel.
The hunks of lobster in Mr. Gatti's risotto are the size of golf balls, and the texture of the foie gras is velvet. A competing club recently featured a Chinese dinner and ordered food from a Chinese restaurant; when Alpine held its Chinese Dinner Night, said Robert Mueller, the general manager, Mr. Gatti made everything, "down to the last dumpling."
Apart from dining, life at Alpine revolves around its golf course, designed in 1928 by A.W. Tillinghast, a well-known course designer of the era. The club also offers swimming, tennis and many activities for children. Like its competitors, Alpine has recently relaxed its rules regarding where and when children may appear, but other rules remain inviolate: no "nursemaids, governesses, au pairs, babysitters and other like attendants" on the premises, and no "shirt with printed phrases or slogans." As for nursing mothers, they can, but only in areas where no one is dining.
Perhaps because the club is so close to Manhattan, members occasionally see celebrities like Michael Douglas on the Alpine golf course, or David Burke and Mario Battali visiting the kitchen. But whether people are famous or just rich, for its members there are always the free ice cream sundaes by the pool on Sundays, and an available table even when the dining room is booked.

There Is No 'No'
"The real pampering is in the staff's attitude that there is no 'no,"' said Herb Karlitz, a member from Demarest. 
The entrance to the Navesink Country Club in Middletown is vintage New England prep school: a roaring fire in the vestibule and red-cheeked men and women wearing cable-knit sweaters and bursting with athleticism.
Navesink is one of three clubs in New Jersey that have skating rinks (Beacon Hill Club in Summit and the Essex Hunt Club in Peapack are the others), which is why it is generally as crowded in winter as it is in August.
On a recent Friday, the club seemed like a young person's paradise: a hockey game was in full swing and children from the camp that the club runs during the summer were having their mid-winter reunion. Even when there is not a party, a snack bar next to the hockey rink serves a teenager-friendly menu that includes Drake's Cakes, mozzarella sticks and hot chocolate.
As Dave Schutzenhofer, the general manager, noted, "The profit margin here is better than in our dining room."
In summer, members golf, play tennis and swim and, on clear summer evenings, watch the lights from Red Bank and the hotels in Long Branch. Some of the club's older members are especially devoted - some even say fanatical - about bridge. Although a group of women in their 70's did not make it to the club on the very day in February that a blizzard dumped two feet of snow on the area, they showed up the next day, ready to deal.
"The playground of society," a newspaper clipping called the Orange Lawn and Tennis Club in 1929. These days, members like to say, Orange Lawn is "about tennis and not exclusivity."
Founded in 1886, six years after lawn tennis was introduced into the United States, the club moved from its original location in Orange in the 1920's to 16 hilly acres in South Orange, where it now resides. Tennis was and remains its most serious business. Arthur Ashe, John McEnroe, Rod Laver - a Who's Who of tennis stars -- played on its famous grass courts in the days before the United States Open left the Forest Hills section of Queens for Flushing and switched from grass to a hard surface.
Today, Orange Lawn still features 10 grass courts (some say they rival those at Wimbledon) as well as 10 with a clay-like surface. On either surface, whites are de rigueur in season, a regulation that has become increasingly rare at newer clubs, but which remains a source of pride to Orange Lawn's members.
"There's nothing quite as beautiful as walking by the grass courts in summer and just seeing white on the green," said Natalie Peck, a member from Essex Fells. When there are weddings, tents appear -- and even then, you can hear the gentle "pling pling" of tennis balls in the distance.
The club also features paddle tennis - its five courts are the site of the annual New Jersey Men's State Championships - and on these courts, the dress code is relaxed with a vengeance. Knickers, suspenders, old paint clothes - anything goes, as long as it isn't yellow, which camouflages the ball. For its famously eclectic members, Orange Lawn also features a men's book club, a bicycling club (members have biked through Lancaster, Pa., and the Hamptons) and one of the few greens in the state for lawn bowling, which is the English version of bocce.
As for wining and dining, most of it takes place in the 1848 building that houses the clubhouse. Jackets and ties are scarce, even on Saturday, when the dress code is "smart casual," but the building, with its lofty ceilings, winding staircase and mansion architecture, still oozes charm. An Edith Wharton heroine would be fully at home by the mahogany bar, grandfather clock and hand-painted mural that dates from the time when women still played tennis in dresses.

The Bar Tab Is Way Down
As the average age of members at Orange Lawn has dropped, and their concern with fitness grows, there is another change from the days when their club was "society's playground," said Richard Peck, a member who is a private investor. "The bar tab is way, way down."
"My grandfather loved his golf, his cards and his cigar and he needed a place to do all of them," said Susan Rybnick, whose grandfather, Max Blotner, was among the earliest members of the Crestmont Country Club in West Orange. 
If Mr. Blotner were still alive, he could still play cards at Crestmont, which was founded in 1954 on the site of the former Newark Athletic Club, and certainly golf. But since his era, the club has banned smoking and more recently, cellphones (except near the house phones on the golf course, or within booths inside the clubhouse).
"We've lost members because of that regulation," said Fern Epstein, a member of the club for 14 years.
Crestmont prides itself on its many activities. First and foremost, there is golf. The much-touted course was designed by Donald Ross, also a leading course designer of his era, and is still the site of many tournaments, including the New Jersey Professional Golf Association Match Play Championship for thelast five years, and the U.S. Healthcare Charity Classic, which will take place at Crestmont this year. The club also features a 300-yard driving range, one of the largest in the area.
Members can also swim, play tennis or work out in the new gym, complete with weights and exercise machines. The men's locker features a steam room, a card room, a barber shop (hair cut $11; beard trim, $5) as well as 15 different types of shaving cream for men who prefer to trim their own. There are also an on-call masseur (or masseuse) and a separate slumber room for napping. (All that leisure can be exhausting.)
The women's locker doesn't have a steam room or a slumber room, but it does have a card room as well as a sitting room with a television and copies of Vogue. Its small library features "Six Novels by Colette." 
David Epstein, a member at Crestmont, grew up working as a caddy at the Baltusrol Golf Club in Springfield. 
"The club was my sanctuary," said Mr. Epstein, whose father was a sheet metal worker in Newark. "I loved being outdoors - nature, the grass. I'd caddy all day, then clean the clubs, go in the pro shop and then play the course until it got dark." 
After attending Rutgers on a scholarship from the New Jersey State Golf Association, Mr. Epstein married, had two children and at age 36 -- slightly before he could afford to -- joined Crestmont with money he borrowed from a bank. "I didn't want to wait until I was too old to enjoy my life, and I never regretted it," he said.
As at other clubs, the generations at Crestmont sometimes disagree. When it came to installing the new gym, many of the the younger members were in favor, but older members grumbled that it took away three-quarters of the room in which they played poker and gin.

Accolades for the Kitchen
In 1996, New Jersey Golfer Magazine voted the clubhouse at the Ridgewood Country Club nicest in terms of architecture and the clubhouse at Cedar Hill most accomplished in terms of its food. Seven years later, the kitchen still deserves accolades for its legendarily simple dishes: Caesar salads with teriyaki glazed chicken and broccoli scrambled eggs served with a hailstorm of melt-in-your mouth onions. If only Peter Anderson, the chef for 19 years, would reveal the source of his rugelah, which is certainly the most buttery of any in New Jersey.
Where there is good food, however, there are invariably picky eaters.
"Sometimes I think they stay up until 3 in the morning thinking about dishes to request," Mr. Anderson said from Napa, where he was enjoying a rest. Find six women at a table in the club's popular main grill, and inevitably each will want her chicken cooked differently. 
Aside from catering to members, Cedar Hill also caters to the about 6,600 non-members who attend the weddings and bar mitzvahs held at the club throughout the year. Members get priority, but nonmembers can also use the club for parties, when different rules prevail. Although motorcycles are generally prohibited, at one event the guest of honor rode into the dining room on a Harley.
Like other clubs, Cedar Hill has adapted to changes. One is the growing popularity of golf.
"Now, you see even more children of members taking lessons and wanting to go out on the course," said Marilyn Maloof, a member for 17 years.
To accommodate them, the club has added a second assistant pro to its golfing staff. Also in the interest of family harmony, the club has changed its voting rules. Instead of giving each family one vote, each has two half-votes, so that spouses can each register an opinon.
When they are not eating or swimming or cancelling out each other's vote, members come to Cedar Hill just to relax. During mid-term exams last January, a group of teenagers with Millburn High School shirts sat contentedly in the lobby. In the absence of well-defined neighborhoods, this was their there.

HEADLINE: DEVELOPMENT; 
Wary of Gambling On Future of Track

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

DATELINE: CHERRY HILL 

 BODY:
THE redevelopment of what is probably the most valuable swath of commercial property in South Jersey is not going all that well.
 It was at another time of impending war, in 1941, when Eugene Mori Sr. put up his racetrack, Garden State Park, in what was then a rural burg. With a huge steel-and-wood Victorian-style clubhouse, it was said to be the fanciest track east of Churchill Downs, home of the Kentucky Derby. 
 Its opening was delayed until the spring of 1942. On the appointed day, wartime gasoline rationing did not stop the showman Mr. Mori, who had horse-drawn carriages transport his customers to the track from the Haddonfield train station a mile away. Each fall and spring for more than 50 years, rich stakes races and fine clubhouse food brought the sharp and the fashionable to Garden State Park, from New Jersey and Philadelphia and from around the globe. 
But two years ago, Mr. Mori's showplace finally closed, after a long decline in horse racing throughout the nation. The clubhouse, rebuilt in the image of the original after a fire in 1977, looms up in the middle of the 223-acre property, but most of the barns and ancillary buildings on the once-glorious property are dilapidated and frayed.
In January 2002, Realen Properties Inc., of Berwyn, proposed a grand plan, in partnership with the owners of the track, Turnberry Associates Inc. of Aventura, Fla., to transform the property with a $500 million mix of housing, office, hotels and open space. Susan Bass Levin, then the mayor of Cherry Hill, lauded the plan at a news conference as finally giving the sprawling suburb a downtown center.
But with more hurdles than a marathon steeplechase, Realen was soon struggling. The owner of a local Shop-Rite supermarket complained that a large Wegman's market on the site would ruin his business. Housing activists sued, saying that the developers were not planning enough low-income housing on the site. Elderly residents of the area worried that too much new housing would attract young families with more children, thus raising taxes for schools. Other residents fretted about the traffic such a big project would generate. And the economy was not cooperating, with new office space hardly at the top of most companies' lists.
Last month, Realen and Turnberry said their partnership had fallen apart.
"Essentially, this is a mixed-use large construction project which requires a lot of planning and a lot of new businesses to come in," said Joel L. Naroff, the chief economist for Commerce Bancorp. "You have to look several years out, and commitments are tough at this point because of the economy. 
"This is a big property and there are times when big is tougher than small. But it is a gorgeous location. It has mass transit nearby, good roads, even fertile fields from all the horse manure. There is no place like it anywhere around the state so close to a city, just 10 minutes from Philly. Everyone just wants to be careful, I think."
Dennis Maloomian, the president of Realen, who had been voluble for the months his company was proposing the project, declined to comment. 
Turnberry, whose lawyers said they had advised against comment about the project because of the housing lawsuit, has taken on a new local partner, M&M Properties, which has mostly developed housing in Piscataway and Clifton.
Bernie Platt, elected last fall to fill the term of Mayor Levin, now the commissioner of the state Department of Community Affairs, said the partnership foundered as Realen apparently lost enthusiasm for the project when so many roadblocks arose.
"Nothing has changed in my mind as far as the development of Garden State Park," Mr. Platt said. "I still have as much passion and commitment to seeing the park developed, though maybe some in that company didn't think so. It's just that these things need the support of the entire community."
They also require timely payment of taxes, Mr. Platt said. Last June, Realen-Turnberry had to pay $923,469.82 in taxes to avoid a sheriff's sale on the property.
Turnberry obviously remains interested in the redevelopment project, even though its commitment was questioned when it bought the property in December 2000 from International Thoroughbred Breeders Inc., which last ran the track. The $43 million that Turnberry paid International Thoroughbred Breeders also bought it a defunct casino in Las Vegas. Turnberry has since converted that property to a $600 million condominium development. Most of Turnberry's malls and commercial and housing projects are in Florida or Nevada, and the Garden State project is not mentioned at all on an extensive list on the company's Web site, www.turnberry.com.
Still, Mr. Naroff is not worried.
"Sometimes, despite what they say, some delay in projects doesn't concern developers," he said. "They want to have their ducks in a row and, especially in a slow economy, it takes a long time to work out lead tenants."
Turnberry and whoever eventually develops the property will have to contend with Peter J. O'Connor, a lawyer who represents the Fair Share Housing Center and two chapters of the N.A.A.C.P., in southern Burlington County and Camden County. Mr. O'Connor is determined that Garden State Park's new incarnation will have lots of housing for low- and moderate-income families and has sued the developers and the township to make sure that happens. So far, a special master has decreed that the project include 285 to 300 lower-cost units.
But Mr. O'Connor wants to make Garden State a model for the rest of the state, and perhaps the country, for bringing low-cost housing to suburban development.
"I argued a case in West Windsor last year in which two justices on the New Jersey Supreme Court said there had to be some new factual basis to address affordable housing," Mr. O'Connor said. "Let's just say that Garden State should be that case. It has the open space we need to talk about when we talk about affordable housing."
One idea proposed soon after the track closed was to convert the whole site into community park space, with everything from an artificial lake for sailing, wooded areas for hiking and a number of playing fields. Freeholder-Director Jeffrey Nash of Camden County called that idea unrealistic.
"Certainly we need to save space for the community, but this is a highly desirable area and it has to generate tax revenue," Mr. Nash said. He said he would like to see a South Jersey arts center on the site that would be devoted to community theater, dance and music as well as small acts to produce income.
"We're not talking about Philadelphia's Kimmel Center here, or the facility in Newark," he said. "But South Jersey doeshave to have something like this to call its own."
"Still, the bottom line is that you expect some bumps in the road on projects like this," he said. "I don't see anything as insurmountable here, just that we might have to wait until the economy gets better. I know people have concerns about traffic and housing, but it will all get resolved."
For now, though, as the barns and clubhouse sit rotting and idle, feral cats seem to have the run of the property.
"The big problem is that a project of this size will naturally change the area forever," said Mr. Naroff of Commerce Bancorp. "No one wants to be blamed for creating a white elephant. So, for a time, I guess, people are just waiting."

HEADLINE: Arts Council Awards Announced 

BYLINE:  By ROBERTA HERSHENSON 

 BODY:
THE Westchester Arts Council announced Wednesday that nine individuals and organizations will receive this year's Arts Awards. 
 Arts Awards do not involve grants or prizes but have been given for 27 years in recognition of achievement and contribution to the county's cultural scene. Winners are chosen by a committee of council board members, acting on recommendations from an independent panel. The awardees will be celebrated at a luncheon on April 9 at 11:30 at the Rye Town Hilton in Port Chester. 
 Jan Adelson of Scarborough will receive the Individual award, which is given to a person who lives or works in Westchester County and has shown "extraordinary leadership and personal commitment" to the arts. Ms. Adelson was named for her work on the boards of Lyndhurst, the Hudson River Museum and Historic Hudson Valley. 
Awards for work that is widely recognized and has made an impact on the community will be given to the pianist Helene Grimaud of South Salem, the muralist Richard Haas of Yonkers and the writer Esmeralda Santiago of Katonah. 
Ms. Grimaud, who was born and raised in France, is a concert and recording artist who is known both for the intensity of her playing and for the wolves she has a license to raise on her property.
Mr. Haas, a longtime Yonkers resident, paints large-scale trompe l'oeil architectural murals that have enhanced city walls and rooftops across the country. 
Ms. Santiago lived with her large family in Puerto Rico before moving to Brooklyn in 1961, at the age of 13. Her books include two memoirs, "When I Was Puerto Rican" (Addison-Wesley, 1993) and "Almost a Woman" (Perseus,1998), and the novel "America's Dream" (HarperCollins, 1996) . 
The Music Conservatory of Westchester will receive the Arts Organization award, given to a group that has influenced the county's cultural life over a "significant period of time." 
The Education award will be presented to Sarah Lawrence College in Bronxville for its theater outreach program. The council noted the college's 30-year record of bringing emerging artists into the public schools, and introducing studentsto the performing arts.
There are three recipients of the Community award: Piper Theater Productions in Yonkers, for bringing "accessible, high-quality theater to Yonkers" and staging free summer performances of Shakespeare in Untermyer Park; Songcatchers of New Rochelle, for its 25-year commitment to providing music instruction to economically disadvantaged children; and Sarah Bracey White of Elmsford, executive director of the Greenburgh Arts and Culture Committee, for arts programming that includes the development of six town galleries, outreach programs at the Greenburgh shelters and a poetry contest. 
This year's panelists were Christopher Beach, executive director, Performing Arts Center of Purchase College;.Creighton Michael, an artist from Mount Kisco; the actress. Zoe Caldwell of Pound Ridge; Manly Romero, a musician and composer from New Rochelle; Shirley Contino-Phillips, vice president of Westchester Community Collegeand executive director of the Westchester Community Foundation; Annette St. John, a musician from Mount Vernon, and Lucie Lapovsky, president of Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry.

HEADLINE: Lobstermen Look for Answers 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE NADEL 

 BODY:
EIGHT men sat back to back at two adjoining booths on the 7:30 a.m. ferry to Bridgeport on March 7, keeping to themselves, speaking quietly in deep voices, like guests at a funeral. These solid-looking men, with thick, calloused hands and heavy clothing made for outdoor work, plainly were not part of the usual crowd of commuters and casino day-trippers.
 They were lobstermen, and they were on their way to another scientific dissection of an event that has threatened their livelihoods: a still-mysterious Long Island Sound lobster die-off that began in 1999. 
 "Most of the guys haven't checked their gear for months -- there's nothing to check," said George Dahl, chairman of the New York Lobster Conservation Management Team and vice president of the Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association. 
John Davi, 39, a lobsterman from Port Jefferson, N.Y., said that between late September and the end of last year he lost money every time he took out his boat, at a cost of about $600 a day for bait, fuel and labor. "Things were good five years ago," he said. "We lost a lot of lobsters." 
So Mr. Dahl and his colleagues had plenty of time to go to Bridgeport for the third annual lobster health symposium, sponsored by the Sea Grant Projects of New York and Connecticut, to hear the scientists report on their latest attempts to find out why the Sound's lobsters have been dying.
Long Island Sound lobster landings, reported at 10.4 million pounds in 1998 by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, dropped to 3.6 million pounds in 2000. After a slight decline in 2001, last year's harvest plunged again, to an estimated 2.5 million pounds. 
"Until September of last year, we were having a fair year," said John German, 55, president of the Long Island Lobstermen's Association. "Then in September-October, there was a major die-off. This year, I'd predict a couple of hundred thousands pounds, if that. The lowest ever." 
Lobstermen are close-mouthed about their income, which makes it hard to get accurate estimates of their financial losses. But in 2002, there were 414 licensed lobstermen in Connecticut, down from 538 in 1998. In New York, there were 600 in 2001, the last year for which complete figures are available.
For the lobstermen, there is little love lost between them and the scientists.
"There are a lot of bean counters here, but the fishermen are suffering," said Nick Crismali, 52, of Guilford, president of the Connecticut Lobstermen's Association. "I'm just interested in knowing where your program is going now that the fishermen are disappearing." 
Carl LoBue of the New York D.E.C. responded, "We recognize that if it wasn't for fishermen, we wouldn't be in this room." But neither Mr. LoBue nor the four scientists who presented their findings on environmental stressors, physiological responses to stress, parasites and pesticides could predict when the situation would improve, and none had an explanation for the disaster that could satisfy the lobstermen. 
Alistair Dove, a senior research associate at the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine who runs a shellfish pathology lab at Stony Brook University, identified a fatal disease called calcinosis in 20 lobsters analyzed between August and October of last year. Calcinosis, in which stony deposits form in the lobster's gills, causing respiratory failure, is caused by excess calcium. This is the first time this disease has shown up in Long Island Sound lobsters.
Dr. Dove also hypothesized that warm water temperatures during the summers of 2001 and 2002 stressed the lobsters' immune systems so that they were vulnerable to infection. Further, the warm water created favorable conditions for paramoebas and parasites. 
The most hotly debated topic pertaining to the die-off is whether pesticides sprayed against West Nile virus-bearing mosquitoes in 1999 were washed into the Sound a few days after Hurricane Floyd swept through the region, killing the lobsters. Jack Mattice, 61, director of the New York Sea Grant program in Riverhead, doubted the pesticides were to blame.
"The lobsters started dying before the first pesticides were sprayed in 1999," Mr. Mattice said.
The night before the conference in Bridgeport, fishermen learned that a lawsuit filed on their behalf against the pesticide manufacturer Cheminova was granted class certification status. The suit charges Cheminova with causing economic harm to the lobstermen after its pesticide Fyfanon, a malathion product, was sprayed in Nassau and Suffolk counties in 1999.
Cheminova's attorney, Christopher Kelly, did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment.
"Class certification is one step on a long road," said Gladstone Jones, a New Orleans environmental lawyer who is representing the lobstermen on both sides of the Sound. He predicted that the case would go before a jury in federal court in Islip, N.Y. this fall, at which time 300 to 500 lobstermen will be named as plaintiffs.

HEADLINE: Wages at Issue for Building Owners and Service Workers 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE 

 BODY:
Facing a contract deadline of April 21, owners of New York City apartment buildings and the union representing 28,000 doormen, janitors and other building service workers, agree that negotiations are going to be tough because of hard times for the city's economy and its real estate industry.
 The current three-year contract covers building service employees at 3,000 buildings in Manhattan, Brooklyn and Queens with a smattering on Staten Island and in Nassau County. It expires at 12:01 a.m. April 21, the day after Easter and four days after the start of Passover. 
 The union and the building owners and managers agree that wages are likely to be the biggest obstacle. Management officials say they want a wage freeze of one year or more with lump sum payments instead of raises; the union is seeking raises of at least several percent a year to keep up with inflation. 
"I think the toughest issue is going to be wages," said James F. Berg, president of the Realty Advisory Board on Labor Relations, which handles negotiations for many owners and managers of large buildings. "We're going to try to work out a deal that is probably a little sparser than usual because of the tough economic times we're having."
But Michael Fishman, president of the union, Local 32B-32J of the Service Employees International Union, said the proposed wage freeze would be a big problem for workers covered by the contract, who include elevator operators, superintendents and people who make repairs.
"We're looking for a wage increase in all three years," he said, but would not be more specific. "We're saying we want a fair wage increase every year. The cost of daily living is continuing to go up."
Every three years before the building workers' contract comes up for renewal, raising the specter of a strike, building owners and managers warn apartment residents about possible disruptions and delays in sorting mail, making repairs and cleaning common areas.
Mr. Fishman said that he would not rule out a strike, but that he wanted to avoid one.
"I would hope there doesn't have to be a strike," he said.
"Both of us are coming to the table understanding we're facing a time when it doesn't serve the union's interests, the industry's interests, the public's or the city's to have a strike."
The union is urging management to agree to far-reaching safety training, which would include teaching workers how to handle suspicious packages and coordinate emergencies with police officers and firefighters.
"Our members are put in harm's way," Mr. Fishman said. "We're on the front line. We're asked to check out a lot of things in the building. We want our members to be safe."
The union argues that management can easily afford significant raises, noting that co-op and condominium prices as well as apartment rents are higher than in 1999. But real estate officials note that co-op and condo prices and apartment rents have generally been softer since the terrorist attack a year and a half ago.
"With the property tax increases and the increases in the price of oil and increased costs for insurance," Mr. Berg said, "a tremendous burden has been put on the buildings in terms of operating costs."
Under the existing contract, most porters and janitors earn $34,350 a year, while repair workers earn $37,840. That contract allowed for annual wage and benefit increases of 3.3 percent, 3.2 percent and 3.9 percent, which industry officials noted was higher than the inflation rate.
The union has called on management to increase its annual contributions for health insurance and pensions and to end its practice of paying new building service workers 20 percent less than other workers during their first 30 months on the job.

HEADLINE: War, or Peace, in Iraq? 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Leadership is more than simply making up one's mind and proceeding on a course of action, heedless of the consequences. 
Yet that is what the Bush administration has done with regard to Iraq (front page, March 14).
 In the name of goals it has neither clarified nor successfully defended, the Bush administration has squandered decades of international cooperation, increased the likelihood that fundamentalist terrorists will attack us, spent untold sums on an ill-advised military buildup and endangered the health of our economy. 
 At this point, the question for Americans to ponder is how the administration might extricate itself from the box in which it has seemingly trapped itself.

HEADLINE: McGreevey To Give Back Arts Funds 

BYLINE:  By JILL P. CAPUZZO 

DATELINE: TRENTON 

 BODY:
FACING a highly organized and unrelenting swell of criticism throughout the state over plans to eliminate all financial support for cultural institutions, Governor McGreevey will now press for the restoration of at least half of the funds that had been earmarked for the arts, according to high-ranking administration officials.
 "A decision has been made to find the means to provide funding for arts communities across the state," said James P. Fox, Governor McGreevey's chief of staff. 
 While sources in the governor's office said it was "not fully realistic" for the New Jersey State Council on the Arts to expect to have its entire $18 million budget restored, about 50 percent of that amount -- which the arts community had been pleading for since the governor announced the cuts last month -- would not be unreasonable.
"We will be working with the Legislature to do it," Eric Shuffler, counselor to Governor McGreevey said. "It's a very fluid process. We might have some ideas where the money can come from and the legislators might have other ideas. But it starts with a determination, and that's where we are now." 
The concession on the arts issue marks the first gambit in what is certain to be a drawn-out budget battle between the governor's office, the Legislature and constituent groups. Nearly six weeks after going public with his budget proposal, Mr. McGreevey and his staff recognized it was time to "enter a different phase," as one administration official put it.
With theater audiences in the state being bombarded nightly with anti-McGreevey messages and a postcard and letter-writing campaign in full swing, administration officials concede that they might have underestimated the power of the arts community, while overplaying their hand in slashing the arts funds in an effort to chip away at the state's $5 billion budget shortfall.
"This was a particularly difficult decision for the governor to make," a source close to Mr. McGreevey said. "If we had to do it all over again, I don't think we'd cut it to zero."
The proposed cuts were expected to affect about 700 arts organizations and projects in the state, 150 of which receive grants directly from the New Jersey Council on the Arts, with the remaining 550 groups being financed by state dollars that are funneled through county arts agencies. The $18 million that the council received for the current fiscal year was down $2 million from the previous year, although most of that was made up last fall through other grants. 
Restoration of the financing for the arts will still require legislative approval, and the specific amount to be allocated may not be known until the process is completed in early summer. Since announcing a number of draconian measures last month in an effort to reduce the budget, the governor has had some general discussions with legislators, though he has not informed them of his intention to restore funds for the arts, according to Mr. Shuffler. 
He declined to speculate on what other programs might have to be cut to come up with the money for the arts, but he emphasized that the funds would have to found within the existing budget, reiterating the governor's vow not to increase taxes. 
For now, the governor's office is trying to piece together a second, more immediate source of funds for the arts, tourism and cultural organizations by tapping into the resources of the state's economic development authorities. This could siphon off as much as $5 million to $10 million from such agencies as the New Jersey Economic Development Authority and the Delaware River Port Authority, Mr. Shuffler said. 
"We're looking at using the power of the economic development authorities to support the arts and tourism because these are economic development engines," Mr. Shuffler said, noting that this source of money could be available in as little as two months.
"Our goal is to keep these arts groups sustained until we can increase state funding," the governor's counselor said. "What we'll be looking to offer is not going to be something trivial. But at the same time, they have to respect the fact that spending is down everywhere and they'll have to do some belt-tightening of their own."
Restoring funds for the arts became the governor's first priority for both personal and political reasons, a high-ranking aide to the governor said. Of all the stringent measures Governor McGreevey proposed in his 2004 budget -- including the elimination of 109 grant programs, a 12 percent cut in state funds for higher education, a $76 million reduction in the state's Family Care Program that helps insure children of the working poor and increases in hotel and casino gaming taxes -- the cuts in arts spending created the greatest furor, even though it represents only one-tenth of 1 percent of the budget.
While playing down the political motivation behind the decision to restore money for the arts, one official conceded that the battle had become very heated.
"We understand the process is now changing," the official said. "It is O.K .to let people know that we're not automatons, marching ahead in lock step, not listening to anyone."
In his budget address before both houses of the Legislature on Feb. 4, Governor McGreevey did not mince words about his plans for the arts. "We have made unprecedented cuts in culture and the arts," he said, "eliminating entirely all Arts Council grants, the Cultural Trust, the Historical Commission and the Historic Site Management Program." 
On a subsequent whistle-stop tour of diners throughout the state just days later, he continued to emphasize the drastic measures necessary for grappling with the state's budget shortfall because of the sharp drop in income tax revenue and escalating costs of state programs. 
While the budgets of most departments in the state were reduced by 10 or 15 percent, the Department of State, which oversees the Arts Council, had its financing slashed by close to 90 percent, with the Arts Council having the distinction of being the only agency whose funds were entirely eliminated.
It did not take long for the arts community to complain bitterly. For one thing, some of the state's wealthiest and most influential individuals sit on the boards of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center, the New Jersey Symphony, the McCarter Theater and other prominent arts institutions. And the venues themselves quickly organized and put out the message to patrons that the governor had made a mistake.

Bombing Every Night
Night after night throughout the state, performances and concerts have been delayed for a few minutes as theater officials fill audiences in on Governor McGreevey's plan to eliminate funds for the arts and urge them to call on their elected officials. 
In addition, ArtsPride New Jersey initiated a letter-writing campaign, with 250,000 postcards being handed out to patrons of theaters, museums and historic sites throughout the state to be filled out and delivered to the Legislature this spring.
At a gathering in Westfield last week that was organized by State Senator Thomas H. Kean Jr., about 100 representatives from various arts and cultural organizations arrived at a decision to start scheduling appointments with their state legislators. And high school and college students have been organizing petition drives.
Through these tactics, elected officials and the public have been made more aware of the proposed arts cuts than perhaps any other aspect of the governor's budget.
"These are wealthy, educated, sophisticated groups who have done a very good job," Mr. Shuffler said. "They've gotten their point across."
As Lawrence Goldman, executive director of the New Jersey Performing Arts Center in Newark, said recently, "This has unleashed sources even greater than the governor thought were out there in support of the arts."
Each night at the Performing Arts Center, curtain speeches have been greeted by a round of boos for the governor. "It's been very encouraging to see that the people of New Jersey at all levels, from the neighborhood to the schools to the philanthropists really give a damn about the arts," Mr. G0ldman said.
Arts programs have historically been targeted when fiscal constraints require government belt-tightening. Twelve years ago, financing for arts was cut in half by Gov. James Florio.
With 46 states now struggling with severe budget crises because of losses in federal aid and a struggling economy, New Jersey is not the only state taking a hard look at its arts programs. The governor of Missouri has also recommended eliminating that state's arts council, while a legislative committee in Arizona is debating a similar measure. 
If New Jersey -- or either of these other two states -- succeeded in eliminating financing for the arts, that would place it in the rare position of being the only state to have no mechanism in place for supporting the arts, or for serving as a matching recipient of national arts funds. 
Despite its recent emphasis on homeland security and military spending, even the federal government managed to find additional funds for the arts, increasing the National Endowment for the Arts budget by $10 million, to $126 million, for fiscal year 2003. Without a state arts agency, New Jersey would risk losing its share of funds from the endowment, which last year amounted to more than $2 million. 
In its effort to lobby Trenton, the arts community has argued not only for the intrinsic value of arts and culture for New Jersey's citizenry, but also for the fiscal benefits derived from hundreds cultural and historical sites throughout the state.
In a 2000 study by Rutgers University's Graduate School of Education, arts and cultural organizations were credited with generating $27 million in state taxes, and contributing $1 billion to the state's economy, including everything from ticket sales to ancillary tourism spending.

Hearing a Mixed Message
One aspect the arts community has found most frustrating in the budget debate has been the mixed messages delivered by the governor. In a speech last July before hundreds of representatives of the arts community, Governor McGreevey acknowledged what he called a "lack of predictability with the state government", and went on to offer a "fiscal commitment between the State of New Jersey and the arts community so that over the next three-and-a-half years there is a high degree of predictability and consistency within the arts community."
In defending the state's decision to turn its back on the arts, members of the McGreevey administration said they could not predict at that time the size of the deficit the state would be facing this year, which would require drastic cuts across the board. The argument also became one of priorities. 
"We have 70,000 people losing health insurance," said Mr. Shuffler. "It's harder to justify spending on items such as the arts when you are cutting health insurance for the poorest of the poor." 
In addition to restoring funds for the arts, he said the governor would also like to find a way to restore some funds for higher education and health care. But with the arts budget representing only a small fraction of the budget, the official said that it was easier to replenish those funds.
"It's easier to make an impact by restoring 50 percent of the arts funding than it is to restore 50 percent of some of the other cuts," Mr. Shuffler said.

HEADLINE: What's Killing the Lobsters? 

BYLINE:  By LAURIE NADEL 

DATELINE: PORT JEFFERSON 

 BODY:
EIGHT men sat back to back at two adjoining booths on the 7:30 a.m. ferry to Bridgeport on March 7, keeping to themselves, speaking quietly in deep voices, like guests at a funeral. These weather-beaten, solid-looking men, with thick, calloused hands and heavy clothing made for outdoor work, plainly were not part of the crowd of commuters and casino day-trippers.
 They were lobstermen, and they were on their way to another scientific dissection of an event that has threatened their livelihoods: the still-mysterious die-off of lobsers in Long Island Sound that began in 1999. 
 "Most of the guys haven't checked their gear for months -- there's nothing to check," said George Dahl, chairman of the New York Lobster Conservation Management Team and vice president of the Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association. The cold winter had covered many harbors with ice, he said, making it impossible for many lobstermen to get to their traps. 
 John Davi, 39, a lobsterman from Port Jefferson who sails out of Mount Sinai, said that between late September and the end of last year he lost money every time he took out his boat, at a cost of $600 a day for bait, fuel and labor. "Things were good five years ago," he said. "We lost a lot of lobsters." 
Mr. Dahl, a 57-year-old Northport resident, said that when he last checked 400 of his 2,000 traps in December, his catch was a mere 25 lobsters. "How much money can you afford to lose before you stop?" he asked.
So Mr. Dahl and his colleagues had plenty of time to go to Bridgeport for the third annual lobster health symposium, sponsored by the Sea Grant Projects of New York and Connecticut, to hear the scientists report on their latest attempts to find out why the Sound's lobsters have been dying. 
For centuries, lobstering was a profitable occupation in the Sound. Local lobstermen grew up working as mates on family-owned boats before becoming captains of their own vessels. That traditional way of life suffered a shock in the fall of 1999 when, almost overnight, more than 90 percent of the lobsters hauled up in the western Sound were dead.
"It was the strangest thing," said Joe Finke, president of the Western Long Island Sound Lobstermen's Association. "They looked perfectly healthy when we hauled them up, but a lot of them were dead."
Mr. Finke, 47, who lives in Bayville and sails out of Glen Cove, recalled packing the few healthy lobsters for market, only to receive a call from the wholesaler in Point Lookout saying all of the shipment was dead on arrival. 
Lobster landings in the Sound, reported at 10.4 million pounds in 1998 by the New York Department of Environmental Conservation and the Connecticut Department of Environmental Protection, dropped to 3.6 million pounds in 2000. After a slight decline in 2001, last year's harvest plunged again, to an estimated 2.5 million pounds. 
"Until September of last year, we were having a fair year," said John German, 55, president of the Long Island Lobstermen's Association. "Then in September-October, there was a major die-off. This year, I'd predict a couple of hundred thousands pounds, if that. The lowest ever." 
"If the lobsters don't show up by May, a lot of guys will pack it in," said Mr. German, who sails out of Mount Sinai and lives in Brookhaven. "Next year's figures will really tell the tale." 
The die-off has already proved fatal to many lobstermen's livelihoods. "We've had three years to adjust, but the loss is never going to pass," said Mr. Finke, who now charters his boat to scientists from the New York Sea Grant Project to haul traps for lab research.
Lobstering, a cash business, is part of the underground economy. Lobstermen are close-mouthed about their income, which makes it hard to get accurate estimates of their financial losses. But in 1997 there were 888 licensed lobstermen in New York State. By 2001, the last year for which complete figures are available, the number had dropped to 600. In Connecticut, the 1998 total was 538, and in 2002 it was 414.
As the ferry docked in Bridgeport, the lobstermen looked as if they were being forced to spend Thanksgiving with relatives they didn't like. "These meetings are useless," said Mr. Dahl, for whom a satisfying day's work used to mean standing on the pitching steel deck of his boat and hauling in several hundred wire traps filled with mud-covered sea life that might or might not include lobsters. On a good day, Mr. Dahl would bring home as much as 700 pounds of the Sound's most profitable shellfish. 
For the lobstermen, there is little love lost between them and the scientists. The prevalent view is that the academics depend on the lobster die-off for their research funds and are in no rush to restore the resource. Mr. Dahl contends that none of the money spent on experiments is helping the lobstermen or bringing back the lobsters.
"In 2001, at the first forum, the scientists said they had to use us in their research because we had knowledge of the resource," he said. "They got their money, and then they wanted nothing to do with us."
Nick Crismali, president of the Connecticut Lobstermen's Association, expressed a similar point of view. "There are a lot of bean counters here, but the fishermen are suffering," said a Mr. Crismali, 52, of Guilford. "I'm just interested in knowing where your program is going now that the fishermen are disappearing." 
Carl LoBue of the New York D.E.C. responded, "We recognize that if it wasn't for fishermen, we wouldn't be in this room." But neither Mr. LoBue nor the four scientists who presented findings on environmental stresses, physiological responses to stress, parasites and pesticides could predict when the situation would improve, and none had an explanation for the disaster that satisfied the lobstermen. For example, all Carmela Cuomo, a geology professor at Yale, could say was that "something funky is going on in September and October." 
Alistair Dove, a senior research associate at the Cornell College of Veterinary Medicine who runs a shellfish pathology lab at Stony Brook University, reported on a fatal disease called calcinosis found in 20 lobsters analyzed from August to October last year. Calcinosis, in which stony deposits form in the lobster's gills, causing respiratory failure, is caused by excess calcium. This was the first time this disease has shown up in Long Island Sound lobsters.
Dr. Dove, a 29-year-old Coram resident, hypothesized that warm water temperatures during the summers of 2001 and 2002 stressed the lobsters' immune systems so that they were vulnerable to infection. Further, the warm water created favorable conditions for paramoebas and parasites. 
Whether they are just a natural variation or a sign of global warming, higher water temperatures are beyond the control of those who live near the Sound or make a living on it. But Dr. Dove was not ready to discount pollution as a factor. "Paramoebae and parasites can have a role," he said. "Pesticides could be a factor. It can easily be a multifactorial problem."
The most hotly debated topic pertaining to the die-off is whether it was caused by pesticides sprayed against mosquitoes in 1999, then washed into the Sound a few days after Hurricane Floyd swept through.
Jack Mattice, 61, director of the New York Sea Grant program in Riverhead, doubts that pesticides were to blame. "The lobsters started dying before the first pesticides were sprayed in 1999," Mr. Mattice said.
He also argued that the pattern of the die-off did not fit the pesticide theory. "I would have expected that we would see the initial effects in the small bays and backwaters where the washout would first have occurred, not going out to the middle of the Sound almost immediately," he said. 
Mr. Mattice's opinions did not go over well with the lobstermen. Many of them say a variety of factors may be in play -- several lobstermen and scientists believe a part of the problem is the recent rebound in striped bass, a major predator of lobsters. But bass or paramoebae cannot be required to pay damages.
The night before the conference in Bridgeport, the lobstermen learned that a lawsuit filed on their behalf against the pesticide manufacturer Cheminova had been certified as a class action. The suit accuses Cheminova of causing economic harm to the lobstermen after its pesticide Fyfanon, a malathion product, was sprayed in Nassau and Suffolk in 1999.
During the pretrial discovery phase of the case, the lobstermen's lawyer, Gladstone Jones, established that in 1999 Cheminova failed to label barrels of Fyfanon with a warning mandated by the Environmental Protection Agency. Exhibit A in Mr. Jones's filing, submitted to Judge E. Thomas Boyle of Federal District Court in Central Islip last August, is the warning that the E.P.A. ordered Cheminova to use. It begins: "Application may not be made around bodies of water where fish or shellfish are grown and/or harvested commercially."
In a May 2002 letter to Christie Whitman, the E.P.A. director, Mr. Jones said that Cheminova stored Fyfanon in warehouses and storage tanks where the temperature reached at least 115 degrees, causing leaks and converting malathion to isomalathion, "a significantly more toxic chemical." 
Cheminova's lawyer, Christopher Kelly, did not respond to telephone calls seeking comment.
"Class certification is one step on a long road," said Mr. Jones, a New Orleans environmental lawyer who is representing lobstermen on both sides of the Sound. "We still have major hurdles, but we can bundle all the lobstermen together." He predicted that the case would go to trial this fall, at which time 300 to 500 lobstermen will be named as plaintiffs. 
At the symposium, the pesticide argument received a boost when Sylvan de Guise, a veterinary pathologist at the University of Connecticut, reported that his experiments proved that lobsters were sensitive to malathion. He said lobsters die when exposed to 33 parts per billion of malathion, a level that James O'Donald, a marine scientist at the University of Connecticut, calculated would have been present as far as 10 miles out into the western Sound after Hurricane Floyd.
The storm on Sept. 17, 1999, after stepped-up aerial spraying of pesticide that summer, when the West Nile virus made its first appearance. "It takes half as much malathion to kill a lobster than to kill a walleye," Dr. de Guise said. "Walleyes are considered sensitive to malathion."
But he was not ready to declare a eureka moment. "What does it mean?" he asked. "We're not quite sure. We would have to follow the lobsters in real life before exposure and follow them afterward. This is very difficult to do retrospectively. We cannot rule out effects we have not measured." 
The lobstermen filed onto the 4:45 ferry for the ride home looking exhausted and agreeing that they had not learned anything new. "None of this will bring the lobsters back," Mr. German said. "Every year there are less lobstermen and less lobstermen -- and more scientists."

HEADLINE: Schools That Try To Keep Students Out 

BYLINE:  By VIVIAN S. TOY 

 BODY:
FROM inside an unmarked car, Nick Luciano trained his video camera on the house where his suspect supposedly lived and waited for her to come out. It was just after sunrise.
 About an hour into the stakeout, she emerged and got into a taxicab. With that on tape, he had what he needed.
 Mr. Luciano is a retired New York City police detective who has dealt with his share of low-lifes and criminals. But his quarry last week was a junior high school student in the Valley Stream Central High School District. 
Someone had phoned in a tip that she came to school in a cab, which raised suspicions that she might not actually live in the district but was coming from across the border in Queens. As it turned out, she does live in the district and just happens to take cabs to school.
"That's not the norm for Valley Stream," Mr. Luciano said. "But she came out of the house and it is what it is." Case closed.
But there are many other cases where Mr. Luciano has staked out a home, made unannounced visits or used other investigative techniques to prove that a child did not live in the Valley Stream district. He said that since he started working as the district's first full-time residency investigator last summer, he has prevented more than 130 students living in New York City or elsewhere from going to school in Valley Stream.
Nassau school districts on the Queens border have grappled with the problem of nonresidents trying to sneak into their schools for years. But with rising property taxes and the recent threatened loss of state education funding, school officials and homeowners in these districts say now more than ever they need to make sure that only those who are entitled to an education in their districts get to stay in their schools.
At least seven Nassau school districts bordering on Queens hire investigators to spy on suspected nonresidents. The number of students expelled as a result ranges from a handful in the Great Neck district to about 20 students a year at the Lawrence public schools and more than 100 a year in Valley Stream and in the Sewanhaka Central High School District, which encompasses Elmont, Floral Park, Franklin Square and part of New Hyde Park. While the vast majority of nonresidents in border districts come from Queens, school officials said they have discovered interlopers from as far away as Staten Island and Farmingdale.
The cost to the school districts ranges from the uncalculated expense of the time that school officials divert from other duties to investigate residency to the $350,000 a year that Sewanhaka pays detectives and lawyers to weed out nonresidents. School officials say the money, whatever the amount, is well spent since every nonresident child that is kept out saves the district $10,000 a year. 
"We have to balance the rights of our taxpayers and our responsibilities to them with our concern for the students," said Ronald D. Valenti, superintendent of the Valley Stream Central High School District, which has 4,600 students in grades 7 through 12. "We want to educate every child to the fullest who is truly a resident of Valley Stream, but we can't extend that benefit to those who are not residents. We can't just simply open our doors and say, 'Come one, come all."'
The district expelled as many as 30 nonresident students a year in the past using a part-time investigator, but Dr. Valenti said that complaints from taxpayers prompted the district to tackle the problem more aggressively. "This has probably been a problem from time immemorial, but the number of families wanting to take advantage of an attractive school district that's only a walk or a bus ride from Queens had been growing in recent years," he said. "And people have become much more sophisticated about gaming the system."
Interlopers use a host of methods, including fabricated leases and rent receipts, phony drivers' licenses, friends or relatives who will claim them as tenants, and rented mailboxes or addresses. School officials said nonresidents have been known to pay homeowners or real estate brokers a fee of, say, $20 a month for the right to receive mail at an address in the district and to have it forwarded to their homes outside.
In addition to using detectives, school districts also use simpler tools like telephone tip lines and letters stamped with "Do Not Forward" to try to catch nonresidents.
Valley Stream redesigned its registration process to try to keep up. Rather than have each of the district's four schools handle its own new students, every application now goes to Mr. Luciano for scrutiny. The requirements for proving residency were also heightened. Homeowners must provide at least three documents that show ownership, no photocopies allowed. Renters must provide a lease, a utility bill, a notarized affidavit from the owner of the house stating that the child lives in the rented home, and a copy of the owner's deed, mortgage statement or tax bill.
Each registration form includes a warning that any false statement is "punishable as a class A misdemeanor" and that the district "reserves the right to investigate any student's residency by any legal means available, including but not limited to public records, site visits and other lawful methods of investigation."
Linda Wain, the executive director of the Long Island Advocacy Center, a nonprofit legal aid center that has represented scores of families in school residency cases, said some school districts have been too aggressive. The actions of detectives who follow and videotape children or make unannounced home visits can sometimes "border on harassment," Ms. Wain said. "The things they do sometimes intimidate families and we want to avoid that."
Curtis Thomas is an Elmont homeowner who went head to head with the Elmont school district two years ago when school officials determined that his 6-year-old granddaughter was not an official Elmont resident. At the time, Mr. Thomas said, his granddaughter lived with him during the week but with her father on weekends. School officials argued that she was living with Mr. Thomas just to attend their schools, disqualifying her. Mr. Thomas then obtained legal custody of the child, but she is now back in Queens with her father.
"I resented that they thought I was trying to do something slick," Mr. Thomas said. "I was responsible for her, but I chose to let her stay with her father. I didn't want to sever their ties."
He also said he didn't like the fact that detectives followed his granddaughter around. "I couldn't believe they would have people stalking you outside your school," he said. "I thought it was foolish to pay somebody to sit out there and do that, when most people would probably tell you the truth if you just asked."
Ms. Wain said many of the families that come to the advocacy center live in illegal multiple dwellings, may be illegal immigrants or have complicated family situations that involve children living with relatives other than their parents. She said the center's main purpose in helping these families is "to see that the children go to school, because there often are long delays and they wind up sitting at home while the districts demand documentation." 
Vilma Mejias's 5-year-old son, Daniel, spent February at home because the West Hempstead school district was not satisfied with the family's housing documents.
The Mejias family moved from Bay Shore to the second-floor apartment of the home of relatives in West Hempstead at the end of January. But because the relatives did not own the house, their affidavit was deemed insufficient. "We had the car registration with this address, my husband's pay stubs and other bills, but they said it wasn't enough," Mrs. Mejias said. So the family wrote to the owner, who lives in Texas, and asked for a signed and notarized affidavit and a copy of a property tax bill. It was early March before they finally got all the documentation the district demanded. 
Part of the impetus for such stiff requirements comes from the concerns that many homeowners across Long Island have about the growing number of illegal apartments. "All these families in illegal apartments mean more kids in school, higher school budgets and more crowded classrooms," said Roy Mezzapelle, president of the Elmont Quality of Life Committee, a civic group that focuses on illegal housing. They are an unfair burden on homeowners who pay an average of $4,000 a year in school property taxes, he added, because the owners of the illegal apartments pay taxes at the single-family-home rate even though their buildings may house as many as five families. "If you have three families in a house, you should be paying taxes accordingly," he said.
Lois Colletta, the assistant superintendent who handles residency issues for the Valley Stream district, said that about half of the 200 residents at a recent public meeting on residency came to complain about children living in illegal apartments. "But even though those children may be living in illegal situations, they're still residents in the district and that means we are obligated to educate them," she said.
Dr. Colletta and officials in other border districts agreed that the problem is more significant at the junior high and high school levels than in the elementary schools. "I think that's partly because young children just aren't as good at lying as older kids, but also because a lot of parents from the city are more concerned about security at the older levels," she said. Rather than have their children go through metal detectors every morning to get to their first-period classes, parents want their children in schools where safety is not a worry, she said.
The Sewanhaka district has been dealing with nonresidents for nearly 20 years and easily has the most elaborate system for dealing with them. The district conducts what they call "massive sweeps" at the beginning of the school year, where teams of detective cars lie in wait at the city line on Hempstead and Jericho Turnpikes and follow every car carrying a child into the district to see whether they go to a district school. The detectives will follow the child into the school, never approaching a child directly, but will learn the child's name from the homeroom teacher.
The district also runs a computer search for children with different surnames at the same address. In many cases, the different names are explained by the existence of illegal apartments in the house. But when there are as many as four to six different surnames at one address, school officials said, they often find that at least one of those children is a nonresident.
"I'm an educator, but I have to sit here and play detective," said George Goldstein, Sewanhaka's superintendent. "It's like we're playing a game of chess here, and the pawns are the children and the horses are my detectives running around like buffoons to try to catch them."
He said that while his district's system is extensive and expensive, the return is worth it. The district has expelled more than 1,440 children in the last 15 years, he said, and at an estimated cost of $10,000 a year and six years of education for each child, the savings to the district is more than $86 million. 
Sewanhaka is also the only district to have instituted a formal appeals process, where families of students who have been kicked out of the district can appeal to an administrative law judge, who is hired and paid by the school district. The district holds about 50 such hearings a year. The judge upholds roughly 30 of those explusions and reverses about 10 of them; the remaining 10 cases are appealed to the state commissioner of education.
At one such administrative hearing late last month, a father from Cambria Heights, Queens, pleaded with the judge to let his 18-year-old daughter stay at Elmont Memorial High School. He brought in her honor roll certificates and explained that they had lived in the district when he registered his daughter but could no longer afford to stay there.
"I would like to maintain her here, because every time I go by the school near us I see fights and I don't want her there," said the father, who asked that he not be identified. The city school, Martin Van Buren High School, has a 9 percent dropout rate and only 30 percent of its students graduate with Regents diplomas. The Sewanhaka district has a dropout rate of less than half of one percent and 65 percent of its students graduate with Regents diplomas.
The father told the judge that his daughter stayed with a relative during the week to maintain her residency, but also said that he was still responsible for her financially. The judge upheld the dismissal.
"I feel for these parents," Dr. Goldstein said. "I would do anything for my child too. But we have to do what we have to do. We have no obligation to teach other people's children."
Carl Friedman, who handles residency issues for the state Department of Education, said that residency became a major issue in the state about 20 years ago. "The economy of it all has caused people to have to guarantee that they're not wasting money and only putting efforts into those students that are entitled to an education in their district," he said.
Mr. Friedman also said that over time there has been an increase in the number of children living with adults other than their parents. Many people do not understand what the law allows in those situations, he said.
A guardian does not have to have legal custody of a child, he said, "but they have to show that they're in charge of everything in the child's life, that they're paying all the costs associated with raising the child, that the arrangement is permanent for the foreseeable future, and they can be doing it for any reason in the world except that they're shopping for a better school district."
School district officials from across Long Island said that residency cases that deal with custody issues are often the most complex ones they face.
Donato Gonzalez, who has two sons and a nephew in the Brentwood school district, said Brentwood officials were confrontational and unhelpful when they tried to remove his 12-year-old nephew, Eric Rodriguez, earlier this month.
What kicked off their residency investigation was a class discussion on parents and careers. Eric said he had never known his father and was not living with his mother, so he wasn't sure what she did.
Mr. Gonzalez said Eric's mother lived with them until recently, but had moved to Florida to care for her ailing mother. "I didn't know I had to tell them about that," Mr. Gonzalez said.
The Long Island Advocacy Center explained their rights to Mr. Gonzalez and his wife, who chose to seek legal custody of Eric and have submitted those forms to the school district. "I'm a taxpayer in Brentwood and I understand what had to be done," he said. "But they made what should have been a simple process very nerve-racking and difficult."
Les Black, the Brentwood schools superintendent, did not address Mr. Gonzalez's case but said: "The question is whether the parent has really given up custody. It has to do with our legal responsibilities too. If a child gets hurt, we need to know who's responsible."
Aubrey Phillips, a school board member for the Sewanhaka and Elmont school districts, said school districts generally needed to be "more sensitive to different social dynamics within their community and not assume that the social dynamics of traditional families in the United States fit the needs of everyone."
Mr. Phillips is an immigrant from Guyana, and he said many Guyanese and Haitian families have large extended families with informal arrangements where aunts and uncles and grandparents care for children while their parents are elsewhere. "Very formal and legal methods of proving someone belongs to someone else just aren't the norm in these communities," he said. "It's something we need to understand and try to work with."
Mr. Luciano, Valley Stream's residency investigator, said he often has mixed feelings when he catches people lying about their circumstances. He said the situations were more cut and dried when he investigated the residency of police recruits as a New York City police detective.
"There, people would lie and yell at you because you weren't giving them a job and you could feel glad that you weren't giving them a gun," he said. "Here, you feel bad, because there's no malicious intent. They're just looking for something better for their children."

HEADLINE: BRIEFINGS: UNEMPLOYMENT; 
FEARS FOR JOBLESS FUND

BYLINE:  By George James 

 BODY:
 The state fund that provides benefits to unemployed workers has lost $1 billion in the last 14 months, prompting calls by business and labor leaders for Governor McGreevey to abandon his plan to divert $325 million from the fund to help offset a projected $5 billion budget deficit. 
The loss occurred as a result of rising unemployment claims and after the governor diverted $650 million to balance the budget last year. In trying to allay fears that employers would have to pay more into the fund, state officials said it had ample money to cover claims for another year. George James

HEADLINE: Remember the British In Cutting Funds for Arts 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 A statement by Governor McGreevey's spokeswoman, Ellen Mellody -- "It's hard to justify hanging a picture on the wall when you can't put food on the table" (Feb. 23) -- shows a shocking lack of understanding of how the arts community affects the lives of New Jersey citizens. 
The arts generate $1 billion in economic impact each year. Cut this and people throughout the state will not be able to put food on the table. 
 Times are difficult, but perhaps New Jersey needs to take a page from the British during World War II. Despite threats of bombings and invasion, the British Museum in London remained open. Priceless artifacts were hidden in bunkers and replaced with reproductions on the walls. The British government and the museum administrators understood that faced with obstacles to everyday living, people needed the reassurance that culture and a sense of history provide. With American society and culture under threat from without, it is disheartening to think that they are also under threat from within.

HEADLINE: It's Getting Easier To Be Green 

BYLINE:  By ELSA BRENNER 

 BODY:
FIVE years ago, Robert and Deborah Fischman paid Con Ed $1,000 a month during the winter to heat their four-bedroom colonial in South Salem.
 By last month, the familys utility bill had dropped to $400. What changed? Worried about both the environment and his budget, Mr. Fischman, a civil engineer, decided four years ago to convert his 3,000-square-foot house to a "green" building. He replaced the homes all-electric heating system with a geothermal pump, which draws heat from the earth in winter and sheds it into the ground in summer through a system of buried plastic pipes called a ground heat exchanger. 
 Not only have Mr. and Mrs. Fischman and their three children been basking in the cost-effective warmth of geothermal heat ever since, but they have also gained new respect in their neighborhood. These days when guests stop by, the conversation invariably turns to the unassuming box in the basement, where a furnace would usually be found. The new system is a winner on two counts, the Fischmans explain: it keeps their home at 70 degrees Fahrenheit winter and summer, and it eliminates emissions from the site that traditional fossil fuel heating systems give off. 
 Mr. Fischman, who works for Andron Construction Corporation in Goldens Bridge, predicts that in time, homes like his will become less of a curiosity and more mainstream. "Especially as peoples values focus increasingly on conserving our environment," he said, "well see a lot more of them."
 In Westchester recently, as in the rest of the country, interest in green construction has grown sharply. Adding to concerns about rolling power failures, soaring fuel costs and dependence on foreign oil is another worry specific to Westchester: if the Nuclear Regulatory Commission closes down the Indian Point nuclear power plant, which provides between 18 and 38 percent of the energy for New York City and the lower Hudson Valley, how will that that energy be replaced?
 Environmentalists, citizen groups and public officials, including the Westchester County Executive, Andrew J. Spano, have called for the closing of the two nuclear power plants at Indian Point in Buchanan run by Entergy, in large part because of the threat to Westchester if they were to become the focus of a terrorist attack.
 Westchester itself is stepping up efforts to find alternatives to traditional energy sources. It already has a solar system at work at its Yonkers Joint Wastewater Treatment Plant. The solar panels, called photovoltaic tiles, which are on the roof of the plants administration building, produce about 100 kilowatts of power at any given time and save about $10,000 a year, said Adam J. Zabinski, deputy commissioner for the countys Department of Environmental Facilities. Also, the sludge processing produces 1.2 million cubic feet of methane gas daily, which in turn is used to fire boilers at the treatment plant. Estimated savings by using the gas byproduct is about $75,000 a year, Mr. Zabinski said.
 The goal of green construction is to make buildings more energy efficient by minimizing environmental impact and reducing energy use, often according to standards set by the United States Green Building Council, a national coalition of leaders from the building industry and environmental organizations.
 A green approach to energy is not new, of course. During the 1970's, strategies to conserve fuel included driving smaller cars, turning down thermostats and wearing more sweaters, following the example set by President Jimmy Carter. Americans also began recycling trash, using low-flow shower heads to reduce water consumption, installing Thermopane windows and adopting other energy-saving strategies. Strategies like recycling had staying power, but others did not, observed Alexander Roberts, president of Roberts Geo Systems, an energy management consulting concern in Pleasantville. The most notable example of Americans discarding conservation efforts, Mr. Roberts said, has been their love affair with S.U.V.'s and other large vehicles with low gas mileage.
 The question now is whether the new zeal for energy conservation will prevail this time around.
 "The crucial difference between then and now," said Mr. Roberts, "was that then conserving energy meant doing without or with less, whereas today many of the new green technologies like geothermal heating and compact fluorescent light bulbs actually improve comfort and work better. Even better, they also offer a clear economic benefit that people can see in pocketbooks, which is a powerful motivator."

Relying on Light And Local Materials
 Geothermal heat pumps and solar energy are both used in green construction. Often such construction depends on daylight for illumination and uses lights that automatically dim depending on the natural light available. A green building is designed to insulate efficiently and has either Thermopane or specially glazed windows. Such buildings also use construction materials like wood from renewable forests, steel with a high content of recycled materials, locally quarried stone, nontoxic paints and carpets, and ceramic tiles made with recycled glass.
 Builders, homeowners and commercial property owners are embracing green construction and predicting that it will soon gain wide acceptance. "We call it green construction now, but it wont be long before we take it for granted and dont refer to it as something special," said Bill Balter, a coowner of Wilder Balter Partners, builders in Elmsford. "Even in less than a decade, it will probably be the norm."
 Some materials, like low-emission insulating glass, are already commonly used by builders. Geothermal heat pumps have proved to be highly reliable but are not common. Still there are some high-profile customers: President Bush had one installed in his ranch home in Crawford, Tex., and Vice President Dick Cheney's official home, the Naval Observatory in Washington, uses geothermal heat pumps. Mr. Balter has installed a geothermal heat pump as a test case in one of 15 luxury homes he is building at Arrowcrest Estates at Hunterbrook in Yorktown. "Eventually well be doing it in more developments," he said. "For now, were trying it out here and working out the kinks."
 The mechanics of such a system are simple: using the constant temperature of the earth below the frost line, a pump forces water through piping connected to a buildings heating and cooling system. During the summer, excess heat from the building is shed into the ground through the system for cooling, and during the winter, heat is drawn from the ground.
 The typical cost for such a system is about $7,500, according to the United States Department of Energy. The investment can often be recouped within 2 to 10 years in utility bill savings, studies from the energy department show. The underground piping used comes with a 25- to 50-year warranty, and the pumps themselves typically last 20 years or longer. Also, the state offers tax incentives and rebates for installing geothermal systems.

Savings at a Country Club And a High School
 Gov. George E. Pataki has been New Yorks major champion of new energy technologies and green construction. He has ordered the state to buy at least 20 percent of its energy from geothermal and other renewable sources by 2010. Incentives are available for installing geothermal systems, solar-electric and wind-generation systems. In 2000, the state passed the countrys first Green Building Tax Credit, a $25 million income tax credit program for owners and tenants of buildings that meet certain energy, indoor air quality, materials, water conservation, appliance and size criteria. The state has distributed money to more than 600,000 individuals and other businesses from the beginning of its public benefit program in 1998.The program is financed at $150 million a year.
 Rebates and savings can be substantial. On a Croton-on-Hudson home that was used last year to educate the public about solar heat, photovoltaic panels were installed for $25,000, with state rebates and tax advantages amounting to $14,000, according to Federated Conservationists of Westchester, an umbrella organization of environmental groups.
The Westchester Country Club in Rye recently installed a geothermal system as part of a $7 million project to reduce energy consumption by 775,000 kilowatt hours, saving $130,000 annually on energy costs and reducing fossil fuel emissions linked to smog, acid rain, global climate changes and respiratory ailments.
The geothermal system at the country club was installed by R. J. Dooley & Associates, a seven-year-old Poughkeepsie engineering and construction firm that is also installing the geothermal unit at Wilder Balter's Arrowcrest Estates at Hunterbrook. The company's owner, Robert Dooley, is converting a 60,000-square-foot former brewery and hotel built in the mid-1800's on the Hudson River waterfront in Poughkeepsie to offices and a restaurant and has installed a geothermal unit there, too.
 To encourage more green construction of schools, the state Energy Research and Development Authority has awarded $20,000 grants to 50 public and private schools, including Somers High School in Westchester. School Power Naturally, as the program is called, is designed to raise students' awareness of the importance and promise of solar energy. Schools chosen for the project are also getting weather stations to aid them in collecting and analyzing their data.
 Somers High is installing a solar collector on the south wall of its gymnasium, which will provide the school with two kilowatts of electricity per month, said Brian Hugick, a science teacher at the school. As a point of comparison, the teacher said, the average home uses about four kilowatts a month; the school uses between 228 and 378 kilowatts a month.
 Even though two kilowatts is a relatively small savings, "it will help us get off the grid," Mr. Hugick explained. The teacher is showing lab students in his Contemporary Issues in Science course how solar energy can be used to power pollution-free model cars and cooking equipment.
 Sarah Lawrence College in Yonkers is going green on a bigger scale, spending $25 million to build a 60,000-square-foot center for the visual arts using recycled and renewable materials including the rock removed from the ground during construction. The design focuses on minimizing water and energy use and includes a geothermal system. The building is expected to open in the fall of 2004.

Counting Kilowatts At the Power Authority
 The New York Power Authority installed new energy-efficiency technologies at the Clarence D. Rappleyea Building, the authoritys headquarters in White Plains. It began the $3.8 million project to address the governors "Green and Clean State Buildings" order, requiring state-owned buildings to achieve reductions in energy use of at least 35 percent by 2010, based on 1990 consumption levels. Along with anticipated energy savings of 50 percent, the White Plains office improvements are expected to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 4,100 tons a year.
 At the Kenneth S. Warren Institute, a medical research center in Yorktown, major renovations are under way to make the building into an oil-free building, said Learned J. Hand, the institutes executive director. Situated on the grounds of Yorktowns 15-acre Kitchawan Preserve near the Croton Reservoir, the 15,000-square-foot building is heated primarily with a geothermal heat pump system.
 "Our eventual goal is to be totally oil free," Mr. Hand said. "But no matter how green a building is, when its 5 degrees outside, you want some backup oil."
 Chuck Lowden, the institutes chief engineer, said the nonprofit group was also considering the installation of solar panels and a propane-powered generator to serve as a backup source of power in case of a power failure. "Especially in a rural area, you dont want to put all your eggs in one basket," he said.

Electric Cars And Building Regulations
 Municipalities, too, have accepted the charge to become more green. White Plains, for example, has installed variable frequency motors at its water pumping facilities and at its public library, said Joseph Nicoletti Jr., commissioner of Public Works and the city engineer. The motors slow down or speed up in response to changing conditions instead of continually running at full speed. The city also retrofitted 4,400 streetlights with high-pressure sodium bulbs, which have a long life and high output. A new parking garage has been designed with light sensors so that outside rows are artificially lighted only when there is inadequate daylight.
 The city's fleet of vehicles has also become more environmentally friendly, including cars powered by electricity, natural gas and alcohol. "The maintenance on these vehicles is considerably less, the cost of refueling an electric car is almost nil, and complaints about noise during night street sweeping are considerably reduced", Mr. Nicoletti said. "In addition, the environmental hazards and constant monitoring and testing required of underground fuel storage facilities is eliminated for those vehicles."
 The town of Greenburgh passed a new law about a year ago mandating energy-efficient construction of all new homes. The law says no building permit can be issued for a new one- or two-family home or a dwelling of three stories or fewer unless the applicant certifies that the building will meet New York Energy Star Labeled Home guidelines. The guidelines stipulate improved insulation, windows designed to improve thermal performance, high efficiency heating and cooling systems that are properly sized for the home, and reduced air infiltration, among other things.
 Steven Winter, chairman of the United States Green Building Council and president of Steven Winter Associates, an architectural firm in Norwalk that designs green projects nationwide, said that however laudable the ideas of green construction are, it could take as much as a generation for the principles and practices of it to become mainstream.
 There is the natural disinclination of some people to make the effort to change, he observed: "Sometimes they're selfish, lazy or just indifferent and not willing to take time to recycle or institute other energy-saving measures. Their attitude is, 'The heck with it.' " 
 There are also some business concerns oil companies, for example, he said that would prefer consumers to maintain their dependence on fossil fuels. "Any time theres a change," Mr. Winter said, "there are status quo interests that resist it."

HEADLINE: TRAVEL ADVISORY: CORRESPONDENT'S REPORT; 
Amtrak Hangs On, Hopeful Once More

BYLINE:  By MATTHEW L. WALD 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
AMTRAK is far from healthy, but after its near-death experience last summer, top management is newly hopeful. It has won a federal subsidy for the current fiscal year that is more than 95 percent of the $1.2 billion it asked for -- including some money for long-deferred capital items.
 But there are strings attached. The first problem is that the money will go through the Transportation Department, which is supposed to provide it to the railroad as grants. David L. Gunn, Amtrak's president, was asked at a recent briefing on the budget whether this created new hoops for the beleaguered railroad to jump through. "Well, at least we've got a hoop," he replied. "We've never had a hoop before." 
 The grant system, cobbled together by Congress, might give the Transportation Department the authority to cut individual trains, although officials at both Amtrak and the department said they were uncertain about the department's authority and its intentions.
Still, it is a step up from last summer, when the railroad was saved from collapse by an emergency appropriation of $205 million from Congress and a $100 million loan from the Transportation Department. Even now Amtrak has only a few weeks' worth of cash on hand. But the railroad's extreme poverty may protect it, Mr. Gunn suggested. It has so little money that any delays in providing more could cause a collapse.
The new budget is for the period from last Oct. 1 to Sept. 30; like nearly all of the federal budget, it was not approved by Congress until February. In addition to $1.05 billion of the $1.2 billion it had asked for, Amtrak won deferral of the $100 million loan. The final budget was a compromise with the House. It provides $522 million for operations, $295 million for capital improvements in the Northeast Corridor, where the track needs billions of dollars in improvements, and $233 million for capital improvements elsewhere. The money for the Northeast includes initial financing for replacement of three bridges on the Connecticut shoreline, two movable and a third that "will move if we don't fix it," Mr. Gunn said. Some of the money will go to replace locomotives that are 50 years old, he said.
Amtrak expects its revenues to continue to decline as part of a recession hitting the whole travel industry, its executives say. But it hopes to cut costs substantially; it has eliminated 600 jobs and streamlined its management. It is getting out of the express package business, and says it will cut back on carrying mail because some contracts are not profitable. The railroad also refused to bid on a contract to run a commuter rail line in Boston and its suburbs and will scrutinize its other commuter contracts.
But it faces tough times. One problem is that for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, it plans to ask for lots more -- $1.8 billion --while the Bush administration says that subsidies are too high and has proposed half that amount. The railroad has also called for fundamental reform without specifying what that would be. Critics have proposed privatizing sections of the national rail system as a reform option, but the administration has not submitted a plan to do so.
The second problem is that the administration has taken aim at six trains that the Office of Management and Budget said lost unreasonable sums. One is the Pennsylvania, which ran from Philadelphia to Chicago. Amtrak has already cut the Pittsburgh-to-Chicago portion of that train, as part of its retreat from theexpress-package business. A second is the Kentucky Cardinal, which runs from Louisville to Chicago; Amtrak plans to drop that in July. Also singled out are the Sunset Limited, between Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla.; the Texas Eagle, between San Antonio and Chicago; the Three Rivers, between New York and Chicago; and the Southwest Chief, between Chicago and Los Angeles. In theory, the department could withhold money to run them.
The administration says the Sunset Limited lost $347 per rider in 2001, and the others more than $200 per rider. Mr. Gunn argued that the losses per mile were not much different from those on many commuter lines, but that the Amtrak trips cover more miles. Besides, he said, the whole railroad loses money; the relevant question, as he sees it, is the marginal cost, or how much would be saved if a route were to be cut, rather than the total cost of the route. For example, Amtrak's station in New Orleans is now used by three trains a day. If Amtrak cut out one of them, the expense of running the station would shift to the other two. And overhead costs like management salaries would not change.

HEADLINE: ECONOMIC VIEW; 
Grading Bush On Prosperity And Pain

BYLINE:  By DANIEL ALTMAN 

 BODY:
AFTER a recent report by the Labor Department suggested that the economy was still losing jobs like sand from a sieve, Democrats blasted the Bush administration for failing to shore up the economy. But how much of the credit or blame do President Bush and his team deserve, just two years into his term?
 The experts have spoken, and the answer is . . . a modest amount. 
 An informal survey of economists, which I conducted last week by e-mail, asked, "To what degree is the Bush administration responsible (in the sense of bearing credit or blame) for the current state of the economy?" 
Answers were sought from 20 well-known Wall Street economists from different companies and 125 academics specializing in macroeconomics. The academic group included R. Glenn Hubbard, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, and his nominated successor, N. Gregory Mankiw of Harvard. Neither responded. Among those who did was Martin S. Feldstein, a Harvard professor who held the post in the early 1980's.
The economists were encouraged to pick from a five-point scale, ranging from "not at all" to "completely," and to offer additional comments. The academics, of whom 57 responded, averaged 2.3 -- between "a little bit" and "a fair amount." The average from the 11 Wall Street economists who wrote back was lower, at 1.9.
Several economists who chose the most popular response, "a little bit," wrote that the White House's actions could not have much effect on the economy in the short run.
"As much as I dislike the Bush administration, and as much as I believe that its current policies may affect the future of the U.S. economy, what's happening right now has little to do with what the Bush economic team has done," wrote Eduardo M. Engel, a professor at Yale.
Those who differed -- and many did -- mostly emphasized the link between foreign policy and the economy. They wrote that uncertainty over Iraq and fears of terrorism as a side effect of war were having as big an effect as any economic policy.
"Whether the Bush administration is right or wrong in its strategy toward Iraq is largely a question of international diplomacy," wrote James H. Stock, a Harvard professor, "but its implication is that domestic investment and, to a lesser degree, consumption decisions are postponed, restraining growth."
And, as some academics wrote, the White House may have more latitude in its foreign policy than in its economic policy. "Even the most ardent Bush supporter would concede that the Iraq push was a choice," wrote Anil K. Kashyap, a professor at the University of Chicago, "and since that is hanging over the economy Bush has some responsibility."
Professor Stock added that the administration could also have taken a stronger stance against the corporate scandals that have dogged the stock market. The complaint thatMr. Bush's tax cuts have damaged the nation's long-term fiscal outlook enough to push up interest rates also received some support among the academics, but not among the Wall Street economists.
One of the president's defenders on that front was James E. Glassman, senior United States economist at J. P. Morgan Chase, who wrote that the Bush administration was "not at all" responsible for the state of the economy.
"Most of us believe the slowdown/moderate recession was the result of a perfect storm back in 2000," he wrote. In the history of such crises, he continued, "we have never seen as quick and forceful a response from the Fed, from the administration and from Congress than that of the last two years."
Mr. Glassman's second point suggests (notwithstanding his "not at all" choice) that the administration deserves some credit, not blame, for the state of the economy. Without its actions, things might have been much worse than they are today. 
But it is worth remembering that in September 2000, before the presidential election, top academics polled by The Economist magazine mostly gave Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman, credit for the boom of the 1990's -- a boom now seen as ending in an unsustainable bubble.
That bubble, wrote Vincenzo Quadrini, an assistant professor at New York University who also answered "not at all" in the informal survey, was the true culprit. "The current economic difficulties are the unavoidable consequences of the asset price bubble that started to burst in the first half of 2000," he said. But, potentially in Mr. Greenspan's defense, Mr. Quadrini added that he found it " difficult to identify a policy that could have caused or prevented this."

HEADLINE: Dot-Com Saviors, Tilting at The World's Ills 

BYLINE:  By KATIE HAFNER 

DATELINE: MONTEREY, Calif. 

 BODY:
WITH their sights set across the globe, they are heading out from Silicon Valley with unflinching optimism, buoyant self-confidence and, now that much of their industry has evaporated, a great deal of time on their hands.
 In increasing numbers, high-tech entrepreneurs who grew wealthy during the dot-com boom of the late 1990's -- as well as many who didn't -- are turning the intense business acumen they once devoted to making money to working for what they see as the global good. 
 With the best of intentions, and maybe a hint of hubris, these New Age saviors are trying to build water purifiers, manual irrigation pumps, low-cost solar collectors, hearing aids, even highly durable mosquito nets. Armed with Po Bronson's recent best-selling book, "What Should I Do With My Life?" they hope to save lives while also giving greater meaning to their own.
"Many people in this industry are in a Po Bronson moment," said Tom Rielly, the founder of PlanetOut, an Internet site catering to gays and lesbians. "A lot of dot-comers who are out of work are trying to figure out what to do, and a lot of them are trying to make a difference." 
This new mood was especially evident at last month's TED conference (for Technology Entertainment and Design), an annual gathering in Monterey that attracts many of the computer industry's elite. But instead of celebrating technology's intrinsic beauty and financial potential, participants showed off gizmos meant to improve living conditions in the third world.
Instead of jargon like personal bandwidth, killer app, and clicks and mortar, the notions floating around this year were sustainability, the ecology of terror and H.I.V. One of the most popular presentations came from Dean Kamen, the inventor best known for the Segway Human Transporter, the high-tech scooter that has yet to prove itself in the marketplace. At TED, Mr. Kamen, 51, showed a water purifier that also generates electricity. The device, which resembles a Good Humor ice cream cart, takes filthy water (all that is available to much of Africa, he said) and distills it to crystalline purity.
"Here you take the box and put it directly where someone needs it," Mr. Kamen said. His device is still not ready for mass production, yet his plans are grandiose. He said he would leave in the next few weeks for Africa to explore distribution for his invention.
TED was not the only place where world betterment eclipsed return on investment as a discussion point. Three weeks earlier, at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, the annual meeting of world economic and political leaders, a dinner for high-tech executives focused almost exclusively on problems of poverty and disease around the world. Bill Gates, the Microsoft chairman, sat on a panel whose theme was "Science for the Global Good," and discussed his foundation's work in bringing immunization programs to developing countries.
While plenty of people in Silicon Valley are still focused on keeping their businesses going, this change in direction among some of the technology elite comes in the aftermath of the dot-com collapse and the Sept. 11 attacks. Fear of terrorism and war, and general nervousness about the health of the planet, seem to have inspired a shift in priorities. Many of the speakers at the conference were self-appointed Cassandras, describing the dangers of American self-absorption with a fervor once reserved for initial public offerings.
"Five years ago, people were too busy getting rich and being dazzled by technology to think more broadly," said Chris Anderson, whose Sapling Foundation, which finances medical, technological and educational projects in the developing world, bought the rights to stage the TED conference from its originator, Richard Saul Wurman, a gregarious designer and architect.
This year marked the 13th TED. Attendees pay $4,000 for three and a half days of intellectual soul searching, mixed with some pure entertainment, like a juggling act, and a generous dose of technological bravado.
The $1 million in profits made at this year's conference will be given to causes devoted to clean water, ocean conservation and public health in the developing world, Mr. Anderson said.
In many ways, this newfound idealism is connected to the old entrepreneurial spirit. 
"As silly as it seems now," said Kevin Jones, 52, who owned several successful high-tech businesses before selling them, "there was an element in the dot-com thing people believed in." That is, entrepreneurs of the 90's embraced the virtues of a supposed New Economy with evangelistic fervor. 
"People felt they were transforming something," Mr. Jones said. "And once you whet someone's appetite like that, they're not willing to go back to business as usual." 
Besides, Mr. Jones added, only partly in jest, "the premium for selling your soul has gone down."
Of course, the time happens to be ripe for a Po Bronson moment. Had the dot-com bubble never burst, a lot of people might not have thought to turn their attention to bettering the world. 
Some of the dot-com activists consider what they are doing enlightened self-interest, perhaps even enlightened opportunism. During the boom years, Bill Gross's Idealab, an incubator for Internet-based startups, was churning out online enterprises that offered toys, Web searches and wedding planning. Then the bubble burst, and many of Idealab's companies disappeared. Mr. Gross's personal wealth, $1 billion or more before the collapse, is now roughly $200 million. 
"Maybe since Sept. 11 and maybe because I'm almost 45 and maybe because I have four wonderful happy kids, I want to do things that are important for the world," Mr. Gross said. 
He used his time onstage at TED to introduce one new Idealab venture, called Energy Innovations, which is making inexpensive solar collectors to sell in places needing cost-effective power. But he hasn't lost his capitalist zeal, either. Eventually, Mr. Gross said, he hopes to turn Energy Innovations into a money-making business. 
Like others at the conference, Mr. Gross criticized the United States for consuming the bulk of the planet's natural resources without regard for the hostility such a lifestyle can engender. "The root causes of any hatred against the U.S. have to be dealt with, as opposed to just closing our eyes to it," he said. 
Not surprisingly, perhaps, few of the newly socially aware entrepreneurs speak of teaming up with public agencies like the World Bank and Unicef, or even nongovernmental aid organizations like Oxfam. Instead, they focus on groups like the Acumen Fund, a social venture fund that encourages an entrepreneurial approach to fixing world problems. The Acumen Fund is receiving $427,000 of the TED profits. 
Jacqueline Novogratz, 41, a graduate of Stanford Business School who started the Acumen Fund in 2001, said she emphasizes models that take an investment-oriented approach to global betterment, treating social ventures like any other entrepreneurial enterprise. So far the fund has raised $15 million. 
As an example, Ms. Novogratz cited the Affordable Hearing Aid Project, which has received $400,000 from the Acumen Fund and others to manufacture and sell a $42 hearing aid in India. A comparable device would sell for $1,500, Ms. Novogratz said. 
Though given as a grant, she said, the money is structured like an investment in a startup, with milestones and benchmarks to track progress. Acumen Fund investors do not expect a financial return. "But millions of people are getting access to a technology they wouldn't otherwise have," Ms. Novogratz said, "and for many, that social return is as compelling as a financial return." 
The view from traditional philanthropists is surprisingly positive. Dr. Richard Rockefeller, a physician and longtime philanthropist (he is the son of David Rockefeller), said he admired the pluck of people like Mr. Gross, even envied their experience. 
"I've often thought, 'Wouldn't it be nice just to go be an entrepreneur,' or to do that first and get a grip," he said. Dr. Rockefeller, the chairman of the United States advisory board of the international aid group Doctors Without Borders, said he had encouraged his own two children "to go get a skill and do it before they go out and change the world." 
And rather than view the new batch of engaged social activists cynically, Dr. Rockefeller gives them the benefit of the doubt. "It's very nuanced," he said. "Some people don't know what to do with themselves. Others have gotten a vision and want to act on it. They're getting a life." 
Not all the good works come from those who have abandoned the high-tech world. Some come from those who are still in it. 
The latest version of the MoneyMaker, a decidedly low-tech leg-powered irrigation pump, was created by a company called ApproTEC, a nonprofit organization that develops and markets new technologies in Africa. It was designed in part by volunteers at Ideo, an industrial design firm in Palo Alto known for the sleek Palm V organizer and the Crest Neat Squeeze toothpaste tube. 
Since the first MoneyMaker pump was introduced in Kenya in 1996, it has increased the average annual income among farmers there who use it from $120 a year to $1,400, according to Martin Fisher, a co-founder of ApproTEC. 
Ideo helped design the newest pump, a deep-well version that went on the market in Kenya last month, at no charge to ApproTEC. Some 40 Ideo employees volunteered in the evenings and on weekends for nearly a year. 
"The pump is real, and helping real people," said Ben Tarbell, the 28-year-old Ideo project manager who oversaw the pump's design. 
Not everyone is embracing high-tech solutions like Mr. Kamen's water purifier, or even more rudimentary technology like the ApproTEC pump. John Wood, 39, quit his high-paying management job at Microsoft around the time the Nasdaq market peaked in March 2000, and started Room to Read, a nonprofit group that brings books, libraries and schools to poor Asian countries. 
Since its start, the group has built 33 schools and 400 school libraries, delivered more than 200,000 books and financed 122 scholarships. 
"For the price an American pays for an S.U.V. or a new Lexus, we could build six schools in Nepal," Mr. Wood said, sounding a bit like a commercial for Save the Children. "For the amount that a wealthy banker spends on a pair of shoes, we could take a girl out of the orphanage, put her in a school uniform, give her a book bag and some pens, and send her off to school." 
But will the commitment last? What will happen if disillusionment sets in at the slow pace of social change? Or if the next technology boom arrives? 
One speaker at the TED conference elicited an appreciative laugh from the audience when he told of a bumper sticker he had spotted recently in Silicon Valley. It read, "Please God -- Just One More Bubble." 
Mr. Wood, for one, said he had no plans to abandon his project no matter what happens in the high-tech business world. "I plan to sit out the next bubble," he said. "I don't care if the Nasdaq goes to 20,000. I'll be in Nepal delivering books to villages on the back of a yak."

Auto Sales AreDown. Punish the Parts Makers.

BYLINE:  By FARA WARNER

DATELINE: DETROIT 

 BODY:
IN early March, two of the world's biggest automakers Ford Motor and General Motors -- announced that they would cut production in the second quarter as they prepared for a downturn in car sales. G.M. said its cutback could be up to 10.5 percent; Ford released details of its cuts on Thursday, when it forecast reductions of 17 percent.
 Predictably, the automakers' stocks fell. But auto suppliers suffered with them. 
 Shares of the Delphi Corporation, the world's biggest auto supplier, with $27 billion in revenue and ranked 67th in the Fortune 500, dropped 8.1 percent on March 4, the day after the initial announcement. American Axle and Manufacturing Holdings, which depends on G.M. for most of its business, sank 8.2 percent; and Visteon, an $18 billion business once a part of Ford, dropped 7.8 percent. 
Being whipsawed by the misfortunes of its biggest customers is business as usual for the auto parts industry, which has annual sales estimated at $1 trillion. When parts makers are not trying to cope with the roller coaster of production, they are responding to automakers' demands for significant price cuts, competition from abroad or their own plans to expand overseas.
Even when production is strong -- as it was in 2002, when automakers churned out 16.4 million cars and light trucks -- suppliers don't necessarily reap big profits. Auto companies look first to suppliers for cost reductions because about 70 percent of a car's cost comes from pieces supplied by outside manufacturers. The Original Equipment Supplier Association, a trade group, estimates that big suppliers operate on profit margins of just 5 percent, on average.
That was one reason many Wall Street analysts were already skeptical of supplier stocks before the plans for production cuts were announced. To them, the planned cuts confirmed that one of the bright spots in the economy -- car sales -- was starting to dim. Lehman Brothers now estimates car production at 15.8 million units this year, down 4 percent from 2002.
"Leases are going down significantly; they've dropped from 26 percent of the market in 1999 to 19 percent in 2002," said Rod Lache, an analyst at Deutsche Bank Securities. That indicates to him that people are holding onto their vehicles longer than they did in the recent past.
Mr. Lache has sell recommendations on Delphi and Visteon. He is also concerned that continued losses in market share for the American automakers -- down to 62 percent last year from 73 percent in 1996 -- will hurt suppliers like Delphi, Visteon and American Axle, which depend on them for most of their business.
Standard & Poor's, the credit agency, also showed concern when it cut Visteon's short-term rating on Friday.
MANY analysts prefer the stocks of the Lear Corporation and Johnson Controls, two big suppliers of dashboards, seats and other parts of car interiors. They have posted strong profit and revenue growth in recent years because they do much of their work for Asian and European automakers.
"There's no doubt this industry is under a lot of stress," said J Ferron, an automotive consultant at PricewaterhouseCoopers in Detroit. "Capital costs are high and margins are tight. The caution sign is definitely yellow.
"But you have to evaluate specific companies on what they are doing in the future," he added. "Who are their customers? What are they doing in research and development?"
Delphi, by far the industry leader, is trying to expand its customer base beyond G.M., its former owner and still the source of 60 percent of its sales. J. T. Battenberg III, Delphi's chairman, president and chief executive, said sales to other customers were growing 15 to 18 percent a year. The company is also spending heavily on research and development, to "have technology that no one else has or technology that's in short supply," he said.
In addition to supplying satellite radios to automakers, for example, it also sells its Skyfi-brand satellite radios at big retailers like Wal-Mart. By selling satellite radios to consumers, Delphi, based in Troy, Mich., is not completely at the mercy of automakers. "We're selling every one we can make," Mr. Battenberg said.
Despite that, Delphi's stock is off by more than half from its 52-week high of $17.15, reached last May 17. Delphi's profit in 2002 was $343 million on revenue of $27.4 billion; the company lost $370 million on sales of $26.1 billion in 2001.
Delphi, Lear and others are also moving to build more elaborate and more expensive components rather than parts -- whole dashboard assemblies, for example, rather than individual gauges, knobs and lights. That follows a rapid consolidation of the parts industry, in which the number of companies that sell directly to automakers shrank to about 100 "megasuppliers" last year from close to 4,000 smaller businesses in 1988, analysts estimate.
By creating such systems, companies have become collaborators with the auto industry, instead of just suppliers to it. An important benefit for the automakers is lower prices on components that they once produced themselves.
"Suppliers can be more nimble and have a lower cost than the automakers," said Jay Alix, chairman and founder of AlixPartners, based in Southfield, Mich., which advises auto suppliers on turnarounds and restructuring. "They don't have the pensions or the union contracts that the automakers have."
The megasupplier strategy has created an opportunity for private equity firms like Heartland Industrial Partners. Heartland began buying auto suppliers like MascoTech, Simpson Industries and Global Metal Technologies two years ago and combined them into the Metaldyne Corporation in Plymouth, Mich. Metaldyne, privately held, had revenue of $2.4 billion last year from the sale of engines, transmissions and car chassis. Heartland has also invested in Collins & Aikman, a publicly traded company in Troy that makes interior parts.
Metaldyne's chief executive, Timothy D. Leuliette, who is also a Heartland partner, has been a critic of price cuts that American automakers often force on suppliers as a condition of awarding contracts.
Mr. Leuliette said he preferred to work on projects that gave Metaldyne a say in how parts are designed and engineered. He pointed to work that Metaldyne is doing for DaimlerChrysler, Mitsubishi Motors and Hyundai Motor to design a "world engine" that each can use in every country where they sell cars.
He also likes the collegiality of automakers like Toyota Motor. He said that Toyota tells its suppliers, "On the next future design let's take 20 percent cost out, but let's work together to get there."
Toyota's approach to suppliers has become increasingly popular with other automakers, analysts said.
"The Japanese balance performance, quality and then price," said Joseph S. Phillippi, president of AutoTrends Consulting in Short Hills, N.J., and a former analyst at UBS PaineWebber. "Price is usually at the bottom of the list for the Japanese."
AMERICAN companies have noticed this, and are starting to rely on suppliers to tell them what consumers want, not to just give them the lowest price.
G.M., for example, recently awarded Lear the full interior system for its Buick LeSabre and Cadillac DeVille models. This is the first time that Lear will design and build an entire interior. The contract is expected to generate $825 million in annual revenue.
The reason was not price, but expertise, said executives who worked with Lear on the new interior. "Pricing was the last thing we talked about," said Vicky Morter, the director of purchasing for interiors at G.M.
This new approach seems to be benefiting Lear. While its stock is down, like that of most other auto suppliers, the fall has not been as steep. Lear's stock is at $33, off from a 52-week high of $53.84 last May 2. The company made a profit of $13 million last year on sales of $14.4 billion.

HEADLINE: The World: Double Bind; 
It's the Economy, Stupid. It's the War, Stupid.

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
IT is a measure of how much President Bush and the nation have riding on his showdown with Saddam Hussein that any recovery in the lackluster and weakening economy hinges less on the administration's goals of tax cuts, free trade and deregulation than on a quick and successful war against Iraq.
 For months, the prospect of military conflict has driven up oil prices and weighed heavily on the financial markets and on consumer and business confidence, quashing the economy's attempts to right itself. 
 Far from hewing to the World War II model of wartime as a powerful stimulus to industrial production and employment, the near certainty of armed confrontation with Iraq has exposed the economy's vulnerabilities, from its dependence on cheap energy to the psychological impact that fear can have on global flows of money and information. 
The White House, as ever, sees tax cuts as the ultimate remedy for the economy, despite the ballooning budget deficit. But inside and outside the administration, it is widely recognized that Mr. Bush's chances of getting his latest $726 billion tax cut proposal through an increasingly dubious Senate will depend on whether a war on Iraq enhances or reduces his domestic political strength. Several moderate Republicans in the Senate came out against the Bush tax plan last week, and others have signaled that they might do the same if the costs of the war look as if they will be substantial.
"Every way you look at it, Iraq is the economic policy," said Kim N. Wallace, a political analyst at Lehman Brothers in Washington.
"If all goes well, President Bush comes back as the commander in chief who despite opposition from many quarters stayed the course and did the right thing," he said. "Oil prices would come down. He'd have a market that would be looking better than in some time."
If the war does not go well or quickly, Mr. Wallace said, "I fully anticipate that his own party would run away from him on domestic policy."
White House officials scoff at any suggestion that Mr. Bush is impatient to begin the war so he can turn his attention back to the economy well before the Democratic presidential field has a chance to start casting him as the president who let the prosperity of the 1990's slip away.
But administration officials openly acknowledge that the economy is to some extent hostage to war fears when they link its fate to national security.
Business, investor and consumer behavior "are all interlinked at this moment with the geopolitical uncertainty," Donald L. Evans, the commerce secretary, said in an interview. "You can't have economic security without national security and homeland security -- and in order to have national security and homeland security, you have to disarm Saddam Hussein."
The interplay between wars and economies has always been more complex than suggested by the experience of World War II, which not only lifted the United States out of the Depression but laid the groundwork for the long boom that followed.
Military spending for the Vietnam War helped fuel the expansion of the 1960's, but also helped ignite the inflation that ravaged the economy through the 1970's. The spike in oil prices that accompanied Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 contributed to the recession that started a month later and lasted through the end of the gulf war the following winter.
In this case, there will probably be some positive jolt to the economy from whatever part of the war's costs -- expected to be $60 billion to $100 billion for a conflict that is over within a few months -- finds its way into new orders for weapons, equipment and services provided by American employers. But there is no prospect of any big industrial mobilization to create jobs. And whatever positive economic effects a war might have could be offset by negative factors like a drop-off in air traffic because of terrorism fears, a concern that the financially troubled airline industry brought to the attention of Congress and the administration last week.
Moreover, the war jitters -- which sent Wall Street down and up sharply last week -- are being superimposed on an economy that was already struggling to deal with stresses totally unrelated to the war.
Industry remains plagued by overcapacity, a legacy of overinvestment during the 1990's boom. Corporations and households are carrying heavy debt burdens. Projections of the federal budget deficit worsen almost every month. Unusually for a time of global crisis, the dollar has been falling in value, indicating concern that the American economy's troubles may be deep-rooted.
CORPORATIONS, driven to maintain their profit margins by improving productivity, have been quick to lay off workers and slow to rehire them. 
"If it works out well, presumably the cost of the war is limited, oil prices come down and consumer and investor confidence pick up," said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of Goldman Sachs International. "But even then it wouldn't be a panacea for the economy. There are still all the overhangs from the bubble of the 90's."
Democrats see the war's end as an opportunity to expose the underlying problems in the economy and to help them advance their argument that Mr. Bush is making matters worse by insisting on huge tax cuts that will burden the government with more debt for decades to come. But it isn't clear that Democrats will be unified or effective in making their case. 
"The Democrats are split all over the place on this," said James Thurber, director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University in Washington. "They split on the war resolution. They split on tax cuts, and they've got 12 people running for president all saying something different."
The challenge for Mr. Bush, said Frank Luntz, a Republican pollster, will be to persuade the American people to remain patient about the economy.
The latest New York Times/CBS News poll, earlier this month, showed that 52 percent of Americans disapprove of the president's handling of the economy, compared with 37 percent a year ago and 28 percent two years ago. Thirty-five percent of respondents ranked the economy first among the nation's problems, ahead of the war on terrorism, at 32 percent, and the Iraq crisis, at 23 percent.
At the same time, two-thirds approved of taking military action to remove Mr. Hussein from power.
"The moment the war is over or Saddam Hussein is gone, the American people will say, 'Now, fix the economy,' " Mr. Luntz said. "Until then they will support his efforts in focusing on the national security threat."

HEADLINE: How Tax Cuts Trickle Down 

 BODY:
In a sorry effort to protect President Bush's tax-cut mania, the Republican leaders of Congress have unveiled proposals for slashing the most basic government programs for years to come. With rationalizations running from tragic to ludicrous, House budgeters envision cuts of $470 billion in "waste, fraud and abuse" in Medicare, Medicaid, education, child care and other vital programs, from transportation to health care, the environment to science research. The regressive 10-year plan, matched by an equally hypocritical Senate version, is a triumph of ideological rant over budget reality. Government now must be drastically crimped to pay for the rolling deficits resulting from Mr. Bush's triumphalist rewards for upper-bracket Americans. 
 The G.O.P. leaders endorse the next chunk of detaxation despite Congressional findings that two-thirds of the deficits running through the decade will be caused by the Bush tax cuts, not simply the failing economy. 
 The estimated shortfall of $2.7 trillion could have been an $890 billion surplus but for the Bush proposals, according to the Congressional Budget Office. The president's next $1.4 trillion cut, geared to the affluent, will average $90,000 a year for millionaires, according to the Tax Policy Center, a research group run by the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute. You would think a sense of embarrassment might strike the Republicans in blessing such a boon for a fortunate minority while taking a cleaver to programs vital for most taxpayers, notably a woeful $12 billion cut in food stamps. But they seem intent on ideology trumping responsibility.
The contradictions of the Republicans' plans are legion. They intend to somehow cut Medicare by $214 billion this decade even as the president vows $400 billion in prescription help for retirees. A $93 billion Medicaid cut is blithely ordered by lawmakers who do not have enough daring to ask the president about the missing budget costs for the looming Iraq war. The cuts, the largest in history, are mean spirited in the face of the Bush Republicans' deepening embrace of deficit spending. And deficit spending, firmly blessed by the administration, will be the rule once Congress gets beyond this period of public relations budget fantasizing. 
The G.O.P. leaders are laying out what is supposed to be a fair outlook of the fiscal future -- a budgetary road map for government to find its way beyond hard times. They are leaving a lesson in how to pretend to toughness while rolling the red ink over time's horizon. In the process, the national debt which the president so recently vowed to shrink will balloon from $5 trillion to $12 trillion at the end of his economic "growth" plan, years after he is gone from office. 
Commendably, Senate moderates alarmed about their own constituents' reactions are vowing to halve the tax cuts. But nothing short of public furor is an adequate antidote at this point. The moderates who would split the differences of two extremes are likely to be marginalized as the president and House drive an ideological bargain no less fateful as the talk of war.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE ARAB WORLD; 
Arab Nations Brace for an Upheaval From a War in Iraq

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SACHS 

DATELINE: CAIRO, March 15 

 BODY:
With varying degrees of fear and resignation, Arabs and their leaders are waiting for the earthquake that they believe a war on Iraq will create in their region.
 Shock waves from the Persian Gulf war in 1991 produced the Madrid peace conference and a breakthrough in the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Small but persistent reform movements sprang up to push for more open governance. Iraq became less of a threat to its neighbors and less of a force in inter-Arab politics. 
 That war raised hopes. But many in the region have since soured on the idea that shaking up the region's established order may bring positive changes.
The American military bases that were established in Saudi Arabia as a result of the war gave Muslim militants like Osama bin Laden a pretext for attacking the Saudi rulers. Hopes for an Arab-Israeli peace have evaporated, fueling more Islamic militancy. Anger at the United States, both for its support of Israel and its defense of autocratic Arab rulers, has become widespread.
The official Arab stance -- the only common position that the fractious leaders could agree upon -- opposes a war on Iraq, but calls on it to comply with United Nations resolutions. 
Most Arab leaders have made it clear that they would prefer to see Saddam Hussein relinquish power. But they are all apprehensive about the Bush administration's proclaimed mission to bring democracy to the Arab world, starting with Iraq.
Arab public opinion appears overwhelmingly opposed to a war on Iraq. Although Mr. Hussein was once lionized as the potential liberator of Palestinians, there has been almost no support expressed this time for him or his government.
But the Palestinian uprising, followed closely in the region, remains the benchmark for Arab views about the United States. Anti-American feelings have replaced pan-Arab nationalism as an ideology that binds Arabs of different political views. No other ideology has truly replaced it, although hostility to the United States and its support for Israel now runs deep enough in the region to be seen as a new dogma that binds disparate Arab groups.
For most Arab leaders, an American-led war, with or without United Nations backing, carries great political risks.
They fear that images of civilian casualties in Iraq could inflame public opinion and create a strong reaction against their own governments. They also fear a resurgence of terrorism in their own countries, especially if the United States is seen to be an occupier of Iraq after a war.
Here are the positions of the major Arab nations in the Middle East.

SAUDI ARABIA -- The Saudi leadership has worried openly about the possibility that Iraq might shatter along ethnic and religious lines as a result of a war, with a push for power by the Iraqi Shiite Muslim majority.
Such an outcome could directly aggravate Saudi Arabia's own brittle relations with its Shiite minority.
"Iraq is one of these states whose independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity should be maintained," Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said last week. 
The presence of American troops and an air base in Saudi Arabia also remains extremely troublesome for the Saudi leaders.

KUWAIT -- Liberated from Iraqi invasion forces 12 years ago by an American-led coalition, Kuwait has turned over one-third of its territory to the American forces preparing for an attack on Iraq.
While many Kuwaitis say they would rather not experience another war, they also hold no illusions about Mr. Hussein. The Kuwaiti leadership has prepared for hostilities. The state oil company said it had raised production to compensate for any interruption in world oil supplies and had prepared contingency plans to shut some vulnerable oil fields near the Iraqi border.

EGYPT -- President Hosni Mubarak has warned that another war on Iraq will devastate the region, incite unrest and severely damage the Arab nations' faltering economies. He has, however, pointedly blamed Iraq for the crisis and said a deadline should be set for its compliance with the United Nations. State-controlled newspapers have been publishing articles and sharply worded editorials criticizing Mr. Hussein.
Officials in Cairo have told the United States that they want compensation for the economic losses they expect to suffer from a war -- as much as $6 billion, by some estimates.

JORDAN -- The tremors from an attack on Iraq could shake Jordan to its core. More than half its population is Palestinian. Because of Palestinian support of Mr. Hussein, in 1990, more than 400,000 Palestinians were deported from Persian Gulf states, and gulf subsidies to the Palestine Liberation Organization were suspended.
After the last two years of violence between Israel and the Palestinians, many Jordanians nurture a deep distrust of American intentions in the region. Those feelings could be exploited by Jordan's active Islamic militant movement.
In addition, Jordan's economy is largely dependent on Iraq, which is Jordan's biggest export market. King Abdullah II has sought to show he opposes war, while at the same time counting on the United States for financial assistance. The strains are showing. 

TUNISIA, LIBYA AND YEMEN -- These countries opposed the American-led coalition and supported Iraq in 1991. They have been careful not to end up on the wrong side of the United States this time. Leaders of the three countries oppose a war on Iraq, though they have been critical of Arab states that openly cooperate with the United States.

THE GULF STATES -- The five small but wealthy emirates have essentially thrown in their lot with the Bush administration. After signing defense pacts with the United States after the last gulf war, they permitted huge naval and air bases to be built on their territories.
The United Arab Emirates, which controls the world's third-largest oil reserves -- after Saudi Arabia and Iraq -- also electrified an Arab League summit meeting earlier this month by urging the 22 member states to call on Mr. Hussein to step down. The proposal, an extraordinary breach of traditional Arab etiquette, was not formally discussed. But it has drawn open support from Bahrain and Kuwait and unofficial support from several other Arab leaders.

IRAN AND SYRIA -- Both countries, which are considered by the United States to be sponsors of terrorism, have firmly placed themselves in open opposition to the United States. Their positions are widely seen as a form of self-defense: their leaders may fear that their own governments may soon draw the hostile attentions of the Bush administration.
Neither has had good relations with Mr. Hussein's government, but they have preferred in recent weeks to portray Iraq as cooperative with the United Nations. They have also tried to use the Iraq crisis to burnish their images as guardians of the Palestinians.
But Syria may have burned bridges in the region. President Bashar al-Assad called on Arab states to expel American forces and when his proposal was ignored, he suggested that his fellow Arab leaders were tools of the United States.

CORRECTION-DATE: March 20, 2003

 CORRECTION:
An article on Sunday about countries in the Persian Gulf region that were bracing for upheaval as war in Iraq drew near characterized them incorrectly. While most are indeed Arab, one -- Iran, which opposes armed intervention by the United States -- is ethnically Persian.

HEADLINE: The Nation; 
To Quit, to Stay, Or to Toss a Wrench?

BYLINE:  By TODD S. PURDUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
SIR THOMAS MORE did it. So did William Jennings Bryan and Cyrus R. Vance. Some people thought Robert S. McNamara should have. Others, in their dreams, hope Colin L. Powell might yet.
 Whether the job is lord chancellor of England under Henry VIII or secretary of state under Jimmy Carter, resigning on principle is about the most powerful statement any government official can ever make. 
 "It really was for me an agonizing decision," said Jerald F. terHorst, who resigned as President Gerald R. Ford's press secretary after just 30 days' service, to protest his boss's unconditional pardon of Richard M. Nixon. "I stayed up most of that night just formulating a three-paragraph letter of resignation."
Last week, Clare Short, the outspoken secretary of international development in Prime Minister Tony Blair's Labor cabinet in Britain, threatened to become the latest high-ranking member of this exclusive club if her government joined the United States in war with Iraq without a second Security Council resolution.
Already in the current Iraq crisis, two lower-ranking American career diplomats have quit in disagreement with Mr. Bush's Iraq policy. 
John H. Brown, who had been a cultural attache at the embassy in Moscow, submitted his resignation to Mr. Powell, saying, "Throughout the globe, the United States is becoming associated with the unjustified use of force" and is "giving birth to an anti-American century."
And John Brady Kiesling, who had been political counselor at the American embassy in Athens, resigned last month, saying in a letter to Mr. Powell, "I do so with a heavy heart." 
That was the phrase Mr. Vance used when he resigned as President Jimmy Carter's secretary of state in 1980 in disagreement over the failed military effort to rescue the hostages in Iran. In quitting that post, Mr. Vance joined Bryan, a pacifist who resigned to protest Woodrow Wilson's tough stand against Germany.
Mr. Powell has stayed loyal to his commander in chief through years of internal battles with more hawkish figures, but that hasn't stopped some doves from fantasizing that frustration might push him to quit.
Insiders who disagree over policy have options short of resignation, but sometimes they are costly. In the mid-1930's, Ralph Wigram, an official in the British foreign office, risked prison when he secretly fed details of Germany's efforts to rearm itself to Winston Churchill, who was then out of power and trying to rouse Britain against appeasement of Hitler. Nearly four decades later, Daniel Ellsberg, a former Defense Department insider who had taken a copy of the Pentagon Papers to a new post at the RAND Corporation, leaked the secret study of the Vietnam war to The New York Times in hopes of curtailing the conflict. He was charged with a long list of felonies, but the prosecution collapsed when the Watergate scandal revealed that the Nixon White House had burglarized Mr. Ellsberg's psychiatrist's office to gain evidence against him.
Another time-honored reason for staying an insider -- to shape policy from within -- carries less risk. In his memoir, Mr. McNamara said he executed the escalation of the Vietnam War, though he had come to oppose the policy, because he was loyal to President Lyndon B. Johnson and "until the day I left, I believed I could influence his decisions."
Peter B. Edelman resigned as an assistant secretary of health and human services in 1996 to protest President Clinton's signing of the bill to overhaul the welfare system.
"I think it's highly personal," said Mr. Edelman, now a professor at Georgetown University's law school. "I can't think of any rules." He then listed a few, saying the dispute "does have to be something that's very basic, that's really an extremely consequential issue."
That rule certainly covers Elliot Richardson, Richard M. Nixon's attorney general, who resigned in 1973 rather than fire the special Watergate prosecutor as the president had ordered him to do.
"The other thing, I suppose," Mr. Edelman added, "is whether it's something that you yourself have anything to do with. In my case, it was that I was working directly on the issue and would be responsible for implementing this policy."
Mr. terHorst, who is now 80, said a pardon of Nixon might eventually have been justified to avoid the spectacle of a drawn-out prosecution, but he said he had never wavered in his view that it was morally unfair to grant the former president an unconditional pardon while his aides were going to jail and draft evaders were receiving only conditional pardons.
"I guess what impelled me would be applicable today," he said. "Are you loyal to a person, to the Constitution, the country or to your own conscience? In my case, my conscience would not let me do this without feeling I had betrayed what I understood to be a basic requirement. I couldn't defend it. I was not going to go out there and defend it when I felt it was wrong."

HEADLINE: Labor Leader Backs Away From Bush 

BYLINE:  By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 14 

 BODY:
Eager to nail down some union support, President Bush has worked unusually hard to court James P. Hoffa, the Teamsters' president. Mr. Bush attended a Teamsters picnic in Detroit on Labor Day, held a cocktail reception for Mr. Hoffa at the Republican National Convention in Philadelphia and invited him to sit in the first lady's box during a State of the Union address. 
 But this intense courtship has failed to win over Mr. Hoffa, whose powerful union has 1.4 million members and is especially strong in important swing states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Indeed, in recent weeks Mr. Hoffa has sounded more and more disaffected with the Bush administration, with his criticisms culminating in an outburst against Labor Secretary Elaine L. Chao and the administration at an A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting last month in Florida. 
 In Mr. Hoffa's view, President Bush has shown far too little concern for the American worker. "He has to work on taking care of the average American," Mr. Hoffa said. "The great mass of people in this country are struggling right now. We've lost two million jobs since 9/11. We had 308,000 more people out of work in February. We have to urge this administration to understand the plight of the average American, who is having a real hard time right now."
In an interview in his spacious office, which has a spectacular view of the Capitol, Mr. Hoffa ticked off a long list of administration actions that he said were either antiworker or antiunion: moving to open the border to Mexican trucks; supporting the repeal of a law that sought to prevent ergonomic injuries; negotiating trade agreements that have few protections for workers; proposing far tougher financial disclosure rules for unions; sponsoring tax cuts that favor the rich.
"The tax plan has to be geared more to working people," Mr. Hoffa said, criticizing the president's proposal to eliminate taxes on corporate dividends. "We have to stimulate the economy, and the way to do that is to put money in the pockets of the average American, who spends 100 percent of their income. You don't do that through tax cuts for the wealthy."
Despite Mr. Hoffa's criticisms of the president, Republican strategists hold out hope that the International Brotherhood of Teamsters might endorse Mr. Bush in the 2004 presidential election. Mr. Hoffa backed Al Gore in 2000, but made clear after Mr. Bush's victory that he wanted to work with the president and Congressional Republicans.
At the moment, Mr. Hoffa seems to be playing hard to get, insisting that his union will look at all the candidates. He floats the possibility of endorsing Mr. Bush, while simultaneously praising several Democratic candidates, especially Representative Richard A. Gephardt, the Missouri Democrat, who was his classmate at the University of Michigan Law School.
"We are keeping all of our options open, and are urging this administration to be more sensitive to the needs of working families," Mr. Hoffa said. "If they're not, we would maintain our options to back other candidates."
When Mr. Hoffa spoke at the A.F.L.-C.I.O. meeting in Hollywood, Fla., on Feb. 26, after Secretary Chao angered many labor leaders by talking at length about union corruption and expressing her opposition to a higher minimum wage, he was somewhat more emphatic in saying the Teamsters might not endorse Mr. Bush next year. At that meeting he said the administration did not understand labor issues, was veering to the right and was pushing many anti-union proposals. 
But on the eveof a possible war against Iraq, Mr. Hoffa appeared to take pains not to attack the president, instead choosing careful, diplomatic language to criticize him. 
He did not hide his warm feelings toward Mr. Gephardt. "He speaks out on the issues that confront the average American," he said. "He's one of the few candidates who speaks that way. He talks about the issue of trade, which has taken millions of jobs out of this country. Obviously we're going to be looking at him." 
While many labor leaders like Mr. Gephardt, some voice doubt about backing him because they question his electability.
In an effort to show his bipartisan approach, Mr. Hoffa was quick to show a visitor a framed photo of him with President Bill Clinton and then, on an adjoining wall, a photo of him with President Bush -- next to a huge portrait of his famous father, James R. Hoffa, who was president of the Teamsters four decades ago.
White House officials say they have appreciated working with Mr. Hoffa on several issues, including energy drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and enacting terrorism insurance legislation to help spur building construction. 
"There will be times when we agree and times we disagree, but the president will continue to work to find common ground where we can get things done," said Scott McClellan, a White House spokesman. "Some of the issues where we've worked together, like the president's comprehensive energy plan, mean more jobs will be created."
Mr. Hoffa strongly backed Mr. Bush on Iraq, parting from the many labor leaders who have criticized the president for alienating allies, failing to build a consensus and repeatedly threatening unilateral action and pre-emptive strikes. 
"It's a good time for all Americans, now that we're on the brink of going to war, to be behind the president and be behind troops who are in harm's way," he said. "It would obviously be nice to have a resolution from the U.N., but I don't think that should tie our hands now that we have 300,000 troops on the border of Iraq. We have now moved beyond that."
With Mr. Hoffa sounding increasingly critical of the Bush administration, some Republicans say they fear the Teamsters will abandon the Republicans altogether in the 2004 elections. But Mr. Hoffa insists this will not be the case.
The Teamsters, he said, have worked well with some moderate Republicans and have supported several dozen Republicans. He had kind words for Representatives Jack Quinn and Peter T. King of New York, Peter Hoekstra of Michigan, and Frank A. LoBiondo and Mike Ferguson of New Jersey. He said the Teamsters would probably continue their pattern of contributions in the 2002 elections -- 84 percent for Democrats, 16 percent for Republicans.
But Mr. Hoffa denounced Tom DeLay, the House majority leader, as extremely antiunion, and said he would like the Democrats to regain control of at least one house of Congress.
"I'd like to see a more humane Congress," he said. "To some extent it's better when Democrats have control. That way they control the committees and the debate, and they can move a lot of issues that can help working people."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: BAGHDAD; 
Iraqis Join a Rally to Show That War Will Be Resisted

BYLINE:  By JOHN F. BURNS 

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, March 15 

 BODY:
Waving Kalashnikov rifles in the air and burning American and Israeli flags, thousands of Iraqis took to the streets of Baghdad and other cities today in a tightly marshaled show of defiance for the United States.
 The main demonstration in Baghdad appeared to have been organized with a view to cautioning President Bush about the resistance American troops may confront in Iraq. 
 Along with soldiers and militiamen, factory and office workers, women's groups and schoolchildren, the battalions parading past a reviewing stand on one of the capital's main shopping streets were a colorful panorama of Iraq's ethnic and sectarian groups.
Iraqi officials offered what appeared to be hugely ambitious estimates of the number of demonstrators, with some saying that as many as a million people had turned out in a city with a population of 4.5 million. By the rough estimates of Western reporters, the total appeared to have been in the range of 100,000 to 200,000. According to some at the rally, many of those taking part, perhaps most, had been ordered to attend by their work supervisors or by neighborhood committees. 
But even if the turnout was hardly spontaneous, and the mood curiously desultory, even limp, the demonstration showed that Saddam Hussein, after 23 years in power, still has an impressive organizational ability and the power to compel compliance. What remains uncertain, even in the face of the vows Iraqis offer on such occasions to fight American troops, is whether many will have the weapons, the perseverance or the will to do so.
In a society that has lived for 35 years under the rigid, neo-Stalinist compulsions of the ruling Baath Party, organizer of the rally today, any attempt to say what Iraqis really believe, or what they may do in conditions of extreme crisis for the government, is in the end largely a matter of conjecture.
Some Iraqis have begun to speak to Westerners with an unprecedented candor. But most people here, disciplined by years of fear and unquestioning fealty, still trust nobody when it comes to political matters outside their immediate family and closest friends, and sometimes do not even trust them.
But something of the crosscurrents that are flowing was suggested by a dinner that one Westerner attended in a Baghdad home on Friday night. The hosts, a retired army officer and his wife, a teacher, fell to arguing about what to do if Mr. Bush returned from his Sunday meeting in the Azores with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain with a decision to order American troops into combat. Iraqi officials who discussed that meeting privately today said they believed that it would be one of the last, crucial watersheds on the road to war.
The retired officer said he would find a weapon and fight, not out of personal loyalty to Mr. Hussein, of whom he was severely critical, but because his yearning for an Iraq free of political repression was outweighed by his sense of patriotic indignation at the prospect of an American general supplanting Mr. Hussein. The officer's wife, alarmed, said she would lock all the doors of the house, as well as the windows, and prevent her husband from leaving, because joining armed resistance to the American forces would be to invite death in a hopeless cause. 
What does seem clear, to just about all Westerners who have visited Iraq in recent months, is that Mr. Hussein and his aging oligarchy have long since exhausted the popular support that greeted the Baath revolution of 1968.
Iraqis whisper with increasing desperation over what has become of Iraq's oil prosperity of the 1970's after punishing wars with Iran in the 1980's and with the United States and its coalition partners over Kuwait in 1991, along with more than a decade of United Nations economic sanctions that have speeded the country's decline toward having a social and economic profile akin to that of much of sub-Saharan Africa. On top of this, there have been the ruthless workings of a secret police with few counterparts in the modern world.
But the same Iraqis who condemn the years of misrule have deep misgivings about the prospect of an American imperium. In that respect, at least, the demonstrations today in Baghdad, however bereft of real passion they may have seemed to outsiders in the waving of portraits of Mr. Hussein and the chanting of his name, may have conveyed something of the reality awaiting American forces if they end up controlling Iraq.
Reporters watching the flow of humanity were approached repeatedly by people who said little or nothing about Mr. Hussein, but a torrent of things about America's greed for Iraq's oil, about its desire to weaken Iraq as a source of opposition to Israel and what is taken here to be its suppression of the Palestinians, and about the arrogance of American power under Mr. Bush. The remarks came from men in Western suits and women in black Islamic cloaks; from soldiers, doctors, professors, teachers, teenagers in school uniforms, Muslim clerics and shopkeepers, from right across the spectrum of Iraqi society.
One woman, who identified herself as Aliya, a 50-year-old high school English teacher, pushed her way through the crowd to a group of reporters, lifted the hood of her black cloak back from her forehead, and ran off a lengthy checklist of grievances against America, from oil to Israel. Listening in, not far away, was a man who appeared to be an Iraqi secret police agent. But the woman, seemingly indifferent, offered a revealing answer when she was asked if she thought Iraqis fighting American soldiers would be doing so for Mr. Hussein, or for Iraq's freedom from foreign control.
"For Iraq," she said. 
In other respects, the rally cannot have been a resounding morale booster for the ruling party. Western diplomats here have estimated that the core of Mr. Hussein's ruling elite -- die-hards, mostly men, who have a deep personal commitment to the Iraqi leader, or who are so closely identified with his rule that they may feel they have little option but to lead the fight for his survival -- could number anywhere from 5,000 to 15,000, in a nation of 24 million. Western military experts have estimated that Iraq's army may have as few as 130,000 soldiers, about a third as many as in 1991. 
On the podium for the rally on the 14th of Ramadan Street, in the mundane heart of a stretch of fast-food restaurants and electronic appliance stores, were a group of men who would probably be counted among those die-hards: senior army officers and Baath Party officials, all in green serge uniforms, the army men distinguished by heavy-caliber pistols loosely holstered at their waists, one of them, in a heavy mustache, black beret and Ray-Ban glasses, almost a ringer for Mr. Hussein. 
They also had a distracted, almost disengaged air, as though they, like the marchers, were mostly going through the motions. 
The marchers, for their part, seemed to approach their task with more of a carnival spirit than anything approaching real fervor. They waved back in a flaccid way, many of them smoking and chatting as they went. Even their banners, in English, seemed polite, rather than militant. 
Many of the marching groups came with Kalashnikovs, and waved them, smiling, at Westerners. But on closer inspection, almost none of the marchers' weapons appeared to have bullets in their magazines.

Tens of Thousands March Against Iraq War

BYLINE:  By ERIC LICHTBLAU 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 15 

 BODY:
In what many saw as a last chance to head off military action, tens of thousands of antiwar protesters marched in several demonstrations around the country today in opposition to the Bush administration's policy on Iraq.
 In Washington, just hours after President Bush said in his weekly radio address that he saw little chance that Iraq would disarm without the use of force, throngs of protesters armed with banners and bullhorns implored Mr. Bush to abandon a possible war. 
 "The people can stop the war," Congressman John Conyers Jr., Democrat of Michigan, told thousands of cheering supporters near the Washington Monument on a mild, sunny but breezy afternoon. He urged people to continue to protest "until this madness is ended." 
Marching on streets that pass within a block or two of the White House, which they were not allowed to approach more closely, the protesters flooded nearly a dozen blocks of city streets in a sea of colorful and often angry antiwar banners and chanted slogans.
Although police gave no official crowd count, a park police supervisor working the scene estimated that the protesters totaled 50,000 people. It was hard to be sure if there were that many, as some came and went, while others milled around in clusters on side streets. Protesters gathered to listen to speeches, then marched around the White House. 
If the crowd was smaller than some recent antiwar protests, it might have been because organizers called the "emergency" action only a few weeks ago. 
Police said the crowd was generally peaceful, although about a half-dozen people were arrested for illegally entering the lobby of the World Bank, a target of past economic protests. Hundreds of police enforced barricades and massed at intersections.
In San Francisco, demonstrators filled Civic Center Plaza, ignoring forecasts for heavy rain and possible unruly acts by splinter protest marchers. Police and organizers declined to provide a crowd estimate.
Some protesters described the mood of the marchers there as less festive than at a February rally. But many demonstrators remained hopeful for a peaceful resolution. "It's worth it to march to make the numbers count and be counted," said Sarah Warnock, 41, a biologist. 
A splinter protest at the February rally turned violent. San Francisco officials rerouted today's rally to avoid the downtown shopping area where rioters vandalized stores. 
Today the police said they had arrested more than 150 of several hundred people in splinter marches away from the main protest. There was one arrest for throwing a smoke bomb at a police officer, and others were charged with failure to disperse and illegal assembly.
In Los Angeles, the Reverend Jesse Jackson led a noisy and soaking wet procession of about 2,500 people through downtown. 
Tama Winograd, a music executive from Hollywood, said the weather was not a hindrance. "I would be here today, even if there was an earthquake," Ms. Winograd said. 
About 30,000 protesters converged on the banks of the Willamette River in Portland, Ore. Representative John Lewis, a Democrat from Georgia who marched alongside Martin Luther King, told the crowd, "People around the world will not be inspired by our missiles and our guns; they will be inspired by our ideas."
Separately, a group of 41 Nobel laureates in science, medicine and economics who signed a declaration in January opposing war with Iraq said today that eight more laureates, all winners of the Peace Prize, have joined their cause. The eight include Desmond Tutu and the Dalai Lama. 
Today's Washington protest was organized by a group called Answer, which stands for Act Now to Stop War and End Racism. The group, formed after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, has drawn criticism from some people inside and out of the antiwar movement because some of its chief organizers are active in radical socialist causes and because it has taken controversial positions on issues not directly related to Iraq. At today's rally, speakers addressed a wide range of issues, including Palestinian statehood, pollution, affirmative action and world hunger.
"We don't police our speakers at all," said Larry Holmes, a spokesman for Answer. "People here raise Palestine, Colombia, everything, but it's all basically about peace."
Mr. Holmes said that if war with Iraq breaks out, the group plans more severe acts of civil disobedience around the country, including mass sit-ins. 
While a New York Times/CBS News Poll last week found that 55 percent of Americans would support an American invasion of Iraq even in defiance of the United Nations, there was near unanimity at today's demonstration in opposition to the war.
Organizers of the protest sought to present a diverse face to emphasize the breadth of dissatisfaction with the administration's Iraq policy.
There were students in tie-dyed shirts playing hacky sack and grandmothers selling antiwar pins. Local residents were joined by out-of-towners. And veteran activists, some who protested the Vietnam War, mingled with novice protesters.
Fred Gregory, a retired Army captain, said he came from Maryland with his wife, Charlotte, to join the protests because he did not believe that Iraq posed the significant threat that the administration says it does. 
At 68, Mr. Gregory said, "this is the first time I've ever protested anything in my life."
President Bush was the target of criticism in speeches and on antiwar placards, with numerous handmade signs mocking him. Ramsey Clark, the former attorney general who was one of more than 50 speakers to address the rally, told protesters that Mr. Bush should be impeached.
Mr. Conyers, the Michigan congressman, urged Mr. Bush to pay close attention to the rising tide of discontent over Iraq. "People have stopped wars before -- ordinary people," he said later. "It can happen again here."

Manhattan Law Firm Makes a Successful Foray

BYLINE:  By WARREN STRUGATCH 

 BODY:
SEVERAL days after Lyndon B. Johnson trounced Barry Goldwater in the 1964 election, Robert R. McMillan, then an ambitious young assistant to former Vice President Richard M. Nixon, accompanied his boss to a gathering of Republican Party leaders at the Waldorf-Astoria. In a suite on the 35th floor, Mr. McMillan watched former President Dwight D. Eisenhower thwart any move by Goldwater to siphon off supporters and form a conservative splinter party.
 "Eisenhower dictated a big-tent statement about party inclusiveness and sent Goldwater downstairs to read it to the reporters," said Mr. McMillan, recalling the event one recent afternoon in his sunny office filled with memorabilia at his Melville law firm. "Then they sent me downstairs to keep an eye on Barry, with instructions to come right back upstairs and tell them if he diverged from the script. Which he didn't, by the way." 
 The qualities that presumably endeared Mr. McMillan to the Republican Party chiefs -- diplomacy, party loyalty and attentiveness to detail, among them -- have served him well over the years as he built a reputation as a consummate insider and consensus-builder. Beginning with Nixon, every Republican president has tapped him to serve on a commission or head up a task force, and so have most Republican governors of New York.
Although his own political career stalled when he lost a 1988 bid for the United States Senate to Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democratic incumbent, he found his niche in his law practice.
Mr. McMillan, 69, may appear to be a throwback to civic-minded lawyers of an earlier generation. He devotes hundreds of hours a year to various social causes, including the Long Island Housing Partnership, which he helped found and which has built 1,300 units of low-cost housing on the Island.
He has headed various foundations, answered numerous calls for pro-bono help, and collected a stream of citizen-of-the-year citations from groups like the Boy Scouts, Helen Keller Services for the Blind and the American Jewish Committee.
As the genial co-host of "Face-Off," a weekly political discussion program seen on Thursday evenings on WLIW, Mr. McMillan is in his 10th year of taking the conservative side in his ongoing debates with Lawrence Levy, the Newsday columnist who serves as his liberal foil.
And as the managing partner and chief rainmaker at McMillan, Rather, Bennett & Farinacci, which he founded in 1991, Mr. McMillan has built up a small but respected local law firm. 
"Small but respected" may be fast becoming an anachronism. Over the winter, five of the nine partners resigned, taking along with them their billings, just over $4 million of the firm's $8 million in annual billings. William Cornachio and Walter Gumersell, both specialists in corporate transactions, went to Rivkin Radler in Uniondale. Barry Cohen and James Rigano, environmental lawyers, departed for Certilman Balen Adler & Hyman in East Meadow. And Guy Germano, who practices land-use law, left to start his own firm.
On March 3, Mr.McMillan announced that what was left of his firm had been acquired by Fischbein Badillo Wagner & Harding of New York. Although Mr. McMillan and three colleagues at his firm -- Leslie R. Bennett, Richard Fogel and Donald Farinacci -- became partners in Fischbein Badillo, none will be a name partner.
"We didn't sell the firm because partners had left," Mr. McMillan said. "The plan had been to sell the firm for a while. We considered several possible candidates. We realized we needed to be able to offer our clients more services." 
The transaction establishes a Long Island beachhead in influential Manhattan legal circles, apparently for the first time. Richard Fischbein, Fischbein Badillo's managing partner, said that the firm was continuing to scout for at least one additional acquisition, and possibly more.
"We think there's great potential on the Island for a regional law firm, and we are looking to expand," Mr. Fischbein said. "There is an enormous amount of business that is not being covered and handled the way it should be. Long Island is grossly under-lawyered."
By "under-lawyered," Mr. Fischbein said he meant that most Long Island law firms were too small to provide a full range of legal services to commercial clients.
With about 100 lawyers, Fischbein Badillo is considered a medium-size firm in Manhattan. But on Long Island, it immediately becomes one of the largest firms, behind Rivkin Radler in Uniondale, which has about 130 lawyers.
John V.N. Klein, the chairman of the Meyer Suozzi English & Klein, the Mineola law firm, said that today's sluggish economy would be conducive to more such deals. "The advantage the New York guys have is that they have the economic resources to make attractive offers," he said. "They can give stability to suburban firms, which are suffering from the economic downturn." 
Some see the spread of Manhattan firms on Long Island as inevitable. "For years, Manhattan law firms have been expanding north into Westchester and Connecticut and west into New Jersey," said Jerry Kowalski, a Manhattan consultant who brought McMillan, Rather to the attention of Fischbein Badillo. "What did not exist was a significant New York law firm with a presence on Long Island."
"McMillan, Rather is a repository of really fine lawyers who were dealt a body blow with these guys walking out the door," Mr. Kowalski said.
The departures will not affect the acquisition, he said. "The important thing is that the partners coming on board now are all players, are all well regarded. They share the same view about how to conduct a successful law firm as does Fischbein Badillo."
Fischbein Badillo is known for its expertise in real estate law as well as for the political careers of some of its partners. Herman Badillo, for example, is a former congressman and New York City deputy mayor. James J. Florio was once governor of New Jersey. Raymond B. Harding is vice chairman of the Liberal Party's New York State chapter. And Robert F. Wagner was mayor of New York City.
Mr. Cornachio, who left McMillan, Rather in January, said that Fischbein Badillo may find its entry into the local legal services market will take longer than it seems to anticipate. "The Long Island market is based on relationships, strong personal and professional relationships, and these can take an entire career to develop," he said. "You can't just create a corporate law practice on Long Island by bringing in a great corporate lawyer. You can't create the relationships, frankly, by buying law firms."
Mr. McMillan said he was enthusiastic about the future but admitted to pangs of nostalgia for the law firm that is no more. "I think of what we accomplished as a law firm," he said. 
But then he quickly added, "If we hadn't accomplished all we had, Fischbein Badillo would never have been interested in us."

HEADLINE: ON POLITICS; 
Corzine Wants Democrats To Lean More to the Left

BYLINE:  By Raymond Hernandez; Raymond Hernandez reports from Washington for The New York Times.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
There has been no shortage of second-guessing within Democratic circles after the party's devastating losses in the last year's elections.
 Many party loyalists, particularly liberals, are complaining bitterly that the party has lost its philosophical bearings and, in the process, become far too timid about challenging Republicans. 
 But that may change -- at least if Jon S. Corzine, New Jersey's senior senator -- has anything to say about it (which he does).
As the new head of the Senate Democratic Campaign Committee, Mr. Corzine has an instant national platform, control over an expected $70 million war chest, a hand in shaping the party's agenda on Capitol Hill and the job of recruiting candidates for the 2004 election. 
Suddenly, the left has a powerful ideological soul mate in Mr. Corzine, who, in many respects, is a throwback to a time when names like McCarthy and Kennedy loomed large in the Democratic Party and the word liberal was a badge of honor.
To be sure, Mr. Corzine has gone to great lengths to identify himself as a progressive, mindful of the stigma that is attached to the word liberal in the current political climate.
And Mr. Corzine, who was an established Wall Street figure before entering politics about two years ago, also has the kind of gilt-edged credentials that would make any country club Republican envious.
But even before last November's elections, Mr. Corzine was a dissenting voice in the party.
He spoke out against the direction in which Democrats were headed, arguing that they had blurred the lines between themselves and Republicans on issues ranging from tax policy to a possible war with Iraq.
But back then, he was just another freshman senator, ranking 99th in seniority, in a party dominated by politicians who maintained that Democrats ran the risk of alienating moderate voters if they moved too far to the left.
Now, Mr. Corzine clearly relishes the chance to do something about the party's direction. "There are a lot of us who would like Democrats to speak like Democrats," he said in a recent interview.
That places him squarely at odds with a wing of the party that gained influence under Bill Clinton, who used a recent speech to argue against the notion that the party needed to return to its liberal roots.
In fact, several of Mr. Clinton's ideological allies maintain that that approach would further diminish the party's standing in 2004.
Interestingly, the last New Jersey senator to run the Senate Democrats' re-election committee was Robert G. Torricell, Mr. Corzine's political patron and a skillful politician who brought the party within striking distance of the majority by taking a page from the Clinton playbook.
Mr. Corzine said he hears frequently from party donors who complain that the Democrats have failed to offer a coherent message that distinguishes them from Republicans.
But he sees positive signs, starting with a Democratic filibuster blocking a vote in the Senate on President Bush's nomination of Miguel Estrada to the influential United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. "I think our stance on Estrada has sent a message to our base that we are reinvigorated," Mr. Corzine said.
He also sees a potential political vulnerability for Republicans in the way the Bush administration has handled the economy and questions about the cost of a war and its aftermath in Iraq. Specifically, he pointed to the administration's failure to discuss such costs at a time when it has proposed yet another round of tax cuts that will drain the federal treasury.
"I think that Democrats are stirred," he said.
In making his case for reinvigorating the party, Mr. Corzine even went so far as to quote Howard Dean, the former governor of Vermont, who has moved Democratic audiences with his dogged attacks on the Bush administration and his outspoken support of liberal Democratic positions. (Mr. Corzine said, however, that that should not be taken as an endorsement of Mr. Dean's presidential candidacy.
Mr. Corzine also suggested that the party could break through to the American public by directly addressing the issue of national security. He said Republicans made headway in the last elections by "falsely" portraying themselves as the party could manage national security in these uncertain times.
But the reality of the situation, he said, is now catching up to Republicans. He noted that the White House, in a recent reversal, acknowledged what Democrats have been saying all along: that a recent homeland defense budget, shaped largely by Congressional Republicans, was too meager.
"It's an indication that they know they have a vulnerability," Mr. Corzine said.
One of the drawbacks of Mr. Corzine's new job is that he will have to spend a lot of time on the road, away from New Jersey, raising money and rallying the troops. Last month, for instance, aides said he visited San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas, Miami and Chicago between Feb. 19 and 22.

Out of the Mouths of Students: Talk of Iraq

BYLINE:  By MERRI ROSENBERG 

 BODY:
CONSIDER it the ultimate current events lesson.
 The entire student body at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua -- 1,140 ninth through 12th graders -- filled the gym during a schoolwide forum on Iraq last week. 
 Five students, representing extracurricular organizations including Amnesty International and the Students for Social Justice Club and two social studies teachers presented arguments for and against war in Iraq. After the half-hour presentation, students dispersed to 50 classrooms to continue the discussion in small groups. 
Students heard a balanced and respectful presentation from both students and faculty members.
"Iraq does not pose a significant threat to the United States," said Keenan Steiner, a senior and the Student Council treasurer. "Invading Iraq will end up hurting our national security. The consequence of war with Iraq is just too scary."
Another student, Michael Pollack, a junior, had a different perspective. "The world's security has been challenged by Saddam Hussein," he said. "Saddam has refused to disarm. War is scary and war is dangerous. But we have to recognize the terror Saddam is."
Emily Curran, a senior, said: "Another war will only inflame Islamic radicals. A war against Iraq will not prevent terrorism. It will incite it."
And Kristin Kelly, a senior, said: "A few weeks ago, I would have said that I was against the war. Most of all, I would have condemned the haste. But Saddam has one of the most disgusting records of human rights abuses. His use of chemical weapons is even more indiscriminate. Saddam is a threat to his own country, and a terrifying threat to us."
While Chappaqua's forum was one of the more ambitious attempts to deal with questions about war in Iraq, the subject is very much on the radar at schools in the county. Irvington High School plans to hold a similar program on Friday. Some eighth-grade social studies classes at Robert R. Bell Middle School in Chappaqua conducted a research project about war in Iraq from economic, social and geopolitical perspectives. At the Ursuline School in New Rochelle, middle school students are examining issues of war in Iraq as a current events exercise. 
"In social studies, the teachers are incorporating Iraq into class discussion," said Steven Goldberg, social studies department chairman at New Rochelle High School. "Students are following events on the national and international front, and teachers are having students discuss events as they unfold, whether it's the speeches by the president or secretary of state or the situation at the United Nations."
Horace Greeley students who are enrolled in the school's elective on foreign policy spent considerable time analyzing United Nations Resolution 1441. Earlier this winter, students at Croton-Harmon High School heard from a West Point officer about his experiences fighting in Afghanistan. Many Westchester students participated in the protest against the war on Feb. 15 at the United Nations, and students from Croton-Harmon, Chappaqua, Dobbs Ferry, Ossining and Mamaroneck. were among those who walked out of class as part of a national protest on March 5.
Like their counterparts around the country, students are concerned about the situation, and teachers are eager to capture their interest in current events to lead to further discussions.
"You can't teach now without talking about current events," said Joel Adelberg, principal of Croton-Harmon High School, where 150 of the school's 400 students walked out of class on March 5. "There is not a monolith on student opinion. It's similar to the split around the country. For many of these students, there's the immediacy, relevancy and urgency of the draft. Their futures are uncertain."
There is a sense of urgency about students' engagement with the subject.
As Kate Charleston, director of social studies for the Ossining school district, said: "These kids are afraid. These kids are the ones who'd be called up."
In the discussion groups at Horace Greeley the possibility of war with Iraq was a concern, but so was the threat of nuclear weapons in North Korea and the potential terrorist target that nearby Indian Point represents.
"The threat is here," said Victoria Hershey, a junior who pointed out that "there's a bottle of water on our English teacher's desk so we can take the potassium iodide pills. It's all very scary."
Her classmate Brendan Murnane, whose older brother is at the Naval Academy in Annapolis, said: "We lost a lot of innocent lives on Sept. 11. This is still the same war."
Teachers are incorporating conversations about Iraq into their lesson plans. 
"It fits into all four years of the social studies curriculum very well," said Ms. Charleston. "In Global Studies, you're dealing with themes of imperialism, for example, or the Balfour decision. Our kids need to understand why everyone is so upset in the Middle East. They need to understand how we are all interrelated. We give them context. You have to follow the news. You study history to make better political decisions in a democracy. We want to give them context. This is a teachable moment, and we run with it."
Jeff Engel's Global Studies students at New Rochelle High School read newspaper articles about Iraq as part of a unit on Stalin and the Russian Revolution as a way of understanding the use of propaganda. His ninth-graders, now studying the Crusades, are expected to see the connections between that period and Islamic jihad.
"Current events is a hook right now," said Mr. Engel. "In that lesson on propaganda, we were comparing what Stalin did to what's going on in Iraq, where there's a one-sided point of view. What's going on is serious stuff, but it gets the kids into the stuff. They make the connection. "

HEADLINE: China Leader Steps Down, But Not Out Of the Picture 

BYLINE:  By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 15 

 BODY:
This past week, Jiang Zemin, China's former Communist Party chief and departing president, spent hours on the phone with leaders in the United States, Britain, France and Germany, discussing the fate of a possible United Nations resolution on Iraq as well as the standoff over North Korea's nuclear program. 
 Today, Mr. Jiang stepped down as president, and Hu Jintao -- the party leader since last fall and a man with little foreign policy experience -- was elected to succeed him in a vote by China's legislature. That has left diplomats and scholars wondering how China's foreign relations will be affected by Mr. Jiang's departure while the world is in crisis. 
 During his decade-long tenure, Mr. Jiang evolved into a skilled diplomat. His primary legacy will almost certainly be seen as raising China's profile on the international scene and, especially in the past couple years, developing relations with the United States. Once a large but relatively isolated country, China has stepped firmly onto the world stage.
Of course, no one expects Mr. Jiang to fade into the woodwork. Today, he was re-elected as chairman of the state Central Military Commission -- he already headed the party's military commission -- and one of his chief allies, Zeng Qinghong, was elected vice president, giving Mr. Jiang a continuing government power base. In internal speeches and meetings with foreign diplomats, he has made it clear that he expects to be directing foreign policy, especially in dealings with the United States and Taiwan. 
But now he must as least coordinate that message with China's official new leaders, and exercising his influence on international issues may prove more difficult without his official seat of power. "Will Jiang try to keep the foreign policy and military all to himself for a long time, and who do we talk to when we have something to say?" asked a Western diplomat. "That is a question now."
Wu Jiaxiang, a Chinese political commentator, said, "If I were President Bush, I'd first give Jiang Zemin a call and then place a second one to Hu Jintao, because Hu Jintao is clearly now the highest civilian authority and formally China's top leader, but Jiang Zemin remains China's most senior de facto leader."
In recent months, Mr. Jiang has publicly positioned himself as an arbiter of crisis situations whose continued input is sorely needed. 
He has developed a personal friendship with President Bush, visiting his ranch in Crawford, Tex., in November as one of his last acts as party leader. American officials have repeatedly described China as being extremely helpful in fighting terrorism and have said they doubted that China would veto an American-sponsored resolution on Iraq, out of respect for the relationship.
In the last week, the Chinese news media have been filled with reports of Mr. Jiang's late-night phone talks with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain and Mr. Bush, as he joined Germany and France in diplomatic efforts to stave off a war with Iraq. 
In a speech in January, Mr. Hu expressed appreciation to Mr. Jiang for staying on in the military role and has emphasized the importance of maintaining "harmony between the generations." But as Mr. Hu matures as a politician and makes his own contacts, it is unclear how the two men will work together.
From today's voting, it was clear many in China wish that Mr. Hu would be allowed to develop his own foreign policy sooner rather than later. Though there were no other candidates, almost 10 percent of legislative delegates opposed Mr. Jiang as chairman of the Military Commission.Almost 20 opposed Mr. Zeng's assuming the vice presidency.
Those were distinctly dissenting votes in a legislature where the norm is unanimity. "Often these days, you get 10 or a dozen votes opposed," said Mr. Wu, the commentator. "But 10 percent, that's really not a small number. I think it clearly reflects the public opinion that Jiang Zemin's decision to hang on to power this way has damaged his reputation."
Of course, there remain many indirect routes for Mr. Jiang to retain his influence on foreign policy, notably through Mr. Zeng, who has accompanied Mr. Jiang on many overseas trips, including one to the United States. Many government observers say that he will be placed in charge of the important Taiwan Affairs Leading Group, overseeing policy toward the island. 
China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province that must be eventually reunited with the mainland, by force if necessary. But the United States has vowed to provide Taiwan with the means for its defense, leaving the Taiwan issue as a huge sticking point in relations with Washington. 
The new official foreign policy team has not been announced. A new foreign minister is to be named on Sunday. 
But some political observers here guess that Mr. Hu may be happy for the moment to have his predecessor calling the shots with so many foreign policy minefields on the horizon.
The Parliament today also chose Wen Jiabao, a longtime party functionary and technocratic manager, as prime minister, giving him primary responsibility for managing the world's sixth largest economy.
The largely rubber stamp legislature confirmed the Communist Party's choice of Mr. Wen, 60, a former vice premier, to suceed his boss, Zhu Rongji, who guided China into the World Trade Organization during his five years in China's top administrative post.
Mr. Wen's promotion has been assured since he was elevated to the third-ranking member of the new Communist Party Politburo in November. He will inherit responsibility for keeping China's long streak of rapid economic growth on track and for tackling the growing and politically sensitive gap between incomes of urban and rural residents.

HEADLINE: Patents; 
Some corporations take generous tax write-offs for donated patents, an industry gadfly says.

BYLINE:  By Teresa Riordan 

 BODY:
GREGORY AHARONIAN is intent on exposing what he says may turn out to be the next big tax accounting scandal: patent donations.
 Mr. Aharonian, in a recent issue of his e-mail newsletter, Internet Patent News, decries what he says is the alarming trend of companies "donating bogus patents to universities and claiming big tax deductions on their federal taxes." 
 Though no statistics have been compiled, experts note a big upswing in patent donations to universities and other nonprofit organizations. 
In the last few years, DuPont, Lubrizol, Eastman Chemical, General Motors and other companies have given away patents whose values were estimated to total hundreds of millions of dollars. SAIC, a research and engineering company in San Diego, has donated more than 40 technology patents, which the company valued at more than $100 million, Mr. Aharonian said.
The patent that has especially raised Mr. Aharonian's ire is one donated last month by SBC Communications to the University of Texas at Austin. Valued at $7.3 million, it covers a virus-screening program.
"This patent stinks like a dead cow in the Houston shipping channel on a hot summer day," Mr. Aharonian wrote recently in his newsletter.
Known for his hyperbole and his contrarian views, Mr. Aharonian is also considered an authority on software patents, and he speaks frequently to patent lawyers around the world.
Moreover, he is not the only one scrutinizing the practice of corporate patent donations. Several weeks ago, the Internal Revenue Service issued a new set of guidelines clarifying what is allowed and what is not. More guidelines are likely to follow. "We're not done with this issue," an I.R.S. spokeswoman said.
Mr. Aharonian said the SBC patent was probably worthless because it was highly unlikely that it could be enforced. The patent never should have been granted, Mr. Aharonian said, because the company did not tell the Patent Office examiner about important "prior art" -- examples of similar software invented already.
He cited pertinent conference proceedings, journals and papers from the 1980's and early 1990's that are not disclosed in the patent. Moreover, he said, a Dutch company, Tunix, already sells similar software.
SBC said it had contracted the patent appraisal to iCMG, a consulting group in Los Angeles specializing in intellectual property transactions, and a subsidiary of Acorn Technologies, a start-up financed by the software legend Peter Norton. ICMG said it could not comment, citing a nondisclosure agreement with SBC.
SBC acknowledged that no "prior art" search was conducted as part of the valuation. "Generally speaking, the assumption on these things is that the patent is accurate and valid," said Jason Hillery, a spokesman for SBC.
Gordon Smith, president of AUS Consultants, an intellectual property estimator in Moorestown, N.J., said prior-art searches were not usually included in patent appraisals.
"It's like an appraiser estimating the price of a home," he said. If this were real estate, "I would make the assumption that the title is free and clear."
But the parameters of a patent are not tangible and thus far less clear-cut than those of a house, Mr. Aharonian pointed out. Intellectual property boundaries are often sorted out only after legal wrangling. Moreover, since the spike in patent applications in the economic boom of the 1990's, the Patent Office has repeatedly been chastised for the low quality of its reviews.
University of Texas officials said they had accepted the donation because it offered research opportunities. "We are approached on a regular basis" to receive such donations, said Steven P. Nichols, a professor of mechanical engineering, "and we do not pursue it unless it benefits us."
Professor Nichols said that in January 2000, the university had accepted a donation of patents and equipment valued at $83.5 million from Shell Technology Ventures, a subsidiary of Shell Oil.
Since then, the university has licensed the technology to TerraTherm, a company that uses conductive heating and vacuums for environmental cleanup. So far, TerraTherm, which has $7 million in annual revenues, has paid the University of Texas $335,000 in royalties.
Giving a patent worth $10 million to a nonprofit institution immediately reduces corporate taxes by $3.8 million for a company that pays 38 percent of its profits in taxes.
Mr. Aharonian said the SBC donation would come out to about $2 million in tax savings. But the balance sheet at the University of Texas puts quite a different value on the patent: $1.
"That's the value we assign all patents at the university," Professor Nichols said. "We simply don't know the value of the technology until after the fact."

Patents may be viewed on the Web at www.uspto.gov or may be ordered through the mail, by patent number, for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

HEADLINE: At Telecom Research Firm, The Forecast Is Never Sunny 

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

 BODY:
It is hard to find much cheer among the analysts who follow the telecommunications industry, with sagging share prices for some of the largest telephone companies and the occasional forecast of a recovery quickly dashed by the latest regulatory rulings in Washington.
 But there is gloom and then there is utter bleakness, a specialty of Probe Research, which issued its latest dose of hopelessness last week in the report "Debt, Demographics and Telecom." 
 One of the report's authors, Alan Tumolillo, Probe's chief operating officer, paints a pessimistic picture of communications services and equipment, as rich industrialized countries grapple with ballooning debt, fierce price competition and aging populations. 
"The demographic, deflation and debt trends require very serious re-thinking on the part of the information technology and telecom industries on the very nature of the business," wrote Mr. Tumolillo, whose report outlines the possibility of an even bigger telecommunications crisis than the industry has suffered in the last couple of years.
Probe, founded 27 years ago by its president, Victor Schnee, a former lawyer and McKinsey & Company consultant, has been on an apocalyptical roll of late. 
In January, a Probe report hinted of the possibility of a thorough telecommunications catastrophe -- like the failure of a regional Bell operating company or R.B.O.C. -- like Verizon Communications, SBC Communications or BellSouth. 
"Very few seem to understand that we are on the edge of a financial and business precipice," Probe said in the January report. "If this bear market is prolonged, we fully expect at least one RBOC to fail. The collapse, like that of the volcano Krakatoa, will be heard around the world, and reverberations will be felt for years."
A month later, in February, Probe was at it again. This time it lamented the industry's inability to break free from its malaise after the Federal Communications Commission upheld regulations that allow large long-distance carriers like AT&T and WorldCom to lease access to the networks of the Bell companies to provide local phone service at relatively inexpensive rates. 
"The telcos have frittered away a commanding position they enjoyed post-September 11th," Probe said. "We are now nowhere, adrift in the Sargasso Sea."
Probe, which sells its research mainly to telecommunications equipment companies, telephone service providers and manufacturers of information technologies, is one of several companies that are seeking to capitalize on recent worries over the objectivity and quality of the research produced by large Wall Street banks.
Sometimes Probe subjects some of the industry's largest companies to scrutiny as it did last week in a report detailing the difficulties at SBC, the large local phone company based in San Antonio. "SBC is caught in a downward spiral," Mr. Tumolillo said, citing problems like revenue loss and regulatory paralysis.
In an interview last week, Mr. Tumolillo, 56, said, "We've found that simple cheerleading doesn't help our clients." He said that SBC was one of Probe's largest customers.
SBC does not necessarily seem to appreciate the help. 
"There's a loud chorus of voices that talk about the entire industry's downward spiral dynamics," an SBC spokesman, Selim Bingol, said. "We were hoping that this would change, but it hasn't."

HEADLINE: U.S. Unilateralism Worries Trade Officials 

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: GENEVA, March 16 

 BODY:
Top officials at the World Trade Organization say they are worried that the Bush administration's go-it-alone policy is threatening international trade.
 In the normally closed, clubby world of the trade organization, envoys and officials said they feared that American moves within the organization and toward a potential war in Iraq would weaken respect for international rules and lead to serious economic consequences. 
 In the past several months the United States has compiled a long record of violating trade rules and has single-handedly blocked an agreement to provide medicines for the world's poorest nations, a rare occurrence in this institution that painstakingly builds consensus behind closed doors.
Supachai Panitchpakdi, the director general of the W.T.O., said a war could have a devastating practical impact as the world grapples with a trade slowdown, rising oil prices and rising costs for transportation and insurance. 
"I can feel the sense of trepidation," Mr. Supachai said in an interview. "Whatever happens, if the U.S. will maintain the way we use multilateral solutions, it will be highly appreciated."
That delicate expression of concern was repeated by some of America's strongest allies. They said they were worried that all international institutions would suffer a loss of credibility if the one superpower appeared to be choosing which rules to obey.
"Normally you can't go to war without the cover of the U.N., but Americans are doing quite a few things alone -- even here," said Carlo Trojan, the European Union's permanent representative to the trade organization. 
European officials have complained the loudest about the United States breaking trade rules. In one of the largest such judgments, Europe was awarded the right to impose $4 billion worth of trade sanctions against the United States for giving tax breaks to American exporters through foreign sales corporations. European officials say they are tired of waiting for Congress to approve new laws prohibiting these subsidies, and that they may impose 100 percent duties on items like precious stones, sporting goods and agricultural products by the end of the month.
The most glaring example here of going-it-alone tendencies was the United States' last-minute refusal to sign off on an agreement that would help poor nations buy generic medicines through exemptions from trade rules.
Developing nations had pinned their hopes on this agreement to fight AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and other diseases. But the United States, with the strong approval of the American pharmaceutical industry, exercised the veto that every nation possesses and destroyed the deal.
That upended the timetable for a current round of trade negotiations that is dedicated to helping developing nations. This cause is identified with Mr. Supachai, the former deputy prime minister of Thailand and first director general of the trade agency. 
Now he has lost the first battle. "That was a great pity," he said. "It would have sent a powerful message that we talk not only about trade deals but humanitarian deals."
Diplomats said they found it striking that Europe was willing to stand up to its pharmaceutical industries and support the agreement, but that the United States was not. 
Sergio Marchi, Canada's permanent representative to the trade organization, said the American position not only put millions of lives at risk, but threatened the organization itself.
"You can't operate 100 percent on local politics if you're part of a multinational organization," he said. "Otherwise, one day it's your politics, next year it's mine, and then there is no more international organization."
Bush administration officials said that they, too, want an agreement that helps provide medicines. But they consider the current agreement too open-ended, and say it could lead to developing nations buying generic versions of drugs under American patents to treat diseases like asthma, obesity and impotence.
Linnet F. Deily, the permanent American representative at the trade organization, said developing nations understood the United States wanted to help those suffering from the worst epidemics, especially AIDS.
"The president's pledge of $15 billion in the State of the Union was extremely meaningful to delegates here," she said. She also disputed the notion that the mood of the trade organization toward the United States had changed from the strong sympathy following the Sept. 11 attacks. 
"As far as I'm concerned, that energy is more intensely felt today than it was a year and a half ago," she said.
As the world's largest trading power, the United States is expected to lead the movement for more liberal trading rules. But after President Bush imposed steel tariffs and approved a dramatic increase in farm subsidies last year, officials here are wondering if the United States is rethinking its role.
"The World Trade Organization is supposed to be about tradeoffs," said Shefali Sharma, the representative of the Institute for Agriculture and Trade, a nonprofit organization based in Minneapolis. "Before, the European Union was the biggest sinner, but the United States is making Europe look good." 
The introduction of this doubt about America's commitment comes as foreign investments have dropped sharply. In 2001, international trade contracted for the first time in 20 years. The world economic outlook is gloomy.
Nothing would please this organization more than to see the United States return to a commitment to make equitable compromises.
"The credibility of this institution is only up to the level a country adheres to the rules." Mr. Supachai said.

HEADLINE: Israeli Army Bulldozer Kills American Protesting in Gaza 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 16 

 BODY:
An Israeli Army bulldozer today crushed to death an American woman who had kneeled in the dirt to prevent the armored vehicle from destroying a Palestinian home in the southern Gaza Strip, witnesses and hospital officials said.
The Israeli military said the driver of the bulldozer had not seen the woman, and called it a "very regrettable accident."
The woman, Rachel Corrie, 23, from Olympia, Wash., was among eight Americans and Britons who had been acting has "human shields" to try to stop the almost daily house demolitions by Israeli forces in Rafah, a town on Gaza's border with Egypt.
When the bulldozer approached a house today, Ms. Corrie, who was wearing a bright orange jacket, dropped to her knees, a practice that members of the group to which she belonged, the International Solidarity Movement, have used repeatedly, her colleagues at the scene said. 
As the bulldozer reached her without slowing up, she began to rise, but was trapped beneath a pile of dirt generated by its blade and the blade itself, said one member of the group, Tom Dale, who said he was standing about 30 feet away.
"We were shouting and waving our arms at the driver," said Mr. Dale, who is British. "We even had a megaphone. But the bulldozer kept going until she was under the body or the tracks of the bulldozer." 
The bulldozer stopped for a few seconds and pulled back, Mr. Dale added. Her colleagues rushed to Ms. Corrie, who was bleeding from the head and face and badly wounded, but still breathing.
An ambulance took her to Najar Hospital, where she died. She had a fractured skull and other injuries, said Dr. Ali Moussa, a hospital administrator.
At the time Ms. Corrie was run over, she was in an open area in front of the house, Mr. Dale said. The bulldozer came from some distance away, and "there was nothing to obscure the driver's view," he said. 
But Capt. Jacob Dallal, an army spokesman, said that the armored bulldozer had small windows and limited visibility, and that the driver had not been aware that Ms. Corrie was in his path.
In a statement, the Israeli military said soldiers "were dealing with a group of protesters who were acting very irresponsibly, putting everyone in danger -- the Palestinians, themselves and our forces -- by intentionally placing themselves in a combat zone." 
About an hour before Ms. Corrie was killed, troops fired tear gas and shot into the air during a confrontation with the protesters at a nearby house, both Mr. Dale and the Israeli military said.
The International Solidarity Movement is made up mostly of Americans and Europeans in their 20's and 30's who are sympathetic to the Palestinians and oppose the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. They have repeatedly placed themselves in front of Israeli forces operating in those areas.
Last May, several members dashed past Israeli troops into the Church of the Nativity in Bethlehem, where Palestinian gunmen had been holed up for more than a month. The protesters remained for several days, until the standoff ended with the surrender of the gunmen.
Ms. Corrie, who was to graduate from the Evergreen State College in Olympia this year, had been in Rafah for two months, living with Palestinians in areas where homes were being demolished, her colleagues said.
In Olympia, Colin Reese, a student at Evergreen State and a close friend of Ms. Corrie, said she had focused much of her studies on community organizing. Describing her work in Gaza, he said, "She was particularly touched by the Palestinian situation and wanted to use her privilege as an American citizen to help defend against the Israeli occupation."
One of Ms. Corrie's teachers at Evergreen was Larry Mosqueda, a professor of political economy and social change, who said her work in Gaza was a reflection of lessons taught at Evergreen that encourage students to put their education to practical use while still in college. "She has a strong sense of social justice," he said. "Basically, she wanted to do something about it instead of just talk about it."
In an e-mail message this month, Ms. Corrie described a Feb. 14 standoff in which members of her group "stood in the path of the bulldozers and were physically pushed with the shovel backwards, taking shelter in a house." She added that "the bulldozer then proceeded on its course, demolishing one side of the house" with the protesters still inside. 
The Israeli Army and Palestinian militants wage frequent gun battles in Rafah. An unarmed Palestinian man was shot and killed by Israeli fire today in the town, said Palestinian security sources and hospital officials. The Israeli Army said it was checking the report.
The military has flattened dozens of homes in Rafah, some because militants were using them for cover.
The Israeli authorities have said the International Solidarity Movement's protesters prevent soldiers from acting against militants, and they have deported some members. Demonstrators have been hurt on a number of occasions, but Ms. Corrie was the first one killed.
 The Israeli troops "have shot over our heads, and shot near our feet -- they have fired tear gas at us," said Michael Shaik, media coordinator for the group. "But we thought we had an understanding. We didn't think they would kill us."

 CORRECTION:
A picture caption on March 17 with an article about an American protester who was crushed by an Israeli Army bulldozer in Gaza referred incorrectly to the bulldozer shown. It was one that the protester, Rachel Corrie, had earlier tried to stop from destroying a Palestinian home. It was not the one that killed her.

HEADLINE: Gharo Journal; 
A Province Is Dying of Thirst, and Cries Robbery

BYLINE:  By ERIK ECKHOLM 

DATELINE: GHARO, Pakistan, March 13 

 BODY:
Millions of people in southeastern Pakistan are seething with anger and despair -- and not over the American threat to attack Iraq, the plight of fellow Muslims in Kashmir or the political role of the mullahs.
 The life-and-death matter that has provoked hundreds of irate demonstrations in Sind Province in the last three years is water. More precisely, what farmers and politicians alike here charge is that "water robbery" has been committed by Punjab, the more powerful Pakistani province upstream. 
 "Punjab isn't giving us the water we are owed and our lives are being destroyed," said Muhammad Usman, a 40-year-old father of 10, who has received enough water this year to plant only one of his 50 acres. To keep his family alive he has opened a tea hut along the roadside, where he earns less than a dollar a day. "Of course we are angry at Punjab," he said. 
Mr. Usman is especially disconsolate this month because, in a fit of optimism, he paid $60 to plow a second acre in hopes of doubling his meager wheat crop. "I spent a lot of time and money on this plot but there just wasn't enough water," he said, crumbling the overturned earth in his hands.
With only inches of rainfall in the best of years and its underground waters saline, Sind would be a barren desert except for irrigation drawn from the Indus -- a prodigious river that over the millenniums has supported grand, water-worshiping civilizations. 
But after decades of dam and canal construction upstream, topped by several consecutive years of drought, the oversubscribed river carries no fresh water at all in its last 80 miles, instead offering a ribbon of useless salt water surging up from the Arabian Sea.
Millions of villagers are falling deeper into poverty as empty canals prevent them from planting crops, and even drinking water becomes scarce. At the same time, the lush valleys lining the banks of the Induszap, which have supported large settlements mixing cattle husbandry and crops, are turning to ghost landscapes. 
The river's broad, fertile delta is suffering ecological catastrophe. By official estimates, 1.2 million acres of farmland have been covered by the advancing sea while large additional areas are turning to salty desert. Biologically vital mangrove swamps are dying. 
Since Pakistan split from India in 1947, the two countries have constantly argued about the division of the Indus and its tributaries. To the people of Sind, though, the main villain comes from within -- the Punjabis, who tend to dominate the country's military and government bureaus. The provincial water war is a prime example of the ethnic and regional fissures that weaken Pakistan, beyond the better-known clashes over Islamic fundamentalism and central control over defiant northwestern tribes.
In the Sindhi view, a series of internal agreements were imposed by outsiders and now those are being violated, too, as Punjab takes more than its legal share through the current years of drought. 
Federal irrigation and power authorities deny the charges and insist they are fairly balancing national needs and the burdens of low rainfall. It is difficult for an outsider to sort through the decades-long tangle of accords and monthly canal allotments and judge the merits of competing legal claims, though the consequences in Sind are visible enough. 
Pakistan would face a water crunch in any case because of its surge in population, from about 30 million when the country was founded in 1947, to 145 million today. Sind alone grew from 6 million to 40 million, bolstered by the arrival of huge numbers of immigrants from other ethnic groups in Karachi and other urban areas. That has left the region's cities a different political universe from the Sindhi-dominated rural areas. 
An outcry from Sind and environmental groups appears to have stopped a proposal to build a third giant dam on the Indus, which could save more water and produce more power but worsen the ecological damage. Adding to current Sindhi outrage, though, is the government's support for yet another canal upstream, the Greater Thal, which will open up 1.5 million acres of Punjabi desert to farming at a time when Sindhi farmlands are famished.
"The Punjabi ruling classes just want Sind to be an appendage of Punjab," said Rasul Bux Palijo, the founder of Awami Tahreek, a Sindhi-based party with a significant following. "Now they have stopped the water in a hundred different ways and they've turned Sind into a desert." 
Leaders like Mr. Palijo know it is unrealistic to call for outright Sindhi secession (though the red flags of a repressed Sindhi secessionist movement are visible in small towns). Still, he and others draw ominous comparisons to 1971, when the disaffected Bengali people of East Pakistan broke away to form Bangladesh. 
"At least the British were more impartial when they ruled this region," Mr. Palijo said. "I think the people of Sind will have nothing to do with Pakistan if this problem isn't solved.
The sense of a common enemy has united -- on this issue at least -- the owners of giant estates and the lowliest sharecroppers. "Punjab is flouting all our agreements," charged Qamar Zaman Shah, president of the Sind Chamber of Agriculture, which represents large landowners. "The shortages are not being shared equally." 
Mr. Shah, speaking in his large, modern house in the city of Thatta, said that in recent years he had been able to plant only one-third of his holdings and had to spend a lot on diesel fuel to pump water up to the fields. 
The devastation is more visible in the village of Muhammad Khan Jat, near the river's mouth, where even the crudely built tea shops have been abandoned, a school building sits empty because the government teacher never showed up and villagers are fleeing for the cities. 
"People here are living a miserable life now," said Muhammad Juman, who looks older than his 50 years. "We can hardly scrape together a pound of flour to survive." 
"Just give us water and all our problems will be solved," he said.

HEADLINE: Rare Arizona Owl (All 7 Inches of It) Is in Habitat Furor 

BYLINE:  By DOUGLAS JEHL 

DATELINE: TUCSON, March 13 

 BODY:
At last count, the greater Tucson area was home to about 900,000 people and 18 pygmy owls. Under federal law, that ratio is a mismatch.
 To protect the owls, an endangered species, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service proposed in November that 1.2 million acres in and around the city be set aside as "critical habitat" for the birds, or about 67,000 acres per owl. The designation, issued under a court order, imposes obstacles to development, so developers in this fast-growing community are fighting back, calling it patently unfair. 
 "When you come right down to it, this is about land that would be lying fallow for no particular good reason, other than that the environmentalists want to have it that way," said Alan Lurie, the executive director of the Southern Arizona Home Builders Association. 
Fights over endangered species like the owl, a brown-and-cream-colored bird about 7 inches high, are not new; over the last three decades, they have become a staple of land-use battles in the West. What is new are the secondary battles like the one here over "critical habitat," a designation that has always been required under the 1973 Endangered Species Act, but one that the Fish and Wildlife Service has only recently begun to impose in earnest, under orders from the courts.
The law, cited by environmentalists to compel the government to act, requires that the designations cover "all areas essential to the conservation of the species." But it also allows the government to weigh whether benefits of a designation outweigh the costs. So in Tucson and other affected areas debates are raging between developers and antigrowth advocates about where to draw the lines.
"The purpose of the law is to protect endangered species," said Kieran Suckling, the executive director of the Center for Biological Diversity, a Tucson-based organization that has brought many of the lawsuits that have required the administration to act. "And here and in lots of other places, that means getting a handle on uncontrolled sprawl."
Out of 1,262 threatened and endangered species listed since 1973 under federal law, the federal government has still designated critical habitats for only 261 of them, mostly because the Fish and Wildlife Service itself has always regarded the designations as a lower priority than identifying which species are endangered.
But in the last two years, the pace of such designations has exploded, as the Bush administration has found itself on the losing side of battles in the courts. Although it has been outspoken in calling the critical habitat designations counterproductive, the administration has now designated some 38 million acres of critical habitat for 115 species, more species than any previous administration.
"Rationally speaking, the costs of critical habitat designation add virtually nothing to the protection of the species," said Craig Manson, the assistant secretary of the interior in charge of the issue. "It sucks up a lot of the resources of the Fish and Wildlife service, and it causes a lot of social and economic upheaval, and the benefit to the species is virtually nonexistent, so it just doesn't make any sense."
Still, as developers and environmentalists fight over the final shape of any restrictions, the administration is finding itself under increasing pressure to take a stronger stand against what the developers have argued could result in economic strangulation.
"From the perspective of our members out in Arizona, the pygmy owl probably represents the pre-eminent problem that they're finding, not only in building new houses, but in keeping housing construction affordable," said Jerry Howard, chief executive of the National Home Builders Association, an industry advocacy group in Washington.
Because the Endangered Species Act includes strict prohibitions against the killing, harming or harassing of listed plants and animals wherever they are found, some contend that its critical-habitat provisions are essentially redundant, while imposing new and strict barriers to development.
But its advocates call the critical habitat provisions vital in setting aside areas necessary for the species' recovery as well as their protection, and suggest that any extra obstacles to development are well worth the costs.
"The pygmy owl, frankly, is what you might characterize as a canary in the coal mine -- an indicator that whatever we're doing is not quite balancing economic development and growth with natural resource protection and conservation," said Chuck Huckleberry, the county administrator in Pima County, which is home to most of greater Tucson and is growing at a rate of nearly 3 percent a year.
The Fish and Wildlife Service tried in 1999 to designate hundreds of thousands of acres of critical habitat for the owl. But that designation, after a court challenge by developers, was struck down in 2001. The government's 1.2 million acre proposal is an effort to reinstate the protection in a way that could withstand any further legal challenge.
From the outset, the Bush administration has made no secret of its misgivings about the critical habitat process, saying that the designations -- particularly when required under court order -- divert the Fish and Wildlife Service from the more important task of determining which species deserve federal protection.
Under Bruce Babbitt, its interior secretary, the Clinton administration voiced similar concerns. But the Bush administration has been more vociferous in its objections, even proposing in 2001 to allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to suspend work on the designations for a year and devote its $9 million endangered species budget to other tasks.
Congress rejected that idea, however, and what has happened since has shifted the battle to places like Tucson, where in vying over whether and how much critical habitat should be designated for species like the pygmy owl, the two sides have presented rival and contradictory visions of what is at stake.
For one thing, developers have argued in federal court in Arizona that the owl is not truly endangered, because the 18 owls in the Tucson area represent just the northern range of a species more abundant in Mexico.
The courts have so far rejected that argument. But the developers are continuing to warn that any benefit to the owl would be outweighed by the economic costs of effectively barring development in 1.2 million acres, or two-thirds of the privately held, developable land in the area. 
The developers say that the proposed designation is excessive and would drive up housing costs by an average of $7,000 per home. They are seeking to persuade the Fish and Wildlife Service to shrink the designation significantly, under the provision of the Endangered Species Act that allows the government to apply cost-benefit tests.
"People keep moving here, the county keeps growing, and when you take land out of the supply, the prices go up,"' said David Goldstein, president of Diamond Ventures Inc., a major developer in the Tucson area.
The developers have also challenged the Fish and Wildlife Service's refusal to make public the locations of the owls, and won a federal court order in November requiring the release of that information. The agency has so far refused to comply, saying such information could lead to harassment of the owls by bird-watchers and others. It has been negotiating with the developers over a possible out-of-court settlement.
On the other side of the debate are environmentalists and some local officials who argue that the designation is important to steer development away from areas important to a fast-shrinking population of the birds. They point out that the designation does not prohibit development altogether, usually requiring in practice only that it be less dense, and that the designation applies to private landowners only when projects are subject to federal permits.
The owl, officially the cactus ferruginous pygmy owl, was listed as an endangered species only in 1997, and the environmentalists point out that surveys taken since by the Fish and Wildlife Service have suggested that its numbers have continued to decline. In 1999, according to the federal agency, some 41 adult pygmy owls were counted in Arizona, but those numbers dropped to 34 in 2000, 36 in 2001 and just 18 during breeding season in 2002.
"Don't get me wrong, this is a huge economic question for the area," said Michael Wyneken, a principal planner for the city of Tucson. "But if we're going to protect what we love, then we need to roll up our sleeves and find the answer, and knowing where the birds' critical habitat is would help the process."
The Fish and Wildlife Service is seeking public comment about its proposed designation for the owl and is expected to make a final decision by summer. Under the Bush administration, the agency's final designations have been consistently smaller than the original proposals, by an average of nearly 50 percent. In an interview, Mr. Manson, the senior interior department official, suggested that would be a likely outcome in the pygmy owl case.
"There's a provision of the law that says we may exclude portions of critical habitat, where the benefits of exclusion outweigh the benefits of inclusion," Mr. Manson said. "And that's something that we in this administration have been looking at quite a bit more robustly than has been done in the past."

HEADLINE: Humanity's Slowing Growth 

 BODY:
A generation ago, Paul Ehrlich warned in "The Population Bomb" that with demands on resources soaring, overpopulation would kill our planet. As demands on water and air soared, many thought he was right. Now it turns out that population growth rates are plummeting -- for good and tragic reasons. The implications are profound. 
 According to a United Nations report issued recently, most advanced countries could, in effect, slowly turn into old-age homes. For example, by 2050, the median age in Japan and Italy will be over 50. Fertility rates in nearly all well-off countries have already fallen below 2.1 babies per woman, the rate at which a population remains stable. 
 In the developing world, fertility rates average three children, down from six a half-century ago, and the U.N. projects that the rate will dip below the replacement level in most poor countries later this century. Slower growth rates are both the cause and consequence of a higher standard of living, and of the emancipation of women. 
There are also alarming reasons for the drop in the population growth rate -- notably the H.I.V./AIDS epidemic. It is one of the factors the United Nations cited in revising its 2050 world population projections, from 9.3 billion people down to 8.9 billion (we're at 6.3 billion today). The U.N. estimates that there will be a half-billion fewer people in the 53 nations most afflicted by AIDS than there would have been. 
For its part, Europe will decline, after accounting for immigration, from 728 million people to 632 million in 2050. Italy, meanwhile, is expected to shrink by a fifth; Estonia, staggeringly, by half. 
By contrast, America's population, boosted by a higher fertility rate and immigration, is projected to be 409 million in 2050, up from 285 million today. Ours is one of eight countries expected to account for half the population increase in the next 50 years. This will improve our economic prospects. Not so for the others, which are all much poorer: India, Pakistan, Nigeria, China, Bangladesh, Ethiopia and Congo.
Aging populations will pose an economic challenge for most wealthy nations as smaller working-age populations will have to pay for the health and pension benefits of a growing number of longer-living retirees. 
Even a cursory understanding of these demographic trends makes two things clear. Helping poor countries improve their economies is not a matter of charity but of intelligent foreign policy. And no matter how much progress is made, there will be large population shifts into better-off nations. The immigrants will need the jobs and the richer countries will need the workers. So increasing the orderly, legal migration of labor from poorer to richer countries in the next few decades is a global imperative. Those who oppose this trend will be embracing long-term economic suicide.
In the second half of the century, the entire world's population should start declining, if these demographic projections prevail. That could present a more affluent world with problems that are the mirror image of what Paul Ehrlich once worried about.

HEADLINE: Spring? No, but Only Calendar Can Tell the Difference 

BYLINE:  By COREY KILGANNON 

 BODY:
To set foot outdoors yesterday was to receive an unexpected present gift-wrapped in sunshine. Perhaps no one was as taken aback, however, as a tiny Yorkshire terrier named Choco, who found himself plopped down on John Street in Lower Manhattan by his owner, Sheena Kim.
 Ms. Kim bought Choco in November but said she had not taken him out of her one-bedroom apartment until yesterday morning, because of the weather. But now Choco, overwhelmed by the traffic and the tall buildings, was shaking in terror. The sudden expansion of his carpeted, upholstered universe seemed to pin him to the pavement. 
 Ms. Kim, 24, a graduate student at New York University, tugged at his leash and tried coaxing him on with dog biscuits. "I don't know what's wrong with him," she said. "Obviously, he's flustered. I think the entire scale is too big for him."
Many people seemed perplexed by the weather yesterday, though few, if any, registered disappointment.
As temperatures hit a high of 68 in Central Park, it seemed that everybody, not just Choco, came out of some sort of hibernation. To spend any time outside yesterday was to hear it voiced unanimously: It was a beautiful day. The balmy weather seemed to drop in like an unannounced guest.
Not that anyone seemed to mind. The weather offered a long-awaited and striking end to a miserable winter.
The warm temperatures incubated cricket games in Queens, boat painting on New Jersey waterfronts and sunbathing on Manhattan Beach in Brooklyn.
There is nothing so unusual about a warm, sunny Sunday. But to a region beleaguered by months of snow and tense talk of terrorism and drooping economies, it seemed like the richest of rewards. Emotions ranged from relief to euphoria.
Tourists packed into sightseeing boats and buses. Household chores and indoor plans went begging, as people spontaneously pulled out summer clothes, dusted off bicycles and heeded a meteorological mandate to head outdoors. People reacquainted themselves with foreign notions like picnics, short pants and sunblock.
Lovers nuzzled on park benches. Kids flew kites and ate oversize pretzels. The brunching set relocated themselves, bloody Mary's and all, to sidewalk tables.
For Carol Irish, 28, her noontime walk down a sunny stretch of Madison Avenue was like reclaiming her life from the winter weather, which had kept her indoors and plagued by head colds.
Ms. Irish, a manager of a Madison Avenue art gallery, took off her leather jacket, flung it over her shoulder and began her sunny convalescence by window-shopping. She passed Cafe Nosidam on Madison Avenue near 66th Street, where Paul Faver and Judy Shulman sat eating brunch at an outdoor table. Mr. Faver, 38, a real estate developer, said that a good chunk of his morning was spent greeting neighbors in his Upper East Side apartment building.
"I ran into people I hadn't seen in months," he said. "It's like everyone spent the winter indoors."
For Kevin Soldano, 19, a doorman at 40 East 66th Street, the weather made it the right climate for girl-watching while on the job.
"It's great day for admiring the female figure, let's put it that way," he said. "All those clothes are off, finally."
It certainly seemed like summer on a narrow spit of sand that is possibly the only beach in Manhattan. Willem Asselbergs, 40, slipped through a small gate and off the promenade onto the sand at the edge of the East River under the Brooklyn Bridge. Mr. Asselbergs, a systems engineer at the United Nations, put down his skateboard and sat on the warm sand. He shed his jacket and began doing paperwork in his T-shirt as waves lapped against the shore.
Spring does not start until Thursday, and yesterday, many people seemed wary of proclaiming winter's demise. And to be sure, there was no abundance of crocuses and rosebuds, and in fact, many parts of the city remained highlighted with melting, sooty snow. But as ice skaters at Wollman Rink in Central Park watched shirtless in-line skaters zipping by, it was apparent that winter is on its way out.
Todd Miner, a meteorologist with Pennsylvania State University, said that record highs for the date were in the low 80's, but that "it just felt unusually warm because of the cold winter."
"We've just been through a half-year of below-normal temperatures," said Mr. Miner, who stopped short of guaranteeing no more snowstorms. "It's very unlikely you would get snow in the second half of March, but one thing you learn in this business: anything's possible."
But yesterday, people were basking in the moment.
At Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, in Queens, Jennifer Formoso relaxed with her family under the Unisphere eating ice cream.
Ms. Formoso summed up the weather in two words. "About time," she said. Asked if she had any complaints, she gave another two-word answer: "Not one."

HEADLINE: At Girls' Schools, Teaching Finances As Sum of Equality 

BYLINE:  By JANE GROSS 

 BODY:
The girls at Marymount School, in three Beaux-Arts mansions on Fifth Avenue, intend to control their financial destiny, unlike generations of women before them.
 In an advanced statistics class, they establish that men marry younger women and then die earlier, leading to an army of widows. In pre-calculus, they determine that saving $1,000 a year from their 20th birthday until their 30th would yield a bigger nest egg than saving the same amount from age 30 until retirement. In Math 12, they plot on spreadsheets how long that retirement fund would last depending on how much they start with and how long they live. 
 The calculations, however valuable, can be sobering. 
Kristina Borocz, a senior, decided she will need $40,000 a year when her working life is over. Assuming she lives until 80, the average lifespan for women, she would need to begin retirement with $640,000. "What do people do when they run out of money?" Kristina wailed. "Can you live on Social Security? Or do you just die?" 
Marymount is one of a growing number of all-girls schools nationwide that have declared financial literacy an educational priority, essential to real gender equality. These schools -- about two dozen, according to the National Coalition of Girls' Schools -- are at the leading edge of a trend to systematically teach teenagers how to earn, spend, save and invest wisely, something that few are being taught at home.
So far, experts say, the financial literacy movement is confined to private girls' schools, which see their mission as producing strong independent women and are not constrained by the curriculum requirements in public schools.
"At girls' schools, we throw around the word 'empowerment,' " said Sister Kathleen Fagan, Marymount's headmistress. "Well, this is what it's all about. Money is not evil. With money comes power and opportunity. We even understand that in the nunnery."
The goal for Marymount and other girls' schools from Chattanooga to Oaklandis mastery of basic personal finance: compound interest and credit card debt. Retirement planning and refinancing mortgages. Living on a budget and creating a business plan. But the inspiration is feminist: Prince Charming will not rescue you. Happily ever after often is not. Women will spend one-third of their lives alone. Too many will end up old and poor. 
"Often women don't take this seriously until they're stranded and struggling," said Whitney Ransome, executive director of the 103-member girls' schools coalition, which held a two-day conference on the subject two years ago. "We'd rather give them a heads-up earlier in life; make sure they understand that part of their responsibility is to be a player and not just a bystander. But it's a seismic shift -- bit by bit, school by school, almost girl by girl."
At the Holton Arms School in Bethesda, Md., eighth graders are given a "job" and a "salary" and must pay taxes, buy health insurance, rent and furnish an apartment, and deal with emergency expenses. At the Julia Morgan School in Oakland, Calif., sixth graders do the same, with the added twists of paying off college loans and donating a percentage of their earnings to charity. 
At Girls' Preparatory School in Chattanooga, Tenn., all math classes include financial topics, occasional speakers talk to students and seniors take four seminars on money management. At Miss Porter's School in Farmington, Conn., mothers join their daughters at financial planning workshops. And at Miss Hall's School in Pittsfield, Mass., "Financial Factoids" are part of morning assembly and the school sponsors an annual conference of local businesswomen. 
March brought a rush of activity.
The Lincoln School in Providence, R.I., held a half-day seminar for juniors and seniors called "Green Power," financed by a 1963 graduate. Miss Hall's School invited Joline Godfrey, a pioneer in the field of financial literacy, to run workshops for students and parents. St. Mary's Episcopal School in Memphis scheduled a weekend program, free to any area high school student. 
Soon to join the crusade, by devising a financial literacy curriculum, is the American Association of University Women, a leader in math, science and technology initiatives for girls. Web sites are proliferating, including independentmeans.com and mapping-your-future.org, along with how-to books for girls, like "Girl Wise: How to be Confident, Capable, Cool and in Control," by Julia DeVillers (Prima Publishing, 2002). Ms. Godfrey, who also writes the DollarDiva column in Cosmo Girl magazine, has expanded her entrepreneurial summer camps to five cities. 
There is ample research supporting the need for financial literacy programs, especially for girls and teenagers of either sex from well-to-do families.
A study of 4,200 teenagers nationwide, done by the Simmons College School of Management, showed girls less confident in their financial skills than boys by a margin of 15 percentage points. The study found that 73 percent of girls said the desire to help others would guide their career choices, while 70 percent of boys cited making money as the most important factor.
A 2002 nationwide survey of financial literacy among high school seniors, led by Lewis Mandell, a professor of finance at SUNY/Buffalo, revealed declining scores over the last five years. There was no difference in knowledge, Dr. Mandell said, although boys were more confident and thus likelier to master skills as they needed them. The least knowledgeable teenagers came from families with incomes above $80,000.
"It is harder to engage better-off kids," Dr. Mandell said. "They live in a cocoon, running up credit card bills and calling Mom to bail them out."
Credit cards are already in the hands of nearly one-third of high school seniors, according to Dr. Mandell. Once teenagers enroll in college, Ms. Godfrey said, they receive an average of 11 credit card solicitations a month and run up an average monthly debt of almost $3,000. The credit card companies reel them in with free water bottles and teaser rates of 2.9 percent, which jump to 16.5 and soar to 24.5 after a few late payments. 
"We think they'll learn how to manage this magically, or by osmosis," Ms. Godfrey said. "We don't expect them to learn to brush their teeth that way."
The credit card companies are most aggressive during college orientation week, a time when the opportunity for financial education is largely wasted, according to Dr. Mandell. "You get five minutes of safe sex and five minutes of financial literacy," he said "It's use a condom, don't use a credit card, and they're on their own." 
Dr. Mandell hopes that coeducational and boys' high schools will follow the lead of the girls' schools, if only because federal standards will require seniors to pass an economics test, one-third of it basic personal finance, beginning in 2006. Dr. Mandell is on the committee drafting the questions. 
At the Lincoln School in Providence, in preparation for the "Green Power" seminar, 70 juniors and seniors answered questions on the survey that Dr. Mandell uses in his research, scoring 56 percent compared with a national average of 50 percent. Answering the questions correctly demands knowledge of income tax rates, the use of collateral on loans, payroll withholding and the liquidity of investments.
The girls at Lincoln were bombarded with facts and figures about the financial challenges facing women and thus their need for self-sufficiency. Then they split up into two groups for workshops geared to 16- and 17-year-olds: how to pay for college and how to avoid credit card debt. 
The credit card workshop was an eye-opener. Twelve percent of Lincoln's juniors and seniors have them, mostly for emergencies. Some girls said they did not want a wallet full of plastic until they were told that they needed to establish a credit history for future purchases, like a house. 
Others seemed befuddled by a hypothetical situation of $1,000 in credit card debt, a 16.5 interest rate and a minimum monthly payment of $20. With $13.75 each month going toward interest, the girls were told, it would take more than seven years to pay off the balance. 
Lauren Hittinger wrinkled her brow in confusion. "This is kind of a stupid question," she said. "But if you like buy a shirt for $26 and you pay it all that month, is it still just $26?" 
There are no stupid questions, Lauren was told, and if there were her's would not qualify. (The answer was yes: a $26 shirt costs $26 if you do not borrow money to pay for it.)

Omnicom's Ratings Are Cut One Notch

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
Standard & Poor's has removed from Credit Watch the debt ratings of the Omnicom Group in New York, though it downgraded by one level the ratings for the company, which owns agencies like BBDO Worldwide and DDB Worldwide. 
 The changes, which came on Friday, meant that Omnicom was off Credit Watch for the first time since June 24. Also last week, Standard & Poor's removed from Credit Watch an Omnicom competitor, the Interpublic Group of Companies in New York. 
 The Omnicom long-term debt was lowered to A-minus from A and the short-term debt was lowered to A-2 from A-1. Standard & Poor's attributed the downgrades to increased concerns about the economy.

HEADLINE: Metro Briefing Connecticut: Hartford: City's Bond Rating Lowered 

BYLINE:  AP (Compiled by Anthony Ramirez) 

 BODY:
 A Wall Street agency has downgraded the city's bond rating, citing the state fiscal crisis and Hartford's stagnant tax revenue. 
The downgrade on Friday came as the city prepared to borrow $31 million to refinance old debt. The agency, Fitch Ratings, lowered the city's rating from AA- to A+, a middle-of-the-road rating. The downgrade is a disappointment, city officials said, but may not significantly increase the cost of borrowing money. "Psychologically, it is a bit of a blow," City Manager Lee Erdmann said.

After a pitcher's death, marketers of dietary supplements try to dodge the taint of ephedra.

BYLINE:  By Nat Ives 

 BODY:
SINCE the death last month of a Baltimore Orioles pitcher who had been taking ephedra, an over-the-counter dietary supplement advertised for weight loss and muscle gain, marketers have found themselves on the defensive from critics who say the supplement poses unreasonable health risks.
 Some marketers of ephedra have stepped up their efforts to combat what they say is unfair criticism. Others are quietly tweaking their promotional claims for products that contain ephedra, or dropping them altogether. And some marketers are emphasizing the ephedra-free nature of other supplements. 
 These measures are just the latest in a yearlong retreat by the supplement makers and retailers. Companies like Herbalife, EAS Inc. and the Twinlab Corporation have dropped ephedra offerings entirely. And despite industry estimates that 12 million to 17 million Americans take more than 3 billion doses of ephedra each year, the 7-Eleven Corporation asked its franchisees to remove ephedra products from its shelves and General Nutrition Centers added ephedra to its list of products only for sale to customers 18 and over.
But the death of Steve Bechler on Feb. 17, a 23-year-old pitcher for the Baltimore Orioles whose autopsy report cited ephedra as a cause, has whipped the criticism to a new peak.
"There was a storm brewing on ephedra all along," said Bryan Glazer, president and executive director at World Satellite Television News in New York, which handles public relations for Cytodyne Technologies. Cytodyne makes Xenadrine RFA-1, the supplement that Mr. Bechler is said to have taken. "The death of Steve Bechler turned a Category 1 storm into a Category 5 hurricane," Mr. Glazer said.
There is now no trace of Xenadrine RFA-1 on the companyWeb site, which instead offers Xenadrine EFX, the ephedrine-free version. Though the company would not discuss its advertising strategy, it spent $4.4 million on advertising Xenadrine capsules and tablets in major media in 2002, according to CMR, a division of Taylor Nelson Sofres.
Since Mr. Bechler's death, Mr. Glazer and his team have been trying to counter the harsh news media attention on ephedra. They distributed video feeds of interviews with medical experts and others to challenge negative reports. They also attended last Thursday's news conference where Mr. Bechler's autopsy results were described, questioning the medical examiner about ephedra's role in the death.
Mr. Bechler did not follow the label's instructions on dosage and on whether people with pre-existing conditions like high blood pressure should take ephedrine, Mr. Glazer said.
A. Wes Siegner Jr., a lawyer for the Ephedra Education Council, agreed. "The bottom line," he said, "what the clinical data shows, is that if you take the product as directed, if you're overweight but otherwise healthy, it will help you lose weight safely."
Many health professionals dispute that supposed bottom line. They say that although the ads promise long-term weight loss, increased energy and enhanced athletic performance, ephedra has not been proven to achieve any of these. And, they add, despite taking the dosage marked on the label, thousands of otherwise healthy young adults have suffered cardiac arrhythmia, stroke, hypertension and even death.
Just as worrisome, some medical experts say, are the ephedra-free products being increasingly advertised. Some of these products use a herbal extract whose pharmacologic properties are similar to those of ephedra. The Food and Drug Administration lacks the power to ban dietary supplements unless it can prove that they present a significant or unreasonable risk of injury.
But the publicity surrounding Mr. Bechler's death has prompted some regulatory action. Less than two weeks after Mr. Bechler died, federal officials proposed requiring labels on ephedra warning that it could cause heart attack, stroke and death. They also ordered 24 companies to stop advertising it as a tool to build muscles.
And many critics are pushing the F.D.A. for an outright ban of over-the-counter sales.
Sidney Wolfe, director of health research at the public interest group Public Citizen, thinks the moment is ripe for such action. But he recalls the shift away from an earlier popular dietary supplement, phenylpropanolamine, or PPA. When PPA was banned from the over-the-counter market in 2000, a new dietary supplement rose to take its place. 
That product was ephedra. "We've seen this movie before," he said.

A Billionaire Is Close to Deal For TV Assets Of KirchMedia

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 16 

 BODY:
Leo Kirch is a reclusive Bavarian businessman, who rose to become the most powerful media baron in postwar Germany, only to watch his empire crumble last year under an avalanche of debt.
 Haim Saban is a garrulous Israeli billionaire, who was born in Egypt, lives a mogul's life in Los Angeles, and is best known for turning "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers" into a global television phenomenon. 
 Now, Mr. Saban, 58, is on the verge of taking control of the coveted assets lost by Mr. Kirch, making him the first non-German to break into Germany's giant, stubbornly ingrown television industry. The Kirch holdings include a rich film library, as well as a majority stake in Germany's largest commercial broadcaster, ProSiebenSat.1, which owns five television channels. 
Mr. Saban was in Munich over the weekend, hammering out final details of the deal, which is worth slightly more than $2 billion, people involved in the negotiations said tonight. Barring a last-minute hitch, he will announce an agreement on Monday with a committee of creditors.
The deal would represent a rare reversal of the well-established trend of German conglomerates acquiring American media properties. It would also bring a shrewd, bare-knuckles Hollywood operator to a market dominated by the state and by family-owned companies like Bertelsmann.
"This is a transforming moment in German television," said Adam Bird, the head of the media practice at the consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton in Munich. "It's an injection of someone with a very different background and outlook into what has been a rather insular business."
Mr. Saban's apparent victory is a surprise ending to a serpentine drama that began when Mr. Kirch's banks forced him into bankruptcy last April, inviting German and foreign investors to bid for the assets of KirchMedia.
Mr. Saban, who made his fortune selling children's cartoons, seemed a long shot among potential bidders that included Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation; Mediaset, an Italian media giant controlled by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi; and Heinrich Bauer Verlag, a respected German publisher.
One by one, however, the other suitors fell by the wayside, leaving Bauer and Mr. Saban, who is bidding in partnership with the French broadcaster Television Francaise 1. Last week, Bauer declared it would pull out, saying it did not want to be drawn into a bidding war.
Executives involved in the negotiations said Bauer was handicapped because it already owned part of another German broadcast group, RTL, which would have put a deal under antitrust scrutiny.
Mr. Saban faced another hurdle, less legal than cultural. While German laws do not restrict foreign ownership of television stations, unlike in the United States, some politicians here opposed allowing a foreigner to take control of one of only two private television groups in Germany.
KirchMedia's largest creditor, HypoVereinsbank of Munich, also favored Bauer as a "German solution," people involved in the talks said. Analysts speculated that politicians might still try to derail the deal, perhaps by passing a media ownership law with retroactive effect.
"Someone may try to block it," an adviser to Mr. Saban said. "On the other hand, we don't see any grounds to do it."
Relative to other foreigners, Mr. Saban carries little political baggage. Media experts said Germans were especially suspicious of Mr. Murdoch, whose newspapers, notably The New York Post, have been harshly critical of Germany's opposition to an American-led war in Iraq.
Mr. Saban is a major fund-raiser for the Democratic Party and has close ties to former President Bill Clinton. Mr. Clinton is popular here, however, and to the extent that Germans care about Mr. Saban's political activities, some experts said that might actually burnish his image.
"He's an entertainment guy, a typical Hollywood guy," said Lutz Hachmeister, a professor of journalism at the University of Dortmund. "He could support leftist-liberal causes in Germany."
Mr. Saban also received a lift from the American embassy in Berlin, which urged the German government to treat him fairly. News that Mr. Saban was close to a deal drew little comment from politicians, who were focused on new economic reforms introduced by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder on Friday.
In the end, Mr. Saban was his own best advocate. He traveled to Germany to take charge of the talks. And he gave a well-timed interview to Der Spiegel, the influential weekly magazine, in which he pledged to be a worthy steward of the rights in the Kirch film library.
Mr. Kirch built the library, which holds the rights to some 11,000 movies and television shows, over a storied four-decade career, buying American situation comedies, Italian films and World Cup soccer matches, which he resold across Germany.
In the early days, according to popular lore, he was so poor that he worked out of the back of his Volkswagen.
"Leo Kirch was a tremendous rights manager," Mr. Bird said. "Haim Saban is a tremendous rights manager, albeit in the more narrow market of children's television. There is a lot of logic to what he is doing."
If Mr. Saban prevails, he will take ownership of one the biggest fixer-uppers in European television. ProSiebenSat.1, which owns news, sports and entertainment channels, has languished without direction amid one of the deepest advertising downturns in recent German history.
Mr. Kirch's downfall came after a ruinous foray into pay television. He invested $4 billion, most of it borrowed, into the Premiere channel, which attracted only 2.4 million subscribers and lost hundreds of millions of dollars. It is not part of the assets Mr. Saban is negotiating to acquire.
In his journey from rags to riches, Mr. Saban is not unlike Mr. Kirch. He also started life poor, as the son of a Jewish toy salesman in Alexandria, Egypt. Moving first to Tel Aviv and then to Paris, Mr. Saban stumbled into television, repackaging and selling Japanese cartoons.
On that foundation, he built a children's entertainment empire, which he merged into Fox Family Worldwide, a joint venture with News Corporation, and later sold to the Walt Disney Company. Mr. Saban's personal gain was more than $1.5 billion, which he plowed into a media investment firm.
Germany would represent a bold return to the media fray. In the interview with Der Spiegel, he explained why he was so hungry. "It's as if a big U.S. network like ABC or NBC were up for sale," Mr. Saban said. "Such chances are rare."

HEADLINE: A New Texas Tourism Lure: George Bush Slept Here 

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: ODESSA, Tex., March 11 

 BODY:
From University Boulevard, at the Gun Company and Tackle Shop and the 7-Eleven, turn left onto Dixie Boulevard, pass the Church of Christ sign that says "Man Is From God Not Slime" and turn right onto East 17th. Halfway down the block, on the left, is No. 916. It is no Monticello.
 Like most other houses in the big post-World War II subdivision, No. 916 has two bedrooms, one bathroom and no architectural distinction whatsoever. Sheathed in asbestos siding and boarded up to be moved to Odessa's Presidential Museum, it was the rented, newly built 790-square-foot home of George H. W. Bush, his wife, Barbara, and their son George W. in late 1948 and early 1949. 
 "Are you serious?" asked a woman pushing a stroller along the sidewalk handing out Jehovah's Witnesses tracts door-to-door. "Is that true?"
Norma Smith, 73, rented the Bush house for a year before buying her own, No. 927, in 1963. But the Bushes were long gone by then, and she had known nothing of the house's lineage. "A year, year and a half ago, they told us about it," Ms. Smith said.
The world has little noted President Bush's childhood homes in the West Texas oil patch: in Odessa, a historically blue-collar city; and in Midland, its richer rival 25 miles to the east that the president calls his hometown. It turns out that he lived in at least nine houses in five cities in three states, Connecticut, California and Texas, before his voice changed. 
Midland and Odessa, their economies still frayed by the oil bust of the late 1980's and eager for something beyond oil-boom artifacts to draw scholars and tourists, have latched on to the Bushes to resuscitate themselves. Spurred by civic pride and a need for private donations and scarce Bush bric-a-brac to furnish former Bush homes, they have begun to make competing claims for attention. 
"Hometown of President George W. and Laura Bush," a billboard in Midland says. "George W. Bush's Childhood Home," reads the sign in front of 1410 Ohio Street, which the family owned from late 1951 to late 1956. Not to be upstaged, Odessa has installed a historical marker pronouncing itself the Bushes' "First Texas Hometown." Quoting the senior Bush, it says, "At Odessa we became Texans and proud of it." 
In addition to the move of the Odessa house, the Ohio Street house in Midland is being restored and an information center is being built beside it to be opened to the public next year. Both cities should benefit from their Bush connections, said Bill Scott, a real estate agent in Midland who is president of the foundation restoring the Ohio Street house, because visitors to one are likely to go to the other. 
Still, differentiating the cities means splitting some hairs. "Midland will tell the whole story of the Bush family" with the Ohio Street house, said Carey Behrends, executive director of the Odessa museum. "We're not going to be telling the full story. Our mission is to tell stories of all the presidents."
Promoting the Bushes presents challenges. Having a president's birthplace or longtime home has helped places like Jimmy Carter's Plains, Ga.; Independence, Mo., where Harry S. Truman lived with his wife and mother-in-law; West Branch, Iowa, where Herbert Hoover was born in a two-room white cottage; and Quincy, Mass., home to John Adams and his son John Quincy Adams.
But while the Adamses rooted like oaks in a neighborhood for five generations and nearly 200 years, the Bushes bounded around like tumbleweed.
They were a mobile 20th-century hooked-to-the-highway family, pulling up stakes and joining the American Dream for bigger homes and bigger dollars. "There wasn't anything subtle or complicated about it," the elder President Bush wrote in "Looking Forward," a memoir. "We all just wanted to make a lot of money quick."
With their wealth swelling from Mr. Bush's ventures in oil and the rush of children reaching five -- a sixth, their daughter Robin, died of leukemia at 3 -- the Bushes raced in a year through three homes in Odessa, two of which have been torn down, spent another year or so around Bakersfield, Calif., and then nine years in three homes in Midland, the last with 3,100 square feet and a swimming pool.
There are still other homes: a small apartment in a converted large house at 37 Hillhouse Avenue in New Haven, for example, where President Bush lived from birth until nearly 2, when his father finished Yale, and the Bush homes in Houston, where they moved when the president was 13.
In Odessa, especially, the Bushes moved too fast for historic preservationists to track. Renters, not owners with tax and property records, they left no public paper trail, no family documents, no photographs of family or neighborhood cookouts, and in the one remaining house, no revealing personal touches like fondly stitched curtains or a basketball hoop.
On East 17th Street, Ms. Smith and Lenora Mancha, who lives in the biggest, best-kept house on the block, were chatting on the sidewalk. Thirty years ago, after the Bushes had gone and she moved in, Ms. Mancha said: "The neighborhood was more kept up. Everyone was retired or real young."
A trouble spot has been No. 916, now known as the Bush house. "It started getting bad about three years ago," Ms. Smith said. "A young girl moved in. She never kept it up."
Less gritty Midland has a better crack at making something of the Bush years than Odessa. Laura Bush's mother, Jenna Welch, still lives in town, and the president lived in a succession of four houses, including the one given to the museum, after graduating from Yale and Harvard Business School.
In their time here, his parents became involved with their church and community groups. They owned their homes in Midland, too, starting with a little blue one on Maple Street. From there they moved to 1410 Ohio Street, a house with three bedrooms, one bathroom and a garage. The president lived there from the ages of 5 to 10.
The last was a cedar-roofed, ivy-laced brick house on Sentinel Street that they built and then sold after two years to move to Houston. To cash in on the Bushes' having been there, the owner put it on the market in August for $250,000. It has since been marked down to $169,900.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES; 
The Leaders' Two Declarations: 'We Uphold a Vision of International Security'

BYLINE:  Agence France-Presse 

DATELINE: LAJES, Azores, March 16 

 BODY:
Following are two declarations issued by the leaders of the United States, Britain, Spain and Portugal after their meeting here today:

Declaration on 'a Vision for Iraq and the Iraqi People'
 Iraq's talented people, rich culture, and tremendous potential have been hijacked by Saddam Hussein. His brutal regime has reduced a country with a long and proud history to an international pariah that oppresses its citizens, started two wars of aggression against its neighbors and still poses a grave threat to the security of its region and the world. 
 Saddam's defiance of United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding the disarmament of his nuclear, chemical, biological and long-range missile capacity has led to sanctions on Iraq and has undermined the authority of the U.N. For 12 years, the international community has tried to persuade him to disarm and thereby avoid military conflict, most recently through the unanimous adoption of U.N. Security Council resolution 1441. The responsibility is his. If Saddam refuses even now to cooperate fully with the United Nations, he brings on himself the serious consequences foreseen in Unscr 1441 and previous resolutions.
In these circumstances, we would undertake a solemn obligation to help the Iraqi people build a new Iraq at peace with itself and its neighbors. The Iraqi people deserve to be lifted from insecurity and tyranny, and freed to determine for themselves the future of their country. We envisage a unified Iraq with its territorial integrity respected. All the Iraqi people -- its rich mix of Sunni and Shiite Arabs, Kurds, Turkomen, Assyrians, Chaldeans, and all others -- should enjoy freedom, prosperity, and equality in a united country. We will support the Iraqi people's aspirations for a representative government that upholds human rights and the rule of law as cornerstones of democracy.
We will work to prevent and repair damage by Saddam Hussein's regime to the natural resources of Iraq and pledge to protect them as a national asset of and for the Iraqi people. All Iraqis should share the wealth generated by their national economy. We will seek a swift end to international sanctions, and support an international reconstruction program to help Iraq achieve real prosperity and reintegrate into the global community.
We will fight terrorism in all its forms. Iraq must never again be a haven for terrorists of any kind.
In achieving this vision, we plan to work in close partnership with international institutions, including the United Nations; our allies and partners and bilateral donors. If conflict occurs, we plan to seek the adoption, on an urgent basis, of new United Nations Security Council resolutions that would affirm Iraq's territorial integrity, ensure rapid delivery of humanitarian relief, and endorse an appropriate post-conflict administration for Iraq. We will also propose that the Secretary General be given authority, on an interim basis, to ensure that the humanitarian needs of the Iraqi people continue to be met through the Oil for Food program.
Any military presence, should it be necessary, will be temporary and intended to promote security and elimination of weapons of mass destruction; the delivery of humanitarian aid; and the conditions for the reconstruction of Iraq. Our commitment to support the people of Iraq will be for the long term.
We call upon the international community to join with us in helping to realize a better future for the Iraqi people.

Declaration on Trans-Atlantic Cooperation
We, the leaders of four democracies with strong trans-Atlantic affiliation, meet at a time of great challenge. We face painful choices.
We uphold a vision of international security we share with other nations. Our nations and people know the horror of war, whether visited upon us, or whether we are called to confront a great danger.
At this difficult moment, we reaffirm our commitment to our core values and the trans-Atlantic Alliance that has embodied them for two generations. Our alliance rests on a common commitment to democracy, freedom and the rule of law. We are bound by solemn commitment to defend one another. We will face and overcome together the twin threats of the 21st century: terrorism and the spread of weapons of mass destruction. All nations must unite to defeat these dangers. We will not allow differences of the moment to be exploited in ways that bring no solutions.
Our security is tied to peace and security throughout the world. Together, we are working to bring security to Afghanistan, and to root out the terrorists who remain there. We affirm a vision of a Middle East peace in which two states, Israel and Palestine, will live side by side in peace, security, and freedom. We welcome the fact that the road map designed to implement this vision will soon be delivered to Palestinians and Israelis, upon the confirmation of an empowered Palestinian prime minister. We would welcome the appointment of a Palestinian prime minister with sufficient authority to put an end to terrorism and consolidate necessary reforms. We shall look to the parties to work constructively together. We have today issued a statement outlining the challenge that Saddam Hussein poses for the world and our vision of a better future for the Iraqi people.
We urge our friends and allies to put aside differences, and work together for peace, freedom and security. The friendship and solidarity between Europe and the United States is strong and will continue to grow in years to come.

HEADLINE: China's New Prime Minister Seen as Careful Conciliator 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 16 

 BODY:
Wen Jiabao, a number-crunching chief of staff who self-effacingly served China's top leaders for two decades, was formally appointed prime minister today. His election by the National People's Congress gives him day-to-day command of China's economy and its 100-million-person bureaucracy and completes the leadership transition that began last fall.
 Mr. Wen, 60, who succeeds the formidable and sometimes brusque Zhu Rongji, will face the challenge of keeping the economy primed. He has vowed to do more to raise the income of peasants and to help workers displaced by wrenching economic changes. 
 Like his superior Hu Jintao, who became Communist Party chief last November and state president on Saturday, Mr. Wen scaled the one-party political hierarchy leaving few footprints and making no known enemies. People who have worked with him say he is conspicuous mainly for being fastidious. He lets policy documents sit on his desk for at least three days before signing off, they say, so he can slow-cook the contents in his mind and triple-check the grammar.
"Like an insect in a spider web, he knows if he moves too fast he'll get caught," said Wu Jiaxiang, a political analyst and former high-ranking party official. "The main thing about Wen is that he never makes political mistakes."
Although he is now the main manager of the world's sixth-largest economy, Mr. Wen ranks third in the Communist Party hierarchy, behind Mr. Hu and Wu Bangguo, who now heads the legislature. Jiang Zemin, the recently retired president and party chief, remains chairman of the Central Military Commission and is likely to exert broad influence.
But as Mr. Wen and Mr. Hu prepared to take control of government and party affairs in recent weeks, they have signaled a subtle shift from the decade-long reign of Mr. Jiang.
Mr. Jiang courted capitalists and sought to foster a middle class, while steering billions of dollars in state funds to build roads, bridges, subways and ports in prosperous east coast cities.
Mr. Wen spent the Chinese New Year holiday at the bottom of a coal shaft in the less developed west. Mr. Hu visited herders in frigid Inner Mongolia. They have emphasized building a social security system to replace the withered socialist welfare state that has left tens of millions of workers without adequate pensions or health care. They have stressed the urgency of reducing the wealth gap between urban and rural residents.
Their focus on the poor reflects worries that the traditional constituents of the Communist Party could threaten its hold on power. Protests by laid-off workers and overburdened farmers are a regular feature of Chinese life, alarming authorities who insist on political stability.
It is difficult to tell if the speeches and demonstrations of concern for the socially dispossessed will lead to new aid programs. But Mr. Wen does appear to want to tackle the problems energetically.
Though born in the eastern port city of Tianjin in 1942, he learned firsthand about rural backwardness during the 14 years he spent working as a geologist and party official in the arid western province of Gansu. He has said that improving the lives of the 700 million people who live in rural areas is the "central and basic goal" for the future. 
As deputy prime minister, the position he held before becoming prime minister, he arranged experiments in Anhui Province to reduce the taxes imposed on farmers. Those experiments have since spread nationwide, though it is too early to gauge their effectiveness. 
Mr. Wen also seems committed to moving China toward a market economy. He was the top deputy and a close adviser of Mr. Zhu, widely regarded as the Chinese leader most strongly committed to integrating the country with the world economy.
In style, Mr. Wen could offer a stark contrast with the fiery Mr. Zhu, who publicly belittled bureaucrats and harrumphed about the intransigence of the Chinese system. Analysts say the bespectacled Mr. Wen tends to prize consensus and avoid confrontation. They predict he may get results.
"When it comes to how to deal with banks or rural development, the debate is about solutions, not ideological principles," said Kang Xiaoguang, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Science.
Mr. Wen's political leanings are more obscure.
Before becoming deputy prime minister in 1998, he served three successive party bosses as the director of the general office of the Communist Party Central Committee, or, effectively, the party chief of staff. The three bosses were Hu Yaobang, Zhao Ziyang and Mr. Jiang.
The feat was not unlike serving three presidents as White House chief of staff. Each of the Chinese successions was acrimonious -- Mr. Zhao succeeded Mr. Hu and Mr. Jiang succeeded Mr. Zhao after political purges. But Mr. Wen transformed himself into a trusted aide to each party leader, managing paper flow and even handling his bosses' personal security.
Both Mr. Hu and Mr. Zhao, who ruled the party during a period of relative openness in the mid-to-late 1980's, were considered more eager to experiment with political reform than Mr. Jiang, who took over after the bloody crackdown on pro-democracy protests in 1989. 
Mr. Wen helped draft proposals for political change, raising at least the possibility that he sympathized with those efforts and might want to liberalize China's repressive political system.
But one thing seems indisputable about Mr. Wen. He has the malleability of a survivor, not the gumption of a maverick.
His mix of loyalty and cunning became the stuff of legend in 1989 during the Tiananmen Square protests. Mr. Zhao, having been effectively deposed as head of the party after intense infighting, decided to make a public visit to the square to show solidarity with protesters camped out there. 
As deputy, Mr. Wen went along with Mr. Zhao. The two were pictured together visiting demonstrators in a front-page photograph in the People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper. Shortly after that rare act of political bravado, Mr. Zhao was placed under house arrest, where he remains 14 years later.
Two well-connected party officials said Mr. Wen survived what could have been a career-ending move because he had telephoned Mr. Zhao's rival, the hard-liner Li Peng, to consult about what to do before joining Mr. Zhao in the square. Mr. Li agreed that Mr. Wen should remain loyal as long as Mr. Zhao remained party chief.

GRAPHIC: Photos/Chart: "China's New Upper Echelon"The leadership transition that began last fall with Hu Jintao's elevation to Communist Party chief has concluded with his promotion to president and Wen Jiabao's to prime minister. Although Jiang Zemin has stepped down as party leader and head of state, he still holds considerable power. HU JINTAO, 60President and General Secretary of the Communist Party For now, his power as China's top formal leader may be held in check by his predecessor, Jiang Zemin. Mr. Hu has indicated he will divert more resources to supporting China's poor, but no dramatic policy changes are expected. WEN JIABAO, 60Prime Minister A consummate administrator, Mr. Wen has a very mild, conciliatory temperment, immune from the bursts of temper that were the trademark of his predecessor, Zhu Rongji. He said a priority of his government would be reviving China's stagnating rural economy. ZENG QINGHONG, 63Vice President A longtime backroom troubleshooter for Jiang Zemin, the retired party leader, he faces the challenge of molding an independent political persona while he smoothes relations between Mr. Jiang and Mr. Hu. Mr. Zeng may seek to play an important role in foreign policy. WU BANGGUO, 61Head of National People's Congress He worked under Jiang Zemin in Shanghai, and recently was in charge of reviving China's stateowned industry. He will be responsible for squaring Communist Party control with calls for a stronger, more representative Parliament. JIANG ZEMIN, 76Chairman of Central Military Commission Although he has retired as party chief and president, he retains control of the nation's top military body. He is expected to exert strong influence over key policy areas, including relations with the United States and China's efforts to regain Taiwan.

HEADLINE: Ridge Gets the Joke, but He Hasn't Lost His Focus 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TIERNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
Many cabinet members serve entire terms without becoming household names, but the new secretary of homeland security is already that and more. Tom Ridge has become a one-man economic stimulus package for the comedy industry.
 Duct tape is now a punch line; the color-coded alert system has spawned a thousand riffs. One Tom Ridge impersonator opened "Saturday Night Live" by changing the national threat level to magenta ("not quite an oxblood"); another performed in front of President Bush and Mr. Ridge at the Gridiron dinner last weekend wrapped in plastic sheeting. Tonight, as usual, the Capitol Steps comedy troupe here will regale the audience with scary bedtime stories read by Tom Ridge. 
 "Tom Ridge appears more frequently in our show than any other public figure, including President Bush," said Elaina Newport, the troupe's producer. "It's great for us that he's supplying so much material, but I think a politician is in trouble when the audience starts laughing as soon as he walks on stage." 
Mr. Ridge seems to be in no trouble with his most important audience, President Bush, an old friend. He is regarded in the administration, and by many of his former colleagues on Capitol Hill, as a dependable, experienced politician in a tough position: blamed as an incompetent if a terrorist attack occurs, mocked as an alarmist if it does not.
But his public image has taken a beating, and not only from comedians. He and his department have been criticized by experts in terrorism and risk-management for scaring Americans with vague warnings and for confusing the public with poor advice. 
"Homeland security is a difficult job, but they've been at it for 17 months, and they're certainly not getting any better at it," said Ivo H. Daalder, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. "They want to be absolutely sure that if anything happens they can say they've warned us about it. But by covering their back sides, they're making terrorism into something more awful."
Mr. Ridge has said the alert system, which uses five colors (green, blue, yellow, orange and red) to rate the threat of terrorism, is mainly to tell the police and other security officials to be more vigilant. But the news that the threat level has been raised can leave people frustrated because they do not know what the danger is or what they can do about it.
"Ridge and the department need to come up with a better way of saying, 'Be afraid,' " said David Ropeik, director of risk communication at the Harvard Center for Risk Analysis. "They say, 'Be alert,' and then out of the other side of their mouth they say, 'Go about your normal lives.' To most of us, those messages don't mesh. They also need to be more specific. When the threat level goes from yellow to orange, tell us what we can do besides being more alert."
Mr. Ridge made one attempt at specificity when he appeared on the "Tonight Show" in November. After praising Jay Leno's many jokes at his expense, he took a direct question from the comedian.
"I'm setting at home in my underpants watching the game and, boop, we're in yellow," Mr. Leno said. "What do I do now?"
Mr. Ridge got a big laugh with his reply: "Change shorts." Mr. Leno recalled later that the line was not scripted. 
"That was a pretty good ad-lib line," said Mr. Leno, who offered a couple of theories for Mr. Ridge's enduring comic appeal. "Tom Ridge always makes me smile because he looks like the guy on the Just For Men hair-coloring box. And he's got a thankless job. When problems seem overwhelming, simplistic solutions always seem funny. Duct tape and plastic sheeting? When the threat level goes down, it'll be downgraded to Scotch tape and two Ziploc bags."
The duct tape jokes began last month when, three days after raising the threat level from yellow to orange, Mr. Ridge's department suggested that residents make emergency plans and stockpile food and supplies, including plastic and tape that could be used during a biological or chemical attack. After reports of panicked people sealing their homes, Mr. Ridge explained that the tape was intended only for use in an emergency, but the jokes went on. 
"Perhaps," said Mark Russell, the stand-up pianist, "he's got us so confused and frightened that we are all just trying to amuse ourselves at his expense. I didn't find him funny until he announced, 'I didn't tell you to use the duct tape, only to buy it.' That's when I wondered about how much stock in the 3M company Ridge might have."
The duct tape jokes came as no surprise to Tim Nyberg, one of the self-proclaimed Duct Tape Guys, the co-author of "Duct Shui" and a series of other humor books listing thousands of uses for the tape.
"When I see a piece of duct tape holding something together, it strikes me as funny because it's obvious that it was a quick fix by someone who neither had the patience nor the ability to fix it correctly," Mr. Nyberg said. "Come to think of it, that seems to be the American way lately."
That's roughly the same conclusion reached by Gary Hart, the former Democratic senator from Colorado who led a national commission that recommended the creation of the Department of Homeland Security. "The idea of using duct tape to protect yourself would resonate only if people could see the government taking action to protect you," Mr. Hart said. "But because the government has done so little against terrorism at home, it sounded as if they were saying, 'You're on your own.' " 
Other Democrats have also criticized the Bush administration, saying it has not spent enough on domestic security. But there has been little personal criticism of Mr. Ridge, at least publicly. While a few members of Congress have expressed private doubts about his abilities, he is generally popular, especially with the many former colleagues in the House of Representatives who have met with him. 
"He has probably met with three-quarters of the members, and his reputation is very solid on both sides of the aisle," said Representative Christopher Cox, Republican of California, who is chairman of the House committee on domestic security. "The public has gotten a lopsided view because he can't talk publicly about much of the enormous effort the department has made to prevent terrorism." 
Sig Rogich, an image consultant who worked in the White House when Mr. Bush's father was president, said that the jokes had not hurt Mr. Ridge with his Republican base.
"His relationship with the president is excellent, and you've got to view him as one of the most well-respected Republican leaders," said Mr. Rogich, who now runs a public relations firm. "There may be some grousing about the color-coded alerts, just as I'm sure people complained about false air-raid alarms during World War II. But it's the price you pay.
Mr. Ridge has tried a little -- very little -- duct tape stand-up routine.
"I happen to think humor is a good way of talking about serious subjects," he said last week in a speech to military veterans here, and told them about a cartoon showing a man wondering what to do now that he had taped a duck to a window. "Might want to keep him alive until Thanksgiving or Christmas," he said, pausing for laughter, "but probably not in that environment."

HEADLINE: With Ears And Eyes Closed 

BYLINE:  By BOB HERBERT; E-mail: bobherb@nytimes.com

DATELINE: WASHINGTON 

 BODY:
It was a weekend of going through the motions. Lip service was still being given to the idea that the war could be stopped. "It's Not Too Late," read one of the signs displayed on Saturday as tens of thousands of antiwar protesters marched from the Washington Monument to the White House.
 Dick Cheney was on television yesterday morning advancing the fiction that "we're still in the final stages of diplomacy." President Bush was meeting in the Azores with his coalition of the hard-of-hearing, the small but stubborn group of men committed to attacking Iraq no matter how wrong or undesirable that might be, or how much outrage it provokes around the world. 
 We're about to watch the tragedy unfold. The president, who's wanted war with Iraq all along, has been unwilling to listen seriously to anyone with an opposing view. He's turned his back on those worried about the consequences of a split in the trans-Atlantic alliance that has served the world well for better than half a century. He's closed his mind to those who have argued that pre-emptive warfare will ultimately make the world more -- not less -- unstable.
Mr. Bush has remained unmoved by the millions of protesters against the war who have demonstrated in the United States and around the world. If any one of those millions has had something worthwhile to say, the president hasn't acknowledged it.
Risks? In the president's view this is a war of liberation that, in addition to removing Saddam Hussein and his weapons of mass destruction, will bring democracy to the people of Iraq and lead to a miraculous flowering of democracy throughout the Mideast.
Never mind the secret State Department document (disclosed last week in The Los Angeles Times) that holds just the opposite view -- that not only are the prospects for democracy in the region poor, but entrenched economic and social problems are likely to undermine even basic stability for years to come.
President Bush may not see them, but the risks are enormous.
"This is an invasion and a long-term occupation of an Arab country in the midst of the most volatile region of the world," said former Representative Tom Andrews of Maine, who has led a particularly well-organized and thoughtful protest group called Win Without War.
The New York Times had a front-page story yesterday about warnings from intelligence officials that a U.S.-led invasion and occupation of Iraq would embolden Islamic terrorist organizations around the world, strengthening their recruitment efforts and increasing the likelihood of another strike in the U.S.
The president's unwillingness to listen to other voices has extended even to the religious community in the U.S. "With the exception of the Southern Baptist Convention, almost every major church in this country has expressed huge reservations about going to war with Iraq," said the Rev. Clifton Kirkpatrick, the chief ecclesiastical officer of the Presbyterian Church.
Mr. Kirkpatrick was part of a delegation of religious leaders who met in London in February with Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain. The group has developed a proposal that it calls a "possible alternative to war." The proposal calls, among other things, for the indictment of Saddam Hussein as a war criminal by an international tribunal; the use of the current military buildup to support and enforce a "greatly intensified" regime of weapons inspections; the development of a U.N. plan for the temporary administration of a post-Saddam Iraq; and the creation of a huge international humanitarian effort to address the continued suffering of the Iraqi people.
"We don't claim to be public policy experts, but these are at least contributions that need to be explored much more deeply," said Mr. Kirkpatrick.
By the end of last week that hope was gone. The Rev. Jim Wallis, editor of the evangelical journal Sojourners, headed the delegation that met with Mr. Blair and had been trying to arrange a meeting with Mr. Bush. On Thursday he told me, "I got a call back from the White House saying the president is not scheduling any more meetings."
The president's mind was made up long ago and all the chatter pro and con was just so much smoke in the wind. Mr. Bush will have his war.
Last night was a time of sadness around the world as people who think that war should always be a last resort lit candles to express their sorrow, their frustration and, however unrealistically, their last faint flickerings of hope.

HEADLINE: How Green Was My Surname; 
Via Ireland, a Chapter in the Story of Black America

BYLINE:  By S. LEE JAMISON 

 BODY:
Happy St. Patrick's Day, Shaquille O'Neal!
 So many African-Americans have Irish-sounding last names -- Eddie Murphy, Isaac Hayes, Mariah Carey, Dizzy Gillespie, Toni Morrison, H. Carl McCall -- that you would think that the long story of blacks and Irish coming together would be well documented. You would be wrong. 
 Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School and the author of "Interracial Intimacies; Sex, Marriage, Identity and Adoption," said that when it comes to written historical exploration of black-Irish sexual encounters, "there are little mentions, but not much."
And most African-Americans do not know a lot about their family names.
"Quite frankly, I always thought my name was Scotch, not Irish." said Mr. McCall, the former New York State comptroller. 
But the Irish names almost certainly do not come from Southern slaveholders with names like Scarlett O'Hara. Most Irish were too poor to own land. And some blacks, even before the Civil War, were not slaves.
Tony Burroughs, a fellow of the Utah Genealogical Association who teaches genealogy at Chicago State University, said that "during the antebellum period, although the majority of blacks were slaves, ten percent were free."
Irish immigrants, fleeing the famine in the mid-1800's, flocked to port cities like Boston, Philadelphia and New York. According to the book "How the Irish Became White," by Noel Ignatiev, the unskilled Irish began to learn trades and seek work as bakers, blacksmiths, carpenters and bricklayers, putting them in competition with the free blacks who often held these jobs. 
Irish and blacks often lived side by side in the poorest parts of town in those port cities. While blacks faced racial discrimination from native-born whites, the Irish suffered from anti-immigrant and anti-Catholic attitudes. 
Charles L. Blockson, the author of "Black Genealogy," said that because of their skin differences, both blacks and Irish, with features like red hair or freckles, were easily picked out by native-born whites and subject to discrimination. He said that both groups were without property and, because of this, each group built a similar live-for-the-moment culture, commonalities that helped bring them together. 
But Irish immigrants and blacks fought over jobs, underbidding one another on wages. The tension reached a fever pitch during the Civil War, when poor Irish could not buy their way out of military service and resented risking their lives fighting for the North for the freedom of blacks who were their economic competitors. 
Irishmen who were angry at the government rose up in the draft riots in New York City. In the mob violence, captured in Martin Scorsese's film "Gangs of New York," several blacks were lynched, scores were beaten, and black institutions were burned. Reports of the death toll ranged from hundreds to more than 2,000.
But blacks and Irish were not always fighting.
Elizabeth Shown Mills, who recently retired as the editor of the National Genealogical Society Quarterly, said that unlike native-born whites, "Irish were more willing to accept and acknowledge interracial allegiances." 
Before the Civil War, she said, "the free mulatto population had the same number of black moms as white moms."
Ms. Mills said that mixed-race children would have been given Irish surnames when their Irish fathers married their black mothers, or when their unmarried Irish mothers named children after themselves.
The Irish ended up in the Caribbean, too. Britain sent hundreds of Irish people to penal colonies in the West Indies in the mid-1600's, and more went over as indentured servants. 
Mr. Blockson noted that "Lord Oliver Cromwell's boatloads of men and women" sent to Barbados and Jamaica intermingled with the African slaves already there. 
Montserrat ended up with the largest Irish community in the West Indies.
It is still called the Emerald Isle of the Caribbean and has towns named St. Patrick's, Galway's, Gerald's, Cork Hill and Kinsale. In 1994, Irish Roots Magazine surveyed names in the island's phone book and found 91 Ryans, 81 Daleys, 57 Farrells, 42 Rileys and 35 Sweeneys.
In the post-Civil War United States, already fragile black-Irish relations collapsed as the Irish began to build the political ties that allowed them to create trade unions. Those unions, in turn, began to exclude blacks from jobs they had long held.
This infuriated blacks who had supported the Irish, both in America and in their fight against the British for independence in Ireland. "A great friend of the Irish was Frederick Douglass, constantly talking, lecturing about oppression of the Irish by the English," Professor Kennedy said.
So, do African-Americans raise a glass to the Irish on March 17? 
Mr. McCall said that last year, he chose not to march in the St. Patrick's Day Parade on Fifth Avenue, because parade organizers refused to allow gay groups to march behind their own banners. But on St. Patrick's Day, Mr. McCall said, "I celebrate with a lot of others." In fact, he said, he celebrates all ethnic holidays.
When Thelma Golden, deputy director for exhibitions and programs at the Studio Museum in Harlem, was told that her surname could be Irish, she was surprised. "I always thought it was more Jewish," she said.
"I grew up in New York City, making it much more likely that I'd celebrate the High Holy Days as opposed to St. Patrick's Day."
Bill Lynch, vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee, does not know whether he is of Irish descent. While he has attended St. Patrick's Day events in New York, he said he has not celebrated the day. "To 'celebrate' would mean a holiday of ancestral origin," he said.
And Shaquille O'Neal?
"I'm not Irish," he said. "I'm from the Brick City -- Newark, New Jersey -- and don't pinch me on the butt if I'm not wearing green."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: FOREIGN POLICY; 
A Long, Winding Road to a Diplomatic Dead End

BYLINE:  By STEVEN R. WEISMAN 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 16 

 BODY:
Dining in September with a group of foreign ministers at the elegant Hotel Pierre in New York, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell was uneasy. France was advocating that a first resolution at the United Nations Security Council, demanding that Iraq promptly disclose its weapons and disarm, must be followed by a second resolution authorizing war if Iraq refused.
 "Be sure about one thing," Mr. Powell told Dominique de Villepin, the French foreign minister. "Don't vote for the first, unless you are prepared to vote for the second." 
 Mr. de Villepin assented, officials who were there said. 
But in the months since, France has rejected any second resolution clearing the way for war. And Mr. de Villepin won over most of the other 13 Council members.
With some bitterness, American officials now say France never really intended to support a war with Iraq. French officials say equally bitterly that the United States never intended anything but a war in the spring of 2003.
Just about everyone involved now acknowledges that a train of miscalculations and misunderstandings has produced a setback for American diplomacy and world standing.
The United States and Britain appear likely to lead an attack, against the will of Europe's biggest states, without the military help of Turkey, despite deep anxieties among Arab countries and fought to the sound of angry protest throughout much of the world.
"We have had our share of mistakes," said a senior administration official. "But fundamentally we have fallen victim to a different reading from many of our friends about the necessity of dealing with the problem of Iraq. The more these differences arose, the more they aggravated resentment over American power in the world."
In more than a dozen interviews, top policy makers in the United States and other countries ascribed the current situation to many factors.
Some cite international anger over the Bush administration's opposition to the Kyoto global warming agreement, several arms control treaties and other mechanisms ofinternational law.
Administration officials acknowledge that as the White House switched its signals -- was the aim to disarm Iraq, or to defeat its leaders? -- the mixed messages undercut the claim that the United States, too, wanted to avoid a war.
Still others say that by seizing on the first report by Hans Blix, one of the two chief United Nations weapons inspectors, as a prima facie case for war, the United States and Britain made him ever more cautious in his conclusions.
Some criticize Mr. Powell for not engaging in shuttle diplomacy to build support around the world. "He should get off the phone and get on a plane," said an administration official.
Mr. Powell's defenders blame the blunt criticism of Europe by Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld for undercutting his efforts to build support there.
In the last month or two, others say, American tactics backfired as diplomats tried to persuade smaller, undecided countries to accept a faster timetable. The more the pressure, the more the resentment it generated, some said.
Assertions that Iraq was linked to Al Qaeda backfired, too, European officials said, as intelligence services in Europe told their leaders that even the Central Intelligence Agency had doubts about the connection.
Even Mr. Bush's efforts to paint a grand vision of democracy in the Arab world, starting in Iraq, backfired, with Mr. de Villepin gaining support by warning that the United States had dreams of remaking the Middle East in its own image of democracy.

The Fall of 2002
Misunderstanding At United Nations
Despite misgivings among his aides, Mr. Powell got President Bush to accede to a French request last fall to pass one measure at the Security Council on Iraq in November, and to allow the Council a second opportunity to discuss what to do if President Saddam Hussein failed to comply with the first. 
With Mr. Bush surrounded by skeptics -- Vice President Dick Cheney, Mr. Rumsfeld and Condoleezza Rice, the national security adviser -- administration officials said Mr. Powell tried to convince that inner circle that at the end of the process, the French would recognize the failure of the inspections and agree to war.
"Condi was the tipping factor," said an administration official, referring to Ms. Rice. "Powell convinced her that the French would be with us. It was wrong then, and it is wrong today."
Whereas the United States saw the resolution as a way of rallying the world around its charge that Mr. Hussein was defying the inspections and the demands to disarm, France and others saw it as a way of pressing the inspections forward as long as they were bearing fruit, with or without Iraqi cooperation.
This misunderstanding, many say, was compounded by the fact that the entire process of trying to avert a war through inspections and negotiations was undercut by the military buildup that the United States said was necessary to force Iraq to comply -- a buildup that some officials later argued could not be reversed without the United States losing face.
"In retrospect, the military buildup and the diplomacy were out of sync with each other," said Richard C. Holbrooke, ambassador to the United Nations in the Clinton administration. "The policies were executed in a provocative way that alienated our friends."
By mid-September, the contradictions were apparent to both sides. It was then that Iraq acceded to receiving the inspections, with Secretary General Kofi Annan at the United Nations helping Iraq draft the statement letting them in.
French officials recall that, whereas they were elated at this development, they detected that American officials seemed to be upset. "It should have been a happy moment," said a French official. "But the Americans saw it as a setback. They showed they never wanted the inspections to work."
The negotiations to produce Resolution 1441 at the Security Council were a high-water mark for Mr. Powell, who won worldwide praise for his efforts to avert war by giving Mr. Hussein one last chance for a peaceful exit through disarmament and disclosure, if not by relinquishing power voluntarily.
Mr. Powell told associates that he truly believed that the process could work, and the administration began changing its rhetoric from "regime change" to "disarmament." 
But a top official called this whole process "a willful suspension of disbelief" -- there was a feeling that no one wanted to admit publicly that it was like "sprinkling pixie dust" on the problem, as one put it.

A Cold New Year
Show of Agreement Slips, Then Is Lost
According to American, French and United Nations diplomats, the pretense of agreement slipped away in December and got lost in January.
First came Iraq's declaration of its weapons on Dec. 7, falling far short of the disclosure demanded by the United Nations. The Bush administration debated whether to go to the United Nations then and there and demand a new declaration that Iraq was in "material breach" of its obligations.
But a senior administration official said it was decided that such a move would be seen as too provocative and too much evidence of American desire for war. Some in the administration now say the decision not to confront the United Nations at that time was a mistake, because it would have started the debate on using force much earlier.
If there was a turning point in this period, the French say, it occurred when Mr. Blix, the co-chief United Nations weapons inspector, began circulating a timetable for how he would proceed with his job in mid-January.
Because Resolution 1441 did not have a timetable, Mr. Blix and his team reverted to one from the 1990's calling for a step-by-step introduction of inspectors, setting up their infrastructure and then establishing "tasks" for Iraq to carry out. The "tasks" are due to be listed on March 27.
Once the United States got a look at the plan, there were objections. Ms. Rice and others, including John D. Negroponte, the American ambassador to the United Nations, issued statements saying the United States could not wait until that date.
"That was the moment of truth, when we suddenly realized we were going to war," said a French official.
But American diplomats regard the French view as disingenuous, a reflection of French unwillingness to see that the inspections could not be strung along forever.
The French-American alienation reached the breaking point on Jan. 20, when Mr. Powell attended a Security Council session presided over by Mr. de Villepin, ostensibly to discuss terrorism. Afterward, the French foreign minister held a news conference and declared forcefully, "Nothing! Nothing!" justified war. American officials did not hear about the news conference until the next day.
"We looked at each other and said, 'What the hell is going on here?' " said an aide to Mr. Powell. "I think it all started to come apart after that moment."

The Inspections
Inconclusive Process For the U.S. and Blix
If there is one point on which American and other officials agree, it is that the administration failed to appreciate the dynamics of the inspections process.
Several diplomats at the United Nations said American leaders were confident that Mr. Blix would either be rebuffed by the Iraqis or he would find evidence of weapons of mass destruction that would make it obvious that the only solution was war.
The Americans were not expecting an inconclusive inspections process that would be seized upon by others as evidence that, while Iraq was far from cooperative, the process itself was working.
Some in the administration say that before Mr. Blix went in, Mr. Bush or Mr. Powell should have made a major speech framing the issue the way that the United States saw it -- that small, niggling steps by Iraq were not evidence that inspections were workable.
But again, they said, there was a desire not to be seen as too eager for war even though the eagerness was barely disguised anyway.
To coax the process along, Mr. Powell made his presentation to the United Nations Security Council on Feb. 5. For about an hour and a half, he presented photographs, intercepts and assertions from informants about Iraq's weapons programs, and he generally won praise for his presentation.
An initial report by Mr. Blix that Iraq was not complying adequately was seized on by the United States with such enthusiasm that, according to one person close to him, Mr. Blix shrank back in subsequent reports and was exceedingly careful not to give the United States further ammunition.
Consequently, there were bitter feelings among American officials, underscored as Mr. Blix repeatedly seemed to side with France and others that he would be able to find more evidence of weapons if only he had more time.
Mr. Blix's mantra was that he was making progress in finding weapons, that inspectors had after all destroyed more weapons in the 1990's than had been destroyed during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, that Mr. Hussein was now less dangerous than he had been before because he was trapped "in a box with the inspectors inside the box."
Administration officials say they continue to respect Mr. Blix's standing, and many say they should have figured out how to outmaneuver him early on. But by the time they realized he was not going to help the United States cause, it was too late.

Outflanking the French
Seeing Easy Support, Facing Hard Sells
Once the Bush administration realized it had lost France, its diplomatic strategy centered on trying to enlist Russia to support, or at least not veto, a resolution that would declare Iraq as failing to comply with the United Nations demands. The five veto-bearing Security Council members are Russia, China, Britain, France and the United States.
The American thinking was that if Russia acquiesced, China would as well, and there would then be a good chance of getting at least five additional votes from six undecided countries: Pakistan, Chile, Mexico, Cameroon, Guinea and Angola. 
But Russia was a hard sell because of its own longstanding relationship with Iraq and Mr. Hussein. President Vladimir V. Putin was still smarting from having to accept Bush administration policies from NATO expansion to scrapping the treaty barring antiballistic missiles.
But the more the United States tried to dangle incentives, like help in paying off $8 billion in debts owed by Iraq to Russia, the more such efforts seem to backfire.
"The argument we made was that if you want your $8 billion, aren't you more likely to get it from a regime that's integrated into the world economy, and that you have helped put in power?" said a senior official. "We were not pushing a quid pro quo. It was just a matter of political logic." Nonetheless, the Russians ended up joining with France and Germany to oppose a speeded-up timetable for authorizing a war against Iraq.
Among the six undecided countries on the Security Council, Americans and Pakistanis agree that President Pervez Musharraf of Pakistan would have gone along with the United States if he had been the ninth and final vote and was needed. That meant lining up two of the three African countries.
Last weekend, Mr. de Villepin went to all three of the African countries, but his efforts seemed to backfire. Then it was the Americans' turn to feel that their efforts had backfired. Some of the last-minute compromise proposals -- like extending the inspections process to later in March, then passing a resolution -- were pushed by Britain in response to Mexico and Chile.
But officials said President Vicente Fox of Mexico was too boxed in politically after the United States gave him little of his own agenda, particularly easing curbs on Mexican immigrants in the United States.
There were hints for Chile that if it went along with Washington, it might smooth the way for its free-trade agreement pending in Congress. But Chilean leaders reacted negatively, saying the agreement benefited the United States just as much as Chile.
"I always thought the United States would have been able to get nine votes for just about anything," said a diplomat involved in the process of the last few months. "What I didn't expect was that the skeptics would become more entrenched. One African official said to me, 'What can the Americans do to us? Are they going to bomb us? Invade us?' "

The Powell Conundrum
Diplomatic Efforts Made From Home
Throughout the last several months, one of the puzzles at the State Department and throughout the administration is why Mr. Powell, one of the best-known and best-liked Americans in many parts of the world, never engaged in a campaign of public appearances abroad as energetic as the telephone and broadcast interview campaign he pressed from his office, home and car.
"His travels abroad are too few and far between," said an official, noting that the only trips Mr. Powell made to Europe since the beginning of last year were to accompany the president or to attend short-lived conferences.
The secretary also never traveled to Turkey to help line up support for using its territory as a base for a northern front in the war, although State Department officials say doing so would have undercut his stance that he was trying to prevent a conflict.
Mr. Powell is known to dislike travel. "I think I have a right balance between phone diplomacy, diplomacy here in Washington, and diplomacy on the road," he said recently when questioned about his schedule.
Some specialists say that if Mr. Powell had gone to Europe to do town meetings and to answer questions, he might have generated good will of the sort that Prime Minister Tony Blair has in Britain.
"I'm a great advocate of what I call gardening," said former Secretary of State George P. Shultz. "If you plant a garden and you ignore it for six months, it's taken over by weeds. But if you keep at it, month after month, then it grows. In diplomacy, the same thing is true."
Mr. Shultz said Mr. Powell had been an "exemplar" of the kind of patient cultivating of diplomacy he advocates, adding that it was unfair to criticize him for not traveling more because he and Mr. Bush had cultivated relations with counterparts very well.

Bush and Allies Seem Set For War to Depose Hussein
President Bush and the leaders of Britain and Spain issued an ultimatum to the United Nations Security Council, declaring that the diplomatic effort to win support for disarming Iraq would end today. They made it clear that they were ready to start a war to depose Saddam Hussein, with or without the endorsement of the United Nations. A1

Battling the American deadline for war, but reluctant to destroy its relationship with Washington, France is seeking an 11th-hour compromise that will avoid a rupture at the United Nations, senior French officials said. But the Bush administration rejected a written declaration by France, Germany and Russia, and with China's support, for more negotiations, as well as a compromise proposal by President Jacques Chirac of France. A12

Officials from the United States and other countries acknowledge that a train of miscalculations and misunderstandings contributed to the diplomatic standoff over Iraq. A1

Iraq has ringed its capital with air defenses that are more formidable than those used during the Persian Gulf war in 1991, according to senior American military officials. Iraq also reshuffled its high command, putting the defense of the country in the hands of Saddam Hussein's most loyal relatives and deputies. A1

HEADLINE: PLACES; 
Retirees Are at Home When Con Artists Call

BYLINE:  By DAN CUFF 

 BODY:
THERE is something about being older that is supposed to make for vulnerability to the pitches of confidence men. The experts who study fraud have laid out a number of reasons why older people, presumably with fewer of their faculties intact, are more likely than younger people to be duped by tricksters who come to their door or waylay them on the telephone.
 "Older people aren't all the same, but in general they tend to be more trusting," said Susan Grant, director of the National Fraud Information Center of the National Consumers League. "They are home to get things like telemarketing calls or have the time to sit down and look at the junk mail that arrives, and they're also good targets for con artists because they have money they have amassed to live on in their golden years." 
 It's not that older people are incompetent, Ms. Grant added, "but they are interested in good deals, and if something sounds like a good deal they tend to trust the person offering it," she said. 
In other words, not all victims are blithering idiots, which is reassuring to hear. This 70-year-old reporter thought he was losing it when he recently fell for a telemarketing scheme and paid $60.90 for two packages of garbage bags, on the premise that the exorbitant price would help handicapped workers. Every day, people buy overpriced garbage bags, light bulbs and room fresheners from commercial telemarketing companies that are not charities but say they hire the handicapped, whether they do or not. The game goes on despite a Federal Trade Commission order in 2000 (that I found on the Internet, alas, too late) against several companies that agreed to stop representing such purchases as benefiting the handicapped or disabled. 
"False appeals to consumers' charitable nature just to fill your own pockets is a despicable act," the F.T.C. said at the time, adding, "legitimate fund-raisers won't push you to give on the spot."
That adviceis one of hundreds of tips from dozens of organizations committed to alerting older people to the dangers of losing their money in endless variations of fraud. To name a few besides the F.T.C., there are the Postal Inspection Service, the Justice Department, AARP, the National Consumers League, the Better Business Bureau, the National Association of Attorneys General and the Consumer Federation of America. 
Still, perpetrators of fraud thrive, and crimes against older people grow, the experts say. And as the first of the baby boomers approach their 60's, more victims are in the making. Perhaps it takes people like Carl Hirdler to show other older folks how to make a difference.
Mr. Hirdler, a retired chemical engineer who lives in Leisureville, a retirement community in Pompano Beach, Fla., is something of a local hero for foiling a scheme to defraud him of more than $4,000. He worked with detectives to catch two men who were eventually arrested and charged with exploitation of the elderly, grand theft and impersonating a law enforcement officer.
It all began in December, when Mr. Hirdler, who is 87 and walks with a shuffle after two strokes, received a call from someone identifying himself as the Pompano Beach police chief. The caller said that Mr. Hirdler's bank account was being raided and asked him to withdraw $4,150 as part of a plan to catch a dishonest teller. 
At first "he had me suckered," Mr. Hirdler said, but he grew suspicious when the caller told him to dial 911 and ask for the police chief for verification. The "chief" apparently stayed on the line and answered when Mr. Hirdler dialed the emergency number. "There's no way I can dial 911 and get the chief," Mr. Hirdler said.
Mr. Hirdler reported his suspicions to the real police and was enlisted in a sting. Detectives watched as two men followed Mr. Hirdler as he withdrew the money. The next day the "chief" called and told Mr. Hirdler that a "security" man would come by to pick up the money. When he did, he was arrested, along with the "chief" waiting around the corner. The men were not so young themselves, 72 and 62, proving that older people can be predators as well as victims. 
"This scam has been going on around here for two or three years," Mr. Hirdler said, and offered his opinion about why older people fall for the lines of confidence men. "They don't think on their feet and they can't rebut," he said. "They follow along like a bunch of sheep. In my case it was a little different, unfortunately for the con men. If they hadn't overplayed their hand on 911, they had me hooked."
The scheme to induce people to withdraw money from a bank is one of the oldest around. A newer plan is to prey on people's sympathies and solicit money in the wake of 9/11, although the experts say it has lost some steam. The most popular current telemarketing scheme is phony credit card offers to people with financial problems who are asked to pay fees of hundreds of dollars, the National Consumers League says.
The credit-card racket has replaced prizes and sweepstakes as the top telemarketing squeeze, the league says. You are told you have won a prize or a lottery but must send money before you can collect it. There is also the magazine subscription renewal dodge, where you are told that your subscription is about to run out, and you are then given a false address in which to send money. 
But these are small-time swindles compared with ones that have bamboozled people out of their property and taken thousands of dollars in sham investments by slick talkers who make friends with victims over the phone. Many of the victims have been widows, lonely and unused to handling the family finances. Older people fall for moneymaking offers because they fear inflation will erode their savings or they want to leave a nest egg for their children, experts say. These schemes are so pervasive that some lawyers now specialize in what is called elder financial abuse, and work to regain stolen real estate or undo fraudulent loans.
One cruel trick involves a "recovery room" telemarketing ruse in which victims of previous telemarketing schemes are called with promises to help them get most of their money back -- if they pay an upfront fee. All these devices, including home-improvement deals where the work never gets done and the bills grow higher; itinerant workers "passing through" who offer to take the dents out of your car; expensive home-equity loans; and sweetheart come-ons, are part of a horde of tricks too numerous to enumerate. 
There seem to be no reliable estimates on how much money older Americans lose to these plots. Out of embarrassment, a lot of fraud is not reported. The loss to telemarketing fraud alone (all ages included) is often put at $40 billion a year, a figure that came up several years ago in Congress in connection with a telemarketing fraud bill. The experts say that nobody knows for sure, but the annual amount lost to fraud by older Americans must be in the billions.
A 1996 AARP study of 800 fraud victims age 50 and over contradicted the stereotype of lonely, addlepated dupes, says Bridget Small, director of consumer protection for AARP, the organization for middle-aged and older Americans. Most of those surveyed weren't socially isolated but were educated, held jobs, went to church and had family and friends. 
They were aware of the dangers of fraud "but it was hard to spot when it was happening to them," Ms. Small said. AARP concluded that simple awareness of the problem of fraud was not enough. The organization changed its theme to emphasize that fraudulent telemarketers are criminals and that what was happening to victims was not foolish or a cause for embarrassment but a crime, and that they should end such phone calls quickly.
Ms. Grant of the consumers league concurs. "One thing we try to get older people to think about is the fact that there are people out there who are crooks that will tell you anything to get your money, and who don't lose sleep over it at night," she said.

The Market Says 'Sell,' But the Heart Says 'Stay'

BYLINE:  By MAUREEN MILFORD 

 BODY:
THE rapid run-up in house prices in the last two years has brought another dimension to the term "home sweet home."
 Retirees sitting on such handsome nest eggs have probably entertained ideas about cashing out, particularly if their stock portfolios are offering little comfort. 
 But selling a house is not the same as trading in technology stocks. For starters, retirees or soon-to-be retirees shouldn't worry about a swift drop in prices similar to those in the stock market, many experts in housing and financial planning say. Historically, home prices have risen quickly but declined slowly, if at all. 
This year, some housing economists expect home prices to rise a healthy 4 to 5 percent nationally. Based on demographic trends, some economists are bullish on housing for the next few years. 
And while a house is the biggest investment most Americans make, a home is first and foremost a shelter. Unless retirees move in with their children, they have to find another residence. A portion -- or all -- of the equity could wind up in the next home. Moreover, the new living arrangement might not be cheaper once every expense is factored in.
Perhaps most important, a home, unlike a paper stock certificate, is often a physical extension of the owners. Consider that when children draw a house it often resembles a human face, with windows for eyes and the door for a mouth, observed Dr. Richard A. Geist, the president of the Institute of Psychology and Investing in Newton, Mass., and an instructor in the department of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School.
"There are other more important issues than financial gain," Dr. Geist said. "A house is a big part of continuity in life. Will it change family relations because there's not room for family? Will it change the holiday routines that are meaningful? Will there be too much of a sense of loss? And selling a house sets off a confrontation with old age."
What seems like a sound financial decision could be a costly mistake if a retired couple is so unhappy in a new city that they have to move back, said Andrew S. Kochera, a senior policy adviser with AARP.
Besides, even if their house sells for the highest dollar, that doesn't always mean that retirees will end up with a tidy sum for income-generating investments.
For people who move from a high-cost area to a low-cost one -- say, from the Northeast to the Southeast -- there could be a substantial windfall, Mr. Kochera said.
But most retirees who move do not stray far from home. Half of Americans 50 and older who move stay in the same county, according to the 2000 Current Population Survey, a joint project by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the Census Bureau. Seventy-five percent remain in the same state, according to the National Association of Homebuilders.
If retirees stay in the same market, it generally means that the real estate they are buying -- or the apartment they are renting -- has experienced a comparable run-up in price in the last two years.
Unless the house is sold without the help of a real estate agent, there is a sales commission to pay, which can be as much as 7 percent of the purchase price, depending on the level of service.
Then there is the issue of capital gains. Currently, individuals do not have to pay taxes on gains up to $250,000. For a couple, the exclusion rises to $500,000. In some areas, like the New York metropolitan region, the San Francisco Bay Area or Boston, gains above these levels are not unrealistic. Retirees could wind up paying 20 percent on their profits, plus state taxes.
What's more, communities aimed at luring retirees can be expensive. 
"A lot of times, people who are making the move are doing it for lifestyle reasons," Mr. Kochera said. "They're doing it for amenities, and those amenities have a cost."
With a new home, there could be settlement costs, which generally run about 1 percent of the purchase price. Retirement communities generally have community association fees to cover common areas, as well as security and general administrative costs. If private roads or roofs have to be maintained or replaced, there can be one-time assessments. 
SOME of these factors have kept Arthur M. Brown, 77, and his wife, Loretta, 71, from leaving their one-story 2,400-square-foot house in Pflugerville, Tex.
Mr. Brown, who is a semiretired real estate sales manager in Austin, said that school taxes were frozen for him because he is older than 65. His 17-year-old stone house also requires low maintenance. Even better, their seven children all live nearby and help with the chores.
"One son does some plumbing for us, if we need it," Mr. Brown said. "My other son mows the lawn for us. I don't know what I'd do if I moved."
Even when owners are eager to sell, the move can still be traumatic. 
"For that reason it's hard to let go of a house, even if it's financially prudent," Dr. Geist said. 
This could explain why an AARP survey conducted in 2000 found that 89 percent of people age 55 and older said they wanted to stay right where they were for as long as possible. That desire only increases with age and length of time in a house.
The final break is almost always wrenching, said Elinor F. Ginzler, the manager for independent living and long-term care at AARP.
Consider Larilee and William Suiter of Vermont. The couple decided years ago that they did not want to retire in the suburbs of Wilmington, Del., where Mr. Suiter worked in market research and his wife was a psychotherapist. 
The Suiters' daughter lives in Vermont and they had spent vacationsthere, thus their desire to retire in that region. When it became apparent last summer that the market in Wilmington was the best it had been in decades, the couple decided to move forward with their plan to live in Vermont. 
"We were highly aware it was a good time to sell," said Mrs. Suiter, who is 64.
Their ranch house in Delaware, which they had bought in 1962 for $24,900, sold within weeks for $290,000 last fall.
The Suiters have since moved to Vermont and the life they wanted, and Mrs. Suiter is involved in developing a co-housing community in Charlotte, not far from Burlington. But divesting themselves of their long-held home in Delaware -- which made the new life possible -- was not easy. Besides raising two children in the house, the Suiters had put their stamp on the house and garden for more than 40 years.
"It is a painful adjustment," Mrs. Suiter said. "It has its moments of deep sadness. But I know that in any kind of separation, even chosen separation, there's grief. There's grieving for part of your life you have cherished."
She made it clear that the move was not a financial bonanza, and preferred to call it a lateral move. 
"The cheapest thing to do would have been to stay put," she said. "But that's not what motivated me." 

How Long Will Hot Homes Stay Hot?
IF the health of the real estate market is a concern for home-owning retirees, they needn't run to the nearest broker. While housing economists don't expect sales activity and price appreciation to continue at last year's pace, the market will stay near historic levels this year and next, said Lawrence Yun, a senior economist with the National Association of Realtors.
The year started strongly. Existing home sales in January were at an all-time record, rising 2.2 percent higher than January 2002, which itself had record sales, the realtors association reported.
In February, consumers continued to be in a home-buying mood, although overall consumer confidence was bleak, said Lynn Franco, the director of the Consumer Research Center at the Conference Board, a research group.
Though interest rates are predicted to creep up as the economy improves, the realtors association expects that fixed-rate, 30-year mortgages will average 6.5 percent for 2003.
"Anything below 7 percent is highly desirable," Mr. Yun said.
Even if the market cools, houses are not likely to sit too long because inventories continue to be tight, economists said. 
There are some wild cards in the outlook -- a protracted military conflict in Iraq, for instance, or a terrorist strike. 
"But I don't think the market will fall off a cliff," said Orawin Velz, a senior economist with Fannie Mae. "If you want to sell a home to live in a retirement home, at this point, there's nothing to worry about in terms of the market." MAUREEN MILFORD

How Green Is Their Valley?

BYLINE:  By PETER T. KILBORN 

DATELINE: GREEN VALLEY, Ariz. 

 BODY:
ROBERT BEZANSON has the leathery look of a durable hippie, with tumbling white locks and gold-rimmed glasses. Raised in Massachusetts, he moved to Montana and lived wherever his business, laying underground pipe, took him. Never married, he retired in 1990 to a condominium in sunny Green Valley.
 Mr. Bezanson had made a plan. He would play golf every day on the courses here and carouse in their taprooms. He would spend all of his Social Security checks, and over a decade, exhaust his long-nurtured nest egg in government bonds. "I would have an adequate amount for an adequate lifestyle for 10 years," he said. By then he would be 75, fulfilled and gone. 
 Instead, Mr. Bezanson is 78 and indisputably afoot. Gripping his gin and soda at the bar of the par-71 San Ignacio Golf Club, he said he was still shooting his usual 88 to 98. "The biggest problem I have is that I'm living too long," he said without a glimmer of gratitude. His investments, though depleted, have stretched because he has never needed doctors or prescriptions. "I have an H.M.O.," he said, "but what I have mainly is health." 
Gin, genes and golf might explain the vitality of a community where the median age in the 2000 census was 72, one of the oldest in the nation. Only 3 percent of the population of 17,283 was younger than 25. With no ice to slip on and a hot, dry climate hostile to viruses and bugs, with 30-minute access to Tucson's wealth of geriatric care and an hour from cheap medication in Nogales, Mexico, Green Valley's location is surely a factor, too. 
But the means to live long is colliding with longer lives and harder times, most starkly in retirement communities like these in Arizona, Florida and California, which bloomed with the rise of the elderly affluence that began in the 1960's. Many of Green Valley's mostly middle-income settlers spent 40-year careers with government or blue-chip industrial employers that now pay them predictable pensions. But the three-year rout of the investment markets has hammered many settlers' stock and bond portfolios, annuities and 401(k)'s. 
"There are coupon clippers," said Paul Wilson, 60, a Coldwell Banker real estate agent here. "We have a nucleus of people living very marginally, and a wealthy class." Helen Patton, 88 and a widow, said she had put almost $30,000 in a variable annuity fund. "I used to get $262 out of it a month, and now I'm getting $120." She has had enough. "I'm from Michigan," she said. "I'm going back to the cold country. I've got to have my daughter take care of me."
At 65, retirees qualify for Medicare, but premiums and deductibles for the insurance to cover prescriptions and the care that Medicare does not cover are rising, too. Social Security checks still rise with inflation, but poverty among older people, driven from the highest of all age groups to the lowest since the 60's, has been creeping up again. One of Green Valley's busiest commercial enterprises is the White Elephant Thrift Shop.
Some residents have been here for 30 years, but turnover is high because of death, disease and economic reversals. A real estate agent was showing a $179,900, nine-year-old house one afternoon. "It was foreclosed," he said. A neighbor explained that the man who lived there had run out of money by caring for his wife, who had Alzheimer's disease. A son took them home to Idaho.
As they go about their seven-Saturday weeks, many younger, healthier retirees seem inured to the squeeze. Limber and sinewy as a point guard, the visible toll of aging no further advanced than the gray invading his stubbly beard, Gregg Zeller, 69, completes his afternoon workout at a fitness center. His wife, Nancy, 63, robust as he, is a volunteer fitness instructor. 
The Zellers, who have two grown children, moved here five years ago from River Forest, Ill., near Chicago. She was a legal secretary and he processed claims for an insurance company. To prepare for retirement, they converted their 401(k) and I.R.A. accounts into variable annuities, which assured them a check as long as they lived. Their monthly checks have dropped by $1,000 to $4,000, but the Zellers have been spending less than they had expected. 
"We're actually banking some money," he said -- $20,000 that they have put into a stock and bond mutual fund. For health care, Mr. Zeller relies on the Veterans Administration hospital in Tucson. Mrs. Zeller has a Blue Cross plan and will soon be eligible for Medicare. Neither covers the cost of prescriptions, however, and she takes Premarin, an estrogen replacement drug. 
"It runs about $75 for 90 pills in the U.S.," she said. So she takes her prescription down Interstate 19 to Nogales. "I park on our side and walk across," she said. "I can get generic in Mexico for $17 for 100 pills."
Green Valley is an unincorporated community, 12 miles long, 3 miles wide, with views of the Santa Rita Mountains to the east and barren, copper-stripped hills that stretch like a fat sleeping snake to the west. Most of the community is as flat as the sea, in spite of its name, and no more verdant than its saguaro and elephant ear cactus. 
The residents have shed the titles, big cars, suits and designer labels that stratified them at home to form a monochromatic sneaker and cotton class. Muriel Anderson, a saleswoman at a jewelry store, said that newcomers often traded in their jewelry. "In a retirement community, their lifestyles have changed," she said. "Where are they going to wear their jewelry?"
Still, distinctions are made. "There are cliques," Eva Olsen, 89, said. "They all look to find their niches. There's a lot of booze, a lot of bridge, a lot of bragging. This is no area for single people. It is for retirees who have brought money from other states." 
The median family income, nearly all fixed, is $43,000 a year, close to the national median. Homes, typically one story, two bedrooms, two baths, a garage and a patch of desert, sell for an average of $126,000, about the national median. Residents must be at least 55 in most of Green Valley, a restriction that conforms with a federal law allowing that kind of age discrimination in communities that provide certain levels of services, like recreation and transportation, for the elderly. Property taxes on most homes are $1,000 to $2,000. Tidy garages and yards are devoid of the spontaneous jetsam of young families' playthings and gear. 
People gather in the four shopping centers, the nine golf courses, the 28 churches, the thrift shop and the 12 nonprofit Green Valley Recreation centers, where for an initial fee of $1,823 for each home and dues of $351 a year, residents meet, swim, work out, play games, go to the theater and pursue hobbies in workshops. 
A memorial gathering for a colleague who died at 94 was breaking up at a center's woodworking shop one Saturday afternoon. With high ceilings, concrete walls and floors and islands of benches and top-of-the-line machinery, this is no whittle-away-the-sunsets place. Fifteen men -- no women -- were single-mindedly milling an unblemished board of poplar, clamping newly glued layers of walnut and cherry to make bowls, turning a post of white oak for a pedestal table. 
Most of the men grew up during the Depression, landed good jobs, saved and retired with pensions and health insurance. "I've got guys in here who are millionaires and don't spend $40,000 a year," said Warren Williams, 74, a volunteer supervisor at the shop who retired at age 59 from the Dow Chemical Company, where he was the mining industry manager; at 65, he retired from a consulting business he had operated in Denver. 
Mr. Williams and his wife, Mary, 71, are meeting their needs on his $2,000 monthly pension and their Social Security and are still breaking away for summer RV trips when temperatures exceed 100 degrees. But their investment portfolio has dropped with the market, and their pension, not adjusted for inflation, pays for less and less. Mr. Williams's monthly payment for health insurance has climbed to $105 from $35, the amount when he first retired. 
OTHERS have been hit harder. "We have a food bank here in town," Mr. Williams said (where Mrs. Williams volunteers). "We've got a few guys going back to work part time. A lot become realtors. We have a man who spent his entire career at General Electric." When he retired, he took a buyout instead of a monthly pension. "He invested it," Mr. Williams said, "and I'm sure he's struggling."
This is a staged-retirement community of young-old and old-old, where over the span of 20 and 30 years, people move from houses and condos to independent living homes to rooms in assisted living facilities and eventually nursing homes. As they age and lose spouses, their incomes decline. They outlive the recreational attractions that brought them here and become Green Valley's sequestered old. 
Some have moved to the 98-unit Del Coronado Apartments. Two stories, pink stucco, with sliding windows and balconies overlooking mountains and desert scrub, Del Coronado's apartments have a bedroom, sitting room, kitchen and large bathroom. 
Government-subsidized, they are restricted to people 62 and older who have incomes of less than $20,640 for individuals and $23,640 for a couple. Rents, based on income, range from $85 to $336 a month. Utilities and laundry machines are free; other services, including 12 meals a week, weekly housekeeping and van rides to shops, cost $355 a month. 
Ms. Olsen was living in Rhode Island with her husband in the early 60's. "I got rid of him," she said, still pleased with herself. A nursing graduate from Yale, she headed west, finding work in Tucson as a mental-health nurse and turning her attentions to her daughter in California, pet dogs and a bird, a blue-gray cockatiel. 
"The bird is 40 years old," Ms. Olsen said. Uncaged most of the day, it screeches and darts about her second-floor apartment at the Del Coronado. Gregarious and agile, Ms. Olsen gestures like a conductor and bounds up stairs like a teenager. "I've got my own car," she said.
She lives on a monthly Social Security check of $945 and pays $203 a month for rent and the $355 for services. That leaves little else for things like the nine other meals a week she must find for herself. "It's very expensive here," she said. "If you go to the Safeway, everything is about 10 cents more than in Tucson."

HEADLINE: SAVING; 
Arguing Against Equities

BYLINE:  By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH 

 BODY:
THE stock bubble has burst, and then some. But even amid the wreckage, the conventional mantra has continued: stocks are still the long-haul key to preparing for financial security in retirement.
 But what, actually, if they're not? 
 Quietly,in obscure financial journals and actuarial conferences, some alternatives are being debated. So far, the ideas have received little public attention. But the concepts that the pension professionals are wrangling over may ultimately hold answers for America's savers -- people who know they need to plan for retirement but can't imagine where to start. 
The debate is broken down into two main camps. By far the larger of the two clings to the traditional faith in stock-market investing. The other camp, smaller but gaining advocates, especially in academia, is challenging what it terms the cult of equities, calling instead for a return to extremely conservative bond investments.
Retirement savers who are using these investments may no longer dream of riches, but at least they won't lose their shirts. If this camp sees a place for stocks in a pension fund, it is only if they are hedged with derivative securities -- financial instruments that help protect against adverse price movements.
Not surprisingly, the first group includes most members of the financial establishment, corporate financial officers, asset managers, actuaries and others who are responsible for figuring out how much today's older workers will cost when they retire, how much money to set aside for them now and how to invest the money so that it grows enough to pay their benefits.
These professionals are well aware that the funds entrusted in their care have shriveled alarmingly in the last three years. Yet they still subscribe to the belief that if an investor's time horizon is long -- as a pension beneficiary's generally is -- history shows the investor will do best with a well- diversified portfolio, larded with stocks.
"These are long-term investors with a very long-term view," said Judy Schub, head of the Committee on Investment of Employee Benefit Assets, a Washington group that represents corporate pension officials. "These are not people who say, 'Oops!' and drop everything and change their strategy based on what's happening short-term in the markets."
If the opposing camp had a name, it might be something like "duration matching bond strategists," or "decumulation specialists." Off-putting terms, but behind them lies a body of thought that ought to be interesting to anyone fearful of having to park cars or flip burgers at age 87. 
The duration matchers' first piece of advice is to stop chasing the average 10.7 percent a year that seemingly everyone says stocks have returned since 1926. That strategy, based on a statistical illusion, they say, is doomed to land those who pursue it on the shores of negative mortality, the grim term actuaries use to describe outliving one's resources.
It's not that stocks have not really returned an average 10.7 percent a year for much of the last century. That number is right, duration matchers say, but it's the wrong number for retirement savers to focus on.
Infinitely more important is "the time path of returns," said Zvi Bodie, a Boston University finance professor and an outspoken proponent of duration-matching theories, both for pension funds and individuals. 
"Even if the average rate of return is high, one can run out of money long before one expires," said Professor Bodie, a co-author, with Michael J. Clowes, of "Worry-Free Investing," a book to be published this year that applies duration matching bond strategies to individual retirement planning. (Mr. Clowes is the editor of "Pensions and Investments," a trade publication.) 
Instead of stocks, the authors propose an ultraconservative fixed-income portfolio composed of inflation-protected Treasury bonds. To avoid getting locked in at a single low interest rate, they also advocate buying bonds of different durations, with the maturities staggered in what is called a ladder. 
If building a laddered bond portfolio sounds too boring after the casinolike thrill of the stock market, it's possible to add derivative-based bells and whistles to improve gains, much like professional fund managers do. But that's probably more complexity than individual savers want. 
There may come a time when individual savers can buy packaged laddered bond portfolios, with the derivative hedges built in. It's possible even today to find prototypes of investment vehicles with some of these features. But you have to go looking for them.
"It's slightly premature right now," said Shane A. Chalke, a Middlebury, Va., actuary and annuity expert who operates AnnuityNet.com, a Web site offering services to fee-based financial planners.
Mr. Chalke thinks it's a chicken-and-egg problem. The public doesn't know about the duration matching bond concept so it doesn't demand these investments; financial-services companies don't offer them because there is no demand.
One reason for the lack of demand is that individual investors have had it pounded into their heads that stocks will eventually yield 10.7 percent, if people hold them for a long enough time period. 
Mr. Chalke came by his opinion the hard way. In 2001, he devised an investment instrument called the Inflation Proofer, which would offer buyers a monthly pension check for life, indexed for inflation. He did it because the Bush administration was studying a Social Security overhaul then. He thought that if he created a retirement income plan that looked like Social Security and kept gun-shy people out of the stock market, the world would beat a path to his door.
His pitch line was, "If you like Social Security, here's where you can buy more of it."
Mr. Chalke located an insurance company, the Lincoln National Group, to underwrite the Inflation Proofer, but before they could start a marketing blitz, the stock market collapsed and plans to "privatize" Social Security were dead. Without legions of older Americans frightened of gambling their Social Security benefits on stocks, there was no market for the Inflation Proofer.
"On this site," he said of AnnuityNet.com, "we generally sell a couple hundred million dollars a year of annuities. But I don't think we've yet sold our first million of Inflation Proofer. The number is so small I don't monitor it." The Inflation Proofer is still available, through fee-based financial planners.
So far, there is only one big corporate pension fund showing the way for those who want to turn their backs on the cult of equities. In October 2001, Boots, a large British drugstore chain, announced that it had dismissed its pension manager, thrown out its equity-based asset-allocation plan and moved 100 percent into bonds. 
Boots may be unknown to most Americans, but to pension managers it has earned a place in history. By selling its equities when it did -- over 15 months in 2000 and 2001 -- Boots generated enough proceeds to create a surplus in its pension fund. It then locked in the surplus by buying high-grade corporate bonds, carefully matching the durations to the maturity of Boots's obligations to its retirees. A sizable share of the bonds are inflation protected.
WHILE all this was going on at Boots, virtually every other large pension fund in Britain and America was holding onto equities and riding the bear market down. 
Today, many of these companies are pumping large cash infusions into their pension funds. Boots, by contrast, has reduced its annual pension contributions by half. And because its bond portfolio is held passively, the drugstore chain has chopped its money-management costs from about $16 million to a thrifty $484,000 a year. 
Despite all this evidence, most pension professionals still question whether the Boots model can be universally applied. They say that American accounting rules are different, that stock prices are too low to permit selling now, and that it is simply "not efficient" to invest in bonds. 
Translated, that last argument means that as long as companies can argue they will earn 10.7 percent a year on stocks, they can save money by paying less cash into their pension funds than they would have if they had invested in bonds and measured their liabilities realistically. It's an appealing line of reasoning as long as it works -- but the failed pension promises of Bethlehem Steel and US Airways reveal what happens when it doesn't.
Mr. Bodie and Mr. Chalke have also been devising a successor to the Inflation Proofer -- a bond-based instrument that would offer not only a guaranteed, inflation-indexed monthly payout, but also an equity "kicker" that would use stock-index options to offer some of the market's opportunity without much of its risk. 
The financial tools for such a product are well established, Mr. Chalke said. What is missing is a sense of the need.
"The public need hasn't reached a critical mass yet," he said. "We almost need to go through that cycle, where people will be retiring without pensions, and you'll have case studies of people running out of money. It's going to take some people running out of money for the demand to emerge." 

Building a Ladder: TIPS and I Bonds
THE first step to rebalance a portfolio is for a retirement saver to sell some stock and put the proceeds into bonds. Professor Zvi Bodie, a finance professor at Boston University, said that Treasury securities were better for retirement savers because Treasuries eliminated the risk of default. He and Shane A. Chalke, an expert on annuities, favor two types of inflation-protected Treasury securities that were created in 1997, TIPS and I bonds. 
"If you're going to be in retirement for 30 years, even 2 percent inflation means serious erosion," Mr. Chalke said. "You're going to lose 45 percent of your purchasing power."
Like other bonds, TIPS of different maturities can be put together in a ladder, staggered to mature in the years the saver expects to need the principle. For people who aren't sure when they'll need the money, there are mutual funds that offer TIPS investments, but their prices fall when interest rates rise; to avoid this, savers can buy TIPS directly from the Treasury and hold them to maturity.
Though yields from these bonds may seem small, TIPS pay a bonus for each year that they yield less than the Consumer Price Index. Because this income is taxable the year it is paid, investors are advised to hold TIPS in a tax-deferred saving account, like an I.R.A. 
I bonds work much the same way, offering interest income that is indexed to keep pace with inflation. But because their interest can be tax deferred for up to 30 years, I bonds do not have to be held in an I.R.A. 
Another difference: I bonds are not traded on a market, like TIPS, but are redeemable at any time for the value they have accrued by the date of redemption. The accrual rate is predetermined, meaning that people can buy 30-year I bonds and get a ladderlike effect by simply redeeming them in the years they need the money. Taxes are owed on the interest that is earned at redemption.
Savers accustomed to the stock market's lure of double-digit returns, though, may wince when they go to the Treasury Web site (www .savingsbonds.gov) and discover that I bonds are currently paying interest of 1.6 percent. MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article in the special Retirement section on Tuesday about alternatives to investing in stocks gave an incomplete description of I-bonds, which are inflation-protected Treasury bonds on which taxes may be deferred. While the fixed interest rate on I-bonds now stands at 1.6 percent, the bonds also pay an inflation-protection premium that is adjusted every six months. The current total return is 4.08 percent.

As Layoffs Rise, So Do Age-Discrimination Charges

BYLINE:  By SHAIFALI PURI 

 BODY:
ONE thing has gone up since the economy has gone down: charges of age discrimination.
 Over the last two fiscal years, age-discrimination complaints filed with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission have risen more than 24 percent, reaching levels not seen since the early 1990's. 
 The sharp increase, labor experts say, is largely attributable to the convergence of a weak economy and an aging work force -- nearly 50 percent of the labor pool is made up of baby boomers, and the percentage of workers over 65 has increased from the last decade. There are now more older workers for employers to discriminate against, and more economic incentives to do so. 
"The knee-jerk reaction of employers is often that they need to cut costs, and since older workers are perceived as costing more, they become targets of layoffs," said Laurie McCann, a senior lawyer at AARP. 
When companies are forced to reorganize, older employees are often perceived as being unable to keep up with new technologies. And because federal courts are often persuaded by arguments that reductions based on economic needs and business strategies do not constitute age discrimination, employers are emboldened to use such rationales as a cover to purge older workers, said John Clifford, a labor lawyer in Washington. 
Such tendencies are compounded in sectors of the economy that say youth is essential to innovation and progress, like technology. Because technology has been hit particularly hard in the downturn, Ms. McCann said, the stereotypes about the inability of older workers to keep pace and adapt, or that they represent higher costs, have an especially pernicious effect.
William S. Payson can speak personally about the industry's suspicious attitude toward older people. When he moved to Northern California in 1987 as a retired chief executive of a business-to-business marketing firm, he had such difficulty finding employment that he organized a brigade of his similarly challenged peers to wear buttons that read "hire the retired" around Silicon Valley. Today, Mr. Payson, now 79, is the chief executive of SeniorTechs.com, an employment database for older information technology workers. 
He said that the relentless quest for youth had always permeated the culture of technology, and that the dot-com boom made matters worse. These days, the "senior" tech workers that Mr. Payson's Web site serves are 35 and older. "It's amazing to think that in the technology industry today, 35 is over the hill," Mr. Payson said. 
Frederic Clancy, 71, and James Hurd, 60, would agree. They filed age-bias charges with the E.E.O.C. and a suit in federal court after being laid off from their sales jobs with Tektronix in 2000, an electronic equipment company. 
According to the complaint, they and a co-worker were abruptly transferred out of their telephone and cable sales group to form a new unit to sell an older, less desirable line. The three men were the oldest members of the sales force. (The third was planning on retiring in a year, and did.) Mr. Clancy and Mr. Hurd, each with about two decades at Tektronix, were told that their sales experience was needed in the new unit, Mr. Clancy said. 
What they say in the complaint is that, unbeknown to them, Tektronix was planning to sell their new unit. Four months after they were transferred, it was sold and Mr. Clancy and Mr. Hurd were notified that they would be terminated. "Prior to being transferred to the new unit, I was the top sales producer in my group and made the most money for the group that year," said Mr. Clancy, who had received dozens of sales awards. "It was inconceivable to me that I would be let go."
For Mr. Hurd, the disbelief was compounded when he tried to find another position within the company, something he said that was promised to him. When a sales position previously held by Mr. Hurd opened up, he saw it as a stroke of luck. "I had trained the guy leaving," Mr. Hurd said, "so there was no question of being qualified."
Instead, he was told that he was not right for the position. Upon being terminated, Mr. Hurd spent more than a year looking for work. 
Mr. Clancy and Mr. Hurd ultimately settled their case. Tektronix officials declined to comment, citing a confidentiality clause in the settlement agreement. 
Ms. McCann of AARP says that problems of proof hamper age-bias cases, especially when the question is failure to hire. "A lot of the discrimination in the technology industry is at the hiring end, and since you're not usually given a reason why you're not hired, it is difficult to prove," she said.
D. Jan Duffy, a San Francisco employment practices consultant and lawyer, said that many older employees were reluctant to litigate. "Plaintiffs' lawyers used to lament three years ago that they could not get clients to bring suits challenging egregious discrimination because the clients could so easily find other work, so it wasn't worth it to litigate," she said. "Today, while the effects of discrimination are so much worse, since it is so hard to find work, many of the people over 50 I have seen are just giving up and leaving the industry altogether, rather than asserting their claims." 
Mr. Payson argues that older workers need to take an entrepreneurial approach to seeking employment. He points to the demands for contract work in older computer languages, which mostly older technology workers are skilled to program. 
But for 58-year-old Marilyn Langenberg, such contract work was not a salvation. As a contract software programmer in Silicon Valley, she has been out of that line of work for 22 months and is now employed as a flower arrangement designer. 
Ms. Langenberg said that contract work was a last resort that she turned to when she could no longer avoid the age problem. She said she was repeatedly told she was overqualified. 
Ms. Langenberg has not had health insurance for three years. Still, she said, the thought of filing an age-discrimination suit has never crossed her mind. "I have always been far more interested in finding a job," she said.

Nobody's Waiting To Take Their Places

BYLINE:  By ROBERT STRAUSS 

 BODY:
JIM WEBER, who is 64, isn't interested in retiring, and he knows that he can keep working as long as he wants to. Here's the secret to his job security: what he does is so out-of-date, nobody wants to learn how to do it.
 Mr. Weber, a radio technician, calls himself a specialist in "trailing-edge technologies." That means repairing and refurbishing analog radio systems that are 10 to 30 years old and that the military wants to keep available as backups in case newer digital systems fail. 
 "Most things have a shelf life of five years or so, but the military likes to be cautious, which has kept me working," said Mr. Weber, who lives in Haddonfield, N.J.
Mr. Weber has counterparts around the country who work in fields as diverse as farming and nuclear engineering. What their industries have in common is dwindling work forces that are growing grayer by the year. When workers like Mr. Weber finally leave their job, there's an added twist: it may be the end of a particular line of work. 
"I've had engineers as assistants the last few years, but they all leave because, being young guys, they want to be on the cutting edge," Mr. Weber said. "What makes it creative is that sometimes the parts no longer exist, so I have to either create them or do some redesign. 
"It really is important work, but I can't get anyone but lab assistants to help me out. So this is about as secure a job as I can imagine. But when I go, I'm afraid the whole thing will go with me."
Doug Werstler knows that the day he retires he will be turning out the lights on a long tradition that has been undermined by economic, not technological, forces. 
Back in 1965, when Goodyear hired Mr. Werstler, the city of Akron, Ohio, was the world's tire-making capital. He estimates that there were about 13,000 factory workers for Goodyear and about as many across town at Firestone. Now, as president of Goodyear's union local, Mr. Werstler, 59, represents about 600 hourly workers. 
Most of those are headed for retirement in the not too distant future. "Our work force is older," he said. "Not many people see a long-term future in Akron in tires."
Tire manufacturing has long since moved overseas. In fact, the only tires produced in Akron are the big ones used in Nascar races. 
Mr. Werstler said the Nascar contract had three years to go, so he thinks he is safe for now, but he feels a sense of loss that goes beyond a job. "There used to be an American tire on an American car, and those days are behind us," he said. 
Mark McCarthy is part of a work force that is aging because of stability, not change. Mr. McCarthy, 50, is a nuclear power plant control-room operator at Seabrook Station in Seabrook, N.H.
He describes people in the nuclear plant work force as settled and generally satisfied -- unlike the disgruntled cartoon character Homer Simpson, who has a similar job. "It has taken a lot of training, but, yes, most of the people here are in their 40's and 50's," he said. "We like our jobs and are staying around, so I don't know that there will be a lot for young people right now."
Mr. McCarthy said that in the days after the Three Mile Island near meltdown in 1979, the federal government required more supervising engineers for checks and counterchecks at nuclear plants. In the last decade, though, that was considered superfluous, so engineering jobs like his at Seabrook and other facilities decreased slightly. In addition, most nuclear plants have consolidated among fewer owners because of deregulation, so some jobs were consolidated as well.
"I don't call my job exciting, but it takes expertise, so I think I will keep it to retirement," Mr. McCarthy said. "I guess you wouldn't really want it to be exciting, though, would you? That would probably mean something not so good."
Theodore Nesmith, 61, plans never to retire. He says he will work "as long as the Lord allows it," which is a good thing because he has no idea who would come after him. One of Mr. Nesmith's many sidelines is persuading young people to follow him into farming, a profession whose ranks are thinning.
Mr. Nesmith was not young when he began to farm -- and as a late-in-life black farmer, he is even more unusual. For 27 years, he ran an auto-body business in New York, but realized there was a hole in his life.
"I didn't love it and I especially couldn't put up with New York anymore," he said. In 1987, he moved back to Nesmith, S.C., his hometown, to farm land that the Nesmith family had lived on for more than 300 years. He raises organic vegetables on a 35-acre plot "because what you eat is what you are," he said.
But his children, like so many other farmers' children, are choosing a different route: his son is a lawyer and his daughter is studying to be a physical therapist. 
"Some people want to wear a white shirt and a tie and sit in air- conditioning and make their $50,000," he said. "But if there weren't any farmers, none of them would be eating."
A few years ago, Mr. Nesmith noticed there were no young people becoming farmers in his area, which is about 80 miles north of Charleston, so he started going to schools to chat up farming, and is trying to set up 4-H clubs.
He also works with the Federation of Southern Cooperatives, an African-American farming group based in Atlanta that is trying to keep the tradition of black-owned farms alive.
Last month, Mr. Nesmith began the cooperative's course in beekeeping. "Seems like another good thing to get involved in," he said.

Prescription Drugs: A Guide to Options That Can Cut Costs

BYLINE:  By JULIE CONNELLY 

 BODY:
IF you are retired, you have undoubtedly been discovering just how expensive it is to get a drug prescription filled. You feel the sticker shock not only because you are at that age when you start to need more medications, but also because your insurance is picking up less of the cost.
 Unfortunately, neither your medicine nor your health insurance coverage for prescription drugs will get cheaper any time soon. Last year, the drug industry raised prices by an average of 4 percent, twice the rate of inflation. Meanwhile, premiums for individual health insurance are rising 15 to 20 percent at renewal time. 
 Retirees with employer-sponsored health coverage are feeling the jolt less because almost all these plans include prescription drugs. But only 37 percent of those retirees ages 55 to 64 have an employer plan, according to the Employee Benefit Research Institute, a nonprofit group in Washington. And Watson Wyatt Worldwide, an employee benefits consulting company, reports that only 3 in 10 Medicare beneficiaries have additional coverage from their employers. 
Moreover, profit-strapped employers are cutting back on retiree benefits, leaving substantial numbers of older people hunting down affordable prescription drug coverage. The Bush administration wants to include drug coverage as part of Medicare, but the executive and legislative branches of the government are a long way from agreeing on what form this should take. 
For retirees who are not covered by employer plans, there are options that can trim the cost of medications. But -- let's get the bad news over with -- they range between more and less unsatisfactory. Early retirees between 55 and 65 who want their prescription drugs covered will have to explore the expensive market for individual health insurance where price comparisons are difficult and applicants can be denied a policy based on pre-existing conditions.
The situation is slightly better for retirees who are 65 and over because they can choose between Medigap, which is supplemental coverage for Medicare, and Medicare+Choice, which are H.M.O.'s and may cover prescription drugs. There are also state pharmacy assistance programs for people whose incomes are too high to qualify for Medicaid but too low to handle out-of-pocket drug costs. In the last two years, those costs have risen nearly 50 percent, to an average of $996 from $644, according to the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation, a philanthropy that focuses on health care.
Retirees can also investigate ways to buy discounted prescription drugs, although 15 percent to 30 percent off the retail price on expensive medications will seldom equal the saving that is available through an insurance plan with a 20 percent co-payment. 

Eligible for Medicare?
Of the 10 Medigap plans, the last three, H through J, offer a prescription drug benefit. Plan J is the most comprehensive, covering 50 percent of drug costs up to $3,000. (The other two cover 50 percent up to $1,250.) If you want to buy a Medigap policy, be sure to sign up for it when you enroll in Medicare. If you wait until you are over 65, you will be "subject to underwriting" -- the tactful term the insurance industry uses to explain that you may not be eligible for coverage because of a pre-existing condition.
Even though Medigap policies are standard, premiums range widely, soit is advisable to shop around. Weiss Ratings, an agency that rates the solvency of insurers, sells the "Shopper's Guide to Medicare Supplement Insurance," which lists Medigap underwriters by region, a description of their policies and the premiums. (Go to www.weissratings.com; $45.) 
About 11 percent of elderly people who are eligible for Medicare are enrolled in Medicare H.M.O.'s through Medicare+Choice. You cannot be turned down for these plans for any reason, although insurers are cutting back on benefits because costs are outrunning federal subsidies. An exception is Aetna, which recently began adding back coverage for prescription generic drugs for some of its Medicare H.M.O.'s on the East Coast and in parts of Southern California.
Many insurers are getting out of their Medicare H.M.O.'s, forcing beneficiaries to find alternative coverage on short notice. Between 1998 and this year, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, the number of Medicare+Choice plans declined to 155 from 346; over that period, according to Weiss Ratings, 2.4 million elderly people lost their coverage. If you are dropped from a Medicare H.M.O., you have a three-month open enrollment window to join a Medigap plan. Miss it and you are back in the "subject to underwriting" pool.
Lower-income older people who are not eligible for drug coverage through Medicaid can pursue state pharmacy assistance programs, which are available in 34 states. New York State's Elderly Pharmaceutical Insurance Coverage, known as EPIC, for example, is available to residents 65 and over with incomes of $35,000 or less if they are single, and $50,000 or less if married. Depending on income, those in the program pay either a fee or a deductible and then a co-payment of $3 to $20, depending on the drug's price.
Prescription drug cards from pharmaceutical companies are another saving alternative for Medicare-enrolled older people who have no drug coverage and meet certain income limits. The Together Rx card, sponsored by seven drug companies, offers saving of 20 percent to 40 percent on more than 150 medications for single people with incomes of $28,000 or less, and for couples with $38,000 or less. (Go to www .togetherrx.com.) The Pfizer for Living Share Card allows older people with incomes of $18,000 or less for singles, and $24,000 or less for couples, to buy a 30-day supply of any Pfizer drug for $15 at 51,000 drugstores nationwide. (Visit the site www .pfizerforliving.com.)

Options at Any Age
Another resource is the Internet, where retirees can research options and buy drugs. Georgetown University's Institute for Health Care Research and Policy, www.healthinsuranceinfo.net, offers a guide customized by state. Retirees can learn at www.benefitscheckup.org what benefits they qualify for by reading the section on drug coverage.
Discounted prescription drugs are available online. Cigna Tel-Drug, a unit of the health insurer Cigna, maintains an online pharmacy at www.cigna.com, where anyone 18 and older can buy a 90-day supply of medications and save an average of 35 percent off the retail price. 
Discount cards issued by pharmacies, insurance companies and AARP offer a percentage off a drug's retail price. The discounts vary and some cards may require fees. AARP offers a free card to anyone who buy its health insurance, and charges an annual fee of $15 to nonsubscribers. Fortis Health, an insurance company in Milwaukee, issues a card for $7.95 a month that covers a household and includes discounts on vision and hearing products and nutritional supplements. If you enroll in many plans, one card can cover what another might not. 
Drugs can also be bought, often at significant saving, from Canada and Mexico online or in person, although the legality of doing so is murky. The Food and Drug Administration is threatening to take action against insurers who encourage the practice. But the F.D.A. has indicated that it is not pursuing individuals who are buying small amounts of medications for personal use. "We're going after the commercial operation, not the individual who is buying drugs on a Web site," an agency spokesman said.
The F.D.A. has also raised questions about the safety of medicine bought in foreign countries, but the difference in prices can be so startling that many older Americans are willing to take the risk. 
The Maine Council of Senior Citizens in Augusta sponsors bus trips to Calais, Me., which is next to St. Stephen in Canada. In Calais, a doctor licensed both in the United States and in Canada examines the travelers and writes prescriptions that are then filled in St. Stephen. The council's director, Neena Quirion, said one participant who was paying $1,600 a year in the United States for the cancer drug tamoxifen now pays $85 a year for it in Canada.

HEADLINE: SAVING; 
Learning Painful Lessons of the 401(k)

BYLINE:  By FRAN HAWTHORNE 

 BODY:
TUAN Q. TRAN embodied the American dream -- until three years ago. 
 A boat person from Vietnam, he arrived in America in 1984 at age 11 with his family, virtually penniless. He worked his way through Virginia Polytechnic Institute as a waiter and a busboy to earn a bachelor of science degree in mechanical engineering. As an engineer at PRE Holding, a medical-equipment manufacturer in Midlothian, Va., since 1998, he faithfully put 15 percent of his paycheck into his 401(k) plan every year. Before he was 27, he had squirreled away more than $30,000 in the 401(k) and other investments. 
 But the dream -- Mr. Tran's and America's -- has faded. During the three years of the bear market, Mr. Tran, now 29, has lost $9,000, or about a third of his 401(k), and more in other accounts. In January, he cut back his paycheck contribution to 5 percent, figuring that "the market's not really picking up any time soon," he said. He doesn't even look at his account statements. 
"I'm not depressed," Mr. Tran said. "It's been an education for me." But he acknowledged that "it's been painful for me to save so much and lose."
About 40 million other Americans have been sharing that education with Mr. Tran, as they open their 401(k) statements every quarter. For the first two years of the weak market, people toughed it out as their accounts lost, on average, more than $8,000, or 18 percent, according to the Boston consultant Cerulli Associates.
Nor did worsening recession and higher unemployment seem to shake these investors. "You could argue that the investment community has gotten across the message that they should take the long-term view," said Kathryn Hopkins, an executive vice president at the Fidelity Institutional Retirement Services Company. "Or you could argue that it's a fair amount of inertia." 
Now, however, more 401(k) participants seem to have decided that they can't wait any longer for the market or the economy to improve. (Employees at a number of companies that have announced they will either reduce or halt their contributions to 401(k)'s have even further incentive.) Instead, they are shifting to more conservative investments, reducing the amount of money they put in or not joining plans at all. Some are taking cash from their 401(k)'s to tide themselves over until the economy improves. By the scores, they are flooding their benefits offices with nervous questions.
While the numbers are small, there are signs that this anxious activity has increased in the last 6 to 12 months. "Five years ago, if you talked to people, their crown jewel was the 401(k)," said Richard Koski, a principal at Buck Consultants, a human resources consulting firm. "Now they don't want to talk about it. They put their money in, but they see the red ink keeps growing." 
It's a feeling, Mr. Koski said, that he sometimes shares: his own six-figure retirement account has lost more than 20 percent of its value.
For many people, the instinctive reaction to a drop in the stock market is to pull money out of stocks and park it in safer investments like money market funds. Virtually every survey of 401(k) asset allocation shows at least a slight shift from equities, maybe 3 to 12 percent of the assets each year. 
Part of that shift is a result of falling stock values, which automatically lower the value of an investor's stock holdings compared with other investments. Still, there are 401(k) participants who have clearly gotten cold feet about stocks. In a survey of about 1,400 savers commissioned by the Principal Financial Group and conducted by Harris Interactive in December 2002, the latest quarterly "well-being" poll by the pair, 34 percent of the respondents said they had moved "from volatile investments to more stable investments" in their retirement savings because of "the current stock market and economic conditions." That is up from 22 percent a year earlier. 
Hedging their bets, investors often reallocate only part of their holdings. For instance, Ann Michelson, 43, an assistant vice president at GuideOne Insurance in West Des Moines, Iowa, still keeps four-fifths of her "low six-figure" 401(k) portfolio in aggressive stock and international funds. Last fall, though, she decided to become more cautious with her company's 3 percent matching contribution, dividing it equally between moderate and aggressive options. 
"I'm in there for the long term, but I realize I have to pull back from the aggressive approach I have traditionally taken," she said. 
Donn Hess, vice president of participant services at J. P. Morgan/ American Century Retirement Plan Services, said that by changing only new contributions, 401(k) investors "avoid turning a paper loss in the existing portfolio into a hard-dollar loss, but they also avoid future losses."
But that doesn't help people who need cash now. One solution is to reduce the 401(k) contribution or stop contributing altogether. Surveys by Principal, Fidelity, the Vanguard Group, Hewitt Associates and others show mixed trends on the reductions but a slide in participation rates -- the percentage of eligible employees who contribute to a plan -- to about 75 percent in 2001 and 2002, down from around 80 percent in 1999. 
The most common explanation is that people who lose their jobs and get a new one are not joining the new company's plan, possibly because they have taken a pay cut. In other cases, employees' spouses may have been laid off, so they have less money to save. Or new employees are scared to get into the market.
To pick up an even bigger infusion of cash, participants can take a loan against their 401(k) or a hardship withdrawal. Most retirement experts say they have not seen much change in these activities, but among Principal's 45,000 small- and midsize-plan clients, loan volume for the last three months of 2002 jumped 11 percent over the same period in 2001. 
Another way to get quick money from the 401(k) is to cash out all or part of its assets when leaving a job. Increasingly, departing employees with less than $5,000 in their portfolio are doing that, rather than rolling the distribution (as it's called) into their new job's plan or an Individual Retirement Account, even though the 2001 tax law makes such rollovers easier. Last year, 22.5 percent of 401(k) distributions were cashed out, up from 20.2 percent in 2000, according to Fidelity.
"These are people who are at the margin," said Ms. Hopkins of Fidelity. "If the economy has gotten tighter, $5,000 in your pocket probably seems better than $5,000 in your I.R.A." 
The biggest increase has been the inquiries flooding call centers and benefits offices. They run the gamut from panicky to sophisticated, from bitter to confused.
At the Brookshire Grocery Company, a chain based in Tyler, Tex., employees have been shifting their 401(k)investments out of the most aggressive of the company's five options and into the most conservative. As a result of that, plus market returns, the most aggressive has lost about 41 percent of its assets in the bear market, while the most conservative has gained 27 percent. "We try to explain that this is one of the cycles that we go through," said Marvin Massey, the chief financial officer. "But still, their emotions get in the way."

HEADLINE: DECISIONS; 
Do You Want Your Money All at Once or Bit by Bit Forever?

BYLINE:  By STEPHANIE MENCIMER 

 BODY:
LUMP SUM or monthly check?
 More and more pension plans are now offering workers the choice of how they want to receive their benefits: as the traditional annuity, in which they receive a certain income each month for life, or as a lump sum representing an estimate of the annuity's value. 
 This important choice -- which often catches workers unprepared -- is complicated, involving calculations that could make an actuary's head spin. And it has led to a certain amount of regret among some recent retirees who chose the lump sum, which looked like the better bet during the stock market's boom. 
Susan Jarvis faced that kind of choice when the stock market was at its peak. In 2000, Ms. Jarvis retired after 33 years as a faculty member and research librarian at the University of Nevada at Las Vegas, where she had managed the gaming library. 
Advisers at TIAA-CREF, the nonprofit financial services provider that primarily serves employees in higher education and was handling her retirement plan, suggested that she put half her retirement money into an annuity, which would have given her a guaranteed income, with periodic increases for inflation. 
Ms. Jarvis was about to take the advice when friends she consulted asked, "Why are you doing that?" With the stock market still going great guns, they thought the annuity was a mistake. Feeling pressured, Ms. Jarvis wavered, unsure what to do. Finally, she chose to take the entire amount as a lump-sum payment after a financial adviser who was recommended by a colleague told her that he could get her a better return on her money, and pointed out that the annuity would not leave anything for her son when she died. 
Shortly after her retirement, the stock market crashed. Suddenly, the prospect of a guaranteed income sounded better. Ms. Jarvis said that while her investments had not fared as badly as some because they were highly diversified, she is still not sure she did the right thing. "I could have asked more questions," she said.
Her decision to take a one-time distribution puts her in an emerging majority of retirees, according to the Department of Labor's Employee Benefits Security Administration.
Today, about half of the Fortune 100 companies offer their employees a traditional pension with the sole option of lifetime monthly payments, compared with almost 90 percent of such companies in 1985, according to a recent study by Watson Wyatt Worldwide, an employment benefits consulting firm. Of the remaining half, about 30 percent offer defined-benefit plans that let employees choose between lifetime monthly payments and a lump-sum payment. (Some companies allow retirees to take part of the pension as a lump sum and the rest in reduced monthly payments.)
Given the choice, most employees will turn down an annuity in favor of managing their own funds, say the experts. This is partly due to widespread misunderstanding about the annuity as a financial instrument, according to David Certner, the federal affairs director for AARP. He said that when people chose a lump sum over an annuity, "Most are not even sure of the value of what they're choosing between." 
That was certainly the case with Ms. Jarvis. She said that when she chose the one-time payment, she was under the impression that if she died in 20 years, she would still have had a "significant amount of money" left in the annuity that her son would have to forfeit. In fact, if she lives to 85, as half of all women who reach 65 can expect to, the annuity would have paid out more than twice the lump-sum total. Also, she could have chosen an annuity that paid slightly less but refunds the balance of the investment to a beneficiary if the annuity's owner dies within a specified time period -- say, 10 or 20 years. In addition, all annuities offer "survivor" options for partners.
Annuities like the one Ms. Jarvis considered are known as immediate annuities because the payments begin right away and continue for life. Those offered through traditional pension plans usually save people significant fees, because the plans tend to have lower administrative costs than companies that sell annuities on the open market. And traditional defined-benefit pension plans are insured by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation.
That is why actuaries do not consider these kinds of annuities investments but insurance against outliving your money. Still, many people think that annuities are risky because they think that if they die earlier than expected, they will "lose" their investment, according to Shaun O'Brien, the assistant director for public policy at the AFL-CIO. "There is this great fear that the day after they retire, they're going to get hit by a bus," Mr. O'Brien said. 
Until recently, Americans have generally been optimistic about their ability to invest better on their own than company pension funds can.
In addition, a quirk in the law has made lump sums slightly better deals. Congress has required companies to calculate how large a lump sum should be to match a given annuity schedule, on the assumption that the entire lump sum is invested in long-term government bonds. Because the interest rates of such bonds are at historic lows, the lump sums have to be higher to compensate. Many big companies have complained that, as a result, they end up overpaying on lump sums -- and that their pension funds are being drained.
Even so, advocates for the elderly worry that Americans do not fully appreciate what they are giving up by forgoing annuities. 
Lump-sum payments shift all the risk to the individual. Sometimes, people choose the lump sum unaware that their companies may subsidize the annuities of people who retire early, or that their retirement health benefits depend on their participating in a traditional pension plan. Ron Gebhardtsbauer, the senior pension fellow at the American Academy of Actuaries, said that a few years after choosing a lump-sum payment over an annuity, "A lot of people wish they hadn't done it." 
When making these decisions, it is a good idea to seek the advice of an expert who is neither your friend nor a financial adviser whose compensation will be affected by your choice, said Jack L. VanDerhei, a professor at the Fox School of Business and Management at Temple University in Philadelphia and an expert in risk management. Usually, he said, when people figure out the minimum amount of money they want to get every month for the rest of their lives, "most will see that they'll want an annuity."

HEADLINE: A Bounty at the Fair, Despite Expectations 

BYLINE:  By CAROL VOGEL 

DATELINE: MAASTRICHT, the Netherlands, March 17 

 BODY:
Between the likelihood of war and the depressed world financial markets, dealers at this year's European Fine Art Fair came here prepared for the worst. Many said openly that they arrived with scaled-down expectations and offerings. Yet visitors are still able to see a vast selection of what the market has to offer in nearly every collecting category from classical antiquities and old master paintings to contemporary art textiles, Oriental ceramics and 18th-century furniture. And there are a few spectacular items on view: a $15 million Bernini sculpture, a 19th-century diamond crown and a collection of imperial Mandarin hat buttons. 
 Still, there are far fewer blockbusters than in recent years. Not only are great works of art getting harder to find, but often when dealers do have something extraordinary, they tend to hide it away during bad economic times, afraid that if it doesn't sell, it will become overexposed and therefore less desirable. 
 "Dealers definitely seemed to be holding back this year," said Ian Kennedy, the curator of European painting and sculpture at the Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City, Mo. "A few years ago they came with only the best, but now they are afraid of getting burned if they don't sell." 
Traditionally this small Dutch city has been an annual mecca for serious collectors from all over the world. But officials here report that attendance at this, the world's largest art fair, will be down about 10 percent from last year. By the time the fair ends on Sunday, they estimate 68,000 people will have visited the Maastricht Exhibition and Congress Center. Noticeably absent are the large number of Americans who would have come in years past but are probably too afraid to travel right now. 
No threat of war or depressed stock market, though, could keep the truly serious collector and art lover away from Maastricht. "I came here feeling very pessimistic," said Jean-Luc Baroni, the London dealer specializing in old master paintings. "But so far things have been surprisingly good." Charles Beddington, another London old master dealer, said he was "expecting to read a newspaper for 10 days." Instead, he said, he has not had a moment to sit down because of the barrage of inquiries about paintings. But so far he has made no sales. 
Browsing among the paintings and objects was Steven Cohen, the Manhattan hedge fund manager who has been a big art buyer in recent years. Also spotted was Mark Fisch, a real estate developer from New Jersey who collects old master paintings. Martha Stewart came, too. 
"I'm looking at furniture designs to get inspiration for my own furniture line," said Ms. Stewart. Allegations of insider trading with the founder and former chairman of ImClone Systems, Samuel D. Waksal, has not seemed to diminish her appetite for art or antiques. "Many of my friends told me they weren't coming," Ms. Stewart said. "But life has to go on." 
This year it seemed many dealers brought works that relate to recent blockbuster museum exhibitions. On the entrance to the Marlborough Gallery's stand, for example, is a 1993 abstract painting by Gerhard Richter, whose retrospective at the Museum of Modern Art in New York last year piqued interest in his work. Nearby, at Waddington Galleries, there is a photograph by Thomas Struth, who is the subject of an exhibition that opened last month at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
Also at Waddington are several other artists who are the subjects of Paris shows. There is a painting by Nicholas de Stael, whose paintings are being exhibited at the Pompidou Center; a work by Magritte, who is having a retrospective at the Jeu de Paume; and two paintings by Picabia, whose work can be seen at the Museum of Modern Art there.
Julian Agnew, the London old master dealer, was thinking of the popular "Manet/Velazquez" exhibition that opened earlier this month at the Met when he chose what to bring to the fair. Prominently displayed in his booth is a portrait of the "Buffoon Juan Calabazas, After Velazquez, 1879." James Roundell, a director of Dickinson Roundell, whose galleries are in New York and London, has proclaimed this "the year of Vuillard." He is referring to the exhibition at the National Gallery of Art in Washington. Mr. Roundell has four Vuillards for sale. One of the best, "Interior at Night, the Hessels in their Dressing Room, Rue de Rivoli" from 1903, shows one of Vuillard's dealers, Jos Hessel, posed in a doorway while his wife, Lucy, is sewing. 
One area of the art market that has been especially popular recently is sculpture. Two terra cottas are standouts. Behind red ropes at the booth of Salander-O'Reilly Galleries, from Manhattan, is Bernini's model for the Fountain of the Moor, which is at the southern end of the Piazza Navona in Rome. It was bought at Sotheby's in London in July for $3.2 million. Without a signature, the auction house had said the sculpture, which depicts a river god with Moorish features struggling to hold a fish, had been attributed to Bernini. But now, with new scholarship, the asking price is $15 million. 
"It is the unanimous opinion of the Bernini scholars that it is by the artist," said Andrew Butterfield, a senior vice president of Salander-O'Reilly, who said that technical examinations had also indicated that the work was by the artist. Called the largest known Bernini terra cotta, it was made in 1653 as a presentation model for Pope Innocent X. 
Another terra cotta that is also getting a lot of attention is a bust of Voltaire from 1778 by Houdon. Made the year Voltaire died, the crisp details show him with a creased brow and just the trace of a smile. 
Old masters have always been one of the strongest areas in this fair. Among the best this year is a watercolor, "Crouching Cat," by Hans Hoffmann, at Hall & Knight. This circa 1578 work depicts a fierce-looking cat that looks as if it were about to leap out of its frame.
Mr. Baroni, meanwhile, is showing "Cleopatra" by the late-Renaissance master Il Cavalier d'Arpino; experts say it is one of the finest Italian pictures at the fair. 
One section of the fair that is constantly changing and strengthening is contemporary art. This season Sperone Westwater, the Chelsea gallery, is exhibiting for the first time. "We're pleased to be able to show newer work to this audience," said Angela Westwater, one of the gallery's owners. In addition to a wall of paintings by Lucio Fontana, this dealer also brought a selection of works by Richard Tuttle, Bruce Nauman and Susan Rothenberg.
In addition to the expected, people always come to Maastricht to find the unusual and the unexpected. This year, encased in glass showcase at S. J. Phillips, the London jeweler, visitors can see a diamond crown circa 1860 from an unidentified European princely family. At Ben Janssens Oriental Art, also from London, there are two exceptional Tang Dynasty sculptures: a limestone torso of a bodhisattva and a pottery figure of a girl seated on a stool. 
A wall of Italian 17th-century coral at Kunstkammer Georg Laue, a Munich dealer, has been so popular, Mr. Laue said, that he sold nearly half of them in the first two days of the show. And Linda Wrigglesworth, a London antique dealer specializing in Chinese textiles, is showing a collection of 19th-century Mandarin hat buttons.
"They represent the different ranks of the imperial court," Ms. Wrigglesworth said. "I have people who try to collect all the ranks. I've even got a client who puts them at her dinner table. She and her husband get the first rank, then she places the others depending on how she feels about each guest. It's a little cheeky, but it's their secret."

HEADLINE: 'Lost City' Yielding Its Secrets 

BYLINE:  By JOHN NOBLE WILFORD 

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN 

 BODY:
Working with new evidence and a trove of re-examined relics, many of them recovered from the basement of a Yale museum here, archaeologists have revised their thinking about the significance of Machu Picchu, the most famous "lost city" of the Incas.
 The new interpretation comes more than 90 years after the explorer Hiram Bingham III bushwhacked his way to a high ridge in the Andes of Peru and beheld a dreamscape out of the pre-Columbian past. 
 There, set against looming peaks cloaked in snow and wreathed in cloud, was Machu Picchu. Before his eyes, rising from the green undergrowth of neglect, were the imperial stones that have entranced and mystified visitors and scholars alike.
The expression "lost city," popularized by Bingham, was the magical elixir for rundown imaginations. The words evoked the romanticism of exploration and archaeology at the time, in the summer of 1911. And the lanky and vigorous Bingham seemed to personify the spirit that was driving discoveries of a forgotten past, the curiosity and courage to go seeking in remote places, as well as the hardihood to succeed. 
But finding Machu Picchu proved to be easier than solving the mystery of its place in the Inca empire, arguably the richest and most powerful in the New World when Europeans arrived. The imposing architecture attested to the skill and audacity of the Incas. But who had lived at this isolated site and for what purpose?
Bingham, a historian at Yale, advanced three hypotheses -- all of them dead wrong. A revival in research in recent years, experts say, has solved the mystery and, to a large degree, demystified Machu Picchu.
The spectacular site was not, as Bingham supposed, the traditional birthplace of the Inca people or the final stronghold of the Incas in their losing struggle against Spanish conquest in the 16th century. Nor was it a sacred spiritual center occupied by chosen women, the "virgins of the sun," and presided over by priests who worshiped the sun god.
Instead, Machu Picchu was one of many private estates of the emperor and, in particular, the favored country retreat for the royal family and Inca nobility. It was, archaeologists say, the Inca equivalent of Camp David, albeit on a much grander scale.
This interpretation and other new research inform a major exhibition at the Peabody Museum of Natural History at Yale. The show, "Machu Picchu: Unveiling the Mystery of the Incas," will be here until May 3. Then it is to travel to Los Angeles, Pittsburgh, Denver, Houston and Chicago.
Dr. Richard L. Burger, the director of the Peabody and a specialist in Inca archaeology, said the show, the largest on the Incas ever assembled in the United States, would "change the way people see Machu Picchu." Dr. Burger and Dr. Lucy C. Salazar, also an archaeologist, are co-curators of the exhibit.
"Bingham's work was very important in putting Inca archaeology on the map," said Dr. Burger, who is married to Dr. Salazar. "But we can now set aside all his ideas about the meaning of the Machu Picchu site."
The new interpretation, generally supported by other experts, is based largely on a study of 16th-century Spanish legal documents and a more detailed analysis of pottery, copper and bronze jewelry, tools, dwellings, skeletal remains and other material found in the ruins.
Many of the artifacts were themselves a forgotten treasure. Shipped back by Bingham, they were stashed in the museum basement, where they remained, still in their original boxes and wrapped in pages of The New York Times from the 1920's, until renewed interest in the Incas led scientists to poke into the stash. 
Until recently, there had not been much scholarly interest in Machu Picchu. Although the site has long been Peru's most popular tourist draw and a mecca for seekers of mystical and spiritual experiences, the haunting shellsof temples, palaces and other structures had ceased to attract many archaeologists.
"A lot of people felt it had become so much an icon for the Inca and Peru," said Dr. Craig Morris, a specialist in Peruvian archaeology at the American Museum of Natural History in Manhattan. "They became more interested in working in places not so well known."
Bingham's long shadow may also have discouraged research. In his three expeditions to Machu Picchu from 1911 to 1915, he established himself as the "discoverer" and foremost interpreter of the lost city. His 1930 book, "Machu Picchu: A Citadel of the Incas," endured as the definitive treatise on the site. His maps and photographs of the ruins were authoritative and evocative.
But he was untrained in archaeology and he did not conduct systematic excavations and rigorous analysis. "His excavation notes," Dr. Burger said, "included more on what they were eating than what they were finding."
Bingham eventually resigned his professorship at Yale to enter politics, becoming lieutenant governor and governor of Connecticut and a senator. But his influence on Inca research remained strong, in part because of his fervid writing style.
In "Lost City of the Incas," a best seller, he wrote: "Here, concealed in a canyon of remarkable grandeur, protected by nature and by the hand of man, the 'Virgins of the Sun' one by one passed away on this beautiful mountain top and left no descendants willing to reveal the importance or explain the significance of the ruins which crown the beetling precipices of Machu Picchu."
Archaeologists today forgive some of Bingham's lapses in excavation, but they have destroyed his theories.
For example, Dr. Salazar's exhaustive examination of pottery contradicted Bingham's speculation that Machu Picchu was somehow associated with the earliest Incas. All the pottery styles were 15th century. That and other evidence suggest that construction on the site began around 1450.
That was in the reign of Pachacuti, considered the Alexander the Great of the Incas. His creation, like the empire, had a relatively brief history. From the recovered pottery and Spanish documents, scholars estimate that the site was largely abandoned after only 80 years.
Plague, brought to the New World by Spaniards, had by then left the land in turmoil, and in 1532 the Spanish conquered Peru with little resistance. The few Incan holdouts, including the last emperor, capitulated in 1572 at a tropical valley refuge that bore no resemblance in Spanish descriptions to Machu Picchu. So much for another of Bingham's suppositions.
His theory about a sanctuary for virgins and priests began to unravel in 1990 with the publication of research by Dr. John Howland Rowe, an anthropologist at the University of California at Berkeley.
In archives at Cuzco, the former Inca capital, Dr. Rowe found a 16th-century suit filed by descendants of Pachacuti. They sought the return of family lands, including a retreat called Picchu. The finding sent Dr. Burger, a onetime student of Dr. Rowe, and Dr. Salazar back to Machu Picchu.
"We then felt this was a royal estate, a country palace," Dr. Burger recalled. "All Machu Picchu is a big palace, the emperor's residence across from the temple, the dwellings and workshops, everything spread out around a great plaza."
As early as the 1960's, Maria Rostworowski, an ethnohistorian in Lima, pointed out that Inca rulers had established a chain of royal estates through the region. They served as occasional royal residences, but mainly as administrative centers. Many of the estates were razed by Spanish soldiers searching for gold, and some were built over and modified beyond recognition. But remote Machu Picchu, at an elevation of 6,750 feet, survived unscathed. 
Dr. Susan A. Niles, an archaeologist at Lafayette College who is the author of "The Shape of Inca History," published in 1999, explained that it has long been known that the estates were peculiar to Inca royalty. Each ruler established his own and built a palace there as a monument to himself.
Each estate was the ruler's own private property, which was left to his family after death. The succeeding son could use the estates, but not own them. So he immediately began building his own monuments.
The estates, Dr. Niles said, were important centers for the economic management of agricultural lands, forests and mines in the surrounding region. That was presumably true, as well, of Machu Picchu.
Dr. Burger and Dr. Salazar agreed, but said little evidence had been found that ordinary administrative affairs were regularly conducted there. They emphasized the role of the site, 50 miles from Cuzco, as a country retreat for entertaining visiting dignitaries and for royal relaxation.
Though called a "lost city," it was not a true city. Probably no more than 750 people ever lived there at any given time, and in the rainy season the population dropped to just a few hundred. They were presumably the servants and artisans who attended to the royal family and their elite guests.
Bingham was not entirely wrong about the religious aspects of Machu Picchu. The buildings, ritual chambers, fountains and gardens, Dr. Salazar said, seemed to be arranged with Incan cosmology in mind. Rulers were believed to be descended from the sun, and wherever they went was sacred. Pachacuti, in particular, was looked upon as a creator god.
New investigations turned up bones of animals probably sacrificed in religious ceremonies. And there were dozens of obsidian pebbles, which scientific analysis showed had come from a revered volcano more than 200 miles away. The obsidian had never been modified for use as cutting tools. It is likely, Dr. Burger said, the obsidian had symbolic meaning. The Incas worshiped high mountains as the source of supernatural forces. 
But Bingham had gone too far with his "virgins of the sun" hypothesis, experts say. He was misled by the findings of the party's osteologist, who reported that most of the skeletons buried at the site were those of women.
In new studies, Dr. John W. Verano, a physical anthropologist at Tulane University, determined that the ratio of female to male skeletons was comparatively even. His research also showed that many families and newborn infants lived there, not what one would expect in a community of virgins.
All the burials at the site were simple, with only modest grave goods. These were the remains of the retainers rather than royalty.
"This mortuary pattern," Dr. Burger said, "is not surprising, because if members of the Inca elite had died while residing at the country palace, they would have been transported to their principal residence in Cuzco rather than being buried at Machu Picchu."
Life at the country retreat must have been reasonably healthy. An analysis of bones showed that the workers apparently ate well. There were cases of tuberculosis and parasites, as well as considerable tooth decay from the corn diets. But nearly all the burials were of adults, including quite a few who were older than 50, an advanced age in that day.
The workers were brought from all over the empire, Dr. Verano concluded. The ethnic diversity was seen in the shapes of skulls, which had been deformed through binding in infancy. Different cultures over a wide geographic range had distinctive cranial deformations. Some came from the coast, and others from the highlands and as far away as Lake Titicaca.
Investigations by Dr. Alfredo Valencia Zegarra, a Peruvian archaeologist, and Kenneth Wright, a hydrological engineer from Boulder, Colo., have uncovered the magnitude of Machu Picchu as an engineering achievement. The Incas had not only terraced the slopes for agriculture, hauling up fine sand and topsoil from the valley and erecting stone retaining walls that have survived more than 500 years. But they had also taken an uneven ridge surface and transformed it to the flat mesalike surface seen today.
Before any of the buildings rose, the Incas leveled the site with loose rock and other fill, stabilizing it with immense walls deep beneath the surface. Mr. Wright estimates that the invisible subsurface construction constitutes some 60 percent of the effort invested in building Machu Picchu.
Whatever Pachacuti, the empire builder, had in mind, Dr. Salazar said, Machu Picchu "shows what the New World had achieved before the Spanish arrived." Some of the engineering and architecture was better than in Seville, she noted, and the Spanish "could not believe how people, people without writing, could have built something like this."
Archaeologists today may have demystified the lofty ruins, but their awe remains undiminished.
Dr. Niles of Lafayette College said the "overpowering landscape alone may be why Pachacuti chose the place for what his legacy to the world should be."
Conceding that he was biased, Dr. Morris of the Natural History Museum said that Machu Picchu "is to me the most spectacular archaeological site in the world."

HEADLINE: Some Companies Quietly Profit From War Fever 

BYLINE:  By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH 

 BODY:
American businesses have not been waiting for this week's moving- target deadlines to prepare for war. Many are already figuring out how to profit from events -- all the while taking pains not to look as though they are profiteering. 
 When the sales staff of the Candlewood Suites hotel in Yorktown, Va., heard that the army was calling up reservists, they immediately visited nearby Fort Eustis to remind the officers that Candlewood puts up military personnel at their per diem rate, or less. It was a good business move: 40 of the hotel's 59 rooms are now occupied by reservists. 
 At 30 Minute Photos Etc., an Irvine, Calif., photo retailer, there is Operation Photo, a Web site where military personnel overseas can upload files of pictures and designate a stateside friend or relative to whom prints should be shipped. The store, which usually charges 32 cents for a digital print, is offering them at 29 cents. Mitchell Goldstone, its owner, said that business was brisk.
Many companies are taking a push rather than a pull approach. Consultants are offering for-fee advice on preparing for emergencies and telecommunications companies are reminding customers about the need for wireless communications systems, while operators of backup data sites are reminding clients of the importance of maintaining duplicate records at remote locations.
But in stark contrast to the months after Sept. 11, American companies are not clamoring desperately for help. Having already responded to the attack on the World Trade Center -- and continuing terrorism alerts since then -- by bolstering security systems, backing up data, and setting up contingency plans for employees, they do not feel particularly vulnerable now. 
But the fact is, reservists need rooms and families need reassurance. And in this sluggish economy, some companies will readily use war talk to jump-start sales. 
Revenues have been flat at best at most of the 108 hotels that make up the Candlewood Suites chain. Yet government business is up 23 percent in the last six months, compared with last year. 
"If we have war, some of our reservists may be shipped overseas, and if we don't have war, many of them may go home," said Mike Atkins, the strategic sales director of the chain, which is based in Wichita, Kan. "But uncertainty about war is excellent for our business." 
Such uncertainty can affect the timing of sales as well. Lawyers at Paul, Hastings, Janofsky & Walker were helping FairPoint Communications structure a financing deal, scheduled for completion in late March, when they realized that a war could put a lot of financial transactions in abeyance. They, along with the client and the bankers, worked round the clock: the deal was completed last week -- and the fees hit the lawyer's coffers a month early. The firm has similarly accelerated a lot of other deals. 
"It's pushed revenue into the first quarter that otherwise may not have come until later in the year," said William F. Schwitter, chairman of the firm's corporate department, who said that until the prospect of war went away, the firm would focus on practices not directly tied to financial markets.
Except for those trying to capitalize on the war, few companies seem to be taking extraordinary measures to prepare for the conflict. The prevailing feeling seems to echo that of a Procter & Gamble spokeswoman: "The looming war has not impacted our business, and based on experience with the gulf war, we don't anticipate disruptions." 
Procter and other companies are not playing ostrich. Many are trying to be sensitive -- Pitney Bowes, for example, inserted "war clauses" into its advertising contracts so that it could, without penalty, pull humorous ads that might seem inappropriate if war broke out. Others, like Bain & Company, the big consulting firm whose employees are constantly traveling, have provided employees with Tips for Travelers checklists reminding them of the protective steps they must take when traveling. 
And companies that are heavily dependent on oil and gas are seeking alternative suppliers, trying to renegotiate short-term contracts and otherwise looking for ways to counteract rising prices. 
"Because of energy costs, the threat of war has already affected our business dramatically," said Robert S. Miller Jr., chief executive of the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.
The sluggish economy, conversely, has made the potential loss of employees to active duty less troubling than it would be if business were booming. Many companies plan to keep called-up reservists on the payroll for at least six months, and many -- Albertson's, the supermarket chain, is one example -- have set up hot lines for family members to inquire about benefits. The Citizens Financial Group is even offering a week'spaid leave and travel expenses for any employee whose spouse, domestic partner or child is called to service. 
Few worry about any drain of brain or brawn -- either real, or perceived by shareholders. Gerard Meuchner, a spokesman for Eastman Kodak, said Kodak had about a dozen employees on active duty. "But none of them are senior managers," he said. "Their work wouldn't ring a bell with Wall Street."
In fact, even the prospect of a retaliatory terrorist strike linked to hostilities in Iraq has not appreciably heightened the degree of corporate angst. One reason is that many companies feel amply prepared already. 
"We're all dusting off the business-resumption plans we put into place after 9/11," said Christa Carone, a spokeswoman for Xerox.
Pitney Bowes, for example, is moving much of its backup data to sites that are far from any urban areas. It began looking for such sites right after 9/11. "Our moves are driven by the longer-term issues of terrorism, not the short-term threat of war," said Michael J. Critelli, Pitney's chairman. So are the moves of SBC Communications, the telecommunications company: Tom Pagano, an SBC spokesman, noted that SBC's emergency response plans were devised around the color-coded Homeland Security alerts.
Those companies with customers decimated by Sept. 11 quickly learned to have contingency plans on hand -- and to broaden their markets to keep from relying on a sector that is too vulnerable to war. 
IManage, a Foster City, Calif., business software company, is a perfect example. After the terrorist attacks, it made sure its employees could work with clients from home, and that it had employees in dispersed locations who could backstop each other on projects. It also stopped concentrating solely on manufacturing clients, and pursued financial services firms, government offices and professionals. 
"We figure in the case of war at least one or two sectors will stay healthy," said Laura Heisman, an iManage spokeswoman.
Nonetheless, sellers of health and safety products are gamely pushing products they mistakenly figured would be slam-dunks last year. Then, they pushed them as balm for Osama bin Laden-induced fears; now, they suggest that the products can guard against retaliation for an attack on Baghdad.
"The post-9/11 customers were more focused on business continuity and facilities security," said Robert I. Thompson, chief executive of Complient, which designs and runs emergency response programs. "Since war talk started, they are a lot more willing to discuss emergency preparedness issues."

HEADLINE: Fashion Tries to Smile on the Outside; 
Not Your Mother's Miniskirt

BYLINE:  By CATHY HORYN 

 BODY:
Facing a cruel economy and the likelihood of war, fashion designers were emphasizing beauty and optimism at the fall 2003 collections. What else could they do? Here's a look at some of the top trends. 
 BEFORE you fall down laughing at the thought of wearing miniskirts with white tights and pointy flats, which is exactly how Marc Jacobs showed them last month in New York, bear in mind that fashion isn't stuck on hemlines. Longer lengths prevailed at Carolina Herrera and Narciso Rodriguez, with belted or nipped waists. And while designers showed more skirts than pants, boyish trousers still look right. Leggings are back, too. 
 What makes the mini look fresh is a change of proportions. Several designers, including Nicolas Ghesquiere of Balenciaga, balanced a teacup skirt with a taut sweater under a shrunken bolero, creating a layered effect. At Chanel, Karl Lagerfeld came up with a kind of demilegging -- skintight leather leg warmers that zip from the ankle to just above the knee, leaving you less exposed. Other designers showed thigh-high boots.
Even before the collections started, Bloomingdale's took reorders on miniskirts for spring, suggesting that women are ready for a change. Although some of the shows seemed to be drenched in 1960's references, retailers say that the miniskirt's return has more to do with current attitudes about the female body than creepy nostalgia. 
"Miniskirts and leggings emphasize the leg, just as short jackets emphasize the waist, and pleating and bows are about prettiness," said Julie Gilhart, the fashion director of Barneys New York. "It all relates to being more beautiful."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE GROUND -- In Princeton, N.J.; 
Flourishing Between Philadelphia And Newark

BYLINE:  By PATRICIA R. OLSEN 

 BODY:
The 2001 Oscar-winning movie "A Beautiful Mind," filmed on the Princeton University campus, may be great publicity, but the area does not need promoting. The university attracts 500,000 visitors and adds $1.1 billion to the local economy each year.
 The Center for Photonic and Optoelectronic Materials at Princeton has stimulated economic growth by joining up with more than 150 New Jersey companies, and the university manages the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory for the Defense Department. During the 2001-2 academic year alone, the United States Patent Office issued 45 patents for inventions from Princeton. 
 The nearby Route 1 corridor, extending from New Brunswick to Trenton, is a hotbed of biotechnology, pharmaceutical and financial companies, including Cytogen, Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merrill Lynch. Princeton is also home of the Educational Testing Service. Numerous office parks like the mixed-use Forrestal Center have sprouted along this route over the years. And with Manex Entertainment, a California movie-production company that is negotiating to build an office in nearby Trenton, another industry is establishing a presence in the area.

AIRPORT
It is a tossup whether to fly into Philadelphia International or Newark Liberty International Airport, both of which are in the middle of redevelopment projects. Aubrey Haines, a commercial real estate broker who owns Mercer Oak Realty in Mount Laurel, N.J., tells clients that while the distance on Interstate 95 from Philadelphia may be shorter than taking the New Jersey Turnpike from Newark, the tie-ups on I-95 can be unbelievable.
If you are facing a long wait at Philadelphia, at least you'll have decent dining; the food and beverage concessions have won awards two years running.
Timothy Fidler, an executive at Wyeth in Madison, N.J., who gives seminars in Princeton and frequently travels overseas, said that while people leaving the Newark airport face the usual frustrations, returning from overseas is "a joy."
"Customs is great, and they're adequately staffed" he said. But he is constantly on the alert for thieves, to the point that when a woman recently cut in front of him at a checkpoint, he shouted to the security agent on the other side to grab his laptop as it came through.
If you travel by rail from either airport to the Princeton Junction train station, a three-mile ride on the famous "dinky" shuttle train will take you to the campus.

HOTELS
David Knights, director of marketing at Picus Associates, a real estate consulting firm in Plainsboro, N.J., says the DORAL FORRESTAL CONFERENCE CENTER AND SPA (609-452-7800, from $159) "wins loyalty from business travelers." When it was built in 1981, it was considered a model for conference centers, Mr. Knights said. In addition to the high-end meeting facilities and the spa, the center's 25 acres include a track and four indoor tennis courts. Companies usually buy a conference package.
If you want to walk to your lodgings from the Princeton campus, the NASSAU INN (609-921-7500, corporate rate $199) is right across the street. It has a cardio-fitness room and delivers chocolate chip cookies to guests every night.

RESTAURANTS
Mr. Haines said his "office away from the office" and an ideal place to take clients is LAHIERE'S (609-921-2798, $50 for lunch for two and $110 for dinner for two, including wine and tip). He says he once laid the foundation for a $100 million real estate deal over a meal there.
Eric Hamblin, director of Princeton's Center for Visitors and Conference Services, likes the buffet lunch at the DORAL (609-452-7800, $16.95 a person).
For a quick bite, he recommends HOAGIE HAVEN (609-921-7723), a Princeton landmark that is "easily No. 1 among students and locals."

ON YOUR OWN
THE SARNOFF CORPORATION has an exhibit hall featuring such technological treasures as a working model of the first RCA color television set (call 609-734-2636 for a guided tour). PRINCETON UNIVERSITY has lectures open to the public, and the PRINCETON PLASMA PHYSICS LABORATORY (609-243-2750), on the Forrestal campus, offers tours.
You don't have to be a technology buff to appreciate a walk around the Princeton University campus. The art museum and chapel are musts, or take the tour offered to prospective students (609-258-1766).

NIGHT LIFE
The McCARTER THEATER (609-258-2787), the Tony-award-winning cultural center, has performances that range from Shakespeare to music, dance and special exhibits. Depending on the season, sports aficionados can take in a TRENTON TITANS hockey game (609-599-9500), a TRENTON THUNDER baseball game (609-394-3300) or a Princeton University football, basketball or ice hockey game (609-258-3538).
For a drink after work, Mr. Haines describes the MEDITERRA (609-252-9680) as "the Cheers of Princeton" and a great spot to relax with clients. The YANKEE DOODLE TAP ROOM in the Nassau Inn has jazz on Thursdays and rock on Fridays and Saturdays.

HEADLINE: Wal-Mart Says Sales to Meet Forecast 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: BENTONVILLE, Ark., March 17 

 BODY:
Wal-Mart Stores Inc. said today that demand for spring merchandise and food was helping March sales to rise within its forecast, while the J. C. Penney Company said sales at its department stores were falling more than planned. 
 Wal-Mart, which is based in Bentonville, expected sales at stores open at least a year to rise a "low-single-digit percentage" this month, it said in a weekly recorded update. 
 J. C. Penney, based in Plano, Tex., had forecast little change to a slight decline. Federated Department Stores Inc., said same-store sales were falling as expected. 
Shoppers bought lawn and garden items as temperatures turned warmer last week, Wal-Mart said. The company also sold more pet supplies, over-the-counter medicines and groceries. Chains like Federated, which is based in Cincinnati, and J. C. Penney, which focus on clothing, cosmetics and linens, fared worse than discounters as people pared spending amid concerns about the economy and a possible war with Iraq. 
Federated, the owner of Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Lazarus stores, said on a recorded call that same-store sales were within its forecast for a decrease of as much as 4 percent this month.

Will U.S. Relax Antitrust Rules?
For months, executives of major airlines have been hinting that in the event of a long war in the Middle East, airlines may need to find a way to coordinate routes and schedules to keep the air-transportation system operating efficiently enough to provide basic service, especially to smaller cities that will be the first to lose flights. War would cause an immediate and perhaps severe constriction of schedules, the airlines have said. 
 In normal times, collaboration would be a blatant violation of antitrust laws. After huge flight delays in the summer of 2000, the airlines and the federal government discussed the idea of a temporary dispensation from antitrust proscriptions to adjust schedules in bad weather, but the matter was never resolved. 
 Will the idea come up again? Possibly, airline executives say privately. But it will come about only if the federal government actually initiates it, perhaps in what James C. May, the president of the Air Transport Association, referred to last week as a possible "forced nationalization" of the domestic airline industry.
In a report, the trade association -- which has been lobbying hard for financial relief to reduce the airlines' security costs and taxes -- predicted extensive economic damage to an already staggered industry. Depending on the length of a war, 2,200 to 3,800 daily flights could disappear, along with as many as 98,000 more jobs, on top of the 100,000 jobs lost in the industry since 2001.
Nationalization "could well involve creating a plan, for example, to assure that there's essential air service to medium and small communities because those are the first places that are going to be hit when the industry economizes as a result of the economic impact of hostilities," Mr. May said in a news conference last week.

Congress to Review Screening Plan
Congress is planning to have a closer look at the recently announced plan to screen airline passengers by checking their records in credit, criminal and other commercially available databases. The so-called computer assisted passenger prescreening system, called Capps, has come under heavy criticism from privacy groups and airline travelers' organizations since the federal government said this month that it would begin testing with Delta Air Lines in three undisclosed airports.
Last week, the Senate Commerce Committee voted to increase oversight of the system, which is being designed by the Transportation Security Administration under a contract with Lockheed Martin. It said it wanted a full report from the T.S.A. within 90 days. JOE SHARKEY

Saudis Stock Oil ReserveTo Make Up for Iraq Loss

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Saudi Arabia has amassed a reserve of nearly 50 million barrels of oil that it plans to use to compensate for possible disruptions of Iraqi oil exports if war erupts, according to a senior Saudi official and industry experts who have been told about the supply buildup.
 "We have about 50 million barrels, most of it in the country," said the Saudi official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "We can tap into it immediately once there is a shortfall." 
 The Saudi stockpile has been built up over the last three months as oil prices have climbed near their highest levels in years. Calls have increased from various political quarters for the Bush administration to release oil from the United States Strategic Petroleum Reserve, which holds 600 million barrels of oil. So far, the administration has said it will let the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries try to make up for any disruptions before tapping the strategic reserve. OPEC is led in effect by Saudi Arabia, the only country with spare production capacity that can be called on in case of supply disruptions. 
"We will make sure there is enough oil in the market," the Saudi oil minister, Ali al-Naimi, said in a statement. "We have plenty of spare capacity."
In New York yesterday, the price of crude oil for April delivery settled at $34.93 a barrel, down 45 cents, on profit taking by traders. During the day, oil traded from $34 to $36.95 a barrel.
Industry analysts said Saudi Arabia probably felt compelled to increase production to back up assertions it has long made that it can take care of problems that buffet oil markets.
"It is in the Saudis' interest to produce oil and store some of it away, and the cumulative effect of that is a substantial reserve," said Lawrence J, Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "The Saudis know that sustained high prices weaken economic activity, decrease demand and encourage non-OPEC production. They want to see a predictable, stable oil supply."
Iraq has been exporting about 1.5 million barrels a day. The cushion the Saudis have built into their system could make up for about a month's disruption of those exports, although Saudi Arabia does not plan to draw down all 50 million barrels, the Saudi official said.
"The United States consumes about one million barrels a day of Iraqi crude," said Yasser Elguindi, a managing director at Medley Global Advisers, a New York consulting firm. "So I don't think it's by accident that the Saudis have these numbers."
A representative of the Saudi oil ministry declined to comment on the reserve. The Saudi official said that he had told members of Congress about the oil pool and that "the U.S. governmentis certainly aware of this."
"Our oil people have been talking to the National Security Council," he added.
But he said that Saudi Arabia took this step on its own, without arm-twisting by the White House. "You look around and make plans based on different scenarios," he said. "What if there is a war? So you increase capacity. But how do you tap into reserves immediately? You want to make sure that if there are disruptions, the oil markets are covered. The administration didn't say, 'Gee, guys, can you do this for us?' " 
A White House spokesman declined to comment last night. 
Saudi Arabia is producing about 9 million barrels a day, the official said, or about 1.5 million more than its OPEC quota. The Saudis have about 1.5 million barrels of additional production capacity that they can bring on in less than several weeks, if the need arises, he said. Independent experts have estimated that Saudi Arabia is producing 9.2 million to 9.5 million barrels a day, with an additional one million barrels that can be called upon.
The Saudis have stored nearly all their reserve within their borders, the official said, rather than in installations they have in the Caribbean, Europe and the Far East. Saudi Arabia increased production when a general strike in Venezuela reduced exports from there to a trickle. But prices for oil have climbed so high that foreign companies are buying only enough Saudi oil for their immediate refining needs, not to build supplies, Mr. Elguindi said. 
Rather than reduce output, the Saudis have continued to increase and store what has not been bought. Oil that would be shipped from Iraq at this point would reach the United States in about 40 days, and any Saudi oil sent to make up for disruptions would take the same amount of time. "Rather than going to Mina al Bakr, more tankers will come to Ras Tanura," the Saudi official said, referring respectively to an Iraqi oil terminal and Saudi Arabia's largest oil port. "But we're not going to paint the barrels yellow and say, 'This is part of the 50 million barrels.' "
The Saudi official warned that despite the reserve and the prospect of OPEC and others producing all out, such preparations would not be enough to fully protect world oil markets from volatility. 
"You're not going to have any slack whatsoever in the system if there is a setback in Venezuela, or a strike in Nigeria or damage to Kuwaiti oil fields, or if Saddam blows up his fields," he said. "From the point of view of oil, the timing of this war is just horrible."

HEADLINE: Things to Come 

BYLINE:  By PAUL KRUGMAN; E-mail: krugman@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Of course we'll win on the battlefield, probably with ease. I'm not a military expert, but I can do the numbers: the most recent U.S. military budget was $400 billion, while Iraq spent only $1.4 billion.
 What frightens me is the aftermath -- and I'm not just talking about the problems of postwar occupation. I'm worried about what will happen beyond Iraq -- in the world at large, and here at home. 
 The members of the Bush team don't seem bothered by the enormous ill will they have generated in the rest of the world. They seem to believe that other countries will change their minds once they see cheering Iraqis welcome our troops, or that our bombs will shock and awe the whole world (not just the Iraqis) or that what the world thinks doesn't matter. They're wrong on all counts.
Victory in Iraq won't end the world's distrust of the United States because the Bush administration has made it clear, over and over again, that it doesn't play by the rules. Remember: this administration told Europe to take a hike on global warming, told Russia to take a hike on missile defense, told developing countries to take a hike on trade in lifesaving pharmaceuticals, told Mexico to take a hike on immigration, mortally insulted the Turks and pulled out of the International Criminal Court -- all in just two years.
Nor, as we've just seen, is military power a substitute for trust. Apparently the Bush administration thought it could bully the U.N. Security Council into going along with its plans; it learned otherwise. "What can the Americans do to us?" one African official asked. "Are they going to bomb us? Invade us?"
Meanwhile, consider this: we need $400 billion a year of foreign investment to cover our trade deficit, or the dollar will plunge and our surging budget deficit will become much harder to finance -- and there are already signs that the flow of foreign investment is drying up, just when it seems that America may be about to fight a whole series of wars. 
It's a matter of public record that this war with Iraq is largely the brainchild of a group of neoconservative intellectuals, who view it as a pilot project. In August a British official close to the Bush team told Newsweek: "Everyone wants to go to Baghdad. Real men want to go to Tehran." In February 2003, according to Ha'aretz, an Israeli newspaper, Under Secretary of State John Bolton told Israeli officials that after defeating Iraq the United States would "deal with" Iran, Syria and North Korea.
Will Iraq really be the first of many? It seems all too likely -- and not only because the "Bush doctrine" seems to call for a series of wars. Regimes that have been targeted, or think they may have been targeted, aren't likely to sit quietly and wait their turn: they're going to arm themselves to the teeth, and perhaps strike first. People who really know what they are talking about have the heebie-jeebies over North Korea's nuclear program, and view war on the Korean peninsula as something that could happen at any moment. And at the rate things are going, it seems we will fight that war, or the war with Iran, or both at once, all by ourselves.
What scares me most, however, is the home front. Look at how this war happened. There is a case for getting tough with Iraq; bear in mind that an exasperated Clinton administration considered a bombing campaign in 1998. But it's not a case that the Bush administration ever made. Instead we got assertions about a nuclear program that turned out to be based on flawed or faked evidence; we got assertions about a link to Al Qaeda that people inside the intelligence services regard as nonsense. Yet those serial embarrassments went almost unreported by our domestic news media. So most Americans have no idea why the rest of the world doesn't trust the Bush administration's motives. And once the shooting starts, the already loud chorus that denounces any criticism as unpatriotic will become deafening. 
So now the administration knows that it can make unsubstantiated claims, without paying a price when those claims prove false, and that saber rattling gains it votes and silences opposition. Maybe it will honorably refuse to act on this dangerous knowledge. But I can't help worrying that in domestic politics, as in foreign policy, this war will turn out to have been the shape of things to come.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL: ON THE ROAD; 
Bringing Private Order to a Chaotic Sky

BYLINE:  By Joe Sharkey 

DATELINE: CHICAGO 

 BODY:
FACED with an expected last-minute trip, I went onto Orbitz .com to check fares. They were crazy, as usual.
 Some examples: American, Continental and United all had reasonable walk-up, round-trip fares of about $460, nonstop from Newark to Chicago's O'Hare. Yet America also had a fare, same day, Newark to O'Hare, for a curious $1,199 -- with a stop in Raleigh-Durham, N.C. 
 Already jet lagged from a weekend trip to London, I wasn't looking forward to the airport experience in either Newark or O'Hare, let alone the grim warrens of Raleigh-Durham. Then I remembered the name Indigo, a corporate-jet service that began operating two weeks ago between Teterboro, a private airport in New Jersey that handles a lot of business jets, and Midway, Chicago's secondary airport. So I called and asked the price.
"We have an introductory half-price offer, $749 round trip," the Indigo agent replied.
"Sign me up," I said.
The next morning, a half-hour before departure time, I parked my car (free) outside Indigo's lounge at a small private terminal at Teterboro. The plane, a sleek new Embraer ERJ 135, waited just outside the terminal as the pilot himself checked the identifications and carry-on bags of the four passengers.
"Everybody's here," the pilot said, glancing over the manifest.
"Let's go, then," suggested William P. Kostel Jr., Indigo's vice president for marketing. We took off 10 minutes early and arrived at Midway in time for me to get on the El, head into the Loop for a quick early afternoon meeting and head back to the airport for the trip home.
Over the years, I've been inside most current models of corporate jets, from the light-cabin Cessna Citation Bravos to the bowling-alley expanses of the luxury Boeing Business Jets, which are basically 737's with most of the seats out and a bedroom in the back. Likewise, an 86-foot-long Embraer ERJ 135 is usually crammed with 37 seats for use as a regional jet. But outfitted as a corporate jet, with 16 plush leather seats set one on each side of the aisle, it offers a whole different travel experience.
But as a business model, will it fly?
Indigo, based in Chicago, originally began service in 2000 with a fleet of older Falcon 20 aircraft that proved to be too high-maintenance to suit the business model, said Peter A. Pappas, the chief executive. The airline ceased operations while raising cash to buy the new Embraer jets, with 2 of them now in service and 23 more on firm order.
Right now, service is limited to the Teterboro-Midway route (the round-trip fare for that will be $1,498 after the half-price offer ends on March 31). In April, the company expects to take delivery of a third jet and start daily flights between Westchester and Midway. As new planes come in, point-to-point routes will be expanded nationally.
Indigo is officially designated as a corporate charter service that also sells individual seats to anyone who wants to book one. The distinction is tricky. Community groups living near private airports like Teterboro in densely populated areas tend to be vigilant about expansion into scheduled commercial airline service. At Teterboro, such groups are seeking to block Indigo's operations.
Recently, bigger airline companies have also adopted the idea of offering premium service on business jets -- most notably Lufthansa, which flies 48-seat business jets between Newark and Munich and Dusseldorf and will add Chicago-Dusseldorf service this spring.
Indigo is positioned to use private airport terminals, including the one where its headquarters are at Midway. Private terminals allow passengers to avoid long lines and "security hassles," Mr. Pappas said. Indigo's fares will be about the same as those of commercial airlines' walk-up, refundable economy seats -- the so-called Y fare.
In his office in Chicago, Mr. Pappas said that he had just pitched the concept to a travel manager for a major international company. "When I got to the pricing part of the presentation, I explained to her that we're offering the private-jet experience at a price that compares to the full economy fare," he said. "She sat back and said, 'I thought you were going to tell me that your fares compared to commercial first-class fares' " -- which, Mr. Pappas noted, many companies prohibit for use by travelers on domestic flights.
Indigo also is marketing its service to the growing number of companies that own fractional shares in corporate jets. Under fractional deals, mileage on corporate jets is limited to a fixed amount annually.
"We're seeing people who own a fractional share and don't want to burn their miles on a trip between New York and Chicago, say," Mr. Pappas said. "But these people have become accustomed to work space and time convenience of the private jet, and we think Indigo makes sense for them."
Well, that's the pitch, and we'll see. The big expansion of fractional-share private-jet services in recent years shows, though, that a segment of the heavy-duty business travel market has come to despair at the steadily deteriorating service and worsening accommodations of the financially distressed commercial airlines, and to be willing to pay a premium for something better.
On my late-afternoon return trip from Midway, I spoke with such a business traveler, Anastasia Valentine, a director of Resource 1, a software consulting company based near Chicago. She was already a convert.
"When I found out at 2 p.m. that I was needed in New York, I was quickly scheduled" on the Indigo 5:10 p.m. flight out of Midway, she said.
She said she drove home from her office near Chicago, packed a bag and "had a solid hour" with her husband and 14-month-old son before she headed to Midway. "I pulled up at the hangar at 4:50 p.m., parked my car 10 feet from the door," and was in the air for 20 minutes later, "calm and relaxed" and "mentally and physically prepared to conduct business," she said.

StockPrices Rise as War In Iraq Appears Inevitable

BYLINE:  By ALEX BERENSON 

 BODY:
After months of uncertainty, investors reacted with relief yesterday to the news that the White House had dropped its sputtering diplomatic efforts and appeared to be preparing for war with Iraq.
 While investors are not looking forward to a war -- and many workers on Wall Street think that they are likely targets for terrorist reprisals -- the news stripped away the cloud of doubt that has hung over stocks since the Iraqi dispute deepened last fall, strategists and money managers said. 
 Stock prices rallied strongly yesterday for the second time in three trading days, punctuating a warm spell in New York that has followed a winter of terror alerts, job cuts at major investment banks, skyrocketing oil prices and miserable weather. Investors appeared to be responding to progress toward war and the rising hope that the conflict would be brief. 
The last gulf war resulted in a quick, decisive victory for the United States, lower oil prices and a strong rally in stocks. Investors appear to believe that even if this war is not quite as successful, it will be better than seemingly endless wrangling over whether to continue inspections for weapons of mass destruction.
"What Wall Street really fears is uncertainty," said Jack Caffrey, equity strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, which oversees $250 billion in assets. "What today's events seem to be pointing to is a reduction in uncertainty, even if the outcome of that is not necessarily a good thing."
After falling slightly when they opened for trading, stocks rose strongly throughout the day. By day's end, all the major market indexes had gained more than 3 percent, their second strong gain since Thursday, when the White House began to signal that it would move away from its faltering diplomatic efforts.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index closed the day up 29.52 points, or 3.5 percent, to 862.79, and the Nasdaq composite jumped 51.94 points, or 3.9 percent, to 1,392.27. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 282.21 points, or 3.6 percent, to 8,141.92. Since Thursday, the Dow has gained almost 600 points.
The rally was extremely broad, on very heavy trading volume. Seven stocks rose on the New York Stock Exchange for every two that fell. Market indexes in Europe also gained, rising more than 3 percent.
In commodities trading, the price of crude oil fell, as traders bet that any war would be swift and would not disrupt the flow of oil from the Persian Gulf. The price of oil for April delivery fell 45 cents a barrel, or 1.3 percent, to $34.93, in regular trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange. In electronic trading after the exchange closed, oil fell another 2.5 percent, to $34.05. Since peaking last week at $37.83 a barrel, oil has fallen 10 percent.
Bond prices also fell, and yields, which had recently dropped to their lowest levels in more than four decades, rose. Money managers said the move reflected confidence that any war would be relatively smooth and would clear the way for stronger economic growth. Strong growth is generally considered bad for bonds because it raises the risk of inflation, and high inflation lowers the value of bonds over time.
The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to 4.80 percent, from 4.71 percent, while the yield on the 10-year note rose to 3.83 percent, from 3.70 percent. The yield on the two-year note rose to 1.63 percent, from 1.54 percent.
Gold, which is seen as a hedge against uncertainty, soared in early trading but ended the day flat.
"There's been an element, I think if you talk to Wall Street and most investors, of, 'We're going to go to war, let's go to war and let's do it,' " said Tobias Levkovich, equity strategist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Mr. Levkovich, whose offices are in Manhattan, said he thought that people in the financial services industry had accepted that they would have to live with the risk of terrorism. Only a catastrophic attack, like that on Sept. 11, would shake them, he said.
"People are resigned to it," Mr. Levkovich said.
Richard DeKaser, chief economist with the National City Corporation, said he thought the rally had just begun. "The bottom line is if it's war-related uncertainties that have been hammering the market, eliminating those uncertainties will give it a rebound," Mr. DeKaser said. "It's got legs and a long way to go, in my opinion."
Other investors were less optimistic.
Even if the war goes well, the rally may sputter as investors realize that the economy remains weak and expectations for corporate profits are too high, said Brian Belski, fundamental market strategist at Piper Jaffray, a regional investment bank based in Minneapolis.
"The fundamentals underlying the market are still rather ambiguous," Mr. Belski said. "Is the new bull market starting today? And the answer to that is no."
William H. Gross, who oversees $300 billion in bond investments for Pacific Investment Management, also said he doubted that the gains were sustainable. "What's going on today, and what's gone on the last few days," he said, "is simply some front-running of the anticipation that the war will begin and go well and return to the status quo."
Mr. Gross said that a quick war would not cure the overcapacity, weak corporate profits and soft labor market that ail the economy.
"If the war goes well, and if the economy catches a bit, it won't be strong, and six months later we'll be back in the same slow-growth soup that we are right now," Mr. Gross said. In addition, he said, investors seemed to be ignoring the cost of the war and of reconstructing Iraq.
"I think we're looking at deficits of $400, $500 billion as far as the eye can see, and that ultimately means higher inflation, higher interest rates."
Mr. Gross has been outspoken in his belief that a pre-emptive invasion of Iraq carries great risks for the United States. But he said that his concerns about the economy were not connected to his distaste for a war.
"My personal feelings," he said, "are separate from the business of managing money."

HEADLINE: Big Credit Default Rate Forces Spiegel Bankruptcy Filing 

BYLINE:  By TRACIE ROZHON 

 BODY:
In 1871, the Great Chicago Fire destroyed the first Spiegel furniture warehouse, but by 1885, business was racing along again, and the founder, Joseph Spiegel, started offering credit to his customers under the slogan: "We Trust the People."
 Yesterday, the Spiegel Group -- which owns the famous Spiegel catalog, Eddie Bauer and Newport News, another direct-mail clothing business -- filed for bankruptcy. The reason given was that the company had trusted too many people, and some did not pay their credit card bills. 
 Analysts estimated the default rate at 17 percent to 20 percent of all Spiegel credit card receivables. Forty-one percent of purchases companywide, -- and 73 percent at the Spiegel catalog, were made with Spiegel's private-label charge cards, which were issued through a Spiegel-owned bank. 
"The straw that broke the camel's back at Spiegel was the credit card business, not the retail and the catalog," said Robert M. Miller, president of the Financo Restructuring Group, based in New York. "They had a very high default rate." 
In its Chapter 11 filing yesterday, the company listed $1.74 billion in assets and $1.71 billion in debts. All stores and the catalog operations will remain open while the restructuring proceeds, said Debbie Koopman, a spokeswoman.
According to David Robertson, publisher of The Nilson Report, a trade journal that reports on the credit card industry, Spiegel had become, in effect, a subprime lender, offering credit to lower-income consumers who, in many cases, would not qualify for the more mainstream Visa or MasterCard. 
For decades, the credit business fueled Spiegel. But then, several years ago, the furnace stopped blasting. Spiegel's fortunes tipped, along with those of Sears, who, Mr. Robertson said, "makes virtually all its money from credit card financing, not from selling products." 
When the economy started worsening, Visa and MasterCard started loosening their previously extremely tight standards across the country, Mr. Robertson said, "casting a wider and wider net for customers." The retail companies, trying to compete for a share of the lucrative plastic business, had to lower their own standards even further.
Not that the credit card issue was the retailer's only problem. Spiegel's catalog, once reaching more than $1 billion a year in sales, dropped to $522 million in 2002, and while Spiegel had hurried to sell its products online, the company is also still producing a catalog of more than 500 pages several times a year. Newport News, the less-well-known catalog merchant, took in $337 million, and Eddie Bauer sold $1.4 billion. Although the combined sales at the division totaled a hefty $2.3 billion, that was 18 percent less than the $2.8 billion the Spiegel Group brought in the year before.
Yesterday, analysts zeroed in on the lucrative Eddie Bauer casual clothing chain as a prime candidate to be sold by Spiegel in its efforts to improve its balance sheet.
Although Eddie Bauer is still regarded as a strong brand name, the store has stumbled badly over the last five years, failing to differentiate itself from competitors like the Gap, Banana Republic, American Eagle Outfitters and others. Now, Eddie Bauer is trying to go to its outdoorsy roots, the spokeswoman said. Same-store sales, which compare recent performance to those of the same stores a year ago, were down 12 percent for 2002.
Yesterday, several analysts, including Walter Loeb, of the company that bears his name, speculated that the company's new interim chief executive, William C. Kosturos, a restructuring expert who came from the New York firm of Alvarez & Marsal on March 1, will try to find a buyer for Eddie Bauer -- and possibly, for the Newport News division as well. Ms. Koopman said no decision had been made on Eddie Bauer's future, and she refused to speculate on what she called "what ifs."
According to a statement released by Mr. Kosturos, the Chapter 11 petition, which was filed yesterday in United States Bankruptcy Court of the Southern District of New York, "will allow the Spiegel Group to address its immediate liquidity needs, restructure its debt and improve its prospects for future growth and profitability." 
Earlier this month, Spiegel entered into an agreement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had charged the company had not fully disclosed to investors how precarious the company's financial position really was. An independent court-appointed examiner will study the company's financial records since January 2000 and report to the court.
In 1982, Spiegel was acquired by Otto Versand, the world's largest catalog company, and according to a company history issued by Spiegel, later transferred its shares "to a group of individual investors."
Yesterday, an investment banker said that Dr. Michael Otto, a German billionaire who controls the voting shares of Spiegel, had been assuring German lenders that there was no chance that the company's well-reported problems would ever result in a bankruptcy filing. The investment banker said that the German banks said they had been caught by surprise by the filing and that it had been the American banks who had "pulled the trigger."
Actually, the company had little choice. Because of an existing agreement, investors had to be paid immediately if the expected credit card receivables fell below certain amounts. Recently, the company wasforced to discontinue its private-label credit cards.
Despite the gloom, Spiegel announced yesterday that it had found $400 million of new financing. The Bank of America, which has already lent Spiegel $85 million (the fourth-biggest creditor, behind Commerzbank, Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein and DZ Bank), had agreed, with several other institutions, to extend another $400 million in "debtor in possession" financing; the spending of that money will be closely supervised by the bankruptcy judge.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS TRAVEL; 
Extra Steps Are Needed in Wartime

BYLINE:  By JANE L. LEVERE 

 BODY:
It has been a rough 18 months for American business travelers abroad. It is likely to become rougher.
 A war in Iraq would only increase the risks that have been on almost every frequent flier's mind since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, travel industry professionals, security specialists and government officials say. These experts have long urged executives who venture overseas to take precautions to protect their safety and reassure colleagues and family left behind. With the apparent failure of diplomacy to avert a conflict, they say, preventive action is more important than ever. 
 Here is their advice, boiled down to the essentials.

Before You Go
Study up on political, economic, security and medical conditions in the countries you are visiting. The State Department's site, (www .travel.state.gov), contains travel warnings, consular information and regional and worldwide public announcements about conditions and dangers for travelers. (The diplomatic wording might not always capture the full extent of all dangers, though.)
Additional perspectives on geopolitical matters can be obtained from Web sites run by foreign governments, including those of Britain (www.fco.gov.uk), Canada (www .voyage.gc.ca) and Australia (www .dfat.gov.au); however, these sites do not address the heightened risks specific to Americans.
Also recommended are www .ds-osac.org, the site of the State Department's Overseas Security Advisory Council, which has security-related information for American businesses overseas; www.odci.gov/cia /publications/factbook, a Central Intelligence Agency site that discusses conditions in specific countries; and www.cdc.gov, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention site, which has information on medical conditions in specific countries.
IJET Travel Intelligence (www .ijet.com) sells reports on destinations worldwide by a global network of intelligence agents; these start at $14.95. International SOS (www .sosinternational.com) and Medex Assistance (www.medexassist.com) offer medical and political evacuation services and other assistance. International SOS's rates start at $55 a person for a 10-day trip, or $1,000 a year for a corporation; Medex's rates start at $4 a day per person, or $5,000 a year per corporation. Medjet Assistance (www.medjetassist.com) provides medical-evacuation and related services; rates start at $195 a year per person.
For travel-related and security information, try www.tsatraveltips.us, which has updates and advice from the Transportation Security Administration, and www.dhs.gov, the Department of Homeland Security site. 
Many experts recommend travel-management companies like American Express, Navigant International or Rosenbluth International to arrange travel. They offer sophisticated information services, can track you down overseas and provide 24-hour help with most problems. Though online travel agencies like Orbitz, Expedia and Travelocity can contact you if your plans change suddenly and provide other assistance, their services are far less inclusive.
Before you leave, create a highly detailed itinerary, with your contact information abroad as well as contact information for all people you will be meeting. Leave this with your family and business colleagues;it could come in handy should an emergency arise.
Bring at least one extra copy of your legal and travel documents and credit cards and leave a copy at home in case they are lost or stolen.
Take a wireless communications device, like a Blackberry, or a cellphone. Thom Nulty, former president of Navigant and now a consultant in Monarch Beach, Calif., suggests contacting your hotel before your departure and asking the concierge to rent a phone for you there; you can obtain the phone's number in advance and leave it with colleagues and relatives. He also recommends using an international calling service, like AT&T Direct, to make telecommunications overseas easier.
Also bring extra cash for emergencies; a shortwave radio to monitor the news if you are stranded in a non-English-speaking country; extra batteries; water and nonperishable food; a small first-aid kit; extra medication; and a copy of your medical prescriptions.
Jot down the address of the American embassy or consulate in countries you will visit, to expedite registration upon your arrival.
If you are an elite participant in the loyalty program of an airline or hotel company, book its services, as you will receive priority treatment if problems arise.
Book flights as early in the day as possible; they are less likely to be canceled than later ones. Book the highest class of service you can afford; you will probably get better treatment than will holders of cheaper tickets if problems arise. Even if it costs extra, get a paper ticket, which is more easily exchanged or transferred than an electronic one.
If you're traveling with an advance-purchase ticket, check if your airline has liberalized its policy for changes. Some major United States airlines and foreign carriers recently announced plans to waive change fees for international tickets bought this month; other carriers' policies will become effective if war occurs or the government issues a red alert.
Travel lightly.
Do not use a luggage tag that has company logos or other identifying markings on it. Do not put your business card in your luggage tag; just include your name and address on it.

In Transit
Call ahead to the airport and your airline or check their Web sites for the latest information on flight changes, delays or other problems.
Make a mental checklist of what to do before you reach the security checkpoint at the airport, notably putting all metallic objects in your pockets or on your body, including your watch, into your briefcase; removing your laptop from its case, and being prepared to remove your shoes. If you can avoid setting off the metal detector, you will spare yourself major problems.

At Your Destination
Prearrange a car-service pick-up at your destination but request that the person meeting you not hold a sign with your name or your company's name on it. If you take a taxi, do not get in one that is unmarked.
While in airports overseas, avoid Americans traveling in large groups.
"We've got to be careful to soften our footprint," said Kelly McCann, senior vice president of Kroll, the risk-consulting company. "Get rid of American emblems and logos on your clothing, moderate your voice and watch your gestures."
Register at the American embassy upon arrival.
If you change your travel plans, immediately notify your employer and family.
Allow extra time for just about everything, like traveling to an appointment or to the airport.
Avoid public events and places where Americans congregate.
Be aware of unattended bags; also do not accept any packages delivered to your hotel that you are not expecting.
Monitor the news so you are aware of what is happening globally and can respond accordingly.
Finally, try to relax. Remember, Mr. Nulty said, that "the odds of your being injured or killed are much greater on your drive to the airport in the United States than while you're on an international trip."

HEADLINE: Germany's Military Sinking to 'Basket Case' Status 

BYLINE:  By CRAIG S. SMITH 

DATELINE: GENERAL STEINHOFF BARRACKS, Germany 

 BODY:
Jurgen Thum nods toward a 25-year-old camouflaged German military truck and lists the parts for which replacements are no longer available: muffler, brakes, bits and pieces of the engine.
 It "should be in a museum," he said. 
 Instead, this truck and others like it are part of the German armed forces' aging war machine, an increasingly anachronistic apparatus designed to fight the Soviet Union in a tank war that never came. A string of German administrations have promised change, but lingering complexes over the experience of World War II, the cost of absorbing former Communist East Germany and other economic constraints have checked the pace of modernization. 
Germany, once America's strongest military ally, is now one of the worst military laggards in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization.
The German military has been effective in peacekeeping operations from the Balkans to Afghanistan, where it now shares command of the international force in Kabul. It has several hundred highly trained special operations troops, excellent mine-clearing equipment and some of the quietest diesel submarines in the world. It has a strong medical corps and a state-of-the-art flying hospital, and more troops deployed overseas than any other country besides the United States.
But even if Germany did want to take part in a war on Iraq, military experts say it would find it hard to fight alongside the modern United States military.
"They're a basket case," a senior NATO official in Brussels said.
The United States has urged Germany and other NATO allies to transform their traditionally static armed forces into high-tech, mobile services that can better share the task of policing the world.
Most NATO allies have followed Germany's lead in letting defense spending languish since the end of the cold war, investing in rich social welfare programs instead. As a result, America's annual defense budget is now nearly double that of the 18 other NATO countries combined.
While the United States spends 3.3 percent of its gross domestic product on its armed forces, Germany's military spending last year totaled just 1.5 percent of G.D.P. 
More than half of the country's $27 billion defense budget goes to salaries and benefits for personnel, a third of whom are civilians. Only about 13 percent is spent on new equipment, according to NATO, and the budget is about to get even more lopsided. Last month, Defense Minister Peter Struck announced cuts in future weapons programs without any significant reduction in troops. 
"We need to spend a minimum of 30 percent on capital investment, otherwise the modernization won't take place at the necessary speed," said Gen. Klaus Naumann, a former chairman of NATO's military committee, complaining in particular that the military is top heavy with civilians.
Mr. Thum and his broken trucks are part of the problem. He is a civilian mechanic inherited from the East German Army when it merged with West Germany's a decade ago. At 55, he works just 220 days a year and cannot easily be fired because under German law, civilians who have worked for the armed forces for 15 years or more are in effect guaranteed lifetime employment.
Keeping Mr. Thum and many of the military's 130,000 other civilian employees busy is one reason the German military spends just $40 million a year on new vehicles but $1 billion on maintaining them. On average, its trucks are 25 years old.
As Mr. Thum says, "Our future is in these old vehicles."
General Naumann said, "If we could free 6 to 8 percent of the defense budget now spent on pay and benefits, we could really begin to modernize the armed forces in a way that would be able to close the capabilities gap between most Europeans and the Americans." 
When the last defense minister, Rudolf Scharping, tried to do that a year ago, he met such stiff resistance from workers' unions that he promised that for the next 10 years the military would not lay off any civilians -- many of whom, a Defense Ministry spokesman noted, lack the skills to work in the private sector. 
There are few other politically palatable options for financing military modernization. With no obvious enemy threatening German security, the population has little stomach for more military spending. That could change if the United States, as some American conservatives and military commanders are now beginning to suggest, sharply reduces its presence in Germany, redeploying troops farther east in Europe.
But for now, cutting social programs or raising taxes to buy weapons is considered politically impossible in Germany. Nor can the government in Berlin depend on deficit spending to finance its military, as the United States can, because the country is bound by European Union rules to keep its budget deficit below 3 percent of G.D.P.
Karl-Henning Kroger, a colonel at the military's command center near Potsdam for operations abroad, said that Germany could not easily break the rules it helped set on deficit limits but that the focus on domestic social welfare and the economic bonds with its neighbors had made Europe a safer place.
"We started to reform late because we were focused on political investment in our neighborhood," he said, adding that Washington fails to appreciate the difficulty the country faced in absorbing East Germany.
Germany is making some changes: In a small map-lined room at East Germany's former army headquarters, a handful of soldiers monitor the 8,000 troops now deployed in a half-dozen places around the world. The military is training more soldiers so that it will eventually be able to field 50,000 outside its borders at any one time, and it is planning to retire nearly half of its remaining 1,500 tanks.
"German armed forces of the future will be able to conduct high-intensity operations," an army colonel in Berlin promises. "Our aim is not only to be in the second wave." 
But there are bottlenecks everywhere: a shortage of engineers to inspect helicopters in the field, for example, and of anesthesiologists necessary for field hospitals.
The country has few precision-guided weapons and only outdated battlefield command-and-control ability. It has plenty of soldiers, about 290,000, but 90,000 of those are conscripts who get minimal training. Most of the rest are aging professionals who have never served abroad.
Most important of all, Germany does not yet have a means to transport its troops far beyond its borders. It had to lease Ukrainian aircraft to fly its troops to Afghanistan for peacekeeping. It is developing a military transport plane with several other European nations, but the first of the new aircraft will not be delivered before 2009.
Germany is developing an air-launched cruise missile and has started buying laser-guided bombs. But it has made almost no progress in developing an airborne ground surveillance system to allow it to survey a battlefield or use precision-guided weapons effectively.
The United States has urged NATO to build such a system, but without Germany the project is unlikely to make much headway.
"If Germany got serious about reform, it would take away the excuse of the smaller NATO countries" a senior alliance official said, alluding to their neglect of the military.

HEADLINE: Indian Tribes Exempt From New Limits on Campaign Gifts 

BYLINE:  AP 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
In their rivalry with other gambling interests, Indian tribes now have one advantage: they are exempt from the overall donor limits included in the nation's new campaign law that took effect this election cycle.
 The tribes, which for the 2002 election spread around $7 million in federal donations, do not have to abide by the overall individual donor limit of $95,000 in contributions to candidates, political action committees and parties. And unlike companies, the tribes can give donations directly from their treasuries. 
 While unlimited donations known as soft money are now outlawed for everyone, including the tribes, the special treatment of Indian nations in the campaign finance rules has some competitors crying foul. 
"They can give money unlike any American businesses," said Mike Sloan, senior vice president for the Mandalay Resort Group casino company, which is based in Las Vegas. "It's a disparity that Congress has created -- probably unintentionally -- and it's the result of the explosion of Indian gaming."
Tribal organizations, including the National Indian Gaming Association, say some in Congress considered putting tribes on the same ground as other donors, but they lobbied to maintain the special status the Federal Election Commission gave them.
Tribal leaders dismiss the criticism as jealousy over Indians' efforts to raise their political standing.
"There's a lot of people bashing the Indians because they're on the scene and they're active now," said Stan Brand, counsel for the gambling association. "The minute they have exercised the least bit of political muscle, people want to change the rules on them."
Jacqueline Johnson, executive director of the National Congress of American Indians, said the tribes' political concerns went far beyond casinos to issues that included economic diversity, improved public services on reservations and protection of their sovereignty.
Neither the new nor the old campaign finance law specifically mentions Indian tribes. Rather, their special status comes from the election commission, which views them as "persons" under the rules. Other unincorporated entities in that category, like homeowners' associations, could give as the tribes do, but in reality, few exist, said David M. Mason, a member of the election commission.
"I'm not aware of any other organizations who are similarly situated to do this," Mr. Mason said of tribal giving.
Tribes gave at least $7 million to federal candidates, party committees and political action committees in the last election cycle, an Associated Press analysis of figures compiled by the election commission and PoliticalMoneyLine campaign finance tracking service found.
More than $8 of every $10 in tribal contributions in the 2001-02 cycle came from 30 tribes, all with enterprises including casinos.
At least two tribes gave more than $500,000, within range of the contribution levels of Las Vegas-based casino giants like Harrah's Entertainment and Mandalay.
Among top donors, the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians in Choctaw, Miss., gave at least $615,000 to federal candidates and political organizations, and the Ho-Chunk Nation, based in Black River Falls, Wis., donated at least $512,000. The Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians in Palm Springs, Calif., gave roughly $429,500. The Mashantucket Pequot Tribal Nation, whose Foxwoods casino in Connecticut is one of the world's biggest and most profitable, contributed at least $419,895.
"We encourage the invitations to fund-raisers, both Democratic and Republican, for party organizations as well as individuals, because that gives us an opportunity to participate and network," said John Guevremont, the Mashantucket Pequot tribe's chief operating officer. "All the parties have come to us."
Overall tribal giving has leaned toward the Democrats in past elections. Mr. Guevremont, a Republican, is among the Indian leaders who expects that to change in light of the Republican control of the White House and Congress.
Tribes have scored victories in each of the past two elections, helping Senator Tim Johnson, a Democrat, keep his South Dakota seat last year, and helping to unseat Senator Slade Gorton, Republican of Washington State, in 2000.

U.S. Business Will Get Role In Rebuilding Occupied Iraq

BYLINE:  By ELIZABETH BECKER 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Mar. 17 

 BODY:
Bush administration plans for the rebuilding of Iraq call for private American corporations to undertake much of the work, with the United Nations development agencies and other multilateral organizations sidelined, according to administration officials who have seen confidential documents outlining the plans.
 With the administration offering $1.5 billion in work to private companies and just $50 million to American aid groups like Save the Children, the plan will leave out many large international organizations. 
 Several development experts said today that they found the plan ambitious, particularly for an administration that campaigned against "nation building."
According to aid officials, the contracts call for the reconstruction or rehabilitation of roads, municipal water systems, seaports and airports, government ministry buildings, schools and irrigation systems. Contracts will also be given to overhaul public health facilities and the primary and secondary education systems. 
In line with the administration's goal of transforming Iraq into a democracy, those who have seen the plans said American officials will also be appointed as shadow ministers, overseeing Iraqi bureaucrats in government ministries. 
The plan as outlined would be a sharp departure from reconstruction efforts in the last decade, which were largely undertaken by international peacekeeping operations.
Administration officials said it was important to give contracts to American corporations, essentially leapfrogging over the experienced development and international groups, as a way to demonstrate to the Iraqi people that the United States is a "liberator" bringing economic prosperity and democratic institutions to their nation.
Relief work will begin almost as soon as the first bombs are dropped and the military is confronted with Iraqi civilians in need of food, water, medicine and shelter, officials said.
For that reason, Jay Garner, the retired general who directs the new Office of Reconstruction and Humanitarian Assistance in the Pentagon, arrived today in Kuwait. He will oversee all the civilian aid, reconstruction and governance of post-war Iraq. 
Kofi Annan, the secretary general of the United Nations, today suspended the program under which revenues from oil sales have kept nearly three-quarters of Iraqis fed. Administration officials said they believe they can reinvigorate it as soon as the military gains control of Iraq. 
The administration is already feeling pressure to expand the list of nations and corporations taking part in what could become a $30 billion program over the next three years. Foreign officials questioned why even British companies have been excluded despite the loyalty of Prime Minister Tony Blair as a strong military and political ally of the United States. 
Bernard Kouchner, the former United Nations special representative in Kosovo and one of the few French politicians sympathetic to the idea of overthrowing Saddam Hussein, said the Bush administration would be shortsighted if it excluded other nations, especially those from Europe. 
"It's impossible -- impossible -- to reconstruct without Europe, not just in terms of money but to push the international community toward your position," he said. "You have to offer them a piece of cake."
At this stage, the only plan for including foreign corporations is as subcontractors to the American companies that win the bids, according to Ellen Yount, spokeswoman for United States Agency for International Development. 
Frances D. Cook, former American ambassador to Oman and a consultant to several Middle Eastern companies, has been lobbying the administration to include companies from Egypt and Jordan to show appreciation for their cooperation in the war effort.
"They are already screaming in the Middle East -- you call us corrupt, look at you giving contracts to American companies and no one else," Ms. Cook said.
The companies asked to bid on the contracts include Kellogg Brown & Root, a subsidiary of Halliburton Company, which Vice President Dick Cheney once headed.
Since Sept. 11 the Pentagon has relied increasingly on Kellogg Brown & Root, which has built cells for detainees at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba and fed American troops in Uzbekistan.
Other companies bidding for the contracts in various alliances include Louis Berger Group, Bechtel Group, Parson Corporation and Washington Group International.

HEADLINE: Despite Law, Catskill Casino Is Not Likely Anytime Soon 

BYLINE:  By CHARLES V. BAGLI 

 BODY:
It is a tale worthy of a novelist, fraught with intrigue, double-dealing, allegations of fraud, and, ultimately, enormous disappointment, all in search of what Indian tribes, casino operators and the administration of Gov. George E. Pataki regard as a potential gold mine: a casino in the Catskills, close by New York City.
 The idea of such a casino, where hundreds of thousands of customers would spend millions and make everybody else rich, has brought developers, gambling companies and tribes through the Catskills in recent years. Their efforts got a major boost 16 months ago when Governor Pataki and the Legislature authorized three tribal casinos in the Catskills, to generate revenues for a state that now faces a $12 billion budget gap. 
 But so far, no casino has opened in the once-thriving resort area of Sullivan County, whose hills are dotted with crumbling bungalow colonies and shuttered hotels. 
The reasons vary from anti-gambling opposition to intratribal disputes. But a big factor is squabbling among the rival partners for the Indian tribes, according to court papers and other documents. 
The tale is told in newly disclosed audio tapes of secretly recorded conversations that have surfaced in a lawsuit between rival casino operators and the largest gambling company in the world, Park Place Entertainment.
In the case, Catskill Development, a small company that had concluded a partnership with the St. Regis Mohawk tribe to build a Catskill casino, accuses Park Place and its allies of using fraud, economic coercion and a $3 million loan to get the tribe to grant Park Place exclusive rights to build Mohawk casinos in New York State. The case, now nearly three years old, was dismissed in August, but Catskill Development's lawyers have appealed, and on Friday they filed a motion to reopen the case based on the newly disclosed audiotapes.
What is not in dispute is that in April 2000, the tribe suddenly renounced its prior deal with Catskill Development for a casino in Monticello, in part, on promises that Park Place would rescue the Mohawks' ailing Akwesasne casino on the Canadian border and start building what Park Place said would be the largest casino resort in the world in the Catskills "within four months."
What has been in dispute is why and how. Thomas P. Puccio, a lawyer for Catskill Development, said in a motion filed last Friday in United States District Court in Manhattan that the previously secret tape recordings buttress the claim of economic coercion. The tapes suggest that Park Place and a third company, the operator of the smaller casino, teamed up to squeeze the Mohawks to renounce their partnership with Catskill Development. 
On one audiotape the operator of the small casino, Ivan Kaufman, is heard telling Clive S. Cummis, now vice chairman of Park Place, that he is withholding paychecks at the casino to drive the Mohawks into the arms of Park Place. At the time, the Mohawk chiefs feared that the small casino would collapse.
"The tapes graphically chronicle Park Place's use of severe economic pressure -- 'squeezing' the tribe by delaying its payroll at Akwesasne -- to force the Mohawks to drop Catskill and sign up with Park Place," Mr. Puccio said.
Mr. Puccio's motion said that Park Place had failed to disclose the tapes during the proceedings. A lawyer for Catskill said Mr. Kaufman had also failed to give the tapes to Catskill in response to a subpoena in 2001.
Walter Horn, who works with Mr. Kaufman, said that he did not know why Catskill did not get the tapes until recently. "I assume Catskill, in their discovery, requested all these things from Park Place," Mr. Horn said. "I don't know what happened."
Mr. Cummis said the tapes violated laws related to interstate commerce, and then declined to comment, saying "the matter is in litigation." He added that he had never had possession of the tapes. But Mr. Puccio's motion contained receipts showing that lawyers from Park Place received the tapes from Mr. Kaufman in 2001. 
The Mohawk chief, Paul Thompson, did not return phone calls requesting comment on the tapes.
The Pataki administration had said that the state would reap hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue from three Indian casinos in the Catskills and three in northwestern New York. The state has borrowed about $300 million against future casino revenues. But only one casino has materialized, in Niagara Falls.
The Catskill casinos were thought to have especially lucrative potential because Monticello is closer to New York City and millions of potential customers than the gambling halls in Atlantic City. Analysts estimated that a Catskill casino could generate revenues of $1 billion a year.
Robert A. Berman, a local businessman and a leader of Catskill Development, signed a deal in 1996 to build an Indian casino at the Monticello Raceway with the Mohawks, whose reservation straddles the Canadian border 350 miles to the north.
Catskill hoped to give the Mohawks 30 acres of land at the Raceway and build a tribal casino there, under a newly enacted federal law. But in April 2000, the Mohawks dumped their partners and signed an unusual deal with Park Place.
"I can't imagine that the tribe, or anybody who recognizes how long it takes to get land into trust for gaming, would want to undo four years of work," Rick Chiff, deputy chief of staff at the National Indian Gaming Commission, said at the time.
At the time, gambling industry analysts and state officials speculated that the Mohawks had been misled by Park Place and its chairman, Arthur Goldberg, who they said was more interested in protecting the company's three casinos in Atlantic City. Mr. Goldberg had opposed gambling in New York, telling stockholders that a successful Catskill casino could reduce revenues in Atlantic City by as much as 20 percent.
But Mr. Goldberg, who is now dead, and Mr. Cummis, the Park Place executive, vowed to build a $750 million casino at Kutsher's, near Monticello, and get federal approval "within four months."
Mr. Berman and Catskill Development sued Park Place. The lawsuit, which was dismissed in August, is on appeal. Catskill Development recently obtained the audiotapes from lawyers for the former operator of the Akwesasne casino, Mr. Kaufman, who has also sued Park Place.
Mr. Kaufman's company managed the Akwesasne casino in a remote corner of New York since it opened in April 1999. But the casino was losing as much as $300,000 a month and had laid off hundreds of workers, many of them Mohawks. 
According to Mr. Kaufman's lawsuit, Mr. Goldberg wanted to gain exclusive rights to gambling in the Catskills, not to rescue a failing upstate. Mr. Kaufman claims Mr. Goldberg reneged on a $30 million deal to buy his interest in the Akwesasne casino, and poisoned Mr. Kaufman's relationship with the Mohawks.
Mr. Kaufman recorded telephone conversations with Mr. Cummis and Mr. Thompson, the Mohawk chief. 
But on Feb. 8, 2000, Mr. Thompson is heard on one of the recordings complaining to Mr. Kaufman that Park Place is being "greedy," because it was saying it would only do a deal at Akwesasne if there were no other "casinos in the Catskills" than its own at Kutsher's. Mr. Goldberg "wants it all," Mr. Thompson added. 
Mr. Kaufman confides that he may sue Park Place because of its failure to complete their agreed-upon deal at Akwesasne.
But eight days later, a jubilant Mr. Cummis is telling Mr. Kaufman that the Mohawks have granted Park Place exclusivity. Mr. Kaufman confesses that he never thought that it would happen; Mr. Goldberg, he says, must be a "genius." Mr. Kaufman reminds Mr. Cummis that he has helped Park Place and wants to consummate the deal at Akwesasne.
"You got to remember the pressure on them with how we're squeezing them at Akwesasne is huge," Mr. Kaufman said. "I have kind of delayed their payrolls and slowed it down so badly that, you know, they're looking at Arthur as a savior."
"Yep, they are," Mr. Cummis responded.
Mr. Horn denied that Mr. Kaufman was trying to coerce the tribe. "He had no obligation to pay any of those monies," Mr. Horn said. 
The Mohawk chiefs were afraid that the collapse of the Akwesasne casino would undermine their tenuous hold on political power, according to Mohawk lawyers and several Mohawks who oppose the chiefs. 
On April 6, 2000, the Bureau of Indian affairs granted tentative approval for the Mohawk-Catskill Development casino, and Governor Pataki signaled he will endorse it.
But ultimately, Mr. Goldberg and Mr. Cummis persuaded the Mohawks to abandon their original partners by promising, in Mr. Cummis's words, to build a casino at Kutsher's "without any significant loss of time." The tribe, Mr. Cummis said, wanted "us to pay them $3 million in cash" to prop up the Akwesasne casino.
The Akwesasne casino is still open, but the Kutsher's project is delayed.

HEADLINE: Trial Lawyers Begin Effort Against Cutting Jury Awards 

BYLINE:  By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr. 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 17 

 BODY:
New York's trial lawyers have begun an advertising campaign to counter a growing political movement here and in Washington, led by doctors, insurance companies and Republican leaders, to reduce jury awards for pain and suffering.
 The New York State Trial Lawyers Association plans to begin running advertisements in major newspapers across the state on Tuesday, pointing out the important role civil suits have played in making products, workplaces and medical procedures safer. 
 "We feel the civil justice system is under attack, and civil justice means civil rights," Jeffrey A. Lichtman, the president of the association, said. "We are trying to get the message out in a way we really never have before." 
The advertisements come as proposals to change tort laws are gaining momentum on both the national and state level. President Bush has proposed a $250,000 cap on jury awards for pain and suffering in medical malpractice lawsuits. The bill has passed the House and is pending in the Senate.
In Albany, the Republican leader of the Senate majority, Joseph L. Bruno, has proposed a similar cap on the state level. The bill in his chamber would also change liability rules to make it harder to sue multiple defendants and would limit fees lawyers can collect on jury awards.
Gov. George E. Pataki, also a Republican, has proposed moving civil suits against public hospitals and state authorities into the Court of Claims, where judges rather than juries decide damages. Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, a Republican, has strongly supported both the Senate's bill and Mr. Pataki's proposal.
Previous efforts to change New York's tort laws have run into a stone wall in the Democrat-led Assembly, where the trial lawyers exert a strong influence on the leaders. This year, however, the state's dire financial situation along with the push from the White House have given new life to calls for tort reform, lobbyists say. 
The trial lawyers' advertisements attempt to portray civil suits and jury awards as the backbone of civil rights. One advertisement lists dozens of changes brought about by lawsuits, from bottle caps being redesigned to prevent eye injuries to dangerous contraceptive devices being taken off the market. Superimposed is the statement: "Look what 'excessive' lawsuits can lead to."
A second advertisement superimposes the picture of a young boy who was injured during a botched medical procedure over the preamble to the Constitution. The text says that "mismanaged underwriting practices, lower interest rates and sinking portfolios" are to blame for the rising interest rates doctors pay, not high malpractice awards for victims like the boy.
Lobbyists for New York doctors and insurance companies disagree. "It's just false," said Michael P. Moran, a spokesman for the American Insurance Association, a trade group. "The trial lawyers are trying to ignore the facts by putting out cases of sympathetic people."

States Pan for Gold By Luring the Gray

BYLINE:  By TERESA BURNEY 

 BODY:
ONCE a year, on the second Saturday in June, a passel of Mississippians journeys to New York, pitches a tent in Central Park, fries up some catfish and starts mining for gray gold.
 With honey-dipped "hellos," full-color brochures and free food, the representatives of the Mississippi Development Authority work to tap a mother lode of 50-somethings. Retire to Mississippi, they say, "Where it feels like coming home." 
 Mississippi and other Southern states and communities have been recruiting older residents with the same vigor they displayed in chasing Mercedes-Benz plants and silicon chip makers. And as there have been fewer factories to lure since the economy turned sour two years ago, the competition for old-folks-to-be has grown more heated. 
"Retirees are a clean industry," said Dr. Mark Fagan, a sociologist at Jacksonville State University in Alabama. He also works as a consultant advising states and communities on how to attract retirees.
They are a growing industry as well. Though only about 5 percent of retirees move more than 100 miles when they quit working, the swelling ranks of mobile baby boomers about to hit retirement age is likely to drastically increase the numbers of retirees who decide to pull up stakes.
With their life saving and pensions, retirees take money into a community, spend it and, while they are healthy, give more to the community than they get back, say academics who have studied retiree migration.
All that, and the likelihood they will work as volunteers, the unlikelihood they will commit crimes and their lack of children in school, makes them ideal citizens.
"We like to think that they bring talent, time and trust funds to town," said Joe David Rice, Arkansas' tourism director.
While Mississippi is busy dishing up catfish in the park and using its satisfied retirees to hawk its 20 "certified" retiree-friendly towns, Arkansas spends $250,000 a year to advertise the natural beauty of its rocks and water to "mature adults."
Here are some other efforts: 
* Alabama used state pension-fund money to build a "trail" of Robert Trent Jones-designed golf courses across the state, and promotes the courses in television stations and newspapers owned by the pension fund.
* Louisiana boasts about its food and culture on a Web site that includes audio "testimonials" from people who have chosen to retire there.
* West Virginia points out its proximity to the bulk of the nation's population, and its "wild and wonderful" natural lands in its advertising aimed at people 50 and over.
These states also flaunt low taxes and costs of living, and boast that their residents have access to good medical care and plenty of recreation, universities and culture.
In a subtle slap at Florida and its long, hot summers, these states make a big deal of having "four good seasons." Their efforts have not escaped the notice of Florida, which has been a retirement state of choice for decades without even trying.
Gov. Jeb Bush set up a commission last year that was charged with figuring out how Florida could keep from losing retirees to its northern neighbors. "They are successfully gnawing away at our market," said T. O'Neal Douglas, the chairman of Governor Bush's Destination Florida Commission.
From 1960 through the 80's, 25 percent of the 60-plus people who retired headed to Florida. That share slipped to 20 percent by the late 90's, the commission says. 
Florida's economy has become so dependent on an inflow of retirees that even a small drop in numbers could have a serious effect on its financial health, the report says. 
"The bottom line is that, if you are going to start recruiting retirees as a source of economic growth, you have to keep on doing it," said William J. Serow, an economist at the Center for the Study of Population at Florida State University.
While pensioned retirees are great for an economy when they first move in as younger and more active people, they can become a drain as they grow older, sicker, poorer and need government assistance. No study has been done on the economic impact of these residents, Dr. Serow said, though a steady influx of younger retirees probably helps balance the effects.
States other than Florida say that they have no worries about a drain on their communities because of retirees. But these states have not made recruitment their only source of economic development, they say.
"We are not wanting to make this a retirement town," said Susan Walker, who runs the retirement recruitment program in Hattiesburg, Miss.
With the University of Southern Mississippi and William Carey College, Hattiesburg already has many young people, Ms. Walker said. The community of about 50,000 has attracted 730 retiree households in the 10 years since it began the Hometown Retirement Mississippi program. 
"I think they've made it a lot better here," Ms. Walker said.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NEW YORK CITY; 
For Immigrants, Mixed View Of War and a World of Hate

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH BERGER 

 BODY:
On the brink of war, Americans are perplexed by a world that seems to have turned against them. That world, however, is vigorously present in polyglot New York City, in the children, siblings and cousins of many of the same people who are expressing such vitriol against the United States.
 But here immigrants view the impending war with Iraq through a kind of split lens. One part of that lens sees the United States as the country that provided them with a haven from tyranny or bloodshed or poverty. But the other half may be shaped by lingering loyalties to their homelands, many of which oppose the war, or by firsthand experience with war in their native countries, where seemingly simple solutions turned out to have ambiguous outcomes. 
 Thus on New York City's streets, there is a babel of views on whether the United States should attack Iraq, with conflicting opinions often coming out of the same person.
"I'm 51 percent for the war and 49 percent against it." said Mark Kukuliev, a Russian immigrant in Brighton Beach, Brooklyn, who captured the ambivalence of many immigrants.
He explained that he holds no animus against Iraqis, only against their leader. "I think Saddam Hussein learned all of his tricks by studying Stalin," he said. "Stalin might as well have been his father." But as the part owner of a cellphone store, Mr. Kukuliev also worries about what war might do to the economy.
Even the city's Iraqi immigrants display the ambivalence. Most of them are Shiite Muslims who fled Iraq because of the oppression they said they suffered under Saddam Hussein. Yet they worry that the bombs being massed against him may soon fall on their relatives. 
"This war is like trying to kill the weed by destroying the whole farm," said an Iraqi who gave his name only as Muhammed yesterday at the Imam al-Khoei Islamic Center, a mosque in Jamaica, Queens.
Harilaos Daskalothanassis, the managing editor of The National Herald, a Greek newspaper based in Astoria, Queens, pointed out that most Greeks in Greece are against the war, but Greek-Americans "see the war through the American experience."
Mr. Daskalothanassis, who like many immigrants came to America to study and stayed, said, "We've been here more than 10 years, and we remember the gulf war, and we know that Saddam has not disarmed, and we know he's started three wars in his neighborhood and a million people died."
Many Greeks who have written to his newspaper compare the American campaign against Iraq to the empire building of the Athenians as they went to war with Sparta in the fifth century B.C. It is a cautionary tale that should have spurred the Bush administration to hesitate, but some Greeks see a dual lesson.
"It didn't go that well for the Athenians, but then again the Spartans were more powerful than the Iraqis," Mr. Daskalothanassis said. 
Ariel Gratch, a 51-year-old Israeli businessman who lives on the Upper East Side, compared what he called America's "failure of leadership" in Iraq to what he sees as a failure of leadership in Israel to deal successfully with the Palestinians after the intifada began in late 2000. 
He said the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, tried to link the uprising on the streets and campaign of suicide bombers to the collapse of the talks at Camp David in 2000. But Mr. Gratch saw that as a pretext for not persisting with negotiations and dealing with the roots of terror. Similarly, he said, President Bush is trying to link Iraq to the 9/11 attack as a pretext for the war he always wanted. 
Nevertheless, Mr. Gratch, embodying the old joke that when you have two Israelis you get three opinions, said he thought the United States should go to war because its immersion in the Middle East would teach it that it must grapple with why Arabs and other Muslims "hate us so much."
Richard Alba, a distinguished professor of sociology at the State University at Albany, said immigrants whose countries are in conflict with the United States face an impossible choice.
"If they attempt to gain acceptance in the mainstream society, they risk in their own eyes being perceived as disloyal to their own group," he said. "If, on the other hand, they retreat into the group, they are giving up on opportunities available in mainstream society."
Many German and Italian immigrants faced this quandary on the eve of World War II, he said. Jews, too, were often less than forceful in pressing for the Roosevelt administration to take in refugees from Nazi Germany, fearing a backlash of anti-Semitism. And today Arab-Americans face rejection by their own community if they support the United States, yet "increased suspicion and scrutiny" if they do not.
In the flavorful Arab neighborhood along Atlantic Avenue in Brooklyn, that conflict was apparent. Mohamed Salih, 38, an immigrant from Sudan who owns a barber shop, said that Muslims who chat about a possible war in his shop -- and that happens all the time now -- are almost unanimously opposed.
"If you find somebody that is for this war, they are lying to you," he said. "A lot of people they are going to die first. Saddam is going to be the last one who's going to die. Don't just think about Saddam; think about all these people."
Jacques Amar, a Frenchman by birth who owns a coffee shop called Cafe de France on Northern Boulevard in Little Neck, Queens, said he departs from his onetime compatriots on their refusal to support the United States. "The French are lucky that America wants to do the dirty job," he said.
"America's heart is in the right place, but they're so misunderstood, unless you live here," he said. "The facts speaks for themselves; it's why everybody wants to come here. 
But he also worries that some Americans will take out their newfound resentment of the French by snubbing his business. So for good measure he is thinking of changing the cafe's name to something more politically neutral, like Casablanca.
"It's not doing me any good," he said of the French name.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE PRESIDENT; 
Bush Gives Hussein 48 Hours, and Vows to Act

BYLINE:  By RICHARD W. STEVENSON 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
President Bush tonight gave Saddam Hussein 48 hours to go into exile or face attack from the United States and a handful of allies.
 In an address to the nation from the White House, made hours after he had abandoned attempts to forge a united diplomatic front against Iraq, Mr. Bush made clear that hostilities could begin as soon as his two-day ultimatum expires, perhaps sooner if Mr. Hussein openly spurns the demand from the United States that he go and take his two sons with him. Mr. Bush warned diplomats, aid workers and journalists in Iraq to get out of harm's way immediately. 
 Mr. Hussein showed no signs of complying, and Mr. Bush's tone and language in his 15-minute address suggested that he expected nothing but continued defiance from the Iraqi leader. 
For the president, the speech marked a failed end to six months of diplomacy intended to convince skeptical allies like France and Germany, and the United Nations Security Council, that weapons inspections had proven ineffective and that only through the immediate application of force could Mr. Hussein be disarmed. 
Having been unable to get the United Nations behind him, Mr. Bush now faces a war with only Britain providing substantial military support and many other nations -- as well as a portion of domestic public opinion -- condemning him for what they have called a rush to war.
The president put the United States on heightened alert for terrorist reprisals and prepared the American people for a war he said was an act of self-defense against a country that had ties to terrorists and was still trying to amass, hide and develop biological, chemical and nuclear weapons. "Instead of drifting along toward tragedy, we will set a course toward safety," Mr. Bush said. Transcript, Page A14. 
To the Iraqi people, Mr. Bush gave notice that he would soon begin an invasion that he said would liberate them from a murderous regime, and to the Iraqi military he issued a stark warning against using chemical and biological weapons or destroying their nation's oil wells. More than 250,000 American and British troops are now massed in the region. United Nations weapons inspectors, on whose work hopes among many nations for a peaceful outcome had been pinned, were told today to begin leaving the country.
"The tyrant will soon be gone," Mr. Bush said. 
"War criminals will be punished," he added. "And it will be no defense to say, 'I was just following orders.' "
Mr. Bush spoke less than 12 hours after giving up on an effort to bring the Security Council behind his plan to force an immediate showdown with Mr. Hussein. Although he did not name names, he was almost scornful of those nations that had opposed him, especially France, which had vowed to veto any United Nations resolution calling for the use of force.
"These governments share our assessment of the danger, but not our resolve to meet it," Mr. Bush said, speaking from a lectern in the Cross Hall in what aides said was likely to be the first of two addresses to the nation this week. They said he was likely to speak again once the hostilities start.
"The United Nations Security Council has not lived up to its responsibilities," Mr. Bush said. "So we will rise to ours."
Should Mr. Bush unleash the military, it would be the first major application since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks of his doctrine of pre-empting threats from rogue nations and terrorist groups with access to nonconventional weapons.
But in reaching this point, he has sorely tried NATO, the pillar of postwar security in the West. Domestically he has all but staked his presidency not only on winning a quick military victory but also on the potentially trickier task of bringing long-term stability to Iraq and the Middle East, and lifting the shadow of war from the troubled American economy.
Standing behind a lectern, with one of the most ornate vistas in the White House behind him, Mr. Bush spoke in measured tones, mixing terms of military resolve with references to humanitarian gestures and a vision of bringing liberty, if not democracy, to Iraq.
To the Iraqi people, Mr. Bush promised food, medicine and liberation from the "lawless men" who have ruled their country through fear and intimidation.
"We will tear down the apparatus of power, and we will help you to build a new Iraq that is prosperous and free," he said. "In a free Iraq, there will be no more wars of aggression against your neighbors, no more poison factories, no more executions of dissidents, no more torture chambers and rape rooms."
He offered no new evidence of his contention that Iraq has ties to terrorist organizations including Al Qaeda, and he provided no new intelligence to bolster his assertions that Mr. Hussein had stockpiled chemical and biological weapons and continued to try to develop nuclear weapons.
But he said that Iraq, under Mr. Hussein, had the potential to one day assist terrorists in killing "thousands or hundreds of thousands of innocent people in our country or any other."
Without providing details, Mr. Bush said some governments in the Middle East had delivered private messages to Mr. Hussein in recent days urging him to step aside. He said the refusal of the Iraqi leader and his sons to go into exile "will result in military conflict, commenced at a time of our choosing."
A Pentagon official said the wording of Mr. Bush's warning was intended to leave open the option of moving militarily in less than two days if Mr. Hussein publicly refuses before the deadline to leave Iraq.
Citing the possibility of terrorist reprisals or attacks by Iraqi agents, administration officials moved today to impose some of the most stringent security precautions seen in the United States since immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks.
Officials said the administration urged the nation's governors tonight to call out National Guard troops or the state police to protect bridges, reservoirs, memorials and other government installations that could be terrorist targets. Without providing details, Mr. Bush noted that the United States had expelled people it suspected of having ties to Iraq's intelligence services.
Military commanders, who said they were ready to begin the invasion as soon as they got the order, continued to move the more than 225,000 American and 25,000 British troops in the region into position for a heavy air attack and a near-simultaneous ground invasion.
Prime Minister John Howard of Australia authorized troops from his country to fight alongside the Americans and British against Iraq. Turkey, which previously had balked at allowing American troops to launch a northern front against Iraq from its territory or to send planes and cruise missiles through its airspace, said its Parliament would reconsider its stance on Tuesday. Canada said it would not allow its troops to take part in the absence of a new United Nations resolution.
 China's new premier, Wen Jiabao, called Tuesday for "every effort" to avoid military conflict in Iraq and said Iraq must meet United Nations demands for disarmament, The Associated Press reported. 
Pentagon officials said they had "information" but no proof that an Iraqi Republican Guard division deployed in southern Iraq might have been equipped with chemical weapons.
Jay Garner, a retired American general who heads the Pentagon office that will oversee the occupation of Iraq, arrived in Kuwait today, a senior Pentagon official said.
The president met at the White House before his speech tonight with the leaders of both parties in Congress and then with senior members of crucial committees, including armed services, foreign affairs, intelligence and appropriations. 
Government officials said Mr. Bush was likely to ask Congress within days of the start of the conflict for $60 billion to $90 billion to pay for the military action, aid to allies and the initial costs of occupying and rebuilding Iraq. They said no firm decision had been made as of this afternoon on precisely how much money he would seek.
Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, Mr. Bush's staunchest ally in confronting Iraq, paid his first serious political price for his stance. Robin Cook, a former foreign secretary who was leader of the House of Commons, resigned from Mr. Blair's cabinet, saying it was "wrong to embark on military action without broad international support," He is expected to become a leader of the antiwar forces in the governing Labor Party.
After a series of early-morning phone calls to other leaders and hearing a report from Secretary of State Colin L. Powell, the president gave up whatever slim hopes he might have had of convincing the Security Council to back his hard line on Iraq. 
Just after 9 a.m., Mr. Bush, Mr. Blair and Prime Minister Jose Maria Aznar of Spain instructed their United Nations ambassadors to walk away from the proposed resolution they had sponsored in the Security Council.
American officials said a vote on the resolution, had one been taken, would have been close, but France said the proposal would have been overwhelmingly rejected.
Despite leaving open the possibility that Mr. Hussein might still be persuaded by other Arab nations to step down to avoid an invasion of his country, diplomats and administration officials said no serious efforts were under way to negotiate Mr. Hussein's departure.
Kofi Annan, the United Nations secretary general, suggested that turning to military action without agreement within the Security Council would scar the organization and leave the United States and its "coalition of the willing" without the world's moral backing.
"If this action is to take place without the support of the Council, its legitimacy will be questioned, and the support for it will be diminished," Mr. Annan said.

HEADLINE: China's New Leaders Vow to Pursue Market-Style Economics 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, Tuesday, March 18 

 BODY:
China's new top leaders, addressing the nation for the first time since assuming command of the Communist Party and the government, vowed unswerving devotion to market-style economic changes today and pledged to do more to attack poverty in the vast countryside.
 President Hu Jintao and Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, both speaking publicly this morning for the first time since the Chinese legislature formalized their accessions, also gave no indication that they would promote free elections or tolerate any challenges to the Communist Party. 
 "China's development is at a new historical starting point," Mr. Hu said in a nationally televised address at the closing session of the National People's Congress, the country's legislature. "We should take full advantage of the strategic opportunity period in the first two decades of the 21st century to focus on construction and development, push forward reform and opening up in a big way." 
Mr. Hu, a 60-year-old career party official who emerged from obscurity to assume leadership of the party and the top titular position in the government, repeated set phrases and slogans that elder leaders have used for the past 20 years to describe their mission. He emphasized the superiority of socialism.
"Only socialism can save China," Mr. Hu said. "Only socialism with Chinese characteristics can develop China."
Mr. Wen, 60, whose resume closely resembles that of Mr. Hu, held a nearly two-hour news conference with domestic and international media, his first since being elevated to his post on Sunday. He emphasized the importance of tackling rural backwardness.
After detailing his own upbringing in a peasant family that suffered hardships during the Japanese occupation more than 50 years ago, Mr. Wen pledged to make raising the incomes of farmers a primary task.
"The first of the major problems we are faced with is the development of agriculture and the slow increase of farmers' income," he said.
Mr. Wen said that China had developed quickly in recent years but that too much of the growth was centered on its east coast. By spreading prosperity inland, he said, the economy as a whole would benefit.
His comments came just after Chinese legislators appointed new ministers to oversee economic, defense and foreign affairs and other portfolios in Mr. Wen's new cabinet.
Li Zhaoxing, 62, a career diplomat, was picked to replace Tang Jiaxuan as foreign minister. He is considered well-briefed on the United States, where he served as ambassador until 2001. But some Western diplomats argue that Mr. Li is unlikely to have the clout to alter course in foreign policy and may end up serving mainly as China's top spokesman.
Mr. Tang has taken a new job overseeing foreign affairs as a state councilor. And Wu Yi, a longtime trade official one of the few women in China's top ranks, was appointed vice premier, also with responsibility for international policy.
At defense, Cao Gangchuan, 58, a military logistics expert who acquired top-shelf weapons from Russia and built up China's missile and space programs, was selected to replace Chi Haotian.
Another powerful official in the new cabinet is Lu Fuyuan, who was promoted to head the newly former Commerce Ministry.

HEADLINE: Market Place; 
A Financier by Another Name Was a Self-Described Con Man

BYLINE:  By ANDREW ROSS SORKIN 

 BODY:
Theodore Roxford seems like a big wheel.
 Henry Kravis has called upon him for advice, and the buyout giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts has paid him thousands of dollars for his work. David Bonderman of the Texas Pacific Group recently corresponded with him about working together. Earlier this month, he went public with a $108 million offer for Zapata, the one-time oil and gas company founded by former President George Bush. 
 But the Theodore Roxford who has penetrated the clubby world of big financiers was once someone else: Lawrence David Niren, a self-described corporate con artist.
Now, Mr. Roxford, who changed his name in 1994 and contends that he has always been a legitimate businessman, is busy playing the role of would-be corporate raider. He has started an investment partnership with a name -- Hollingsworth, Rothwell & Roxford -- that hints at old money, though it seems to consist largely of himself, an e-mail address and a Web site he started through Yahoo last month. He refuses to provide any substantive information about his partners.
Most recently, he has tried to make a business of connecting with some of the nation's most prominent deal makers to sell them on merger and acquisition ideas for a finder's fee -- and in at least one case, he has sued, seeking that fee.
In a lawsuit against SBC Communications, Mr. Roxford contends that he is owed $2.5 million in fees for proposing the acquisition of BCE Inc. by Ameritech two years before a deal was announced. (SBC subsequently acquired Ameritech.) A federal judge in Illinois threw the case out of court in January saying that "the complaint reeks of harassment because it is so patently baseless as a matter of law." Mr. Roxford is appealing.
Mr. Roxford contends he provides useful, legitimate advice on prospective deals. "We are real, and our mission is to enhance shareholder value for all shareholders in undervalued companies," he said.
But as Mr. Niren, he described something quite different in interviews with Forbes magazine and The San Francisco Chronicle in 1995. In them, he told of a scheme to introduce financiers to deep-pocketed investors for an upfront fee -- and then never show up with the investors.
He said he used false references and fake names of investors, according to the articles, in a tale that sounds something like a Wall Street version of "Catch Me if You Can." If the investors complained, he would tell them of a death in his family or a business partner's heart attack, the articles said. He even got the corporate raider T. Boone Pickens to pay him half a million dollars as a deal consultant.
"I conned because it got me out of bankruptcy," Mr. Roxford -- then Mr. Niren -- told The San Francisco Chronicle, saying he had received more than $2 million this way. "It just started snowballing."
Mr. Roxford now says he was never a con man, despite his past comments. "That was a publicity stunt to sell a novel I had written in 1994," he said, adding, "I changed my name because I wrote a controversial novel that talked about corruption of companies who cheat people." The book was never published.
Mr. Roxford, 49, got his start in the world of Wall Street as a gold analyst for Princeton Economic Consultants in the mid-1980's. In 1986, Princeton sued him -- contending that he disclosed confidential company information during a trial -- forcing him to file for bankruptcy.
These days, Mr. Roxford is trying to put his past behind him to become a big-time financier himself -- and dropping the names of Mr. Kravis and others to give himself credibility. In February, he sent out a press release announcing a $78 billion takeover offer for Sony. No wire service or publication picked up on it, however, even though he sent journalists a list of references including Mr. Kravis and Mr. Bonderman and their phone numbers because, as he described it, "You will not find any information on us because of the highest security clearances for three of the partners."
At the time, he told at least one reporter that J. P. Morgan was acting as his adviser, though the bank refused to work with him.
And while his offer for Sony was dismissed out of hand, Mr. Roxford's bid for Zapata was taken so seriously that trading in the stock was halted so the company could respond to his offer.
Zapata has since rejected the offer, and, according to people close to the company, the company is looking into Mr. Roxford's background.
As for Mr. Kravis, he has cut off contact with Mr. Roxford since learning of his past. He declined to comment for this article.
Mr. Bonderman, through a spokesman, said that Texas Pacific "never had interest in participating in any transaction proposed by Mr. Roxford."
But Mr. Roxford refuses to give up. "We just got off the phone with one of the banks that we have been in talks with about financing our offer for Zapata and they said, and I quote: 'We would finance your Zapata deal in a minute. Any bank would. But with all of the negative stories out there on you guys, it is making it difficult to do the deal quickly,' " he said. Still, he refused to provide the name of the banks he said he was talking with. "It could screw it up for us," he said.
Mr. Roxford's lawyer, Thomas M. Paris, calls his client "eccentric and resourceful." 
"He knows a lot of people in the business," Mr. Paris said. "I can't keep up with him. I've gotten letters from him in Rio de Janeiro, London and Japan."
Asked if Mr. Roxford was a genuine businessman, Mr. Paris responded: "Is he legit? I don't know what you mean by that."

HEADLINE: Good Morning, New York: Eggs Over Easy, Business on the Side 

BYLINE:  By FLORENCE FABRICANT 

 BODY:
IT could have been lunch. Although nearly every table at Michael's restaurant in Midtown was occupied, it was only 8:45 a.m. And in the private garden room, there was a party of 30 corporate technical officers. 
 "I dropped in to meet someone for breakfast," said Sue Huffman, a founder of the Television Food Network who was eating at Michael's on a weekday morning last week. "They asked if I had a reservation. For breakfast! I was stunned. They managed to fit us in." 
 New York City's hotel restaurants have always served breakfast -- they have to. And many restaurants capitalize on weekend brunches. But all over the city, in restaurants that are better known for lunch or dinner, breakfast is becoming increasingly important. Breakfast is now on the menu at Balthazar, Otto, @SQC and the Brasserie, among others. And chefs like David Page at Home, Geoffrey Zakarian at Town and Terrance Brennan at Terrance Brennan's Seafood and Chop House are lavishing the attention on breakfast usually reserved for lunch or dinner. 
The simplest explanation is economic. Restaurants can fill tables that would otherwise be empty. "I'm paying rent around the clock, so why not take advantage of it," Scott Campbell, the chef and owner of @SQC on the Upper West Side, said. 
For the business customer, economics is a factor, too. A meeting over breakfast costs the host about one-third the price of a business lunch. Breakfasts in restaurants also tend to be less expensive than at fancy hotels. 
When Mr. Campbell opened @SQC last year, he served only breakfast for the first 10 days. "It was the easiest way to get the place going, to fine-tune it," he said. "Besides, breakfast has changed, especially in this neighborhood. People are no longer tied to offices, they're working -- or not working -- at home, and this is a better option than meeting someone at Starbucks."
Mr. Page, the chef and an owner of Home in Greenwich Village, said the dozen or so breakfast customers he serves every day are mainly people who work at home and are meeting someone. "Serving breakfast pays my sous-chef's salary for the day," Mr. Page said. 
At Michael's it could pay for more than that. The well-dressed crowd often includes executives from the worlds of publishing, real estate and luxury establishments with offices nearby like Cartier, Veuve Clicquot and Mont Blanc.
"We had only two tables when we started seven years ago," Michael McCarty, the restaurant's owner, said. "It took a few years to get it going but now it's packed, and the demand keeps increasing. Regulars make reservations and insist on certain tables, just like lunch." Only cheaper. Breakfast is usually one course, not three, and it does not generally include alcohol.
For Stanislas de Quercize, the president of Cartier, who is a regular at Michael's, a breakfast meeting is more personal than lunch or dinner. "It's an intimate moment at the start of the day," he said. "Michael's is comfortable for me, like a club."
Others are not so happy to be up early. Marc Hacker, an architect in David Rockwell's office, said he found breakfast meetings to be a necessary evil. "They do tend to be more intimate and friendly than lunch or dinner," he said. "Perhaps because you're more exposed at that hour."
Phil Lempert, the food trends editor for the "Today" show, sees breakfast as a growing business not just in New York but around the country. "And not just in hotels," he said. "Restaurants have done an exceptional job of changing their breakfast menus, offering more elaborate fare, for people who don't want to be in and out in 15 minutes."
Robert Gregory, the publisher of Rolling Stone, has business breakfasts at Michael's several times a week. "When I walk into Michael's I feel like a mogul," he said. "Maybe it helps that I'm a regular, but they seem to treat everyone that way. It puts me in a great mood for the day and it also makes my guests feel important." Mr. Gregory sometimes returns to Michael's for lunch.
Indeed, restaurants that open for breakfast have a good chance of seeing business spill over to other times. At Bin 36 in Chicago, Daniel Sachs, an owner, said that his breakfast customers tended to be New Economy entrepreneurs, "the same people who come for dinner."
Nick Valenti, the chairman of Restaurant Associates, which owns the Brasserie, echoed Mr. Sachs. "Once a customer comes in for breakfast, if they're happy it's likely they'll be back for lunch or dinner," he said. Mr. Valenti estimated that the Brasserie serves 150 breakfasts each weekday.
At Balthazar, in SoHo, breakfast is low-key and relaxed, and is considered by some to be New York's best-kept secret. Patrick Martin, the director of the Slow Food organization, a group that approves of a sit-down breakfast, not something grabbed from a coffee cart, called it "civilized." To Marion Nestle, the chairwoman of the food studies department at New York University, breakfast at Balthazar is "a great New York treat."
Though the restaurant always offered a continental breakfast with items from its bakery, recently, Keith McNally, the owner, expanded the breakfast menu to include soft-boiled eggs, shirred eggs and omelets. True enough, it has increased business, but Mr. McNally said another reason for adding the eggs was personal. "I love those dishes," he said. "I miss them, especially the soft-boiled eggs and the oeufs en cocotte." 
Appetites at breakfast often seek the familiar. The anthropologist Margaret Visser wrote in "The Rituals of Dinner" (Grove Weidenfeld, 1991): "We reject, for instance, anything fancy for breakfast, feeling fragile and unadventurous just after the little daily trauma of getting out of bed." 
Just as Mr. McNally has done, other chefs, including Kurt Gutenbrunner at Cafe Sabarsky and Mario Batali at Otto, are offering the breakfast foods they themselves prefer. Tom Colicchio plans to open his new cafe, Wichcraft, for breakfast, partly because he wants to be able to eat breakfast there. 
Breakfast came to Cafe Sabarsky, on the Upper East Side, just last week. The menu is brief: orange juice, soft-boiled eggs in a glass, coffee or tea, and bread, pastries and croissants with Austrian jam. "I want it to be just like in Vienna," Mr. Gutenbrunner said. "It's very simple. Eggs any style is not what it's about."
At Otto, breakfast is just as limited. Blood-orange juice, little Italian rolls stuffed with mortadella, ciabatta with mascarpone and jam, biscotti, gelato and coffee, all served at the bar. It's a menu that the owners say is "evolving." 
"I live right across the street, so it's great for me, and for my family," Mr. Batali, an owner, said. "We open at 9 so we can jump-start the service before people start pounding on the door at 11:30." 
On many mornings, John Leguizamo and his wife, Justine Maurer, are at Otto with their two small children. There are likelyto be only a few other customers. "It's still a secret," Mr. Leguizamo said. 
But as much as they may love Italian food, how many New Yorkers are willing to forgo a bagel with their latte for a mortadella sandwich?
"Breakfast more than any other meal is structured by expectations and governed by cultural conventions," said John Finn, a professor of government at Wesleyan University who is a graduate of the Culinary Institute of America and who teaches a course called "Culture and Cuisine." "There is now developing a code of behavior, rules for a business breakfast. For example, what is appropriate to eat, and how much should you eat when you're having a business meeting? For some people, the nice thing is that you can actually get away with eating just about nothing, which you cannot do at lunch." 
Does that mean that chefs like Mr. Zakarian, who has put items like breakfast panini and house-smoked salmon on the menu at Town, or Mr. Brennan, at Terrance Brennan's Seafood and Chop House, who is scrambling eggs at tableside and offering an array of condiments, including caviar, are wasting their time?
"People are very particular about breakfast," Mr. Zakarian said. "For a new place it takes a couple of years to catch on. It's not like lunch or dinner. No one reviews breakfast." 
Mr. Page of Home said dishes like garlic potato cake with roasted tomato sauce and poached eggs reflected the kind of food he serves at other meals. "It's what we're known for and our customers expect it."
Breakfast food also has a kind of popularity that overrides the morning hour. Norma's opened in the Parker Meridien hotel five years ago, offering a breakfast menu until 3 p.m. 
"Breakfast is something we're obligated to provide because we're a hotel," Deborah Carr, the manager, said. "But we have travelers on different time zones, and in the past people were disappointed when they came in at 10 a.m. and we told them we had stopped serving. Breakfast food is easy food to eat all day long. Now we're grossing $3 million a year on bacon and eggs."

HEADLINE: Alcohol Tax? Bad Idea 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Jim Gogek (Op-Ed, March 13) calls for an increase in alcohol taxes to help states address their budget problems and suggests that such increases will curb alcohol abuse. 
 Taxes already account for 44 percent of the cost of beer. Additional tax increases on beer will raise prices for everyday consumers and harm an industry that contributes billions to the economy. Academic studies have consistently shown that the behavior of illegal under-age and abusive adult drinkers is not affected by the price of alcohol. 
 The beer industry promotes responsible drinking and spends hundreds of millions of dollars on programs aimed at preventing illegal under-age drinking. The industry's commitment, along with that of community leaders, government and law enforcement, has contributed to the steady decline of under-age drinking in America over the past two decades.

HEADLINE: The Former Premier Who Ended China's 'Splendid Isolation' 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH KAHN 

DATELINE: BEIJING, March 18 

 BODY:
Some call Zhu Rongji, China's just-retired prime minister, a visionary who transformed China into a modern market economy. Others say he is a two-faced braggart who bungled a chance to tackle pressing economic and social problems. 
 Good or bad, everyone seems to have an opinion about Mr. Zhu, the former Shanghai mayor who served as China's de facto economic czar for nearly a decade until this week, when he was succeeded by his deputy, Wen Jiabao. 
 Mr. Zhu, 74, appealed to ordinary Chinese because he mastered the art of popular politics. In a nation accustomed to leaders who never deviate from scripts and slogans, he had a gift for extemporaneous speaking, a sardonic sense of humor and a prodigious memory for names and faces. 
Chinese watched mesmerized as he jousted verbally with former President Bill Clinton during a televised news conference in 1999, and the former American treasury secretary, Lawrence H. Summers, often reserved in assessing other financial leaders, called Mr. Zhu "brilliant." 
At home, though, Mr. Zhu did not always master the politics of the Communist Party. He promised dramatic change and delivered only incremental advances. He exploded at senior ministers who did not follow orders. By the end of his term, China's establishment had grown weary of his antics. 
He was tapped to run China's economy in 1993, when the paramount leader, Deng Xiaoping, brought him to Beijing from Shanghai. Mr. Deng said that Mr. Zhu "gets economics." By most accounts, he did. He tamed the rampant inflation of the early 1990's. He overhauled the currency system. He implemented sweeping tax reform that created a revenue bonanza for the central government. 
When Asia was gripped by financial panic in 1997, Mr. Zhu used Keynesian-style spending to keep the economy growing quickly. By 2002, China had become the world's sixth largest economy and attracted more foreign investment than any other country. 
His most lasting legacy may be arranging entry into the World Trade Organization, which required a certain amount of political bullying. Mr. Zhu almost lost his job because of a backlash against the concessions he made to United States and other countries. But membership in the trade body is now seen as a milestone. 
Fred Hu, chief China economist for Goldman Sachs, said Mr. Zhu knew all along that entry into the W.T.O. was about much more than cutting tariffs. "It was a revolution in national outlook, ending the Middle Kingdom's centuries-old penchant for splendid isolation," Mr. Hu wrote in an opinion article for the Asian Wall Street Journal. 
But detractors say that Mr. Zhu had another side. He had great faith in his ability to micromanage the economy. As a result, they say, he never completed the promised transition from central planning to a market economy. The banking system is still hobbled by bad loans to state enterprises and state projects that Mr. Zhu championed. 
Mr. Zhu vowed publicly in 1998 that he would turn around money-losing state companies within three years. Although perhaps 30 million workers were laid off, tens of millions of surplus workers are still paid by state companies that make things no one wants to buy. China still has no national welfare system to care for the unemployed. 
In his farewell speech to China's Parliament, Mr. Zhu acknowledged that he had failed to address growing income inequality between urban residents and farmers, calling it "one of our biggest shortcomings." Admitting his errors set him apart from other Chinese leaders, but it also gave fuel to his critics.
"If you look at the things he promised to do five years ago, not one has truly been realized," Kang Xiaoguang, a political scientist at the Chinese Academy of Science, said. 
Mr. Zhu has blamed the bureaucracy and the party hierarchy for his failure to accomplish more. But China is a one-party state, and Mr. Zhu ran the government. 
"He had great skills as an orator," Mr. Kang said. "But he lacked the essential skills of a politician."

PERSON: Edgar Russell Fiedler 

HEADLINE: Edgar Russell Fiedler, 73, Economist and Treasury Aide 

BYLINE:  By WOLFGANG SAXON 

 BODY:
Edgar Russell Fiedler, a former assistant secretary of the Treasury who later had major jobs at the Conference Board, died on Saturday in Chapel Hill, N.C., where he lived in retirement. A former resident of Scarsdale, N.Y., Mr. Fiedler was 73. 
 He suffered cardiac arrest playing golf and was pronounced dead at a hospital, the family said. 
 Mr. Fiedler retired from the Conference Board, a business research organization in Manhattan, in 1996 as a vice president and economic counselor and remained a senior fellow and adviser at his death. He was assistant Treasury secretary for economic policy from 1971 to 1975 in the Nixon and Ford administrations.
During his tenure, it often fell to him to interpret the government's indexes to the public through years of inflation, recession, price and wage controls, and an oil embargo. He also served on the government's Cost of Living Council.
A native of Milwaukee, Mr. Fiedler was a 1951 graduate of the University of Wisconsin. He received an M.B.A., concentrating on statistics, at the University of Michigan in 1956, and a Ph.D. in economics from New York University in 1970.
Before his government service, he worked in the 1950's and 1960's for Eastman Kodak in Rochester, and Doubleday & Company and the Bankers Trust Company in New York. In the 1980's, he was an adjunct professor of economics at the Columbia Graduate School of Business.
He joined the Conference Board in 1975 as vice president for economic research and moved to the economic counselor's position in 1986. He edited the board's monthly publication, Economic Times, and contributed to its Business Cycle Indicators.
From 1979 until 1993 he edited International Economic Scoreboard, which keeps track and analyzes the leading business indicators of 10 countries. He regularly wrote for the board's Across the Board magazine and other professional journals.
He was a former president of the National Association of Business Economics, and a past chairman of the Conference of Business Economics and the National Economics Club's education foundation.
Mr. Fiedler is survived by his wife of 46 years, Jessie Lichtfeldt Fiedler; a daughter, Carol Therien of Montreal; a son, William, of Chicago; and two grandchildren.

HEADLINE: 9/11 Small-Business Grants Exceed Approved Financing 

BYLINE:  By JOSEPH P. FRIED 

 BODY:
The biggest 9/11 program aiding small businesses in Lower Manhattan has approved payments totaling $49 million more than the amount allotted to the program, and state officials are scrambling to come up with the extra money.
 Meanwhile, business owners needing the money who were told as far back as December that they would get it in three to five weeks, but did not, are now being told to "call back next month" to find out when it might be coming, a group representing such owners says. 
 One businessman, a locksmith and engraver whose shop was in the World Trade Center, said he had been given this instruction in February, and again earlier this month. The businessman, Seth Pehr, said that he was told in late December that $23,000 would be coming in three to five weeks. It was important, he said, because he needed it to buy a van from which to operate, because he cannot afford to set up a new shop. 
A spokesman for the state agency running the program, the Empire State Development Corporation, said on Monday that there had been a surge of applications in the weeks before the Dec. 31 application deadline for the program, the World Trade Center Business Recovery Grant Program. The surge swelled grant-approval totals.
By Monday, 14,233 companies had received grants totaling $530 million, or $49 million more than the $481 million that the agency had established for the program, said the spokesman, Alex Dudley.
The agency, he said, expects that by the time it finishes the backlog of several hundred applications, it will have approved grants totaling about $561 million, which will mean $80 million more will be needed.
He said those numbers were signs of the program's success in reaching out to small-business owners struggling in the wake of the terrorist attack, and expressed confidence that "everyone would get the money they were promised" from the program. "And we understand sooner is better than later," he added.
He said that his agency was working to come up with a combination of two possibilities: reallocating unused funds from its other 9/11 programs and seeking funds from another state agency, the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation. That corporation got $2 billion of the federal money allocated for rebuilding Lower Manhattan, while the Empire State agency received $700 million for its own separate programs.
Although the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation is a subsidiary of the Empire State corporation, any grant from Lower Manhattan to Empire State requires the approval of the Lower Manhattan board and the federal agency that granted the funds, the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
A spokeswoman for the Lower Manhattan Development Corporation, Nancy Poderycki, said that if the Empire State Development Corporation asked for more money, "our board will review and seriously consider the matter." She noted that last May her agency had approved giving $350 million to the Empire State agency, and that the federal agency had also approved the move.
While the agencies deal with aid in terms of hundreds of millions of dollars, the ultimate recipients, like Mr. Pehr, just want to know when they will get their relatively small pieces. 
He is not alone. Mr. Dudley said that about 1,500 of the companies approved for the small-business recovery grants had not received any money, though many of them had been waiting a much shorter time than Mr. Pehr because their applications had been approved more recently. 
Mr. Pehr said the delay meant he continued to work using "my car, the subway, the taxi, whatever works," rather than being able to work from a van. 
"I haven't gotten enough money either through insurance or assistance to open another establishment," he said. When his shop, Daniel Pehr Locksmithand Engraver, named for his father, was in the trade center for 28 years, he said, "I took the elevator, because 95 percent of my customer base came from there."
Jeannine Chanes, a lawyer for From the Ground Up, a group representing many Lower Manhattan small businesses seeking aid from 9/11 programs, said of the business recovery grant program, "Every month, approved applicants are being told to call back next month when there might be money." She added, "What we see is that there is a whole amount of money out there but not in the right bucket."
Critics have also said that for many months last year the program was too slow in reaching out to businesses in need, and that it never provided enough for those that were in the trade center and lost everything.
Under the program, businesses and nonprofit groups with fewer than 500 employees, located from 14th Street to the Battery, are eligible for compensation for economic losses stemming from the terrorist attack. Those that were in the trade center, or in other buildings nearby that were so damaged that they could not reopen, are also eligible if they certify that they will resume operations in the city within a year of receiving a grant.
Grant size depends on location. Businesses and nonprofit groups that were in the trade center or close to it are generally eligible for up to 25 days' worth of losses, to a maximum of $300,000. The smallest grants, in the area from Houston to 14th Street, represent up to three days' worth of losses, to a maximum of $50,000.

HEADLINE: Text of Statement From Federal Reserve 

 BODY:
Following is the text of a statement released by the Federal Reserve yesterday after the Fed's monetary policy panel, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided to leave interest rates unchanged: 
 The Federal Open Market Committee decided today to keep its target for the federal funds rate unchanged at 1 1/4 percent. 
 While incoming economic data since the January meeting have been mixed, recent labor market indicators have proven disappointing. However, the hesitancy of the economic expansion appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties. The committee believes that as those uncertainties lift, as most analysts expect, the accommodative stance of monetary policy, coupled with ongoing growth in productivity, will provide support to economic activity sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time. 
In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation in the short run and their apparent effects on economic decision making, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks with respect to the prospects for its long-run goals of price stability and sustainable economic growth. Rather, the committee decided to refrain from making that determination until some of those uncertainties abate. In the current circumstances, heightened surveillance is particularly informative. 
Voting for the F.O.M.C. monetary policy action were Alan Greenspan, chairman; William J. McDonough, vice chairman; Ben S. Bernanke; Susan S. Bies; J. Alfred Broaddus Jr.; Roger W. Ferguson Jr.; Edward M. Gramlich; Jack Guynn; Donald L. Kohn; Michael H. Moskow; Mark W. Olson; and Robert T. Parry.

HEADLINE: COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE; 
Downtown Struggles While Neighbor Thrives

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL BRICK 

DATELINE: HOUSTON, March 13 

 BODY:
Gary Barnett does not trade natural gas and electricity futures for a living, and there is no indication that he plans to do so. This is something of a disappointment for many people in Houston. Should Mr. Barnett ever take a shine to the idea of trading energy futures, he is the new owner of an ideal place to start, a place that many people here had hoped would be used for that purpose.
 He is president of the Intell Management and Investment Company, which bought the building formerly known as Enron Center South through a bankruptcy court auction for $102 million, about a third of its construction cost. The sale closed on Dec. 30, and Intell has renamed the building 1500 Louisiana, a name that makes its address redundant. 
 The only tenant, the power trading operation that UBS Warburg bought from Enron, plans to move in May. 
Henry J. Terech, a senior vice president at Intell who manages the 40-story tower and who previously oversaw its development as an Enron employee, said he was marketing space to a range of potential tenants.
"The conventional wisdom was this place was going to sell to a Dynegy or a Duke," Mr. Terech said, naming companies that are, in fact, in the business of trading energy futures. "When the energy market melted down, that wasn't the case."
The problems of the power trading companies have steepened the downward slope of a boom-and-bust real estate cycle in the central business district, an echo of previous patterns driven by traditional energy companies. But Houston has diversified its economic base, developing a medical complex about four miles south of downtown. That part of town is thriving, but the traditional downtown remains hostage to boom or bust. 
Vacancy rates for top-class office space downtown have risen to 13.75 percent at the end of 2002, not including sublease space, from 4.94 percent a year earlier, and asking rents have fallen to an average of $24.01 a square foot, from $27.35, the real estate services firm Insignia/ESG said.
"The hope is that there's some large energy companies that can take that space," said Jerald King, a director of Insignia, citing as an example Exxon Mobil, which has offices here in a building that is more than 40 years old. 
"I don't know that any of them will," Mr. King said. "At least for the Enron building, there's still a stigma to it that people can't get over."
Mr. Terech, the manager of 1500 Louisiana, said he planned to market the space at rates comparable to other buildings downtown, emphasizing its modern amenities.
Inside, there are four trading floors, each with a 53,000-square-foot floorplate raised 18 inches to accommodate a maze of 1.3 million feet of data network cable. The cables connect with 475 trading positions, desktops with file cabinets, dwarfed beneath 55 plasma screens.
From just outside an office once intended for Jeffrey K. Skilling, who was once the chief executive of Enron, a luna pearl granite staircase leads down to one trading floor. The building's exterior wall is reinforced to withstand hurricane-force winds; backup generators sit atop the garage; and boardrooms are wired with microphones and videoconferencing equipment.
A few miles away, Houston's other downtown is booming.
The Texas Medical Center, with 22 million square feet of space, is a city within a city, not quite half the 47 million square feet of office space in the central business district. 
The medical center has about 6,000 hospital beds and 60,000 workers. Another 11 million square feet is under construction at a cost of about $1.8 billion, according to the nonprofit group that manages the area.
The group, the Texas Medical Center Corporation, owns 250 undeveloped acres, and the complex is bordered by a bayou, a park and university land. Inside its zone, the corporation leases buildings to medical institutions for 198 years at a dollar a year, so commercial developers and brokers are effectively frozen out.
"We have driven up the price of land by our success," said Richard E. Wainerdi, chief executive of the corporation, noting that it spent $15.7 million in 2000 to buy 22 acres including a 600,000-square-foot building from Nabisco.
Much of this real estate is research space and hospital facilities, along with hotels and restaurants. But the center has 3.6 million square feet of office space, and its market is among the tightest in the country. Insignia places the vacancy rate at zero for top-class buildings, and 10.42 percent for buildings described as Class C, a designation typically applied to older buildings nearing economic obsolescence.
"You've got fancy buildings downtown that can't get these kinds of rental rates," said Jeffrey P. Munger, a senior director of Holliday Fenoglio Fowler, a commercial mortgage banking firm, standing outside Medical Towers, an 18-story building that opened in 1954. Rental rates for older buildings in this part of the city range from $26 to $30 a square foot, Mr. Munger said. 
Back downtown, brokers and building managers consistently cite its ever-increasing list of amenities as reason to think that tenants will return. A 7.5-mile, 16-station light rail system is being installed, and the city has promised that it will be complete, at least as far as the football stadium, in time for the Super Bowl in January.
A $100 million convention center expansion is under way, and there is a new $85 million performing arts center. 
In addition, a developer, Tilman J. Fertitta, has built what might be described as a permanent carnival, the Downtown Aquarium. His $38 million complex on the edge of the central business district has 500,000 gallons of water and 200 species of marine life, as well as seafood restaurants and games and rides not unlike a sanitized Coney Island. His aquarium complex is packed with visitors, mostly children, even on school days.
Downtown brokers and landlords do not expect the aquarium to lure office tenants, and neither does Mr. Fertitta, but they consistently say that another attraction cannot hurt.
"The problem is the oil," Mr. Fertitta said. "Maybe Houston still needs to be a little bit more diversified."
While energy still looms large, its dominance has been diminishing. More than 51 percent of economic activity drawing money into Houston these days comes from sources other than energy, compared with 15.7 percent in 1981, according to the Institute for Regional Forecasting at the University of Houston.
Mr. Barnett, the owner of the former Enron Center South, is counting on that diversity. His building downtown is being marketed to companies in financial services, technology and traditional energy areas.
In addition to the former Enron building, Intell and its affiliates own or are developing 8 million square feet of commercial real estate around the country, including a 1.8- million-square-foot office building at 175 West Jackson Street in Chicago and the W Hotel in Times Square. 
Mr. Barnett's hopes of developing an office tower near Times Square were frustrated last year when he and other property owners on the block lost a legal battle to prevent the state from condemning a site for a new headquarters for The New York Times Company.
Discussing his property in Houston, Mr. Barnett said, "We're seeing lots of interest in our building," adding that there are companies in the suburbs that want to move downtown and companies downtown that want to consolidate their space in more modern buildings. 
"For years, there was no space in downtown Houston," he said. "You have the oil services business and the exploration and development, and those are doing really well now. The only ones that are hurting are the power traders."

HEADLINE: With Little Loans, Mexican Women Overcome 

BYLINE:  By TIM WEINER 

DATELINE: SAN MARCOS ACTEOPAN, Mexico 

 BODY:
Guadalupe Castillo Urena was widowed at 31, left alone with five children when her husband died trying to get to the United States from their hut here in the foothills of Mexico's southern Sierras.
 She was among the poorest of the poor -- scraping by, like half the people in Mexico, and half the world's six billion people, on $2 a day or less, barely surviving. 
 Then an organization called Finca came to the village. It asked the women there -- and only the women -- whether they would be interested in borrowing a little money, at the stiff interest rate of 6 percent a month, to start their own businesses.
Change came. With a loan of about $250, Ms. Urena, now 35, started making hundreds of clay pots this winter. With Finca's help, they were sold in bulk to a wholesaler, who sells them in the city. She pocketed $15 to $20 a week in profit. That sum, the first real money she had ever earned, was enough to help feed her children and pay their school expenses. 
"It's exhausting," she said, "kneading the mud, stoking the kiln. But it's something. An opportunity."
These small loans, known as microcredit or microfinance, are not a charity. They area growing business that is producing wealth in some of the world's poorest countries. 
Experience has taught the lenders to make nearly all their loans -- 95 percent or more -- to women, and preferably those like Ms. Urena who are single mothers.
"Why only women?" said Alejandra Ayala, 36, a participant from this village 100 miles southeast of Mexico City. "Everyone knows women have the capacity to do this. Running a family, running a business, what's the difference?"
Carlos Labarte, director general of Compartamos, a larger group loaning to the poor in Mexico, had his own answer: "The men are not here. They've gone to the United States. Or maybe they're just gone. Or they've died. This is not philosophy. This is reality."
In Mexico alone, companies making these loans are reaching hundreds of thousands of women and children. Those women borrowed and repaid tens of millions of dollars in the last two years. Their default rate on these loans averages 2 percent, considered unusually low in the developed world.
The sums loaned are tiny by most standards, a few hundred dollars in most cases. But they represent a chance for the poor to acquire a little bit of wealth. The money the loans help generate can ensure that a child can attend school or that her mother can buy medicine.
That counts for something in a world where rich and poor nations are undergoing financial shocks, wealthy donors are suffering from compassion fatigue and governments everywhere have thrown up their hands at the failure of antipoverty programs and development schemes.
In Mexico, the best-run little village lenders have grown into something closely resembling banks. That is something new in Mexico. Commerical banks in this country are for rich people. They almost never serve the middle class or the poor, rarely if ever providing them with savings accounts, much less loans or credit.
"People who have nothing to eat and no table to eat on have no trust in institutions," said Serapio Reyes, who oversees 10,300 Finca clients from Cuatla, a two-hour drive southeast of Mexico City.
"They need an institution like us to have a semblance of an economic or financial life," said Mr. Reyes. "They certainly do not have access to a commercial bank. But they have us. And we are an institution based on trust."
Most of the 32 small loan institutions now operating in Mexico started in the 1990's. For many, seed money came from private American foundations or, in at least one case, the United States Agency for International Development. Many are modeled on the Grameen Bank of Bangladesh, run by an American-educated economist named Muhammad Yunis, which now lends roughly $1.2 billion to 2.4 million poor people, overwhelmingly women.
Thousands of village banks based on Mr. Yunis's model have started around the world. But the most successful of these are now outgrowing their modest beginnings.
Compartamos, which is based in Mexico City and whose name means Let's Share, started making loans in 1990. With 140,000 clients today -- 98 percent of them women -- it has a loan portfolio of $45 million and a default rate of just over 2 percent. Compartamos may not be Citibank, but it has the potential to offer more poor people more financial services than any commercial bank in Mexico ever has.
"People don't just need credit," said Mr. Labarte, Compartamos's director general. "They need financial services. They need savings accounts. They need insurance, life insurance, education insurance. These are things that no middle-class person, no poor person, has ever had in Mexico."
Like big banks, institutions that make these small loans can be damaged or destroyed by financial crises or by fraud. Finca's Mexico operation had to restart seven years ago, its managers say, after the peso collapsed and one local manager quit unexpectedly.
The established small loan groups like Finca, whose name means farm, and Compartamos have learned some fundamental lessons about what works and what does not work when it comes to fighting poverty.
What works, first of all, is loaning money to women.
"When you walk into a village, you do not consult the mayor and you do not consult the priest," said John Hatch, Finca's executive director. "You ask, 'Who is the woman in this community that everyone most respects?' Then you ask that woman, 'Would you be willing to convene a meeting at your house?' And at the meeting we start the bank."
The women in San Marcos Acteopan said they reacted with a rainbow of emotions after Finca came to town last year, from fear to fascination. The idea that someone was going to lend them money to start businesses was riveting.
What is also working -- and this is very new -- goes beyond lending money to providing poor people with the ability to save and invest. This has become possible under a new federal law in Mexico providing a legal architecture and regulations for village banks and small loans.
Those measures help combat the fiscal amateurism that had financially threatened some lending organizations, said Mary O'Keefe, who helped start Finca's operations in Mexico 10 years ago and now works as a consultant to the World Bank.
The breakthrough under Mexico's president, Vicente Fox, she said, "is the realization that poor people are deserving of financial services." 
"The trick", she said, "is to create savings. The fact is that poor people can save money."
This fact qualifies as something of a revelation to economists: that given the chance, poor people would put their money into a certificate of deposit, rather than spending it, stashing it under a mattress, or fattening a pig for market.
What does not work in this kind of war on poverty, experience shows, is letting the government run things. When Mr. Fox announced that he was starting a government small-loan program back in December 2000, a week after he took office, Mr. Yunis, the godfather of microcredit, talked him out of it. "Politicians are interested in the votes of the poor," said Mr. Yunis, whose Grameen bank now has three branches in Mexico. "Politicians are not interested in getting the money back." 
Mr. Reyes of Finca Mexico said demand for the loans was so great that he anticipated serving 58,000 clients by 2007, up from 10,300 today.
Among those clients is Escolastica Medina, 43, of San Marcos Acteopan, who borrowed the equivalent of $500 from Finca late last year. 
With the money she bought mud and firewood to make about 1,600 clay pots. She sold them over 15 weeks for about $800, with $110 in interest going back to Finca, an effective annual rate about five times higher than any United States credit card company could legally charge.
She kept about $190 -- "a little money for when my children need something -- enough for food, for school, for their health." Now, she said, "I feel equal to anyone."

HEADLINE: Bruno Pushes for Compromise on State Budget 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 18 

 BODY:
The Republican leader of the State Senate, Joseph L. Bruno, pressed today for a compromise on the budget even as his Democratic counterpart in the Assembly stepped up his criticism of Gov. George E. Pataki.
 Standing with a coalition of union leaders in education and health care, who five months ago were the core of Mr. Pataki's support in his re-election campaign, the Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, said the governor's budget was full of the wrong kind of spending cuts to help balance an $11.5 billion gap in this year and next. 
 Mr. Silver said an analysis showed that Mr. Pataki's cuts in aid to local school districts amounted to $1.4 billion, not $1.2 billion, as all sides had reported earlier, placing a greater burden on localities. Mr. Silver said they would face higher property taxes to close the gaps.
The squabbling was part of another intense day in the Capitol, with Mr. Pataki, Mr. Silver and Mr. Bruno holding separate news conferences as the end of the fiscal year, March 31, draws closer. The three men later met briefly together, but reported little progress.
"It was kind of not a very pleasant discussion," Mr. Bruno said after the meeting. "The question is where does the money come from. And that's what we discussed, just round and round with no conclusions on anything."
Adding to the swirl of the day's maneuvers, Alan G. Hevesi, the state comptroller, proposed a change in the formula for state and local-government contributions to the state pension fund. He said his proposal would save the state government about $600 million next year and save local governments about $1 billion.
Prolonged sluggishness on Wall Street has reduced the value of the pension fund and imposed greater pension costs on the state and localities. Mr. Silver and Mr. Pataki said they were open to Mr. Hevesi's proposal.
Kevin C. Quinn, a spokesman for the State Division of the Budget, said he was pleased that Mr. Hevesi had reacted to Mr. Pataki's calls for action last month, when he proposed a menu of options to delay sharply rising pension costs.
"But our first initial review of it," Mr. Quinn said, "shows that it does not provide the long-term fiscal relief to state and local governments that the governor's plan would."
In discussing revenue at the meeting of the three leaders, Mr. Silver said, the governor was open to closing corporate tax loopholes to raise revenue, an idea that union leaders have been pushing. Mr. Silver said the specific loopholes were not identified, but that a list would be made.
But Mr. Quinn said the governor, in his executive budget, had already proposed closing a number of loopholes, including one that gives certain businesses tax breaks when they buy very large sport utility vehicles, under a provision that was intended to help farmers buy farm equipment.
"And we would look at other proposals like that," Mr. Quinn said, "that would not impact our ability to continue creating jobs and growing the economy."

HEADLINE: Fed Leaves Interest Rates Unchanged 

BYLINE:  By EDMUND L. ANDREWS 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged today, but it also departed from its standard practice by saying that the uncertainties about Iraq were so great that it could not assess the risks of an economic downturn.
 It was the first time that the Fed has refused to comment on the "balance of risks" between inflation and recession since February 2000, when it began announcing the assessment after every decision on monetary policy. 
 The decision leaves the benchmark federal funds rate on overnight loans between banks at 1.25 percent, the lowest in 41 years. But many analysts and traders had been expecting a broad hint about the Fed's willingness to pump money into the system if the economic news did not improve. 
In a statement after the meeting of its Federal Open Market Committee, the Fed said, "In light of the unusually large uncertainties clouding the geopolitical situation, the committee does not believe it can usefully characterize the current balance of risks."
Today's decision reinforces previous statements by Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, that the economy's weakness stems primarily from jitters leading up to a war with Iraq and that the outlook will improve once the issues are resolved.
The Federal Reserve acknowledged that recent economic signals have been "mixed" and that unemployment is "disappointing." But it said the sluggishness of economic recovery "appears to owe importantly to oil price premiums and other aspects of geopolitical uncertainties." Once those "uncertainties lift," it said, the current monetary policy should be "sufficient to engender an improving economic climate over time."
In a hint that it could still move quickly if necessary, the Fed said that "heightened surveillance is particularly informative." That appeared to be a more nebulous and detached reformulation of statements in the past that it would "closely monitor" events, a phrase that analysts have come to interpret as preannouncing a rate cut.
"Mystifying," said Robert S. Gay, a strategist at Commerzbank Securities in New York. "They have completely left the door open to anything they want to do."
Others said the statement simply reflected the unknowns posed by the Iraq situation. "The Fed is flying blind, like the rest of us," said Robert J. Barbera, chief economist at ITG/Hoenig.
Fed officials are hoping that a war will be extremely short, that oil prices will drop quickly and that financial markets will enjoy an extended "relief rally" as a result of the end of waiting.
By contrast, many private economists have become increasingly worried that war anxieties are not the only problem dragging down the economy, and they pointed to several disturbing signs.
The government reported today that housing starts fell by 11 percent last month, the steepest one-month drop since 1994, though part of that decline was a result of the heavy snowstorms in the eastern part of the nation last month. But retail sales are slumping, manufacturing continues to be stagnant and the number of unemployed workers jumped by 308,000 people last month.
Surveys of businesses by the Federal Reserve's regional banks have also been bleak. The Fed's beige book, a compilation of anecdotal reports from around the country, described consumer spending as weak, manufacturing activity as lackluster, business spending as quite soft, and hiring policies as cautious. The nation's factories are running at just 75 percent of capacity, well below normal.
On Monday, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York reported a significant deterioration in conditions facing manufacturers in New York. One quarter of manufacturers in the survey said conditions had worsened, while another 50 percent said conditions had not improved from the existing weak levels.
Given the breadth of discouraging news, some economists worried today that the Federal Reserve was being too sanguine about the effect of that war jitters were having on economic growth.
"Given the degree of softness in the data, that's an awfully big counterweight that they must have," said Robert V. DiClemente, chief United States economist at Salomon Smith Barney.
Mr. Greenspan is expected to pay extremely close attention to the trend in oil prices, which have declined over the last week but are still hovering above $30 a barrel, an unusually high level. Analysts say Mr. Greenspan will also pay special heed to the stock market, insofar as it offers an early indicator of increased investor confidence.
Futures traders also appeared baffled about the Fed's intentions. In Chicago, prices on fed funds futures -- which are essentially a bet about the future direction of the benchmark interest rate -- jumped erratically after today's announcement but eventually settled at prices that imply a 25 percent chance of a rate cut in April.
The Open Market Committee, which sets monetary policy, is not scheduled to meet again until May. But Mr. Greenspan can convene an impromptu session, linking the committee's members by telephone, any time before then.

HEADLINE: New Housing Dropped Sharply in a SnowyMonth 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
Starts on new housing fell 11 percent in February, the Commerce Department reported today, the biggest decline in nine years as snowstorms hampered construction.
 Builders broke ground on homes at an annual pace of 1.622 million units, down from 1.822 million in January, the report said. February's pace was the slowest since April 2002 and less than the 1.728 million forecast in a Bloomberg survey of economists. 
 But home building may rebound in coming months, economists said, with mortgage rates at a record low and building permits, a gauge of future construction, higher than last year's average. Building increases the spending on construction materials and home furnishings and helps underpin the economy.
"It's pretty hard to start houses when the ground is frozen and buried under a couple feet of snow," said Stuart Hoffman, chief economist at PNC Financial Services in Pittsburgh, who forecast that starts would be 1.6 million. "Permits are telling you it's going to rebound in March and April."
Housing starts slowed in the West, suggesting that the February decline was not entirely a result of the weather.
Some economists think that the overall pace of housing may start to cool later in the year. They said that purchase applications, as measured by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, were fewer than in January. New-home sales in January were the weakest in a year after December's record pace.
"We expect the flattening trend in housing to build as the year progresses," said Peter Kretzmer, an economist at Banc of America Securities in New York. "We can, however, expect an initial bulge of activity as buyers who have been waiting for even better rate opportunities now jump into the market."
The decline in February housing starts was the largest since a 17 percent plunge in January 1994.
Starts of single-family homes fell 13.7 percent last month, the biggest decline since January 1991, from a 1.501 million unit pace in January. Single-family homes account for 8 of 10 houses built. February starts of multifamily homes, like apartments and condominiums, rose 1.9 percent, to an annual pace of 327,000.
Building permits rose 0.4 percent, to an annualized 1.786 million units, from 1.779 million units in January. February permits for apartments and other multifamily homes increased 28 percent. They fell 6.8 percent for single-family homes.

HEADLINE: Libertarians Join Liberals in Challenging Sodomy Law 

BYLINE:  By LINDA GREENHOUSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 17 

 BODY:
The constitutional challenge to the Texas "homosexual conduct" law that the Supreme Court will take up next week has galvanized not only traditional gay rights and civil rights organizations, but also libertarian groups that see the case as a chance to deliver their own message to the justices.
 The message is one of freedom from government control over private choices, economic as well as sexual. "Libertarians argue that the government has no business in the bedroom or in the boardroom," Roger Pilon, vice president for legal affairs at the Cato Institute, said today, describing the motivation for the institute, a leading libertarian research organization here, to file a brief on behalf of two gay men who are challenging the Texas law. 
 Dana Berliner, a lawyer for the Institute for Justice, another prominent libertarian group here that also filed a brief, said, "Most people may see this as a case purely about homosexuality, but we don't look at it that way at all." The Institute for Justice usually litigates against government regulation of small business and in favor of "school choice" tuition voucher programs for nonpublic schools. 
"If the government can regulate private sexual behavior, it's hard to imagine what the government couldn't regulate," Ms. Berliner said. "That's almost so basic that it's easy to miss the forest for the trees."
The Texas case is a challenge to a law that makes it a crime for people of the same sex to engage in "deviate sexual intercourse," defined as oral or anal sex. In accepting the case, the justices agreed to consider whether to overturn a 1986 precedent, Bowers v. Hardwick, which upheld a Georgia sodomy law that at least on its face, if not in application, also applied to heterosexuals.
While the Texas case has received enormous attention from gay news media organizations and other groups that view the 1986 decision as particularly notorious, it has been largely overshadowed in a busy Supreme Court term by the challenge to the University of Michigan's affirmative action program. The justices accepted both cases on the same day last December, and briefing has proceeded along identical schedules. The Texas case will be argued March 26 and the Michigan case six days later, on April 1.
Although libertarian-sounding arguments were presented to the court as part of the overall debate over the right to privacy in the Bowers v. Hardwick case, they were not the solitary focus of any of the presentations then. The Institute for Justice had not yet been established, and the Cato Institute, which dates to 1977, had not begun to file legal briefs. Whether the arguments will attract a conservative libertarian-leaning justice like Clarence Thomas, who was not on the court in 1986, remains to be seen.
More traditional conservative groups have entered the case on the state's side, among them the American Center for Law and Justice, a group affiliated with the Rev. Pat Robertson that is a frequent participant in Supreme Court cases.
The split among conservatives demonstrates "a diversity of opinion among our side," Jay Alan Sekulow, the center's chief counsel, said today. He said the decision to come in on the state's side presented a "tough case, one that we approached with reluctance." He said he decided to enter the case after concluding that acceptance of the gay rights arguments by the court might provide a constitutional foundation for same-sex marriage.
The marriage issue also brought other conservative groups into the case on the state's side. "The Texas statute is a reasonable means of promoting and protecting marriage -- the union of a man and a woman," the Family Research Council and Focus on the Family told the court in a joint brief.
While the Texas case underscores the split between social and libertarian conservatives, it is evident at the same time that the alliance between the libertarians and the traditional civil rights organizations is unlikely to extend further. The two are on opposite sides in the University of Michigan case, with both the Cato Institute and the Institute for Justice opposing affirmative action while nearly every traditional civil rights organization has filed a brief on Michigan's side. The Bush administration, which filed a brief opposing the Michigan program, did not take a stand in the Texas case.
In 1986, when the court decided Bowers v. Hardwick, half the states had criminal sodomy laws on their books. Now just 13 do. Texas is one of four, along with Kansas, Oklahoma, and Missouri, with laws that apply only to sexual activity between people of the same sex. The sodomy laws of the other nine states -- Alabama, Florida, Idaho, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, Utah and Virginia -- do not make that distinction. The Georgia law that the Supreme Court upheld was later invalidated by the Georgia Supreme Court.
The Texas law is being challenged by John G. Lawrence and Tyron Garner, who were found having sex in Mr. Lawrence's Houston apartment by police officers who entered through an unlocked door after receiving a report from a neighbor that there was a man with a gun in the apartment. The neighbor was later convicted of filing a false report. The two men were held in jail overnight, prosecuted and fined $200 each. Represented by the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund, they challenged the constitutionality of the law and lost in a middle-level state appeals court. The Texas Supreme Court refused to hear the case.
The United States Supreme Court's decision to take the case has been interpreted on both sides as an indication that the court is likely to rule against the state. Both Texas and the organizations that have filed briefs on its side devote considerable energy in the briefs to trying to convince the justices that granting the case was a mistake, a choice of tactics that is usually an indication of concern that a decision that does reach the merits will be unfavorable.
If the justices do strike down the Texas law, the implications of the decision will depend on which route the court selects from among several that are available. The court could find that by singling out same-sex behavior Texas has violated the constitutional guarantee of equal protection. Because the Bowers v. Hardwick decision did not address equal protection, instead rejecting an argument based on the right to privacy, such a decision would not necessarily require the court to overrule the 1986 precedent.
The Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund's brief for the two men urges the court to go further and rule that any law making private consensual sexual behavior a crime infringes the liberty protected by the Constitution's due process guarantee. Several arguments in its brief appear tailored to Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who voted with the majority in Bowers v. Hardwick but is now assumed, on the basis of her later support for abortion rights and her votes in other due process cases, to be at least open to persuasion.
For example, the brief includes a quotation from Jane Dee Hull, then the Republican governor of Arizona, where Justice O'Connor once served in the Legislature, on signing a bill repealing the state's sodomy law in 2001. "At the end of the day, I returned to one of my most basic beliefs about government: It does not belong in our private lives," Governor Hull said.

HEADLINE: Gasoline Prices, Likely to Stay High, Don't Seem to Be Reducing Demand 

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
Consumers may be complaining mightily about rocketing gasoline prices, but so far they are not buying less, industry experts say. That, in turn, is helping to keep gasoline prices high, given how tight gasoline supplies are now.
 The Energy Information Administration, the analytical arm of the Energy Department, predicts that even if crude oil prices decline over the next few months, retail gasoline prices will probably stay high, averaging about $1.76 a gallon in April. The current average retail price of gasoline is $1.73 a gallon, according to the latest Energy Department data. 
 "At the margin, which is where prices are set, any measurable increase or decrease in demand will have an effect on price," said Lawrence J. Goldstein, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation. "We're seeing a very slow increase in demand. But if demand is still going to grow, prices will stay high relative to crude oil."
Because of changes in Americans' driving habits over the last decade or so, demand for gasoline changes little, even when prices climb. The vehicles that many people are driving, most notably sport utility vehicles and light trucks, get far lower gas mileage than cars did 20 years ago. 
In roughly the same period, the number of drivers has increased over all, as has the number of miles people drive each year, according to David Costello, an analyst with the Energy Information Administration. And despite the widespread complaints about high fuel prices, when adjusted for inflation prices are actually lower than they were at their peak 20 years ago, Mr. Costello said.
"There's no doubt about it that people are grumbling," said Scott Hartman, president of the CHR Corporation, which owns 51 convenience stores with gas stations in the York, Pa., area. "But we don't see any changes in the gallons that they're buying. Actually, we're seeing some nice growth figures."
At its meeting last week in Vienna, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries argued that a seasonal drop in demand would help keep a lid on crude oil prices, which have stayed over $30 for weeks now. Yesterday, the price of crude oil for April delivery fell $3.26, or 9.3 percent, settling at $31.67 a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange. 
Gasoline futures followed suit, with the wholesale price of fuel for April delivery falling 6.52 cents, to 96.19 cents a gallon, the lowest end-of-session price since Feb. 3.
Analysts and traders said that the decreases were impelled by a belief in the oil markets that the expected war with Iraq would be quick and would result in little damage to Iraqi oil fields and installations. But other analysts warned that no one can predict what might happen in Iraq. More important, they said, the underlying factors that have driven up crude oil and gasoline prices persist, and an American victory in Iraq would not change them overnight.
OPEC made a series of output reductions last year that buoyed prices and led oil companies and refiners to draw down their inventories of crude oil and petroleum products. In the winter, when companies normally build stocks of gasoline for the spring and summer, supplies of crude oil plummeted after a strike in Venezuela brought the country's oil exports to a halt.
Then, a cold winter in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic motivated refiners to squeeze more heating oil from a barrel of oil, at the expense of gasoline. Now, supplies of crude oil, gasoline and heating oil are at their lowest levels in years.
Demand for petroleum products usually does dip in the second quarter, as OPEC predicted. But demand for crude oil remains unaffected by seasonal changes. And this year, demand could prove even stronger, especially in the United States, as companies scramble to fill stocks in the short time that remains before the main driving season begins in late spring. As a result, oil prices would probably remain volatile, despite price drops in the last few days.
With crude oil prices so high and stockpiles so low, consumer demand has proved to be an important factor in buoying gasoline prices. The question is, How high do prices have to go before car owners change their driving patterns?
California, where prices commonly exceed $2 a gallon, now has the most expensive gasoline in the country -- a situation related to its environmental regulations. California requires a certain additive to make cleaner-burning gasoline, called ethanol, that constrains how many gallons of gasoline can be wrung from a barrel of oil and complicates the refining process over all.
But Tom Robinson, chief executive of the Robinson Oil Corporation of San Jose, which owns 28 local gas stations, said that despite their complaints about high gas prices, his customers continued to buy as much gasoline as they did before prices shot up.
"In California, we've had numerous run-ups, and this is the highest so far," he said. "And people know when the price goes up, it will come down. This time, it's been publicized more -- the reasons that we have high prices -- the war, Venezuela, the problems compounded by our own situation in California."
Some industry analysts and consumer groups said people might drive less if prices approached $3 a gallon or stayed near $2 a gallon for an extended period. But others contend that consumers adjust to prices -- mainly because they have to, with driving integral to their lives.
"It has been our contention since the 1970's that consumers really don't change their driving habits on the basis of price," said Geoff Sundstrom, a spokesman for the Automobile Association of America. "They only change due to supply problems. At this point, the tightness in the markets is pretty much invisible to consumers in that they're not going to gas stations that have run out of fuel."

HEADLINE: Airlines Announce Cutbacks As They Prepare for War 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD and EDWARD WONG 

 BODY:
The airline industry, already crippled by a weak economy, scrambled yesterday to prepare for the effect of a war with Iraq by suspending and eliminating flights and warning employees to expect emergency cuts in wages and benefits amid signs that air traffic is declining.
 Continental Airlines said yesterday that on April 6 it would cut seven flights a week, from Newark, Cleveland and Houston to London, Paris and Tokyo because of a drop in passenger demand. The Israeli airline El Al, said it was cutting 29 flights a week, 15 percent of its capacity, including 2 to New York, because its passenger levels have dropped 40 percent so far this month. British Airways said that flights to and from Kuwait and Israel would be suspended indefinitely, while Swiss International Air Lines is suspending two of its six weekly flights between Zurich and Cairo. 
 United Airlines, which warned last week that it would cut its capacity 10 percent to 12 percent in the event of war, said it was watching traffic "day by day" to determine when to act. American Airlines and Southwest Airlines said they would wait for a military conflict to start before determining whether to cut back, while US Airways said it had no plans to reduce its flights. 
Still, both US Airways, whose bankruptcy restructuring was approved by a judge yesterday, and United, also operating under bankruptcy protection, warned employees that they might soon face emergency cuts in wages and benefits because of a decline in bookings caused by fears of a war.
"There's no question that the airlines have felt the effect" of passengers' reluctance to book tickets in the face of a war, said Sandy Rederer, an aviation industry consultant in Arlington, Va.
One measure aimed at helping the airlines is to be introduced in Congress today. The Aviation Stabilization Act of 2003 would give airlines access to $3 billion of the $10 billion in federal money that was authorized after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. This would help offset a spike in jet fuel prices brought on by a war, according to an advance draft of the measure.
The bill would also reimburse airlines for the $312 million cost of reinforcing cockpit doors and would guarantee federal terrorism insurance for four years, without an increase in premiums. It would also authorize the Transportation Department to reimburse airlines for losses from a war, a proposal that is likely to stir debate. "That's a stretch," said a senior executive in the transportation industry, who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
But Representative James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota, who planned to introduce the bill, said he would argue in favor of reimbursing the carriers. 
Mr. Oberstar predicted traffic would slump, as it did in reaction to the Persian Gulf war in 1991, and he said the industry would vitally need relief. "This is a proposal based on experience," he said.
In Washington, Transportation Secretary Norman Y. Mineta said the Bush administration was prepared to "move very quickly" to help the air carriers in the event of war.
Despite the promises of assistance, Standard & Poor's, the credit rating agency, placed nine domestic airlines and two European carriers on credit watch with negative implications, citing the prospect that a war would lead to increases in already high fuel prices and would cause bookings to fall further.
Airlines have acknowledged in recent days that their bookings through spring have fallen precipitously, especially on overseas flights. In response, they have eased restrictions placed on tickets to try to reassure passengers nervous about making travel plans.
But Mr. Rederer said the airlines had themselves to blame for failing to predict weaker traffic. For too long, he said, the airlines based their schedules on forecasts that air travel would rebound this year from a sluggish 2002, failing to sense that travelers' sentiment had shifted.
The Federal Aviation Administration released a report yesterday predicting that domestic and international travel would increase this year, though it said a war would put those projections at risk. The F.A.A. said that domestic traffic would climb 3.5 percent and that international traffic would rise 4.7 percent. The report was released only a few days after the Air Transport Association, the industry's main trade group, warned that airlines could lose $10.7 billion this year and be forced to cut up to 70,000 jobs, if a long war ensues.
Daniel Solon, an industry analyst with Avmark International in London, said that any predictions of a recovery this year were overly optimistic. "Everybody's been sitting around telling themselves that after the shooting is over, it'll all be over," he said. "I happen to be bearish on that. I think we'll continue to see embedded weakness in the economy."
No airlines are more vulnerable to weaker traffic than the industry's two bankrupt carriers, United and US Airways.
On Monday, United said in a filing in federal bankruptcy court that it might have to impose 9 percent across-the-board wage and benefit cuts on all its employees, on top of $1 billion in concessions that it ordered soon after filing for bankruptcy in December.
United also said in the filing that it expected that its competitors would be as hard hit as it has been. The company said that in the last several weeks, its domestic bookings had fallen while its international bookings had dropped 30 percent. As a result, United said it expected revenue through June to be nearly $300 million lower than it planned in December, when it filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection.
US Airways said in bankruptcy court yesterday that a war might prompt it to impose a 5 percent cut on its employees' pay and benefits, on top of concessions it had already obtained. It also said that a war might force it to reduce the number of aircraft it flies, something that it had promised its unions it would not do under normal conditions.
The third-most-vulnerable carrier is American, which is negotiating with its unions on $1.8 billion in wage and benefit concessions it said were necessary for it to avoid bankruptcy. A spokesman for American, Todd Burke, said the airline planned only one set of concessions and did not plan to impose emergency cuts.
British Airways said yesterday that it was canceling several flights between London and the Middle East. The airline will cut its service today to Tel Aviv to one flight a day from two, then indefinitely suspend all such flights starting tomorrow. The single daily flight from London to Kuwait, with a stop in Abu Dhabi on the return leg, will be suspended starting today.
The airline is also suspending one of two daily flights between London and Dubai in the United Arab Emirates.
British Airways flies Boeing 777's with four classes of cabins on its Middle East routes. Flights that go over the region to or from Asia will be rerouted. Flights that once switched crews in the Middle East will now do that during a stop in Cyprus because of security concerns.
"We hope to resume services to Kuwait as soon as possible, but will only do so when we feel it's absolutely safe and the commercial demand returns," said John Lampl, a company spokesman.
Jim Faulkner, a spokesman for Air France, said planners in Paris were monitoring traffic on its routes to see whether it needed to cut any flights. Planning has become more difficult because passengers are booking their flights closer to the date of travel, he said.
Thai Airways is canceling flights starting tomorrow from Bangkok to Kuwait and Bahrain.
Delta Air Lines did not make any schedule changes yesterday but said it would allow some passengers with restricted trans-Atlantic tickets to change their destinations, cabin classes or dates of travel without having to pay the standard $200 fee. This policy applies to tickets bought from March 5 to March 31. Such tickets can be changed before May 31 and would be good for travel until the end of the year.
United Airlines announced a similar policy yesterday, though it said its waiver of the standard change fee would apply to any ticket for travel originally scheduled for May 18 or earlier and issued on or before March 31. The company said travelers would need to change the ticket before either the originally scheduled date or April 19, whichever comes first.

HEADLINE: In Battle Over the State Budget, Pataki Is Assailed on All Sides 

BYLINE:  By AL BAKER 

DATELINE: ALBANY, March 18 

 BODY:
With lawmakers deadlocked over how to solve the state's financial crisis, critics are dissecting the budget proposed by Gov. George E. Pataki, and many say his public remarks do not always match the fine print of the proposal.
 Democratic critics say the governor has touted the proposal as a no-new-taxes document, but they predict the impact of cuts in school aid and Medicaid financing will be higher local taxes. 
 Conservatives say that although the governor is urging localities to tighten their belts, it is only recently that the state has taken steps to stop unnecessary spending.
Even Mr. Pataki's fellow Republicans are stymied over the budget, attracted to its political theme of fiscal conservatism but worrying that it will be overly harsh on their constituents. 
"Everyone is jockeying for political advantage," said Blair Horner, the legislative director of the New York Public Interest Research Group, "and the governor is actually in the toughest spot because his budget is unpopular and he is creating a straw man: 'Don't look at my budget over here, just look at my rhetoric over there.' So there is certainly an 'Alice in Wonderland' element about the whole thing."
Mr. Pataki's chief spokeswoman said both the document and the governor were consistent.
While Mr. Pataki is cutting $1.2 billion for education, he is not encouraging local school districts to raise taxes to fill the gap, said his spokeswoman, Lisa Dewald Stoll.
In fact, she said, Mr. Pataki is calling on localities to make the same "tough decisions" that he has made in cutting spending and in setting priorities about policy, like education, health care or public security. He has said the only way to save the health and education programs he is cutting is to turn the economy around, best done by holding the line on broad-based taxes.
"The governor's budget was crafted based on experience and is consistent with the policies he has championed in the past that have grown our economy, helped to create hundreds of thousands of jobs and fueled the record investments New York has made in education, health care and the environment, under the governor's leadership," Ms. Stoll said.
Yet critics of the governor said the budget that includes no "job-killing taxes" calls for $1.4 billion in new taxes and fees, and increases the sales tax on clothing.
Likewise, they said, Mr. Pataki allowed the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, an agency he controls, last month to impose a 50-cent fare increase on city subway riders, a cost that many Democrats consider a tax by another name. Similarly, they say, raising college tuition is a taxlike burden, as well. 
On the spending side, they said, the governor is curbing increases in Medicaid costs but has stayed silent or rejected calls from New York City and other local governments for a fundamental restructuring of the program, so that its steady, costly growth to localities can be reined in. 
And even as he has preached that local governments need to tighten their belts to avoid raising taxes, he has not addressed a proposal made by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other county representatives for the state to take over all Medicaid costs. The localities have argued that Medicaid is their biggest fiscal problem, and the state has all the power to control its costs. (State takeover would cost the state about $1 billion when it can least afford it, Pataki administration officials said.)
To be sure, in politics, there is often a gap between rhetoric and reality. And in this capital, where backroom deals and partisan posturing have been raised to an art form, the governor has not been the only one with a consistency gap.
The State Assembly speaker, Sheldon Silver, a Democrat, says he wants to restore the governor's cuts to local school aid and more than $1 billion worth of service reductions to Medicaid. Yet, as the governor has said, Mr. Silver has so far refused to acknowledge the need to increase state income taxes to pay for it.
And while the State Senate majority leader, Joseph L. Bruno, has played the mediator, trying to be both policy broker and political peacemaker, some longtime lobbyists say his balancing act forces him to straddle the contradictions.
The governor, however, is most vulnerable to this dissection game, as he is the only one of the three Albany leaders who has fully revealed his budget hand, having released his proposal in January. The two leaders have been slowly laying out their positions, but only in response to his.
" 'No job-killing taxes' is really a rhetorical cover for a budget that raises taxes and cuts services," Mr. Horner said. On the other hand, he said, "Attacking the governor's budget is a rhetorical cover for not having one of your own. And in the case of Mr. Bruno, he is trying to be the arbiter, the person who will bring the two together, so he has to keep a foot in both camps."
Mr. Pataki's assertions that state and local governments need to rein in spending is an argument that many, including conservatives, find hard to swallow given that the state has increased its budget by two to three times the rate of inflation over the last several years.
E. J. McMahon, a fiscal analyst with the conservative Manhattan Institute, said he thought even Mr. Pataki's talk about curtailing spending fell short. He said a March 7 memo from Carole E. Stone, the director of the State Division of the Budget, calling for cuts in cellphone use and other administrative expenses, was too little too late.
"Anytime you send out a memo urging your agencies to curb unnecessary spending, it begs the question: 'Why were you spending that much in the first place?"' Mr. McMahon said.
Others also point out that Mr. Pataki has not cut all state costs. For instance, he has stood by his promise to reinstate three additional sick days for members of the Public Employees Federation, a union that supported him during his re-election last fall. Likewise, he has called for cuts in health care programs under the state's Health Care Reform Act, but not to Medicaid reimbursements intended to finance raises for health care workers, fulfilling a campaign promise to 1199/S.E.I.U., the union headed by Dennis Rivera.
Mr. Pataki has said that he does not want to repeat the mistakes of his predecessor, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, who raised taxes in the middle of a recession in the late 1990's. But some critics say Mr. Pataki's budget is remarkably similar in its mix of cuts and new revenues to Mr. Cuomo's. "I say that it is so similar that it is scary," said Frank Mauro of the liberal Fiscal Policy Institute.
Mr. Pataki has said his budget protects funds for security, a theme of his third term. Indeed, he has increased spending for agencies under his control, like the state police and the Office of Public Security.
Thomas A. Reppetto, president of the Citizens Crime Commission, said that while the governor's pro-security stance on the state level was welcomed, "we also need the same kind of strengthening in New York City."
And, say the state and city comptroller, the governor's budget not only does not include new spending for the police, firefighters and other front-line defenders in New York City, it will cost the city hundreds of millions of dollars that will likely result in cuts to those very agencies. 
Mr. Reppetto said he wished the governor would help to reinstate the old tax on New York City commuters, as some city officials have asked.
Mr. Silver has been particularly critical of Governor Pataki, saying the no-tax stance makes no sense in such tough fiscal times -- even as he refuses himself to advocate a tax increase, presumably because Democrats do not want to live up to their tax-and-spend reputation.
But he and others have urged Mr. Pataki to go to Washington and ask the Bush administration and the Republican Congress to help New York. 
"There are a whole bunch of issues the federal government could be helpful in," Mr. Silver said this week. "And they have not done it."

HEADLINE: Technology Briefing Telecommunications:Bankruptcy Filing For Hughes Unit 

BYLINE:  Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
 The unit of the Hughes Electronics Corporation that broadcasts the DirecTV satellite television service in Latin America filed for bankruptcy protection yesterday. The company cited a loss of subscribers and the departure of its chairman. 
DirecTV Latin America said it would ask a judge to approve a $300 million loan from Hughes to continue operating in bankruptcy. The operation, the region's largest satellite TV service, had $600 million in assets and $1.6 billion in debts on Dec. 31, according to papers filed in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del. The declining value of Latin American currencies reduced DirecTV's sales when converted into dollars and the service lost subscribers amid weakness in the region's economies. DirecTV Latin America might eventually merge with the Sky Latin America unit of the News Corporation, investors said. News Corporation executives have said they might buy a controlling stake in Hughes, whose DirecTV unit is the biggest satellite TV service in the United States, with about 11.2 million subscribers. A News Corporation spokesman, Andrew Butcher, declined to comment. In another development, Larry Chapman, president of DirecTV Latin America, was promoted after the chairman, Kevin McGrath, quit yesterday.

HEADLINE: News Corp. to Raise Up to $1.5 Billion With Bond Issue 

BYLINE:  By SUZANNE KAPNER 

DATELINE: LONDON, March 18 

 BODY:
The News Corporation said today that a subsidiary would raise as much as $1.5 billion in capital by issuing bonds that are convertible into shares of British Sky Broadcasting, a pay television company in which the News Corporation has a stake.
 Proceedsfrom the bond issue are meant to help the News Corporation finance its widely expected bid to acquire DirecTV, another satellite pay television operator. 
 Some $715 million of the new money is earmarked to pay down an existing loan that carries a far higher interest rate, sparing the News Corporation about $40 million in interest expense annually, according to Andrew Butcher, a company spokesman. 
The News Corporation, which like British Sky Broadcasting is controlled by Rupert Murdoch, did not specify what it intends to do with the remainder of the proceeds -- anywhere from $635 million to $785 million depending on demand for the bonds. But bankers and analysts expect Mr. Murdoch to put it to use in the United States by offering to buy a stake in DirecTV, the country's No. 2 pay television provider after Comcast. 
"NewsCorp is raising this debt partly to pay down existing debt, but also presumably to potentially finance a purchase of General Motors' stake in DirecTV," Lehman Brothers analysts wrote in a research note published today. 
Mr. Murdoch has made no secret of his interest in DirecTV, a company with nearly 11 million subscribers that he has pursued for at least three years. Buying it would be an important step in expanding his global satellite empire.
But he suffered a setback in 2001 when General Motors agreed to sell its Hughes Electronics division, which includes DirecTV, to EchoStar Communications, a slightly smaller satellite TV competitor. When regulators in Washington rejected the deal on antitrust grounds, they reopened the door to Mr. Murdoch and other possible bidders, including Cablevision, the big cable television carrier, and General Electric. 
More recently, SBC Communications, the second-largest American phone company after Verizon, has held talks with General Motors, raising the possibility of a bidding war with Mr. Murdoch, who had been seen as the only serious contender. 
By issuing the new bonds through its News America unit, the News Corporation runs a small risk of diluting its stake in British Sky Broadcasting, which now stands at 35.4 percent. 
Mr. Butcher said that was unlikely to happen, though, because under the issue's terms Mr. Murdoch retains a right to pay off bondholders in cash rather than in British Sky Broadcasting shares. Bondholders may demand payment starting a year after the bonds are issued, so long as British Sky Broadcasting's shares are trading at least 36 percent higher then than they were at the time the bonds were issued. 
Shares of British Sky Broadcasting fell 3.8 percent, to $:6.10 in London trading. American depository receipts of News Corporation rose 1 percent to $25.03.

HEADLINE: Operation Atlas, Shrugged Off 

 BODY:
In these hours of suspense, as we wait for the opening shot of the war in Iraq, fear of retaliation has taken the nation to orange alert again. The federal government expects local communities to be hypervigilant. This is nothing new for New York City, which remains high on the list of targets for attack. But you would not know that by the level of support the city has gotten from the federal government. 
 New York is the chief example of the Bush administration's failure to underwrite the grass-roots war on terror. The city -- in a position to offer a first line of domestic defense -- has been left to fend for itself, relegated to the status of an ancient Greek city-state while Washington pretends that a national threat is manageable at the local level. 
 Police Commissioner Raymond Kelly has mapped out a comprehensive plan, called Operation Atlas, for preventing attacks in the air, on land, on the waterways and in the subways, wherever people live, work, study, worship or recreate and wherever there are ports of entry. The price will be steep, with police overtime pushing the tab to some $5 million a week even as the city struggles to close a budget shortfall of more than $3 billion. City leaders are determined to deny any opportunity to those who would try to commit terrorism.
But this leaves hard choices for a city that has been suffering economically and psychically ever since Sept. 11. Already, hundreds of thousands of jobs have been lost -- including slots for thousands of new police officers. Meanwhile, there has been a steady cost to the city for national security, about $110 million a year so far. President Bush promised help -- $3.5 billion for first responders in localities across the nation -- but it has remained mostly unfinanced. It may get ever more difficult to be heard while both sides of Pennsylvania Avenue are looking at an initial bill of tens of billions of dollars to attack Iraq and then begin rebuilding it.
But this moment may offer an opportunity to include the defensive needs of the most vulnerable sites on the home front as part of the larger supplemental financing for the war. Mayor Michael Bloomberg has been lobbying Washington and says he is hopeful that the federal government will come through. Others are less optimistic.
Major cities around the nation are reeling from the combined effect of budget crises and the cost of antiterrorism efforts. New York is not alone in going all-out to keep the people safe right now. But as time grinds on and the costs become harder to bear, even the best efforts may slip if Washington fails to pay for the true costs of homeland defense.

HEADLINE: Tax-Cut Plan May Endanger New Housing 

BYLINE:  By DAVID W. CHEN 

 BODY:
Virtually all the rental units for low-income residents that have been built in the last 15 years in the United States have been financed in part by a little-known provision in the nation's tax code: credits given to private corporations for investing in housing for the poor.
 For years, corporations, eager to limit their tax exposure and thus keep their revenues high and shareholders happy, have bought the tax credits at a slight discount, and thus, as a kind of enforced side effect, helped to finance the construction of the kind of unglamorous housing that otherwise might not be built. 
 The financing tool, long known as the low-income housing tax credit, has been so effective that it was one of the strategic ideas at the heart of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's new $3 billion five-year plan to build and renovate more housing than has been built in almost a generation.
But in recent weeks, city officials, housing experts and others have come to realize that Mr. Bloomberg may no longer be able to count on all those instrumental corporate tax dollars. President Bush's tax cut plan, with all of its much-debated breaks for private industry, could all but eliminate the incentive for most corporations to buy the tax credits. Corporations, the officials and experts believe, may simply have more attractive options under the plan for how to maximize and protect their money. 
"We're certainly not willing at this stage to declare a catastrophe or anything," said Jerilyn Perine, commissioner of the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development. "But there's no question that our plan presumes that these tools are available to us. It's something we're concerned about."
The concern stems from the fact that without those tax credits, and the corporate dollars they produce, the city, which is now staring at $4 billion budget hole, would not have enough money to carry out the mayor's ambitious housing agenda.
Adam Weinstein, president and chief executive of the Phipps House Group, one of the city's largest nonprofit housing developers, was blunt in linking Mr. Bush's proposed tax cuts to the mayor's vision.
"So much of the Bloomberg plan depends upon having the credit that the loss of the credit really takes the heart out of the program," said Mr. Weinstein, whose company has used the corporate money to develop or rehabilitate 1,500 low-income housing units in the city. "It guts the program."
In simplest terms, the low-income housing tax credit works like this: Each year, every state receives tax credits from the federal government as a way to stimulate housing construction. The state allocates the credits to specific projects proposed by competing developers -- anything from a two- or three-story building with six units on Eldert Street in Brooklyn's Bushwick neighborhood to a six-story building on Riverside Drive in Harlem. Those developers, who work with community groups, sell the credits to companies, whose cash they use to start the projects.
Since its inception in 1986, the tax credit has generated about $6 billion in private investments to build a million units, or virtually all the low-income rental housing put up across the country. The figure also equals 40 percent of all the apartments, including luxury units, according to the National Council of State Housing Agencies.
But the Bush tax cut plan may remove the rationale for companies to use this tax maneuver. The president's plan, after all, calls for the elimination of taxes on dividends, which would be a huge boon to corporations and their shareholders, and, experts and others say, relieve corporations from any longer having to come up with creative ways to limit tax liability.
Corporations would then feel liberated by the plan to use the earnings they might have otherwise sheltered in housing credits to pay their shareholders tax-free dividends or reinvest them tax-free.
"By making other investments more attractive, tax credits become less attractive," said Prof. Michael H. Schill, director of the Furman Center for Real Estate and Urban Policy at New York University.
Put another way, Professor Schill said, Mr. Bush could make the housing credit so unappealing that even corporations interested in housing would likely offer far less money for the credits, thereby diminishing the capacity of the developers to get as much done.
"Despite what they say in terms of public relations, corporations invest in low-income housing tax credits not because of altruism but primarily because that is one of the few ways their share owners can avoid double taxation," he said. 
The dividend tax proposal would also likely affect tax-free bonds, another important tool in the low-income housing world. If the new dividend tax proposal becomes law, tax-free bonds would suddenly be competing with tax-free dividends for investors' capital. And since those bonds traditionally have a lower yield than stocks, their attractiveness would decrease, making it harder and more costly for developers to produce as much housing.
The Bush tax plan is not yet law, and it has provoked fierce opposition. Thus many lawmakers say it is likely to undergo considerable revision.
But for many, much seems at potential risk. A recent analysis conducted by Ernst & Young for the National Council of State Housing Agencies estimated that if the Bush plan became law, apartment production would drop by 35 percent and 40,000 fewer units would be built each year, with the biggest impact felt disproportionately in "low-income neighborhoods, isolated rural areas and high-cost urban areas."
"To do anything that has an inkling of potentially damaging something that we know is a solid program that works would be mismanagement," said Alan Hirmes, senior managing director of the Related Capital Company in New York, which sells the credits to companies.
In New York, the issue of housing for poor and middle-income residents is receiving more attention than it has since the Koch administration. In December, Mr. Bloomberg proposed that the city build or renovate 65,500 units over the next five years, and build an additional 7,000 units on city-owned land, using cash generated by the housing tax credit, existing capital funds, tax-exempt bonds and other sources.
A budget and policy analyst for the city's Independent Budget Office, Molly Wasow Park, said that the mayor did an impressive job in stretching the city's limited resources to come up with the plan, and even accounted for deep cuts to the city's capital budget. But because of the potential ramifications of the tax plan, she said, "it's all based on a foundation that's changing."
Virtually everything in the plan could be affected, especially the $200 million in private capital that the city had expected the housing credits to generate, as well as hundreds of millions of dollars from the sale of bonds.
In 2002, New York City used roughly $25 million in housing tax credits to attract $200 million in investments to help build an estimated 2,000 low-income units in 100 housing developments, city officials estimated. Over all, since 1988, the city has used roughly $250 million in credits to generate about $1.6 billion in investments to subsidize the production of an estimated 30,000 low-income units for families who make, on average, $23,864 a year, according to city housing officials.
But if the Bush administration's tax cut package passes, the city might be able "to do a couple thousand units a year, maybe, but that's all," said Denise Scott, managing director of the New York office of Local Initiatives Support Corporation, which helps to administer the financing of the projects. "I don't see that the mayor's plan is possible."
A few housing experts, including Professor Schill, believe that the mayor's plan would still be viable, if a bit more modest, without the credit. Still, many housing groups and corporate investors say that projects have been delayed and investment decisions put on hold because of the uncertainty. Some of the leading corporate investors in the past have been JP Morgan Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway and the Wells Fargo Bank.
In public, many housing lobbyists say that they believe that the administration did not intend to scuttle the housing credit, which has had strong bipartisan support in Congress.
But housing groups, both those with Democratic and Republican affiliations, say that administration officials, including some close to Karl Rove, have pressured them in recent weeks to avoid criticizing the tax cut package.
"Some others have felt intimidated about raising this issue because they are worried that they will lose favor with the White House," said F. Barton Harvey 3d, chief executive of the Enterprise Foundation, which is another major nonprofit group that helps to administer the financing of the projects.
Some housing groups with close ties to the Bush administration say that it is necessary to move slowly and cautiously, stressing what they say are the overall economic benefits of a dividend tax cut. A study issued last week by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, said, in fact, that "a failure to pass the administration's growth plan would negatively impact" housing credit prices.
"We need to go slowly, let some of the political fires die down a little, so that more rational heads prevail," said Gerald M. Howard, chief executive of the National Association of Home Builders.
For her part, the housing commissioner, Ms. Perine, disagreed with the most dire predictions of the impact of the White House's tax proposal: that the mayor's housing plan would be completely undone.
"You have a generation of housing and community development professionals who don't remember life without these things," she said. "But in a worst-case scenario, we're potentially looking at one source of funding maybe not being stretched as far, and we'll have to find other ways of doing that. Our plan is still very much in play, and we're still completely committed to it."

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Shares Rise Modestly in Choppy Trading; Bond Prices Fall

BYLINE:  By Bloomberg News 

 BODY:
Amid a countdown to warwith Iraq, blue-chip stocks rose for a fifth day yesterday, giving the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index their longest winning streaks in almost two years.
 Health care issues including Pfizer and Merck led the gain after Bayer, Germany's largest drug maker, won the first case to go to trial in the United States over a cholesterol medication it has withdrawn from the market, Baycol. 
 Indexes bounced between gains and losses before turning higher in the final half-hour of trading. Some investors said prices already reflected optimism that United States military forces would prevail in Iraq within days or weeks. 
"Everyone's now taking a wait-and-see approach -- they want to see that everything goes well," said Jack Ablin, chief investment officer at the Harris Trust and Savings Bank of Chicago.
The Dow advanced 52.31 points, or 0.64 percent, to 8,194.23. The broader S.& P. 500 rose 3.66 points, or 0.42 percent, to 866.45, with health care shares contributing a third of the advance. The technology-laden Nasdaq composite index added 8.28 points, or 0.59 percent, to 1,400.55.
Advancing issues on the New York Stock Exchange exceeded those declining by a margin of about 11 to 9. Volume was 1.56 billion shares, down from 1.70 billion in Monday's sharp rally.
On Monday night, President Bush gave the Iraqi leader, Saddam Hussein, 48 hours to leave the country or face attack. Yesterday, Mr. Hussein rejected Mr. Bush's demand.
"If you're looking to invest now," Mr. Ablin of Harris Trust said, "you probably want to wait the 48 hours."
Drug stocks rose yesterday after a jury cleared Bayer of legal responsibility for the illness of a Texas man who took Baycol.
Pfizer gained 32 cents, to $30.02. Merck rose 82 cents, to $53.02. Bayer's American depository receipts soared $4.16, to $15.40.
Chemical companies, which use oil as a raw material, gained as the commodity price of crude oil fell nearly 10 percent. DuPont added $1.38, to $40.08. Dow Chemical rose 49 cents, to $28.86.
Procter & Gamble, the largest American producer of household goods, rose $1.12, to $86.62, after it agreed to buy Wella of Germany for $5.7 billion plus the assumption of debt.
Boeing, the world's largest aircraft maker, rose 93 cents, to $27.83. The company and General Dynamics won another chance to convince a federal claims court that the Navy improperly canceled a contract to build Stealth aircraft and is not entitled to recoup $2.3 billion. General Dynamics, the maker of the Army's main battle tank, rose $1.49, to $57.75.
Human Genome Sciences climbed 92 cents, to $8.10. The biotechnology company hopes to start human tests of an anthrax vaccine.
Tobacco stocks declined after the Justice Department said in court filings that it wanted companies to forfeit $289 billion in profits made through what it said was fraudulent marketing. Altria Group, the renamed Philip Morris Companies, fell $2.08, to $32.64. R. J. Reynolds, the second-largest tobacco company, dropped $3.12, to $33.57.

Treasury Prices Retreat
(By Reuters) -- Treasury prices fell yesterday after the Federal Reserve, as expected, kept interest rates steady but said that with current world political uncertainty, it could not characterize inflation or contraction as the greater risk to the economy.
The benchmark 10-year Treasury note dropped 19/32, to a price of 99 23/32. The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.91 percent, from 3.83 percent on Monday. The 30-year bond dropped 15/32, to 107 21/32. Its yield climbed to 4.87 percent from 4.80 percent.
Here are the results of yesterday's Treasury auction of a four-week bill:

HEADLINE: Republicans Say They'll Push for Tax Cuts Regardless of War 

BYLINE:  By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
In the face of Democratic arguments that Congress is making a mockery of sound budget procedures, Republican Congressional leaders said today that they were determined to approve deep tax cuts regardless of the cost of a war against Iraq and its aftermath.
 Asked if he favored the 10-year, $726 billion tax package proposed by President Bush before attention became focused on the costs of fighting a war and rebuilding Iraq, Senator Bill Frist of Tennessee, the majority leader, said, "The answer is yes." 
 "I'm in favor of growing the economy, which is absolutely necessary if we are to reduce our deficit over time," Dr. Frist said. 
The first test of Congressional sentiment on taxes is likely to come this week, when the Senate and House are to vote on budgets for the year.
In the Senate, a majority seems to oppose the full package of tax reductions the president says are necessary to spur the economy. But it was not clear today whether a majority supported any alternative either.
One alternative, being offered by a group of moderates from both parties, would allow a tax cut of up to $350 billion in the budget. Senator John B. Breaux, Democrat of Louisiana, a sponsor, said he did not have the votes to pass it, at least not today, because of opposition from senators who opposed any tax reduction.
Democratic leaders are drafting proposals to permit two years of tax reductions focused on middle-income taxpayers. These plans have little, if any, Republican support.
The first votes on the budget were taken tonight. On one of them, the Senate voted 56 to 43 to reject an amendment that would have allowed no tax cuts or spending increases until the president gave Congress a detailed report on what a war would cost.
Dr. Frist said the Senate would approve the budget in one form or another by the end of the week.
The plan, called a budget resolution, is not conclusive. It establishes a framework for the tax and spending decisions Congress will make for the rest of the year.
Democratic senators, saying that heightened security concerns would strain local police and fire crews, said today that they would propose budgeting at least $20 billion more for what they called first responders. Senator Charles E. Schumer of New York said New York City alone would spend more than $5 million a week on added security and overtime.
One senator who says he wants to delay votes on taxes, John McCain, Republican of Arizona, said he was open to the idea of reducing taxes, "but not now." In a speech on the Senate floor, Mr. McCain added, "Not until Congress and the administration have a better understanding of the costs of war and peace."
The administration has refused to estimate the cost of a war, and the budgets before the Senate and House make no provision for war expenditures.
A lawmaker who was briefed at the White House on Monday night before the president's speech said that a war could cost as much as $100 billion and that there would be additional long-range expenses for redeveloping Iraq.
Senators Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Democratic leader, and Edward M. Kennedy, Democrat of Massachusetts, were among the Democrats who said Republicans were irresponsible in demanding budget decisions without counting the cost of war.
Congress, Mr. Kennedy said, should "level with the American people" and "be honest about the burden we are undertaking in Iraq."
Republican leaders in addition to Dr. Frist used the same argument as the majority leader, even the same words, in urging that tax cuts be approved quickly.
John P. Feehery, the spokesman for Speaker J. Dennis Hastert, said Mr. Hastert "supports the president's tax cut because he thinks it's the best way to grow the economy."
The House is to vote on its budget plan on Thursday, and the vote is likely to be close. If their whip counts show that the plan might fail, Republican leaders will probably postpone the vote.

HEADLINE: Bankruptcy Judge Approves Overhaul Planfor US Airways 

BYLINE:  By MICHELINE MAYNARD 

 BODY:
A United States Bankruptcy Court judge approved US Airways' restructuring plan yesterday, clearing the way for the airline to emerge from Chapter 11 protection by March 31.
 The judge, Stephen Mitchell, approved US Airways' plan after it received a strong endorsement from the airline's creditors' committee. Last week, the group voted in favor of the proposal. 
 The judge's action came despite objections from US Airways' pilots, who were upset by the airline's bid to set aside their pension plan and replace it with a program that would pay up to 75 percent less in benefits. Judge Mitchell had ruled that US Airways could dissolve the plan but asked the two sides to negotiate a replacement.
In a statement, US Airways' chief executive, David N. Siegel, said yesterday that the airline would try to resolve the dispute with the pilots and would meet with federal pension officials to discuss its proposed plan.
Once US Airways emerged from bankruptcy, it would be able to draw on $900 million in loan guarantees from the federal Air Transportation Stabilization Board, which had given the airline provisional loan approval, pending its reorganization.
The airline, based in Arlington, Va., will also be able to obtain $240 million in financing from its primarily lender, the Retirement Systems of Alabama, a pension fund. In that role, Retirement Systems had outbid an earlier contender for the airline, the Texas Pacific Group, an investment group led by David Bonderman.
The pension fund, based in Montgomery, Ala., would have the largest stake in the airline, 36.6 percent. It would control 8 of 15 seats on the airline's board, and would have 70 percent voting control. Last week, it named a slate of directors including the pension fund's chief executive, David G. Bronner, and Rono Dutta, a former executive with United Airlines. US Airways' employees, who would hold 31.2 percent of the airline, would have 4 seats on its board.
"This new injection of capital is essential," Mr. Siegel said, "so that we can ride out the impact of war and economic turbulence, and implement our new business plan." 
US Airways filed for bankruptcy protection on Aug. 11, when its air traffic, which is concentrated primarily on the East Coast, failed to rebound after the terrorist attacks on Sept. 11, 2001. Mr. Siegel, who joined US Airways a year ago, tried to stave off a bankruptcy filing through cutbacks and employee concessions.
Under the restructuring plan, US Airways plans to save $1.8 billion a year through wage and benefit concessions granted by its employees; the greater use of efficient regional jets; a code-sharing agreement with United Airlines that it introduced in January, and other changes to its operations. 
US Airways has already enacted a wide-ranging series of cutbacks, including an end to giving out souvenir pilots' wings to young passengers. Yesterday, it said it would join other airlines in offering meals that passengers can purchase on its flights. It plans to charge $7 for breakfast and $10 for lunch and dinner. 
Officials hope the airline can break even in 2004, and return to profitability in 2005, assuming a modest improvement in the airline industry. The company has not reported a profit since 1999.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DEMOCRATS; 
Divided Democrats Concerned About 2004

BYLINE:  By ADAM NAGOURNEY 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 18 

 BODY:
With rising intensity and emotion, the Democratic Party finds itself divided over war in Iraq. The turmoil in the party -- and the rising voices of the antiwar wing -- are shaping the nation's view of the Democrats as they approach a national election that could turn on the question of the country's security, party leaders said.
 Officials in both parties say the image of high-profile Democrats challenging President Bush's war policy right up through his address to the nation on Monday -- and, in fact, beyond the speech, as was clear here today -- could reinforce a perception that Republicans are better suited to deal with threats from abroad. 
 Should that happen, Democrats say, it could pose a serious obstacle for the party if the White House and Congressional contests in 2004 -- unlike the contests of 1992, 1996 and 2000 -- are fought out on issues of national security and foreign policy.
The discord is apparent in every corner of the Democratic Party: on Capitol Hill, among presidential candidates divided over whether it is appropriate even to criticize Mr. Bush's Iraq policy with the nation almost at war, and at gatherings like a Democratic Party convention in California last weekend, where two White House candidates were booed for their pro-war stands. 
Polls show that rank-and-file Democrats are much more likely than the nation at large to oppose an invasion of Iraq, particularly without the consent of the United Nations. Many middle-level Democratic officials, not facing the pressure the party's presidential contenders have to take a stand immediately, are hedging their bets, in part because of the memory of the embarrassment of Democrats who opposed what turned out to be the successful invasion of Iraq by Mr. Bush's father in 1991.
Perhaps the most striking rift has been between the two power centers of the Democratic Party: its Congressional leaders in Washington and some of its best-known presidential candidates.
Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the House Democratic leader, and Senator Tom Daschle of South Dakota, the Senate Democratic leader, criticized Mr. Bush's war policies right until Mr. Bush began his White House speech, reflecting the sentiment of many in their party caucuses. By contrast, four of the major presidential candidates, aware that the electorate that will vote in next year's general presidential election is much more in favor of the war than Democrats, voiced support for removing Mr. Hussein from office, even as they questioned Mr. Bush's diplomatic skills.
Democratic leaders said the divisions were emblematic of a party that has always fought its battles in public, and of an issue -- war and peace -- that has starkly divided Republicans and Democrats since the Vietnam War. Party officials, recalling that President Bush's father lost re-election after waging a successful and popular war against Iraq in 1991, said they remained hopeful that a second Iraq war would also be eclipsed by worries about the economy, and noted that polls showed unhappiness with Mr. Bush's management of it.
Even so, many analysts said the unfolding global turmoil means that foreign affairs could be as central to the 2004 elections as in any presidential race since 1980, when hostages were being held in Teheran and the Soviet Union rattled the West with its invasion of Afghanistan. Several suggested that should the war turn out well for Mr. Bush, he could undercut the Democrats' national security credentials next year. In 2002, Mr. Bush campaigned for a Republican Congress by focusing on Democratic opposition to aspects of legislation creating a domestic security agency.
"I don't think given the instability in the world today that the American people will elect a Democrat as president unless they trust a party on foreign affairs and defense issues," said Howard Wolfson, who was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in 2002, when Democrats lost six seats, an outcome that many Democrats attributed to Mr. Bush's success in focusing on national security.
Mr. Wolfson recalled that his committee's polls charted rapid drops in public support for Democrats when the debate on the Iraq resolution began last fall. "This is a threshold issue," he said. "It's possible that it goes away, but I wouldn't bet on it."
Most Democratic presidential contenders said they would refrain from criticizing Mr. Bush while troops were heading into battle. But Howard Dean, a former governor of Vermont who is running as an antiwar candidate declared he would continue his attacks, war or no war.
Dr. Dean's position prompted concern among aides to his rivals, who suggested today that it was playing into the White House's hands. "If Howard Dean didn't exist, Karl Rove would have to invent him," said a senior adviser to one of Mr. Dean's rivals, in a reference to Mr. Bush's senior political adviser.
One of the Democratic candidates who was booed in California last week, Senator John Kerry of Massachusetts, said today: "In the first few days, America needs to band together and be supportive of the troops. This is not going to take very long, and if Howard -- I think anybody who knows anything about this knows there will be plenty of time to be critical."
Though worried, some Democratic leaders predicted that the potential war with Iraq would ultimately have little effect on the outcome of Mr. Bush's re-election campaign.
"Let's remember that this war -- if there is a war -- is likely to be a distant memory by November of 2004," Gov. Gray Davis of California said.
"The dominant concern will be the economy and what has happened to individual Americans," he said.
Ms. Pelosi said she did not believe Mr. Bush could successfully use the issue against her party. "They try to convey that image of the Democrats as weak on defense," she said. "I don't think we should take that. There is no party position on the war, much to the dismay of our grass-roots constituents."
Still, in a poll conducted for The Los Angeles Times in December, Americans by nearly 2 to 1 said Republicans would do a better job handling national security and the fight against terrorism. 
"The party is more of a party that tends to look for diplomatic solutions before military solutions," said Bob Kerrey, a former Nebraska senator and Vietnam veteran who ran for president in 1992. "It's not the image -- it's what the party is."
At least three of the major Democratic presidential contenders -- Mr. Kerry and Senators Joseph I. Lieberman of Connecticut and John Edwards of North Carolina -- view security as a crucial issue next year. Mr. Kerry gave a speech today outlining measures that he said should be taken to protect Americans from terrorism.
That such opinions exist in the Democratic Party is testimony to how much it has changed since Bill Clinton led it back to power in 1992. He encouraged the rise of a moderate wing that resisted the image of Democrats as weak on defense. 
The four Democratic presidential contenders who support removing Mr. Hussein from power -- Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Senators Kerry, Edwards and Lieberman -- all have ties to the Democratic Leadership Council, the group that helped propel Mr. Clinton's rise to national power.

Hussein Rejects Ultimatum To Leave Iraq in 48 Hours
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq gave a defiant rebuff to President Bush's ultimatum giving him and his two sons until Wednesday to leave Iraq. The streets of Baghdad emptied in anticipation of war. A1

The White House said Saddam Hussein made his "final mistake" when he rejected an ultimatum that he leave Iraq or face war. Administration officials said President Bush was meeting today with military advisers on the details of an attack that might come at any time. A1

The United States and Great Britain made final preparations to wage a war aimed at toppling Saddam Hussein. United States Army and Marine divisions formed an arc of thousands of vehicles, shoulder to shoulder in a sprawling phalanx facing north. A1

America's rationale for using force exposed an overwhelming opposition to war in many nations and a growing resignation as it approached. A1

A meeting between Turkish government officials and Iraqi Kurdish leaders did not yield any pledge from Turkey that its forces would stay out of northern Iraq in the event of war, despite deep American concern about the potential consequences. A14

Prime Minister Tony Blair of Britain, shaken by the resignations of three ministers, defended a government motion to join the United States and back "all means necessary" to disarm Iraq, surviving the greatest challenge by members of his Labor Party in his six years in office. A15

Arafat Creates Premier Post
Yasir Arafat, accusing party members of betraying him, signed legislation to create a post of prime minister after the Palestinian parliament and his Fatah movement forced him to withdraw a proposal to restrict the prime minister's powers. A3

Many States Slow to Heed A Federal Call to Arms
State, local and federal officials stepped up security at sensitive sites as the nation returned to a high level of alert. Many states stopped short of activating the National Guard, despite the Bush administration's call for governors to deploy such troops or state police. A1

The emergency system is ill prepared to rescue children if there is another terrorist attack on American soil, terrorism experts and health providers say. Although planning is better than it was a year ago the experts said, actual preparedness is hardly better than it was before the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001. A22

Senator Tom Daschle, the chamber's top Democrat, called President Bush's diplomatic efforts in the Iraq crisis a miserable failure in a speech that drew strong criticism from the White House and Congressional Republicans. A18

The Democratic Party is divided over war in Iraq. The turmoil in the party -- and the rising voices of the antiwar wing -- are shaping the nation's view of the Democrats as they approach a national election that could turn on the question of the country's security, party leaders said. A18

Republicans Still Seek Tax Cuts
Republican Congressional leaders said that they were determined to approve deep tax cuts regardless of the cost of a war against Iraq and its aftermath, even in the face of Democratic arguments that Congress is making a mockery of sound budget procedures. A24

Farmer in Standoff With Police
A disgruntled tobacco farmer who claimed to have explosives kept scores of police at bay for a second day from his tractor in a pond on the National Mall, shutting down three federal buildings and snarling rush-hour traffic in the center of the capital. A20

Couple Charged in Abduction
The homeless couple arrested last week in the Elizabeth Smart case were each charged in court with six felony counts, including two of aggravated sexual assault that accuse them of raping the girl in her nine months of captivity. A23

HEADLINE: LETTER FROM EUROPE; 
Germans Balk at the Price of Economic Change

BYLINE:  By Richard Bernstein 

DATELINE: BERLIN, March 18 

 BODY:
Given the frequency of protests against an Iraq war in this country lately, you would be forgiven for thinking that the marchers who gathered last Sunday in Berlin were another group demanding, "Nein zum Krieg" -- no to war.
 But they were not. These protesters, several thousand of them, were not even expressing a view on the other great issue in German politicsthese days: the 4.7 million, or 11 percent of the workforce, unemployed and a government in prolonged semiparalysis over what to do about it. The protesters' complaint had to do with a parliamentary decision allowing shopkeepers to stay open four hours longer on Saturdays, so that instead of a mandatory closing time of 4 p.m., they could stay open until 8 p.m. 
 The protesters were saying it would be contrary to what is often referred to as social justice in Germany to require shop employees to work longer hours on weekends. If that seemed slightly out of step in a country in "deep economic crisis," as the daily newspaper Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung put it, a time when talk of deep economic reform is in the air, there they were anyway, embodiments of a political fact of life here. Even rather small changes in the elaborate rules governing economic life inevitably provoke spirited opposition from some quarters.
What does that portend for the long-anticipated program of major economic change, including cuts in the welfare state, that was announced in a major speech by Chancellor Gerhard Schroder on Monday?
Needless to say, what it portends is that Mr. Schroder's program -- criticized by the left and by parts of the right, as too much, and by other parts of the right as not enough -- will pass in Parliament only with great difficulty and, in all likelihood, in a severely attenuated form. If recent history is any guide, the great German social welfare state, widely regarded as the root of the country's economic problems, will emerge from the process largely unscathed.
Germany has one of Europe's strongest commitments to what Mr. Schroder, in past if sporadic efforts at change, has called the nanny state. Many reasons are given for this, but one of them is that Germany has almost no tradition of laissez-faire liberalism of the sort that provided intellectual justification for both the Reagan revolution in the United States years ago, or the Thatcher revolution in Britain.
It may not be exactly a precise measurement, but a look at street names in Berlin might provide a clue to this. If you walk the area around Charlottenburg, a fashionable neighborhood somewhat akin to Manhattan's Upper West Side, you will note that many of the streets are named after great German philosophers.
There are Leibnizstrasse, Kantstrasse, Niebuhrstrasse, and Mommsenstrasse, all for illustrious figures in the great German tradition of moral inquiry. But there is no Adam-Smith-Strasse in Berlin, and in contrast to Austria, the homeland of such free-market avatars as Friedrich Hayek, there are few, if any, pioneering German proponents of economic liberalism.
"The great German cause has always been stability and unity," said Adam S. Posen, a Europe expert at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "The Germans have not gone in for the Anglo-American tradition of individualism and free markets." 
This has been true, Mr. Posen said, since the great 19th-century unifier, Otto von Bismarck, introduced the welfare state to Germany.
"Bismarck provided goodies," Mr. Posen said. "It was unity and stability through goodies provision."
Other factors are often cited to account for the German cultural preference for what is called social peace versus the brutalities, as they are often described here, of American-style capitalism. Among them is the catastrophic economic collapse of the pre-World War II Weimar Republic, which was one of the main causes for the rise of Nazism.
The Germans, partly as a result of this trauma, have been willing to pay the price of economic rigidity in exchange for stability. They have worked hard so that, in the past, they were able to accomplish their goals.
But there is also a sense here now that Germany is failing in the competitive international economy and that something needs to be done. Also, in the newspapers lately was a photograph of a leading free-marketeer and critic of the government, Hans-Olaf Henkel, the vice president of the German Federation of Industry, washing glasses in a Berlin restaurant and being paid about $2.20 for his half-hour of technically illegal labor.
"Strictly speaking," he said of his stint as a temporary worker, "what I did violated the law."
It was a lighthearted jab at the opposite end of the spectrum from the shop-hours rally, a protest against the extensive labor market rules that make it very cumbersome to hire and fire people.
Mr. Henkel, who called the reform program announced Monday by Mr. Schroder a drop of water on a hot stone, said the deeper problem in Germany was that the main parties of both left and right were attached to the German social welfare system. This too would seem to reflect the absence of a strong intellectual tradition of laissez-faire liberalism in German intellectual life.
All of which brings us back to the streets named after philosophers. In fact, there are two streets named after Adam Smith in Germany, though none in Berlin. One is in Bremen and the other in Ingolstadt. 
Another thinker, however, is more popular in Berlin, the capital of a united Germany. Two streets and a square are named after the philosopher most globally famous for his critique of capitalism: Karl Marx.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: TOKYO; 
Japan Premier Supports U.S. On Iraq Stance

BYLINE:  By HOWARD W. FRENCH 

DATELINE: TOKYO, March 18 

 BODY:
In the face of strong and growing opposition, the Japanese prime minister, Junichiro Koizumi, expressed strong support today for the United States' ultimatum to President Saddam Hussein of Iraq to leave his country within 48 hours or face war.
 "Now that it is determined that the extremely dangerous regime of Hussein has no intention to disarm, I believe it appropriate to support America's use of force," Mr. Koizumi told a news conference Tuesday. 
 Mr. Koizumi's foreign minister, Yoriko Kawaguchi, reinforced the Japanese government's message on Tuesday in a meeting with Iraq's interim charge d'affaires, Qasim Shakir. "If Iraq paves the way for the abolition of its weapons of mass destruction with the exile of President Hussein, the Iraqi people will be able to avoid damage stemming from military action," Ms. Kawaguchi was quoted as telling the envoy.
"Prime Minister Koizumi made it clear that because of the constitutional constraints, Japan will not participate in any military action against Iraq," said Hatsuhisa Takashima, a foreign ministry spokesman. "However, the government of Japan will make a thorough study on how to help the rehabilitation and reconstruction of postwar Iraq and contribute to international peace and stability while making utmost efforts to secure the safety of Japanese nationals and to prevent any economic disruption."
Japan's support of American policy toward Iraq has scarcely been in doubt here. But with his public opinion ratings plummeting and opposition to the war rising, Mr. Koizumi had always been careful to hedge his statements. Recently he said that Japan's response to any American attack on Iraq would depend on "the climate of the moment."
A Kyodo News Agency poll conducted Saturday and Sunday put the prime minister's support at 41 percent, his lowest ever. Of the respondents, 53 percent said the government should not back an attack on Iraq. Another Kyodo survey suggested that 68 percent of the country's legislators did not support an attack regardless of whether a United Nations resolution authorizing war was adopted. Numerous recent polls here have shown that over 80 percent of Japanese oppose Washington's threatened use of force in Iraq Japan's streets have grown lively with antiwar protests.
Despite public opinion against the war, Mr. Koizumi said that no additional Security Council resolution would be necessary before the expected attack on Iraq, because past resolutions had already legitimized the use of force to disarm Iraq.

HEADLINE: Split on Iraq May Harm U.S.-Europe Trade Ties 

BYLINE:  By MARK LANDLER with ERIC PFANNER 

DATELINE: FRANKFURT, March 18 

 BODY:
With France and Germany at diplomatic loggerheads with the United States over Iraq, businesspeople here are watching nervously for signs that the trans-Atlantic dispute will spill over into commerce. 
 So far, the only confirmed example of a ruptured business relationship involves a small leather manufacturer in eastern Germany. The company's owner and chief executive, Grit Kuhnt, said it had lost an important American customer because of the German government's lack of support for the United States. 
 The case drew widespread attention here because Ms. Kuhnt wrote an angry letter to Chancellor Gerhard Schroder, urging him to reverse his antiwar stance, so as not to sacrifice German-American friendship on the "altar of short-term political success." 
Mr. Schroder reaffirmed his opposition to military action today; so did President Jacques Chirac of France. The United States and Britain have blamed France for much of the diplomatic impasse. 
In such a toxic atmosphere, rumors about reprisals against French and German companies flare up regularly. The latest was a radio report in Paris on Monday that a French catering company, Sodexho Alliance, had lost a $1 billion contract to supply food to the United States Marine Corps.
Sodexho and the Marine Corps denied the report, though a spokesman for the Marines in Washington, Capt. Nat Fahy, said, "We have fielded a lot of protests over the fact that we have a contract with a French-based company." 
At the start of stock trading in Paris on Monday, Sodexho's shares plunged 14 percent before the confusion was cleared up; it recovered by the end of the day, and the company demanded an inquiry by market regulators.
Other French companies are lowering their national profile in the United States. Accor, the hotel conglomerate, has taken down French flags from 7 of its 10 Sofitel hotels in the United States. 
"It was a precautionary measure to calm the situation," Paul Charoy, a spokesman, said. "There's no political statement behind this. It's more a need we have to keep our customers and employees comfortable." 
For France and Germany, the economic cost of a sundered trade relationship with the United States would be enormous. Germany exports more than $56 billion worth of products a year to the United States, making it the fifth-largest supplier to the American market. France ranks ninth with shipments worth more than $26 billion a year.
France is the fourth-largest foreign investor in the United States, after Britain, Japan and the Netherlands. France and, to a lesser extent, Germany depend on Americans to support their tourism industries. Three million Americans visited France last year. 
Some businesspeople here say the danger to European companies is exaggerated, or at least misplaced.
The rise of the euro's value against the dollar -- which is making European exports, and visits to Europe, more expensive for Americans -- poses a greater threat than any political reaction. The shaky economy in the United States is curbing Americans' appetite for French Champagne and German sports cars irrespective of politics.
Luxury goods makers like LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton of France and Hugo Boss of Germany said they had not detected any reaction against their goods in the United States.
"People buy Hugo Boss suits because they are well made and fashionable, not for any political reason," said Philipp Wolff, a spokesman for the designer, which gets a sixth of its total sales in the United States.
Among German exporters of heavy machinery, however, there is less confidence. In a recent survey conducted by a German trade association, 25 percent of companies said that tension between Berlin and Washington had already negatively affected their dealings in the United States. If the tension persists, 63 percent of the companies predicted it would jeopardize their business relationships.
German automobile executives have also lobbied Chancellor Schroder about the risks to their exports in the United States. Mercedes-Benz and BMW operate huge assembly plants in the United States, which underscores that there are risks on both sides of the Atlantic.
Companies that depend on American government contracts feel especially vulnerable. When the Defense Department recently scaled back a $36 million contract with Krauss-Maffei, a German maker of armored vehicles, the move prompted speculation that the company was a victim of the political crosswinds. United States officials said the decision had nothing to do with Iraq.
American business leaders in Europe are campaigning feverishly to keep these jitters from multiplying.
"Germans worry by nature," Fred B. Irwin, the chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in Germany, said. "I keep reminding them that procurement standards in the United States are so tight."
Business diplomacy has its limits, however. Mr. Irwin tried to mediate between Lederett, the German leather maker, and its American customer, Enefco International, which is based in Auburn, Me. He finally gave up. The owner of Enefco, Norman Farrar, said in his letter terminating his business with Lederett, "Hopefully in the near future the political climate in Germany will change and I will once again feel comfortable using Lederett material."
Nothing has changed yet, a company official said today.

HEADLINE: New Columbia President Has Ambitious Arts Plan 

BYLINE:  By JOHN ROCKWELL 

 BODY:
Universities and colleges come in every size and shape, but in all of them the arts play some role. That role can be curricular or extracurricular. It can be to train professional artists or to try to cultivate an appreciation for the arts among the student body. It can involve teaching by tenured faculty or by famous artists with a greater or looser connection to the institution. It can entail visiting performances and a more or less active curatorial program by the university's museum. And it can take place in a bucolic rural setting or in the middle of a bustling, highly cultured city.
 Lee C. Bollinger, the new president of Columbia University, has long been known for his advocacy of the arts as integral to the university experience. He is also a hands-on reformer, as shown by his determination somehow to reshape the craft-oriented Columbia School of Journalism. 
 Mr. Bollinger comes to New York City after five years as president of the University of Michigan. Ann Arbor may not be entirely bucolic, but it is not New York. So Mr. Bollinger finds himself running a major Ivy League research university in the most highly cultured city in the United States. He gives every sign of relishing the prospect of forging more ambitious, more glamorous bonds between the arts and the university. 
"I can't imagine a great university without a school of the arts," he said in his Lowe Library office, thus effectively depriving Harvard, which lacks such a school, of great-university status. Mr. Bollinger was widely known to have been the runner-up to Lawrence H. Summers in Harvard's search for a new president.
"If you believe, as I do, that the arts are a fundamental means of thought and communication," he went on, "why wouldn't you easily conclude that they must be part of the university community? If I had to choose between an expository form of expression and an intuitive form of expression, I would choose the latter to be more profound. I think it's a false premise that the arts are an add-on to ordinary life."
Mr. Bollinger's plans -- some about to be announced, others more vaguely under discussion -- involve a new building, expansion and upgrading of the School of the Arts and the related undergraduate department of the arts; key appointments of well-known artists (like Mikhail Baryshnikov and stars from the theater and architecture); an aggressive expansion of collaborations with New York arts institutions; high-profile visits of national and international performance groups; and the widespread integration of such visitors into university life and community outreach.
"I couldn't do this in Michigan," he added. "What we can do here in New York City is fantastic."
An early (and to hear him tell it, still vestigial) example of such visits is the series of 12 performances by the Royal Shakespeare Company of an adaptation of Salman Rushdie's novel about the birth of modern India, "Midnight's Children." 
The performances begin tomorrow and continue to March 30 at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, near the university but until now separated from it by geography (Morningside Heights vs. the flatlands) and cultural differences.
Mr. Bollinger sits on the Royal Shakespeare Company board and sponsored its extensive visits to theUniversity of Michigan. The "Midnight's Children" production was produced by Columbia with the company, the University of Michigan and its University Musical Society.
The performances come at the end of a monthlong Midnight Children's Humanities Festival, which includes public dialogues, open rehearsals, readings and debates. Several courses in different departments have been devoted to the play and the issues it raises. A performance will be held for Harlem schoolchildren.
But Mr. Bollinger would like to go beyond that. He imagines Columbia as a "potential partner" with major New York performing institutions and museums, all devoted to the exploration of themes like the Spanish Golden Age or Elizabethan London or Vienna at the turn of the last century. " 'Midnight's Children' is an experiment in this kind of effort," he said. "I think that the usual cultural experience is far too limited."
In the longer term he hopes to initiate a "very major campaign" for a new building for the School of the Arts -- currently in the inadequate Dodge Hall -- and to expand its faculty and programs, all under the continuing leadership of its dean, Bruce W. Ferguson. The new building would be part of a larger "campus planning process" that Mr. Bollinger has initiated. 
Mr. Bollinger said Columbia might expand on the south side of 125th Street near the Hudson River, where it owns property, and possibly to the north. He is especially interested in developing dance and theater programs within the School of the Arts; currently, he said, the affiliated Barnard College for women handles most of those, and would continue to do so, but he wants to refocus attention on those disciplines within the School of the Arts as well.
Mr. Bollinger said his vision for the arts at Columbia was based on his perception of how the arts related to academic life in two models, the liberal arts college and the large research university. (Although there are also hybrid models -- such as Harvard's, which may lack a school of the arts but has a growing, university-supported range of student extracurricular arts activities -- which may flourish in part, some argue, by the very absence of an intimidating faculty presence.)
"In a small liberal-arts college, a permanent faculty may teach, but students participate fully; they are the leading actors, they dance, they direct and design," Mr. Bollinger said. "In a great research university, you can have the greatest artists involved. The students may play subsidiary roles, but they're not front and center. There's a lot to be said for each of those models."
One can raise doubts about some of this. Does New York, with its crazy quilt of cultural life, need more symposiums (which many institutions already provide) and imports? Doesn't Mr. Bollinger's fascination with the Royal Shakespeare Company, which has suffered some critical slings and arrows of its own back home in recent years, have a whiff of eager Anglophilia?
Mr. Bollinger stoutly defends the company, which he called "a superb institution, very much like a university." And he makes a convincing case that a large university can provide a more financially secure form of patronage, freed from budgetary fretting. But ultimately Columbia's new energies in the arts are intended to benefit not just the city but also the university community itself.
One might think that in pursuing his artistic agenda, Mr. Bollinger would encounter resistance from those who felt left out. A law professor himself, publicly devoted to issues of free speech and tolerance, he hastens to stress that expanding the arts will not preclude fund-raising and reforms in other parts of the university.
"Nobody has complained to me about my interest in the arts," he said. "We're going to devote tremendous resources to the sciences, the humanities and to journalism. A major academic conference might cost $200,000 but will have less impact than a magnificent cultural experience. There is a yearning within this institution to become a community, to realize what this university stands for, and to be more closely connected to New York City and to our surrounding community."
Noble words for potential arts philanthropists. But how many of them are left? How, in a time of economic recession and a general decline in cultural philanthropy, does Mr. Bollinger hope to pay for all this?
"One thing I've learned in fund-raising is that you can't try to time the market," he said. "It's always possible to get major gifts. And since it takes years to develop this kind of support, it's impossible to predict how healthy the economy will be in two or five years. So I'm proceeding with only the slightest amount of trepidation."

WHAT LIBERAL MEDIA?
The Truth About Bias and the News
By Eric Alterman
322 pages. Basic Books. $25.
 The attacks on the World Trade Center and our subsequent military involvement in Central Asia shocked Americans into a fleeting recognition of how dependent we actually are on the news media to keep us informed about complex global issues. Now at the brink of a war against Iraq and with the United States trying to redefine its leadership role in the world, we are reminded how crucial it is to have fair and accurate news media at home, especially as we find ourselves dealing with unprecedented national security concerns, resurgent patriotism and increasingly vituperative party politics. 
 Instead of focusing on how journalism might serve this country better as it faces these hours of decision, however, we find ourselves distracted and divided by a barrage of accusations from conservatives charging the media with liberal bias.
Over the last few years a host ofbest-selling books have relentlessly and theatrically attacked major news organizations, not the least of which is The New York Times, as irredeemably liberal. Among them are "Bias: A CBS Insider Exposes How the Media Distort the News," by a former television reporter, Bernard Goldberg; "Slander: Liberal Lies About the American Right," by the media critic Ann Coulter; and "The Savage Nation: Saving America From the Liberal Assault on Our Borders, Language and Culture," by the radio talk-show host Michael Savage.
Now Eric Alterman, media columnist for The Nation, has jumped into the ring and taken off his gloves. In an impressively researched and documented book, "What Liberal Media? The Truth About Bias and the News," he provocatively challenges this conservative wisdom as a mirage. He asserts that what Americans should really fear is the far better organized, more powerful and effective propaganda machine of the right that postulates the presumption of liberal bias through research groups, religious organizations, ideological news organizations and conservative personalities that "skews the entire discourse toward the right." 
"Unbeknownst to millions of Americans who continue to believe that the media are genuinely liberal -- or that conservatives and liberals are engaged in a fair fight of relative equality," Mr. Alterman writes, "liberals are fighting a near-hopeless battle in which they are enormously outmatched." 
He attributes this imbalance and the resulting rightward drift to new media-ownership patterns and to the enthronement of a veritable aristocracy of right-wing talk-show hosts and pundits whose party-line discipline and take-no-prisoners attitude toward liberal guests has kept conservatives "on message," thereby giving their collective movement the appearance of unity and clarity of vision.
"Conservative people tend to see the world in black and white terms, good and evil," observes Bill O'Reilly, the host of the Fox News Channel's "O'Reilly Factor." "Liberals see grays. In any talk format, you have to pound home a strong point of view. If you're not providing controversy and excitement, people won't listen, or watch."
Liberals, on the other hand, do not tend to see themselves as representatives for any ideological movement. Rather than emphasizing discipline, organization and uniformity of message, Mr. Alterman suggests, they favor self-criticism, diversity and fairness, which makes them weaker competitors, especially on the kind of sound-bitten yelling contests that increasingly characterize radio and television.
Regarding the right's savage attacks on Bill Clinton while he was president, "Democrats are not likely to give as good as they got," notes John Harris, White House correspondent for The Washington Post. "They simply aren't as well organized. And they are not shouting as loudly."
While this indisposition to shout may be viewed as a virtue in liberal circles, in the rough-and-tumble world of conservative versus liberal media mud wrestling, it is a liability.
But what really undermines liberals and renders them even less effective competitors, Mr. Alterman writes, is that they are often psychologically "cowed by a combination of conservative criticism and patriotic self-censorship." For example, he suggests that by the last presidential election, "the elite media had so internalized the false message of their own 'liberalism' " that they had lost the ability to defend themselves convincingly. 
While Mr. Alterman is a self-confessed liberal, he is only too eager to throw off the yoke of liberal wishy-washiness and fight fire with fire, taking on neo-conservative writers like Andrew Sullivan, Michael Kelly and Charles Krauthammer, who he claims "have carried the talent for malevolent invective with them like a communicable disease." He is no gentler on the progenitors of Fox-style television, disdaining executives like Roger Ailes, once an adviser to Ronald Reagan and the elder George Bush and now the president of Fox News, for merging political agendas with market fundamentalism. Mr. Ailes is quoted as saying, "News is what people are interested in," then adding, "We're just getting the same girls to dance around shinier poles."
Mr. Alterman is not, however, averse to pointing out the frequently conservative biases of news media celebrities from so-called liberal organizations like The Washington Post, The New York Times and CBS. Howard Kurtz, the media columnist for The Post; Frank Bruni, a Times reporter; and the CBS anchor Dan Rather all come in for some less than worshipful criticism.
But Mr. Alterman does not hold journalists primarily responsible for the parlous state of so much of the news media. Quoting Tom Johnson, the former publisher of The Los Angeles Times and later the president of CNN, he makes the point that it is finally "the owners of the media who decide the quality of the news." 
Much of Mr. Alterman's wrath is reserved for broadcast media, especially cable television news. "Across virtually the entire television punditocracy," he writes somewhat plaintively, "unabashed conservatives dominate, leaving lone liberals to offer themselves up to be beaten up by gangs of marauding right-wingers." 
After jousting with right-wing accusers, Mr. Alterman finally brings the debate back to where it should end: are the American news media up to the task of keeping this democracy well enough informed to make intelligent decisions?
"The current historical moment in journalism is hardly a happy one," he concludes. "These irresponsible attacks come at the cost of the kind of information citizens require to understand the political, social, and economic context of their lives."
In the end, for most in the news media, the challenge is not so much dodging the enervating debate of conservative versus liberal bias, as it is doing credible journalism. As Harold Evans, the former editor of The Times of London, observed, "The problem that many media organizations face is not to stay in business, but to stay in journalism." This is the subtext of Mr. Alterman's interesting book.

HEADLINE: A Most Unsettling Time For French Wineries 

BYLINE:  By JOHN TAGLIABUE 

DATELINE: BORDEAUX, France, March 18 

 BODY:
Paul Pontallier knows the notebooks of Thomas Jefferson -- when he traveled to Bordeaux, what clarets he purchased where. And from his first reading of the Declaration of Independence, Mr. Pontallier became a fan of America.
 "Imagine," he said over lamb chops washed down with a 1989 Chateau Margaux, from the venerable French winery he has managed for close to two decades. "The right to personal happiness framed in the Declaration of Independence. Unthinkable in revolutionary France." 
 Here, not just in the heart, but the very aorta of deep French red, the histories of France and the United States are intertwined like the tangled shoots of a cabernet sauvignon vine.
So the threat of a boycott of French wines by Americans annoyed at the French position on Iraq is hard to take. And it could not come at a worse time for a struggling industry. Last year was a good year, but over all the industry is under siege.
Germany, the French ally on the Iraq issue, is the biggest export market for Bordeaux wines, but that is little consolation. Last year, the value of Bordeaux shipments there slumped 7 percent, because of the sour performance of the German economy.
Mr. Pontallier, 46, whose manner is as gentle as his wines, knows about the New Jersey restaurateur who poured robust bottles of French merlot into the toilet to express his grudge against America's former bon ami.
An hour's drive to the south, Christian Delpeuch, managing director of Ginestet, one of the biggest Bordeaux wine merchants, has faxed copies of The New York Post on his desk, sent by an American friend, with photos of French wines next to California and Australian wines, under the headline "Just Say Non." Over the non-French wines is printed "Oui"; over the French wines "Non."
"It's not just this," Mr. Delpeuch said. "It's the weakness of the dollar, too. That's what troubles me."
French wines have been losing ground in a lot of traditional markets. In Britain, the country that discovered claret, the market share of French wines had fallen by 2000 to less than one-quarter, from almost half 10 years earlier. The winds of change were buffeting small French winemakers everywhere, including Bordeaux, as wines from Australia, California, Chile, South Africa and elsewhere transformed the trade from the largely European monopoly it was when Jefferson strolled the lanes of Bordeaux into a global business.
The French are fighting back. Faced with huge multinational operations like E.& J. Gallo Winery of California and Southcorp of Australia, now the world's largest, the merchants of Bordeaux are banding together, designing new labels and promoting brands alongside the heritage of growing regions, often down to the fields surrounding chateaus.
Mr. Delpeuch's company, Ginestet, is a case in point. Once important Bordeaux wine merchants, the Ginestet family watched its fortunes collapse with the Bordeaux market in the 1970's, and the company was acquired in 1978 by Groupe Taillan, a local rival. With $275 million of annual revenue, Taillan now has long-term contracts with local winemakers and promotes its wines under brand names built around the prestige of Bordeaux. In recent years, Ginestet has had notable success in penetrating Asian markets, and has sales offices in Tokyo and Bangkok. But North America remains a tough nut to crack.
"In the United States, the French and other Europeans have been cannibalized by American brands," he said. "Today, I don't have a recipe for replanting a brand in the United States. We have the product and the brand; what's missing is the financial means to promote it."
To overcome this hurdle, the Bordeaux wine merchants are pooling their money and buying ads to promote the name Bordeaux. Mr. Delpeuch, who is also vice president of the Bordeaux trade association, said the total ad budget would rise this year to more than $23 million, from $19 million in 2002. In American magazines, the ads feature the sensuous curves of wine glasses filled with deep red Bordeaux, and the words: "Fine wines. Be seduced."
The campaign is paying off. Last year, sales of Bordeaux to the United States increased 28 percent by volume, and 13 percent by value, to 182.59 million euros, or $194 million. That leaves the United States just behind Germany as Bordeaux's biggest export customer. Bordeaux's success helped push up overall sales of French wine to the United States by 12.5 percent, to 28.8 million gallons, valued at $913.5 million. France is America's third-largest wine supplier, after Italy and Australia.
Last year, the dollar declined sharply against the euro, making anything sold in euros more expensive for Americans. That frightens some traders here more than the menace of a boycott. "The whole problem is there," said Patrick Bernard, the owner of Millesima, whose two million bottle stock and 35,000 clients worldwide make it one of the biggest Bordeaux merchants. "The dollar has lost against the euro, and the market is expecting cheaper prices for the 2002 vintage. You'd have to cut your prices by 45 percent to give the American consumer the same price. That is more serious than a boycott, which would last a short time."
Mr. Pontallier says that keeping with evolving wine tastes represents a far deeper challenge.
"With New World wines we are not in direct competition," he said. "The challenge is cultural. We don't make the same kind of wine. The challenge is to convince people that our criteria are still valid."
"We are not afraid; but it's a certain challenge."
Hence, any boycott would be painful.
"I am concerned," said Corinne Mentzelopoulos, who this month purchased the share of Chateau Margaux that she did not own from the Agnelli family of Italy. "For the last 20 years, Bordeaux has never been so successful and so prestigious."
Mrs. Mentzelopoulos's father, Andre, a financier born in Athens, acquired Margaux's properties in 1976 for 77 million francs, then worth about $17 million, as a bijou for his wife, Laura -- her mother. The properties are now valued at about $440 million, a 25-fold gain.
"I got letters," she said, referring to the threat of boycott, "and I answered them all."
"America saved us in two world wars and from communism," she said. "I haven't forgotten that."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene; 
American unilateral bravado regarding the war would be misplaced and could be costly when it comes to the economy.

BYLINE:  By Jeff Madrick; Jeff Madrick is the editor of Challenge Magazine and the journal Indicators, and he also teaches at Cooper Union and New School University. His new book is "Why Economies Grow," from Basic Books. E-mail: challenge@mesharpe.com.

 BODY:
THERE have been a number of lofty pronouncements lately from commentators that the deepest interests of the United States and Europe are diverging. The Iraq crisis has obviously inflamed the rhetoric. 
 But those familiar with the economic developments of the last half century must be shocked by such claims. To the contrary, in economic terms, the nations of the developed world have never been so dependent on one another. 
 This includes the United States. Yes, its economy is the most powerful and the wealthiest. But to support its growth, it must attract hundreds of billions of dollars of the world's savings, much of it from Europe. It imports far more than it exports. Many of its best companies are dependent on foreign markets, simultaneously exporting products and importing parts and supplies.
Unilateral bravado on any nation's part is misplaced and will be costly. Increasing friction among allies will exact an economic price on which few people are focusing. 
The place to begin is America's need for foreign investment. The current account deficit, the amount by which imports of goods and services as well as income on financial transactions exceeds exports, must be financed by foreigners to the tune of as much as $500 billion a year. 
As a result, says Catherine Mann of the Institute for International Economics, foreign investors own 36 percent of American government debt, up from 17 percent in 1984, and they hold 18 percent of the corporate debt. Others estimate that European investors alone own 10 percent of American equities. 
Foreign investors, of course, did not buy American assets to do the United States a favor. They made plenty of profit on those investments. 
But in light of how much the United States depends on foreign investors, there is little room for arrogance. A change in investment attitudes can have a significant impact, forcing the dollar down, raising import prices and possibly forcing interest rates up even in a slow economy. In fact, the dollar has fallen about 20 percent in the last year, and foreign investors have been pulling back.
Also, many countries have increasingly opened their doors to American capital in the last decade or so. Such capital flows have been very profitable to American investors and financial companies. The Bush administration wants to end remaining controls on capital mobility. 
This would be an error. Hot, unrestricted capital was quickly withdrawn from Asia in 1997, contributing to the financial crisis. But political friction and growing distrust will also restrain useful changes and needed cooperation among nations. This will involve not only capital flows but also international accounting rules, bankruptcy procedures, World Bank policies and the rescue missions of the International Monetary Fund. 
As for the flow of goods, American imports have risen sharply, to 17 percent of gross domestic product, from about 5 percent in 1970.
But that does not tell the whole story. G.D.P. includes only final sales to consumers and to business for capital investment; it does not include most goods and services bought and sold between companies, like parts and supplies.
In total, Ms. Mann points out, imports come to nearly half of all the durable goods -- like steel products, appliances and cars -- that the nation's individuals and businesses consume.
In a recent Conference Board report, Gail D. Fosler, the board's chief economist, estimated that apparel imports come to 45 percent of domestic consumption by consumers and business. About 42 percent of all computers and office equipment sold are imported. In cars, imports equal almost 30 percent of American purchases. 
The rest of the world is lucky that the United States provides such an exuberant market. But domestic business and consumers also depend on the quality and uniqueness of overseas products, not to mention all that foreign capital.
At the same time, American companies -- often big exporters -- need foreign markets. J. David Richardson, a professor of economics and international relations at Maxwell School of Syracuse University, points out that companies that are both major exporters of products and importers of equipment and supplies often invest the most and pay the highest wages. 
Is this interdependence of trade and capital flows in jeopardy? The answer is yes. Mr. Richardson notes, to take a recent example, that deteriorating relations between President Vicente Fox of Mexico and President Bush over Iraq and terrorism have already resulted in a cooling of important discussions about changes to trade and immigration agreements. And there is a long agenda of trade grievances and needed changes around the world, both among rich countries and between rich nations and poor. 
Political decisions cannot be subject only to economic considerations, but fanciful and ideological claims about inevitably diverging interests are dangerous. They are also on balance simply untrue. 
Dividing the world between friends and foes will be economically costly. Trade and capital flows are by no means the only sources of growth in the world. Too often, workers' rights and environmental degradation have been ignored when it comes to liberalizing trade and capital flows. But few would argue that trade and capital flow have not been major contributors to growth.
Will the world return to business as usual after the Iraq conflagration? I have doubts, especially if more military missions are undertaken. Friction, supported by the new ideological claims, may be becoming embedded.
The economic goal should be the opposite -- to ease the path toward converging interests among developed nations, not to deny them. Even more important, the converging interests between the rich of the West and the poor of Africa, Latin America and the Middle East must be pursued. The latter in particular is essential to fighting terrorism in the long run. There is no standing alone in the contemporary world.

HEADLINE: Morgenthau Is Fighting Cuts to Investigations of Fraud 

BYLINE:  By SUSAN SAULNY 

 BODY:
Faced with as much as $10 million in budget cuts, Robert M. Morgenthau, the Manhattan district attorney, is trying to protect his office's resources by arguing that fighting white-collar crime is literally an investment that pays dividends.
 Prosecuting street criminals brings safer streets and is therefore good for business, tourists and residents. But beyond that, Mr. Morgenthau is arguing that investigations of white-collar and financial fraud in Manhattan deliver "an enormous financial return." 
 Mr. Morgenthau, who runs the largest district attorney's office in the city and has done so since 1975, has taken an unusually public stance on the issue and has taken his argument to the City Council. He contends that the mission of his office is unique in the five boroughs because it covers the financial heart of the city.
Over the last several months alone, investigations of white-collar crime and financial fraud in Manhattan have returned more than $6.3 million to government coffers, most of it from the buyers of fine art who were caught trying to exempt themselves from paying sales taxes. The prosecutors who pursue such cases are now the ones most vulnerable to cuts, Mr. Morgenthau said.
"The only place cuts can come from at this point are investigations," Mr. Morgenthau said. "We think that's shortsighted because investigations raise a lot of money for the city and the state."
Jerry Russo, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said that the Manhattan district attorney's office is not exempt from budget cuts, and that it could take a lesson from other departments in the city which have managed to operate with increasingly less money.
"We are confident that the district attorney will follow the Police Department example of doing more with less," Mr. Russo said, "and driving down crime 18 percent despite having reduced their headcount and their budget." (Mr. Russo said the cuts to which he referred happened over two years.)
The Manhattan district attorney's office has lost almost 15 percent of its budget over the last two fiscal years, and this year's cuts, if they pass unchanged, could lower Mr. Morgenthau's budget another 12.5 percent, to $54.2 million. Negotiations are continuing between the city and the district attorney's office.
Mr. Morgenthau and James Kindler, the chief assistant district attorney, said that they have already pared down the trial division to the bare minimum needed to staff the Manhattan Criminal Court, one of the busiest justice systems in the country. There have been no merit raises since the summer of 2001. Prosecutors routinely work more than 50 hours per week and are not paid overtime. Mr. Morgenthau estimated the unpaid overtime to be worth $17 million last year.
The annual class of 65 or so new hires was pared down to 40 last year. As for perks for the new assistant district attorneys, Mr. Morgenthau said, "we make sure they have a flag" for their offices. "If we're really going a long way, they get a rug and a flag," he said.
The investigations division, which accounts for 45 percent of the staff of 485 assistant district attorneys, is home to many prosecutors with rare expertise in complex financial investigation.
"You lose an experienced investigator, and you can't go out and hire someone with similar experience because they're not out there," Mr. Kindler said.
Some in the legal community say that the burden on big city prosecutors has grown, even as crime has fallen nationally. They say local and state prosecutors are taking more of the sort of cases that would have traditionally gone to the federal courts: expensive, labor-intensive financial investigations.
"Across the country we are experiencing cutbacks in the number of cases the federal government traditionally did because they are reorganizing their resources to do homeland security cases," said Dan M. Alsobrooks, the president of the National District Attorneys Association. "This is a very poor time to be cutting back on resources."
The amount of investigating a district attorney is compelled to do is also a function of location, Mr. Alsobrooks said, so it should come as no surprise that the Manhattan district attorney's office would use a significant part of its budget on financial fraud.
Mr. Morgenthau told the City Council this month that he feels his office must ensure fair-dealing in business and labor practices and maintain the integrity of the financial markets because it is located in Manhattan. "We're looking at cases that affect the economic and social viability of the city," he said.
Mr. Morgenthau said recent events, including the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, and the stock market boom and bust, have created unprecedented opportunities for fraud. "It's worse now," he said, "the whole system of checks and balances seems to have broken down."
In one case being handled at the moment, investigators are trying to understand why an unlicensed Midtown money transmitter wired more than $3 billion last year to an off-shore bank, keeping the identities of the account holders hidden along with any hint of why they might want to stash billions of dollars in the Bahamas, among other places.
The answer to Mr. Morgenthau's questions might lie in 270 boxes of financial records that court-authorized search warrants have allowed his investigators to collect. If the parties involved are indicted on tax evasion charges and Mr. Morgenthau is able to successfully prosecute them, he said the government could expect to collect its due of $3 billion -- an amount that far exceeds the proposed budget cuts.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Expects City's Recession to Linger 

BYLINE:  By MICHAEL COOPER 

 BODY:
City Comptroller William C. Thompson Jr. said yesterday that he expected the city to remain in recession this year for the third year in a row.
 "We still see this year as a bad year," Mr. Thompson said during a lunch with editors and reporters of The New York Times. "We see next year as, at most, I guess you would say, a flat year." 
 Mr. Thompson said that his prediction that the recession would linger took into account the possible economic effects of a war with Iraq, effects that he said would be difficult to estimate without knowing the duration of a war. He made the forecast a week after his office released a report showing that the city's economy remained in recession during 2002, even as the national economy began to grow moderately.
The bleak economic outlook makes it more difficult to close a city budget gap for the fiscal year beginning July 1. Mr. Thompson estimates that gap at $3.9 billion, and he said it had widened because of proposals by Gov. George E. Pataki that would cost the city money. Mr. Thompson held out hope that the city could win approval for some form of restored commuter tax, but not at the rate that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg is seeking.
To make up for the difference, he said, the city will have to look at other possible sources of revenue. He said his office was studying the effects of imposing a surcharge on the personal income tax of high-income people for a limited time.
Mr. Thompson was cool to a proposal for the city to swap the land under La Guardia and Kennedy Airports, which the city owns, by giving it to the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey in exchange for the land of the World Trade Center site. He said he was not sure the trade would be a good deal for the city because the airports could provide significant revenue if the city was able to raise the rent for them.

HEADLINE: House Votes To Make It Harder to Seek Bankruptcy 

BYLINE:  By CARL HULSE 

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, March 19 

 BODY:
The House voted overwhelmingly today to make it harder for people to eliminate their debts by filing for bankruptcy, heeding complaints from lenders and businesses that the system is being abused.
 Opponents of the measure, adopted 315 to 113, said it was flawed and ill timed because it could fall hardest on people already struggling in a troubled economy. 
 The authors of the long-sought overhaul of the bankruptcy system said it was intended to prevent people who could afford to pay some of their debts from using the courts to escape payment while protecting those who were truly strapped.
"For someone who is genuinely down and out and has no chance of repaying their debt, it doesn't change the law at all," said Representative F. James Sensenbrenner Jr., Republican of Wisconsin, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee. 
Mr. Sensenbrenner said the measure would force people who have some capacity to pay their debts to do so over the course of five years. "I don't think there is anything wrong with that," Mr. Sensenbrenner said.
Some Democrats, joined by consumer groups and labor organizations, said the measure was a bow to politically influential banks and credit card companies. The opponents said the lenders contributed to the problem by making credit too easy to obtain and already profited substantially from that part of their business.
"This is purely a bill by and for the large credit card companies and big banks," said Representative Jerrold Nadler, Democrat of Brooklyn, who offered a Democratic alternative that was soundly defeated.
The bankruptcy measure has been circulating in Congress for years, and its fate in the Senate, where it has been caught up in an abortion debate, remains uncertain. The bill nearly passed Congress last November but died when opponents of abortion refused to support it because of a provision that would prevent protesters who block access to abortion clinics from avoiding court fines through bankruptcy.
That provision is not in the measure that cleared the House today, but Senator Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of New York, indicated he would try to attach it in the Senate.
"Just as creditors need protection from abuses of the bankruptcy law, so do women who are trying to protect their constitutionally given rights," Mr. Schumer said.
Proponents of the bankruptcy changes said they hoped they could finally move the measure without the abortion language, with the Senate under Republican control.
"We are going to work very hard to keep that out of the final bill," Representative Christopher B. Cannon, Republican of Utah, said, adding that he believed the margin of support in the House was the largest it had ever been in the half-dozen times the measure had been on the floor. 
All 225 Republicans voting supported the measure, along with 90 Democrats; 112 Democrats and an independent voted no.
Under the proposal adopted by the House, people filing for bankruptcy would undergo a screening that would dismiss those deemed to have sufficient resources to pay their debts or shift them to a process known as Chapter 13. People in that category agree to repay part of their obligations over five years as opposed to those filing under Chapter 7, which discharges most debts.
Credit card companies and banks say some people are gaming the system after running up large debts and then walking away from them. According to the United States Chamber of Commerce, bankruptcies have risen to 1.4 million a year from 348,000 over the last 15 years and cost other borrowers an estimated $400 each a year. 
"It is vital to our economy to bring a sense of personal responsibility back into a critically flawed system," Thomas Donohue, the chamber president, said.
Opponents of the bill say that the percentage of abuse is small and thatthe overhaul is poorly conceived since it considers in its screening process income that might no longer be available to someone who has lost his job.
"It is against the best interests of America to punish those families pummeled by record unemployment and soaring health care costs with inflexible bankruptcy reform," said John J. Sweeney, president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: ANKARA; 
Turkey Limits Military Help to U.S. on Iraq

BYLINE:  By FRANK BRUNI 

DATELINE: ANKARA, Turkey, March 19 

 BODY:
Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said today that Turkey was poised only to open its airspace to American warplanes bound for Iraq, a degree of military cooperation vastly more limited than the United States had initially sought.
 Mr. Erdogan and other senior government officials said a resolution to be debated in the Turkish Parliament, probably on Thursday, would not authorize United States forces to use Turkish air bases and would not permit the movement of American ground troops through Turkey. 
 Citing that decision, both Turkish and American officials said today that Turkey would not receive a special package of at least $6 billion in new aid that the United States had offered. The aid was tied to full military cooperation, and those officials said it would be either scaled back substantially or eliminated. 
Today's developments caused an immediate plunge in stocks here. They also represented a setback for American military planning and reflected a serious strain in relations between Turkey and the United States, longtime allies and NATO partners.
"These two countries are strong partners," said a senior Turkish government official. But, the official added: "If you said there would be no impact on our relationship, that's unrealistic. There is going to be a sort of mark, especially on the American side. They are more upset than we are."
Even the use of airspace was not entirely settled, because the Turkish Parliament has to vote on it. Almost three weeks ago, the Parliament narrowly rejected an earlier resolution to allow American ground troops in Turkey and the use of Turkish bases and airspace.
The United States had wanted to move armed forces across the southeastern border of Turkey into northern Iraq at the start of an invasion, an option that might have expedited a military victory. For months, American officials pushed for such permission and were at times assured by the Turkish government that it was coming.
It is now out of the question. So is the possibility of using American military aircraft at the Incirlik base in southern Turkey for any imminent war efforts. Those jets have long flown from Incirlik to enforce a no-fly zone over northern Iraq.
Asked today if the new parliamentary resolution included American use of Turkish bases or the ability to have planes refuel in Turkey, Mr. Erdogan said, "No, none of those are in it," according to the Turkish state-run news agency.
Turkish government officials predicted that the scaled-back resolution for air rights would pass, but several Turkish politicians who strongly opposed the previous measure spoke out just as emphatically today against the new one.
In addition, a senior member of Mr. Erdogan's Justice and Development Party said in an interview that the withdrawal of the full American aid package might embitter some members of Parliament.
Both Turkish and American government officials said a new, reduced package could still be negotiated, especially if Turkey decided later to increase its cooperation with American military efforts in Iraq.
Justice Minister Cemil Cicek said today that a parliamentary motion to allow American troops into Turkey could re-emerge, prompting financial aid.
Turkish government officials fear that the country could suffer dire economic consequences from a war in Iraq. They say that Turkey lost of tens of billions of dollars in diminished trade and tourism after the Persian Gulf war in 1991.
They also worry that a war could lead to the establishment of an independent Kurdish state in northern Iraq and rekindle separatist demands among Kurds in southeastern Turkey, some of whom waged a prolonged, bloody campaign for autonomy during the 1990's.
In addition, the Turkish government is on guard against any movement of refugees into Turkey. Government officials said the new parliamentary resolution would include authorization for Turkish troops to enter northern Iraq to prevent that, although American officials are still urging Turkey to keep troops away.
Iraqi Kurds have warned in the past that they might shoot at Turkish soldiers coming into the region.
Zalmay Khalilzad, the American special envoy to the Iraqi opposition, concluded talks in Ankara today that were intended to ease tensions between Turkish government officials and Iraqi Kurds.
Those talks produced public assurances from Iraqi Kurds that they would put their military forces under the command of an American-led alliance.
Over the last two weeks, Mr. Erdogan's government had sent conflicting signals to the United States about how much military help Turkey could offer, and today began with Mr. Cicek saying that the new parliamentary resolution would include permission for American troops. Little more than an hour later, Mr. Cicek said it would cover only air rights.
In the brief span of time between those statements, Secretary of State Colin L. Powell told the Turkish government that at this late juncture, air rights were the Bush administration's overriding interest.

HEADLINE: State Budget Cuts Endanger Famed Psychiatric Center 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: ORANGEBURG, N.Y. 

 BODY:
For a half-century, the Nathan S. Kline Institute, a state-owned psychiatric research center here, has won renown for its research on mental health, from drug treatments for Alzheimer's disease to violence among the homeless mentally ill.
 But as of July 1, under a budget proposal by Gov. George E. Pataki, the institute, in Rockland County, will no longer exist. Instead, it will become a satellite campus of the larger New York State Psychiatric Institute in Manhattan, and the state will eliminate 113 research positions from the combined institutions, with most coming from Kline. 
 The state has moved to close Kline as part of a huge package of cuts across all agencies meant to close a $11.5 billion budget gap over the next two years. The state's Office of Mental Health estimates that the state would save $7.8 million in the first year by merging the two centers.
The plan, which requires legislative approval, also calls for closing, by July, three upstate psychiatric centers that have fewer than 125 patients each, and closing the Bronx Psychiatric Center and the Bronx Children's Psychiatric Center in 2005.
As for Kline, state officials say their goal is to end duplication of research efforts at the two institutes.
"The fact is that New York leads the country in terms of psychiatric research and will continue to do so," said Roger Klingman, a spokesman for the Office of Mental Health. "The idea is to preserve key areas of research and as much as possible go for administrative savings."
But researchers and advocates for the mentally ill say the merger will amount to a closing -- and a significant loss for mental health research, which has witnessed promising advances in recent years. They say Kline is noted for its applied research, looking at the practical problems of people living with mental illnesses.
Besides its studies of brain imaging and new drug treatments, the center, on the grounds of Rockland Psychiatric Center, has explored aggressive behavior, the impact of managed care on mental health financing and the dual diagnosis of mental illness and drug addiction.
"We're devastated," said Rena Finkelstein, co-president of the Rockland County chapter of the National Alliance for the Mentally Ill. "It's a terrible blow to research."
Ms. Finkelstein, who sits on the center's institutional review board, overseeing research protocols, said researchers there brought in an additional $15 million a year in the form of foundation and government grants. "Some of them are multiyear grants, and they will come to a grinding halt," she said.
Legislative approval for the merger, and the rest of the cuts, is far from certain. On Wednesday, a State Supreme Court justice temporarily halted preparations for closing the three upstate centers until he hears a legal complaint brought by public employees' unions. 
A particular concern at Klein is the conflicting affiliations of the two centers to be merged. New York State Psychiatric is affiliated with Columbia University, while Kline has had a relationship with the New York University School of Medicine since 1979. Many researchers at Kline hold faculty positions at N.Y.U. and much of the research work takes place at N.Y.U.'s campus in Manhattan.
Researchers at Kline, who have been told by the Office of Mental Health not to talk to reporters about the planned closing, said that even if their positions were spared, their research would be jeopardized without access to N.Y.U.
"It's much more complicated than saying you'll cherry-pick the best research programs," said one researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. "How do you move people from one institution to another? The work I was doing, work that I thought was important for New York State, will now be interrupted for years."
Concerned about the impact of the merger, N.Y.U. has contacted state officials to try to work out a solution. In a letter to the commissioner of the Office of Mental Health, Dr. Robert Glickman, dean of the School of Medicine, even proposed that N.Y.U. acquire Kline.
But Dr. Andrew W. Brotman, vice dean for Clinical and Hospital Affairs at the N.Y.U. School of Medicine, said that so far the state had not been receptive in talks. "Attempts to come up with other solutions that would save the state the same amount of money have not been successful on our part," he said.
Dr. Brotman said state officials had indicated that the "bulk of the positions will come out of Kline" rather than the Psychiatric Institute.
This is not the first time Kline has been threatened. In 1991, during the financial crunch of the last recession, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's budget cutters proposed its closing,questioning the need for two research centers. But Kline was ultimately spared, in part because of the different missions of the two research institutes.
"Psychiatric Institute does basic research, and Nathan Kline really focuses on what impact services have on patients today," said Richard C. Surles, a former commissioner of the Office of Mental Health who fought to keep the Rockland research center.
While it is not a treatment center per se, Kline does provide treatment to local residents through experimental drug therapies that are not yet approved by the federal Food and Drug Administration.
Some families in Rockland County expressed dismay that their relatives might lose access to drugs if the merger went forward. Rose Angerame of Nanuet said her husband, Anthony, 83, had benefited from an Alzheimer's drug used in Europe but not available in the United States.
Mr. Angerame has taken the drug for about a year, with careful follow-up and monitoring at Kline. "They are amazed at how it has maintained the illness," Mrs. Angerame said. "It has not gotten worse, and there are no side effects at all. I'm very concerned."
Mr. Klingman said that some research would continue at Kline, whose two-story mocha-colored building here underwent a $40 million makeover four years ago. But Dr. Brotman said the cuts would hurt mental health research in general.
"We worry that this size of a cut and the elimination of Kline as a separate entity will result in instability among the remaining people," he said. "It is not possible to surgically remove programs from a site like that."

A City in Fear Loses Some Of Its Swagger

BYLINE:  By JOYCE PURNICK 

 BODY:
THE morning dawned yesterday with the awareness of a persistent grinding sound just outside the window. Probably a helicopter on a surveillance mission, came the thought, as sleep blessedly (if momentarily, alas) returned.
 Later, consciousness brought perspective. Silly, to think that the grinding noise was a hovering helicopter. Probably a garbage truck. 
 Or maybe not.
Alarmist thoughts seep in all the time now. Subtle fears have been part of life in New York for a long time, since Sept. 11. But they are more pronounced in the face of war, and it was unsettlingly apparent yesterday that those fears have blunted New York's insolent edge. For now, at least.
The brashness does not feel the way it used to. New York can take anything, and it has. But though antiwar demonstrators are as fierce as ever, the less political New Yorker seems chastened by terrorism's persistent threat and a troubled economy.
There are days lately when the sidewalks are passable and the breakfast coffee carts are still filled with seeded rolls by lunch. "It's dead," said Mojeb Hakimi, from his cart opposite Radio City Music Hall yesterday.
Maybe it's the talk of war, or school vacations; perhaps it's the economy in general, with everything from Wall Street to tourism hurting. Even guardians of the ever-optimistic theater industry are cautious, saying the theaters are slowly returning to normal after the recent musicians' strike, and cite the quieter-than-usual streets. "There's a general malaise in the whole city," one ticket agent said.
How could it be otherwise, given the sense of watchfulness and the suspicions? There are warnings from Washington; the possibility of new terrorist attacks; the Police Department's new Operation Atlas, its wartime security plan.
"Everywhere you look, there's a New York City police officer," said Nicole Orrell, a college student from Des Moines who was visiting Rockefeller Center with her family. Indeed, the block above the skating rink was watched over by four police cars, three police officers on foot, one on horseback.
Visitors seemed grateful for the police presence; New Yorkers seemed equally grateful or indifferent -- and maybe a little uncomfortable at the need for so much protection. Throughout Midtown, the police are on streets, in subways, at bridges and tunnels. They dominate Times Square. They are in front of ABC on the West Side, giving the thumbs up to Regis (live).
"It's a new way of life," said Steven Musumeci, a nine-year veteran of the Police Department, noting that the city now has to fight terrorism as well as more conventional crime.
Officer Musumeci was part of a four-officer team inspecting trucks on the southwest corner of 96th Street and Broadway yesterday, watched over by a homeless man conducting an animated conversation with himself; by people who stopped on their way into the subway station, glanced, then kept on going; by reporters who found themselves treated with unusual openness by the officers -- surely as deliberate as the show of force.
AT the checkpoint, one of several operating yesterday along 96th Street, nearly every truck and van was stopped for a brief examination by the officers, who checked licenses and registrations as well.
Another member of the team said that in two months of working at checkpoints, he has found some expired registrations, but nothing more. Is the effort worth it? "It's a precaution," the officer said. "We could find anything at any time. I hope we don't."
What was most surprising yesterday was the absence of animus, from passers-by and from the drivers themselves. It was not hard to imagine that a short time ago, the drivers would have resented the intrusion, complained that their rights were being violated, their livelihoods hurt. Yesterday, they said they were used to it and understood the rationale for the inspections.
"It's better to be cautious," said Gerard Romano, who was stopped on his way to delivering roast turkey to a deli downtown. Elad Bello, driver of the Oz Moving and Storage truck, didn't think the city was doing enough. "They should stop everybody," said Mr. Bello, who immigrated from Israel a year ago. "Better to be safe."
Hard to argue with that, though we have to admit missing New York's old stubborn carelessness. No place for that now. Not when the ominous sounds of hovering aircraft can invade our dreams, and make us wish for the growl of garbage trucks beneath our windows.

HEADLINE: The New Uncertainty in Bridgeport: Who's in Charge? 

BYLINE:  By LISA W. FODERARO 

DATELINE: BRIDGEPORT, Conn., March 19 

 BODY:
The conviction of Mayor Joseph P. Ganim on federal racketeering charges today may have ended the legal saga in this long-beleaguered city. But in other ways the outcome has placed Bridgeport in a new sort of limbo, with uncertainty mounting over the city's leadership in the coming days and months.
 Under state law, Mr. Ganim would lose his mayoralty only upon both conviction and incarceration. But today the judge freed him on bail and set a sentencing date of July 1. 
As residents of this polyglot, financially pinched city of 140,000 wrestled with their disappointment or disgust with the conviction, depending on their allegiances, the City Council called on Mr. Ganim to step aside.
"There is now no doubt that the public trust has been violated, that public confidence in the mayor's capacity to lead and effectively govern this city has been destroyed," said the Council president, John M. Fabrizi, who under the City Charter would automatically become mayor when Mr. Ganim resigns or is imprisoned.
"As we, the City Council, anticipate," Mr. Fabrizi said, "now is the time, for the benefit and the good of the city of Bridgeport, for the mayor to resign his position immediately."
Later, at an evening news conference, about 75 residents repeatedly shouted "resign now" and Mr. Fabrizi said Mr. Ganim had told him he would quit, but would not say when.
Across this 19-square-mile city, many people lashed out at Mr. Ganim. For months, they had heard testimony about the fancy gifts he had accepted as bribes, from custom-made suits and crates of expensive French wine to diamond earrings for his wife, Jennifer.
"Bridgeport's free now," said a visibly angry Joe Braca, who owns a dry cleaning business on East Main Street. "He took a lot of bread off the tables of Bridgeport citizens. We've been used and abused in this city."
Ron Smith, a mortgage consultant for Citibank and a Bridgeport resident, never accepted the defense argument that associates of Mr. Ganim had orchestrated the bribe-taking scheme without his knowledge. "Did he have on earmuffs and blindfolds?" he asked. "Come on."
But others here seemed conflicted about Mr. Ganim's felony conviction, which is certain to bring prison time. Those who know him, city employees, for example, kept talking about how sociable and caring he was as he navigated the warren of offices in City Hall. 
"He was very friendly and would not turn his back on anyone," said Jessica Santiago, a clerk in the city's benefits office. "He was always coming in with a smile, saying 'good morning.' I just wish that none of this had happened and he would go on being the mayor."
Others pointed to the myriad improvements in Bridgeport under his leadership. The economic rebirth was marked by the development in just the last five years of new shopping centers, supermarkets, a Home Depot, a multiscreen cinema, a minor-league ballpark and a 10,000-square-foot arena. 
Sonja Singletary, a cook who has lived in Bridgeport for 30 years, praised Mr. Ganim's efforts to rehabilitate her section of the city, the East End, which has a large African-American population. 
"He tore down a lot of abandoned houses and fixed sidewalks that had been broken for years," she said. "You feel safe and secure because we got police substations now. I love the mayor. Even though he's guilty, he's in my prayers every night."
Economic growth in the city started to stall in the last year or two. Business leaders say the mayor's troubles probably accelerated a downturn that would have come anyway, as the national economy faltered. But some are worried that the cloud of corruption could hamper further redeveloment.
Paul S. Timpanelli, president of the Bridgeport Regional Business Council, which serves as a chamber of commerce, said the city "was almost bankrupt" a decade ago, with "no leadership, no economic development and no private investment." What it did not lack, he said, was "rampant crime and a very poor public image."
"Over the mayor's term of office, until recently, all that was beginning to change and change dramatically," he said. "Unfortunately, the scandal has set us back. Whenever a city experiences the kind of scandal we're experiencing, businesses always hesitate."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: TELECOMMUNICATIONS; 
A Trade Show Talks Shop Between Talk Of an Invasion

BYLINE:  By SIMON ROMERO 

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, March 19 

 BODY:
Despite a giddy atmosphere including raucous parties in the French Quarter and the rollout of fanciful new mobile computing services, war worries were pervasive at a large international gathering of the wireless communications industry, which ended here today. 
 Participants in the three-day Cellular Telecommunications and Internet Association's annual wireless convention, attended by nearly 40,000 people, seemed to spend as much time discussing the looming prospect of military action in Iraq as on ways to maintain growth in their industry. 
 The wireless segment has been a rare bright light in an otherwise gloomy global telecommunications market, and the trade show's organizers tried to direct attention to new data indicating that wireless subscriptions in the United States were up 10 percent last year, growing to 140.8 million from 128.4 million the year before.
But many at the convention found it hard to ignore the apparently imminent invasion of Iraq. 
"Some of my buddies are already over there in Kuwait," said Vik Sanchez, an Army reservist and sales representative for TimesTen, a Silicon Valley software company that had a small booth at the show. 
About 15 percent of the attendees and exhibitors came from outside the United States, about the same level as last year, said Kimberly Kuo, a spokeswoman for the association, noting that China, South Korea and the Scandinavian countries were strongly represented.
Samsung Electronics of South Korea had a large booth featuring a troupe of Broadway-style singers and dancers. But even there, the sales song and dance seemed only a partial distraction from geopolitics. 
"Any type of war is not positive," said Junho Park, who works in Seoul, South Korea, for Samsung's wireless handset division. "A lot of people are worried that North Korea could be the next bombing target after Iraq."
None of the international high-ranking executives scheduled to address the convention, including John Koo, vice chairman of the large South Korean company LG Electronics, and Jorma Ollila, the chief executive of the Finnish cellphone manufacturer Nokia, canceled their participation. Senior executives from American companies, including Microsoft's chairman, Bill Gates, took part in the gathering as planned.
Ted Turner, the vice chairman of AOL Time Warner, was on hand as keynote speaker today. Mr. Turner repeated indications that he made on Tuesday in New York that he might remain on the company's board, even after he steps down as vice chairman in May. His purpose, he said today, would be to help the company with strategy. "Who knows, the war might spread," Mr. Turner told the audience. "I'm good when things get bad. I don't run."
Many of the executives at the convention said they hoped that any conflict in Iraq would be brief and only minimally disruptive to the economy. Despite growing subscribership, relatively slack demand for next-generation wireless services and fierce competition among large carriers have meant sluggish growth prospects for many companies.
Among the innovative new services and products rolled out at the show and meant to buoy the industry's fortunes were so-called streaming video capable of delivering short movies on cellphones, sophisticated gaming consoles built into handsets. But some executives said war could at least temporarily distract consumers from such offerings. 
"A big issue for our industry with the war is that we want it over quickly so we can get more clarity as to where we're headed," said Rick Darnaby, chief executive of Somera, a company in Santa Barbara, Calif., that helps wireless carriers manage their networks more efficiently. 
Some people at the conference had broadly international perspectives, like Brandon Haase, who lives with his Turkish wife in Seoul, where he is a senior project manager for LG Electronics. 
Mr. Haase, an American whose parents live in Beirut, also has a Lebanese passport and is able to travel unhindered on business throughout the Middle East. He said he had recently returned from Iran, where he found people riveted by the prospect of war in neighboring Iraq.
"It's something that's understandably on people's minds," Mr. Haase said, measuring his comments as an international diplomat might.
Some others attending the trade show used the event as an opportunity to forget briefly about global uncertainty and, as some mentioned, the threat of retaliatory terrorist attacks in this country. 
As in previous years, public relations firms organized elaborate open-bar parties for several of the larger companies, even though the lavishness did not measure up to the boom times of a few years ago. 
"People want to have fun with all that's taking place," said Nicky Csellak-Claeys, a marketing executive from Belgium who works for Sony Ericsson, the Japanese-Swedish handset venture, which gave a party for more than 500 guests at the House of Blues nightclub on Tuesday night, with a mosh pit in front of the stage where the rock band Good Charlotte performed. 
But escape tended to give way to realities, whether mundane or cosmic. Jyrki Antikainen, an executive with Nokia, said he hoped flights back to Helsinki would not be delayed by military action. 
Keiji Tachikawa, chief executive of Japan's largest wireless carrier, NTT DoCoMo, took the larger view.
"The pending conflict is of a different paradigm than what we had during the cold war and in previous years," Mr. Tachikawa said in an interview. "It's a conflict between very different cultural models, which makes rational attempts to achieve resolution less effective."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: AUTOS; 
Detroit Fears Sales Will Turn More Sluggish

BYLINE:  By DANNY HAKIM 

DATELINE: DETROIT, March 19 

 BODY:
Zero percent financing got this town through one war. But two?
 Car lots are emptying, and auto dealers, suppliers and analysts are worried that, in contrast to the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks, Detroit may not have a tonic to offer a paralyzed economy. 
 "Zero percent has been around for quite a while," said Conrad Darby, who owns four General Motors dealerships in Sarasota County, Fla., "and the American public tends to get jaded on anything that's longer than their short-term memory." Sales, he added, are "very soft" this month. 
Even G.M.'s chief sales analyst, Paul Ballew, can muster only a tepid endorsement of the deals that have been the heart of the company's sales strategy for the last 18 months. "Zero percent continues to be more effective than any other offer out there," he said today. But, he acknowledged, "in this environment of uncertainty, we are all wondering how effective any incentive program will be." 
G.M. initiated free financing on Sept. 19, 2001, after the Bush administration appealed to Detroit for a patriotic gesture to rev up the economy. Ford and Chrysler quickly matched the offer, and the deals worked, stimulating consumer spending. October 2001 turned out to be the biggest sales month in the industry's history, and sales remained vigorous throughout much of 2002. 
The incentive spending cut into the Big Three's profits, but the deal making kept factories running, dealers happy and suppliers busy. It was also a boon for the economy at large, since automobiles and parts account for 3.5 percent of the nation's total output. The industry plays an even bigger role not just in traditional auto-making states like Michigan and Ohio, but also in Southern states like Alabama and Mississippi, where foreign automakers have factories.
This year, though, sales over all have been sluggish even as incentive spending -- particularly by the domestic automakers -- has continued to rise. That makes for an unattractive business recipe. 
"What are the incentives getting you? It's clear they are not working as well," said Maryann Keller, a veteran auto analyst. "There's no urgency or call to action from incentives anymore."
Some industry experts say that high gasoline prices, driven up by tight supplies and war jitters, are cutting into car sales over all and are beginning to color car shoppers' preferences. While S.U.V.'s in general continue to gain market share, for example, sales of the largest S.U.V.'s have been sluggish. 
Donald V. Esmond, general manager of the Toyota brand in the United States, said that Toyota's largest vehicles, like the Sequoia S.U.V., were selling "not as well as some of the more fuel-efficient vehicles," like the smaller Highlander sport utility.
He also sees evidence of at least a short-term shift by customers toward more fuel-efficient vehicles in sales of the company's Prius, a small car that saves gas by supplementing its internal combustion engine with electric power. 
"We sold 1,968 last month, up 32.9 percent from a year before," Mr. Esmond said. "It was our best-ever Prius month, and right now we're tracking to well exceed that this month."
Mr. Ballew, the G.M. sales analyst, said the weakness in sales of the biggest S.U.V.'s was "not because of fuel economy," but a result of the many alternatives that have emerged, like luxury and smaller S.U.V.'s and so-called crossover vehicles that combine aspects of cars and sport utilities.
Over all, February was the second- worst sales month of the last four years, with sales falling 6.7 percent from a year earlier, to a seasonally adjusted annual sales rate of 15.4 million vehicles. 
J. D. Power is expecting the pace to fall to 15.25 million in March. Last year, the industry sold 17.1 million vehicles in the United States, a strong showing.
Even as sales were falling in February, incentive spending rose 33 percent from a year earlier. Merrill Lynch, in a report this week, noted that automakers spent an average of $2,225 per vehicle on incentives in February, compared with $1,673 in February 2002. 
"Based on February sales results, we are concerned that consumers' responsiveness to incentives is beginning to dull," the report said. "Nevertheless, with inventories mounting, we believe still higher incentives are in store for the near future."
In the meantime, Wall Street has been cutting its earnings forecasts for the carmakers, and the Big Three have been cutting their production schedules. Ford announced last week that it would reduce production 17 percent for the second quarter, the sharpest cut yet. 
David Bradley, an analyst at J. P. Morgan, has cut his 2003 earnings estimates for automakers and suppliers by an average of 24 percent this month. "At particular risk near-term, in our view, are Ford and its largest supplier, Visteon," he wrote in a report Monday. 
Ford has lost $6.4 billion in the past two years, and many analysts believe that it will struggle to stay out of the red this year. As goes Ford, so goes Visteon, which used to be a Ford division and still derives 80 percent of its business from the company. Together, Ford and Visteon employ more than 160,000 people in the United States. 
Some car dealers said this week that the manufacturers might again inspire shoppers if they brought back the across-the-board zero percent financing offers that were widely available for months after the Sept. 11 attacks.
"Zero percent for 60 months on a whole product line is very different than what's been out for the last few months," said Michael Maroone, president of AutoNation, the country's largest chain of dealerships. 
Jerry Reynolds, a Ford dealer in Garland, Tex., agreed -- though he blamed oil prices for consumers' decision to keep their wallets closed.
"People with large S.U.V.'s and pickups are not willing to give up what they have just yet, so they're waiting, and people who have more economical vehicles and would have moved up are waiting and thinking about it," he said. "Gas prices are our problem at this minute."
Mr. Darby, the Florida dealer, said, "We have to do something to whet the appetite."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: PETROLEUM; 
Persian Gulf Oil Disruptions Have Already Begun

BYLINE:  By NEELA BANERJEE 

 BODY:
As the United States military completed its plans to invade Iraq, disruptions of oil supplies and shipments from the Persian Gulf appeared to have already begun yesterday, industry experts said.
 Most notably, exports from Iraq under the United Nations oil-for-food program dwindled to a trickle, a spokesman for the program confirmed, after Kofi Annan, the secretary general, suspended the program within Iraq on Monday. More broadly, some oil tankers scheduled to arrive at other Middle Eastern countries are refusing to enter the Persian Gulf because of security concerns, said Nader Sultan, chief executive of the Kuwait Petroleum Corporation. 
 "Companies are saying, 'Do I send my ships up to the gulf?' " Mr. Sultan said in a phone interview from Kuwait. "And it's not just to Kuwait. Then, the question is up to the captain. Beyond insurance, it's safety, and someone has to make a judgment as to whether it's safe." 
He added: "It's already happening, already in the whole of the gulf, there are tankers not going up. Certain shipping companies and certain countries are rethinking that their ships shouldn't come here."
So far, the oil markets have shrugged off concerns that such disruptions could be substantial or last long. At the end of trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange yesterday, oil for May delivery dropped to $29.36 a barrel, while oil for April delivery fell $1.79, to $29.88 a barrel. The price of oil has fallen 21 percent this week on the belief that a war in Iraq will be quick and that there will be little damage to Iraq's oil fields and facilities.
Iraq shipped some of its biggest loads last week, averaging about 1.8 million barrels a day, according to Walid Khadduri, editor in chief of the Middle East Economic Survey and an expert on Iraq's oil industry. But shipments began to shrink considerably by the end of the week, he said.
Now, with the suspension of the oil-for-food program, the loading of oil from the port of Mina al-Bakr, Iraq, on the Persian Gulf has stopped, said Ian Steele, a program spokesman. He said that oil was still flowing from Iraq's northern Kirkuk field to the Turkish port of Ceyhan, where one tanker took on oil Tuesday and another is expected tomorrow.
Oil traders and other industry experts said they expected Iraqi exports to end soon, even from Ceyhan, because the Iraqis would probably shut down most production in preparation for the war. Iraq sends about 35 percent of its oil to the United States, according to PFC Energy, a Washington consulting group, and substantial shipments also go to European oil companies like Eni of Italy and TotalFinaElf of France.
Representatives of the oil industry said the industry would not be badly hurt by the suspension of Iraqi exports because it had already scaled back imports from Iraq over the last year.
A pricing plan for Iraqi oil under the oil-for-food plan proved particularly onerous and discouraged oil sales to many foreigners, oil traders and companies said. Iraq's own decisions throughout the year to increase and decrease exports at will also frustrated buyers. Over the last two months, Iraqi exports have increased as Baghdad compensated for a shortfall of oil from Venezuela because of the general strike there. Still, the growing probability of war over the last few months sent many companies looking elsewhere for more stable oil supplies.
"People have anticipated the possible cutoff of Iraqi oil for months now," said Sara Wachter, a spokeswoman for TotalFinaElf, whose own imports have fallen to "pretty minuscule levels" now from 2.5 million barrels a month in November.
Ms. Wachter said that oil companies operating in OPEC states were producing more oil along with OPEC members, which are producing far above their quotas to make up for the sharp decline in Venezuelan exports and for a possible halt in Iraqi oil. They are also buying up some of the extra OPEC output, she said.
But oil companies buying oil from other Persian Gulf states now face increasingly more expensive insurance rates that are making the journey to that region particularly difficult, industry experts said. 
Mr. Sultan of Kuwait Petroleum said that the broad hesitation to bring tankers into the gulf arises from memories of the Iran-Iraq war in the 1980's, when oil tankers were strafed and bombed by the warring sides. He said he thought that this time, as in the first Persian Gulf war, Navy ships might be willing to escort tankers requesting such protection. A spokesman at the Navy Central Command in Bahrain could not be reached for comment. 
Moreover, the Persian Gulf countries will be willing to ship the oil themselves to foreign tankers that are reluctant to enter their waters, Mr. Sultan said. "If they're not prepared to come here, we're prepared to take the oil to them," he said. "There won't be a supply disruption. It will be more like a blip in programming. A country like Kuwait, we can make up for a shortfall by delivering oil south of Hormuz. All the logistics are in place. We just need to give the green light to put it all in motion."
Industry experts said that although official Iraqi oil shipments had all but stopped, a chance remained that Iraq could illegally export oil as it has long done, though in far smaller quantities. 
Over the last few weeks, oil traders have received reports that five to seven Jordanian-chartered tankers had each loaded about a million barrels of Iraqi crude oil at the Khor al-Amaya port on the Persian Gulf, a transaction and a port outside the purview of the United Nations. The tankers then moved through the gulf without being stopped by the United States-led Multinational Interception Force, which, traders say, routinely searches even small boats.
A spokesman, however, said United States forces do not routinely check ships belonging to allies. He added: "We consider Jordan to be a vital ally in the global war on terrorism."

HEADLINE: Time Runs Out: The Battle for Iraq Is at Hand 

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "It's the Economy, Stupid. It's the War, Stupid" (Week in Review, March 16): 
 Your lucid description of the interconnection between the economy and war with Iraq misses one very cogent point -- the main economic rationale for invading Iraq. 
Victory in the war is likely ultimately to enable the United States to exert great influence over the control of Iraq's oil spigots and thereby help stabilize world oil prices. 
 Such an occurrence, while unpredictable, is also clearly doable, and would be a huge boon to the American economy and other Western economies as well. 
If such a scenario were to happen, all the arguments that have been raised in the United States both for and against war will quickly recede into oblivion, as will the protests of France, Germany, Russia and others.

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: NEW YORK; 
City Fortifies Entry Points To Guard Against Terrorism

BYLINE:  By WILLIAM K. RASHBAUM and JAMES BARRON 

 BODY:
Concerned that river crossings are among the likelier potential targets for terrorist attacks, the New York Police Department sharply increased its patrols at bridges and tunnels yesterday. The patrols, along with inspections of trucks in Manhattan, slowed traffic to a single-lane crawl on entrance ramps and avenues.
 The traffic snarls were perhaps the most visible evidence that New York was feeling the squeeze of security in anticipation of the American-led attack on Iraq. Officials said that officers at more than a dozen checkpoints used hand-held devices the size of a cellphone to scan cargo for radiological material. 
 "The idea is to avoid anything going down there -- downtown -- blowing anything up," said Sgt. Al Flaxman, the chief of the unit inspecting trucks heading south of 96th Street in Manhattan.
The inspections -- part of Operation Atlas, the Police Department's comprehensive security plan to prevent retaliatory terrorist attacks -- reflected a sense of what might be on the minds of terrorists. While no specific threat against a particular bridge or tunnel has been received, officials said, in recent months intelligence analysts studying statements by captured terrorists found several mentions of the economic disruption that would follow an attack on any of the major routes into the city.
For that reason, police harbor patrols have been told to concentrate on the areas around bridges and tunnels, officials said. That directive strengthened an earlier focus on river crossings that included posting a police launch in the East River near the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges and installing a new system of surveillance cameras and alarms on bridges and tunnels.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which operates the Lincoln and Holland Tunnels and the George Washington Bridge, has also stepped up truck inspections and is counting on help from New Jersey state troopers. City officials said delays on the bridges averaged 20 to 40 minutes yesterday, though drivers said they seemed much longer.
Edward Skyler, a spokesman for Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, said the checkpoints were among many prudent measures being taken. "When New Yorkers see the precautions we have put into place, they should feel assured that the city is doing everything in its power to protect them and feel free to live their lives," he said.
But, in an increasingly nervous city, some people had apparently decided not to venture out. There came a moment in the afternoon when someone seemed to pull the plug on tourism in Midtown Manhattan. "We were doing really well in the morning," said Peter Oratowski, a Gray Line tour guide at 47th Street and Eighth Avenue. "Then, in the afternoon, it just trailed off. I think they went home to watch television and wait for the war."
With the waiting came new precautions and preparations. State officials advised schools to prepare for "lockdowns" to protect students in case of terrorist attacks against schools. A memo from the State Education Department also advised local officials to review safety plans, increase surveillance of schools, restrict parking near buildings and consider postponing field trips. And the Police Department began distributing thousands of first-aid kits, respirator masks and rubber gloves for officers to use in response to chemical or biological attack.
For several weeks, additional police personnel have been assigned to several New York City bridges. But they have generally monitored traffic for unusual events and not spent much time stopping and searching vehicles. Yesterday, that changed, and some drivers were annoyed at the latest ritual -- being pulled over, being asked for license and registration, being asked to open the door to the cargo area and, in some cases, being asked to open packages.
"I'm behind schedule as it is," said Fernando Cruz, an appliance repairman who was stopped on Second Avenue on the way to East Ninth Street after fixing a refrigerator on East 114th Street. "It's slowing me up." 
The challenge for the police inspections was to strike a balance between the flow of commerce and the need to tighten security around what Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly called "the core business district."
"The definition of where that begins is somewhat flexible," the commissioner said. "We don't say it's only going to be at 96th Street. Quite frankly, we could do locations south of that anywhere before you get to 59th Street." Later, he added: "Don't hold us to the 96th Street location. That was kind of notional."
For much of the day yesterday, though, it was more than notional. The officers inspecting the trucks moved from avenue to avenue but were always along 96th Street -- officials said it was selected because it is a choke point well south of the George Washington and Triborough Bridges. The inspection team spent a couple of hours at Central Park West, but by the time an all-news radio station was broadcasting a report from there, it had moved to the East Side, first to Fifth Avenue, later to Second Avenue.
Sergeant Flaxman, of the truck-inspection unit, said the checks were different from those his officers usually carry out. Most days, his unit inspects trucks for safety problems -- bald tires, worn brake lines, cracked windshields.
"Now we're supposed to be out looking for anything suspicious," Sergeant Flaxman said. "It's preventive. It's good to have a nice show out here. Police presence is a deterrent."
And the level of scrutiny is likely to increase. The authorities have become concerned by various developments, including reports that men had been seen videotaping the undersides of the George Washington or the Verrazano-Narrows Bridges from boats or the edge of the water. But officials said the calls may simply have reflected new awareness of routine tourist activity.

HEADLINE: THE MARKETS: STOCKS & BONDS; 
Dow andS.& P. 500 Advance for Sixth Consecutive Day

BYLINE:  By The Associated Press 

 BODY:
Wall Street notched its longest winning streak in nearly three years yesterday, as investors picked up shares before the deadline President Bush had set for the Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein to flee or face war.
 Analysts said volume was somewhat light as many investors chose to see what happened once the deadline of 8 p.m. Eastern time passed. Technology shares, however, sagged on a cautious outlook from Oracle. 
 "There's a sense of relief that we now understand all the war variables for the first time in a month," said Brian Pears, head equity trader at Victory Capital Management. "We know there's a military solution. That euphoria won't last forever, but it certainly accounts for one of the best rallies in three years."
The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 71.22 points, or 0.9 percent, at 8,265.45, for a six-day advance of 741 points.
It was the highest closing level since Jan. 23, when the Dow finished at 8,369.47.
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 7.57 points, or 0.9 percent, to 874.02. The last time the Dow and S.& P. 500 had six consecutive days of gains was in August 2000.
A third market indicator finished lower, however. The Nasdaq composite index declined 3.48 points, or 0.3 percent, to 1,397.07.
Oracle dropped 94 cents, to $11.31, after it warned that profits might sag if the anticipated war was not completed quickly. The news weighed on other technology companies, including Siebel Systems, which declined 53 cents, to $8.79.
"We're used to Oracle being the cheerleader in the technology sector since it historically has given us relatively positive guidance," said Arthur Hogan, chief market analyst at Jefferies & Company. "Yet their guidance was cloudy, so that didn't help."
Investors have pushed stocks sharply higher in the last week, bolstered by hopes of a short and successful war with Iraq.
Still, analysts caution that Wall Street could quickly have losses should the military assault led by the United States fail to achieve a quick victory.
"Unfortunately, we're going to trade headline to headline for a while," Mr. Pears of Victory Capital Management said. "It's really difficult to say what the market will do in the short term, depending on what happens overseas."
"For the rally to continue, it would have to be a quick and relatively casualty-free war," he said.
Gainers included the military contractors General Dynamics, which climbed 67 cents, to $58.42, and Northrop Grumman, which rose $1.29, to $87.45.
Albertson's increased $1.25, to $20, after it reported fourth-quarter earnings that met analysts' expectations.
FedEx rose $3.50, to $55.18, after it reported earnings that fell a penny short of analysts' expectations.
But Bayer declined $1.19, to $14.21, pulling back after a huge increase the day before. The company's shares traded in the United States rose 37 percent on Tuesday after Bayer was cleared of liability in the first lawsuit to go to trial accusing it of ignoring research linking its cholesterol-lowering drug Baycol to dozens of deaths.
Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 5-to-4 ratio on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was moderate.
Bond prices fell. The benchmark 10-year note lost 20/32 , to 99 3/32 . The note's yield, which moves in the opposite direction from the price, rose to 3.99 percent from 3.91 percent on Tuesday. The 30-year bond dropped 29/32 , to 106 24/32 . Its yield jumped to 4.93 percent from 4.87 percent.

HEADLINE: Spitzer Unpopular on Street He Made His Beat 

BYLINE:  By JONATHAN P. HICKS 

 BODY:
Fresh from a string of appearances on magazine covers and a statewide race in which he was re-elected with a commanding two-thirds of the vote, Eliot Spitzer is widely considered to be a politician with a future.
 Mr. Spitzer, a Democrat who is the attorney general, is widely acknowledged by both Democrats and Republicans as the candidate to beat should he choose to run for governor in 2006. His favorability ratings are high, according to the polls. 
 But a poll of those who work in the securities industry -- and those who recently did -- would probably show much different results. Reeling from a contracting economy and a loss of faith in the stock markets, many of the people who work on and around Wall Street see Mr. Spitzer at the root of their troubles. 
Many say his investigations into Wall Street practices continue to harm an industry that is already down and out, and accuse him of pursuing the issue for his own political gains. And they are angry.
Some said their feelings were evident this week, for example, when Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, Gov. George E. Pataki and Rudolph W. Giuliani, the former mayor, were among the political notables invited to the gala 70th birthday party for Sanford I. Weill, the chairman of Citigroup -- and Mr. Spitzer was not.
A spokesman for Citigroup did not return calls for comment.
Whether Mr. Spitzer's absence from the event Sunday at Carnegie Hall is related to his aggressive pursuit of malfeasance among corporate and Wall Street executives is unclear. But he has certainly left bitter feelings in his wake.
"Look I've seen this movie before," said Michael Holland, a former Salomon Brothers partner and a fund manager at Holland & Company. "Spitzer has obviously overreached. I view all of this as very Rudy Giuliani-like. Both of these guys made their mark the same way, and it turned out that a lot of it was overreaching and overzealousness. Eliot Spitzer is a good politician -- he saw his opportunity and he took advantage of it."
In response, Mr. Spitzer said that his investigations were necessary to clean up practices among Wall Street firms and that any price he might pay in unpopularity among executives was immaterial.
"Like most people, I would prefer to be liked than disliked," Mr. Spitzer said in an interview. "But does it matter if I'm disliked by some? No, it doesn't matter. My job is to enforce the law and we will continue to do that. I continue to believe that what we did was correct, what we did was important to the public interest and, in the long term, beneficial to Wall Street."
Mr. Spitzer added, "I don't mean to be cavalier about it, but if I've lost some friends, so be it."
In the Wall Street community, the animosity toward Mr. Spitzer is hardly a secret. He made a name for himself by taking out of mothballs the Martin Act, a 1921 state law giving the attorney general jurisdiction over securities trading. With that, he took on Merrill Lynch & Company, the nation's biggest brokerage firm and a pillar of New York's financial community.
Mr. Spitzer's investigations unearthed damaging e-mail messages among Merrill stock analysts. He charged that the analysts, while portraying their financial advice as objective, urged customers to buy stocks they believed were bad deals to please companies whose investment banking business the firm wanted. Merrill Lynch has since agreed to pay $100 million in fines.
In a bear market, such investigations are easy, some Wall Street analysts said. But in this bear market, they have added to a climate of reluctance to trade stocks that has led to large layoffs in the industry -- as well as the city and state budget crises, which are caused largely by dwindling tax revenues.
Normally, these kinds of feelings would spell trouble for a politician seeking statewide office. But some suggest that Mr. Spitzer's troubles with Wall Street are unlikely to have much of an impact on his ability to be elected, should he decide to run for governor.
For one thing, they point out, the next gubernatorial election is three years away, an eternity in the world of shifting political fortunes. But they also say that for every Wall Street executive Mr. Spitzer has alienated, there are a far larger number of average investors who are more likely to view him as their champion.
"The attorney general has earned the affection of millions of disgruntled I.R.A. owners," said Evan Stavisky, a political consultant who works with Democratic candidates. "I think the average voter is certainly very enthusiastic about the attorney general's efforts to crack down on abuses on Wall Street."
Wall Street, Mr. Stavisky said, "is certainly not something to be trifled with." But, he added: "In raw political terms, they are dwarfed by the millions of people who have seen their life savings evaporate because of securities fraud. What he did seems more like a home run, politically."
And, should the hard feelings linger, he may have enough fund-raising prowess to offset the normally generous executives' closed wallets.
Some politicians close to Mr. Spitzer say that he believes the hard feelings are dissipating and, perhaps, will be gone by the time of the gubernatorial election, particularly if Mr. Spitzer is increasingly viewed as a front-runner. No one, they said, likes a winner more than Wall Street.
And, some point out, Mr. Giuliani was once loathed for leading Wall Street executives out of their offices in handcuffs. Now executives are jumping to hire his security firm and stand close to him at public events. Add in a return to a bull market and this, too, shall pass, they say.
"There are some business leaders all over this city, state and this nation who applaud what I've done," Mr. Spitzer said.
But will the anger hurt him should he decide to run for governor? "Maybe we'll find out," Mr. Spitzer said.

HEADLINE: Palestinian Becomes Premier, Diminishing Arafat's Power 

BYLINE:  By GREG MYRE 

DATELINE: JERUSALEM, March 19 

 BODY:
In a move that marks the most significant cut in Yasir Arafat's powers since he became leader of the Palestinian Authority in 1994, his longtime deputy, Mahmoud Abbas, tonight accepted the new post of Palestinian prime minister.
 With the United States and Israel boycotting Mr. Arafat, the appointment of Mr. Abbas also offers some slim hope for restarting dialogue, and perhaps even peace talks, that collapsed during 30 months of Middle East fighting. 
 Mr. Abbas accepted the job at a meeting with Mr. Arafat tonight in the West Bank city of Ramallah, and the two men discussed the broad outlines of the future government, which the prime minister has three weeks to assemble.
Mr. Arafat, the pre-eminent Palestinian leader for more than three decades, has seen his authority diminished on several fronts in the last year. He wrangled for days with his own Fatah movement and Palestinian legislators over how much political control he would have to cede to the new prime minister.
Mr. Arafat, 73, has retained his role as overall commander of the security forces, and he will also have the final say on any peace negotiations with Israel. But Mr. Abbas, 67, will form the cabinet and handle the day-to-day running of the government, powers that Mr. Arafat previously held for himself.
The Israeli government of Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has placed tight restrictions on Mr. Arafat's movements since December 2001, and the Palestinian leader has left Ramallah only once, for a day trip, since then. Last summer, he responded to international pressure for reforms by shaking up his cabinet and appointing an influential finance minister, Salam Fayyad. That chipped away at Mr. Arafat's control of Palestinian finances.
With Mr. Abbas assuming office, Mr. Arafat will now have to deal with an independent-minded prime minister and an increasingly restive parliament that has shown its willingness to stand up to him. 
The publicity-shy Mr. Abbas, commonly known as Abu Mazen, has said almost nothing about his intentions, though his appointment has been widely welcomed.
Palestinian political reformers, who sought to dilute the power concentrated in Mr. Arafat's hands, have been supportive. The United States and Israel, which pressed for the creation of the prime minister's position as a way to neutralize Mr. Arafat, now say they are waiting to see how much influence Mr. Abbas will have.
Given Mr. Abbas's low-key style, and with the spotlight on the American showdown with Iraq, he is not expected to make any major announcements in the next few days.
"Maybe by the beginning of the next week he will be able to declare a government and define his plans," said the Palestinian information minister, Yasser Abed Rabbo. "I do not advise him to take this step during the first few days of a war, because I do not think anyone will be listening."
Mr. Abbas faces huge challenges and Palestinians will be looking for him to deliver quickly. Since the Palestinian uprising began in September 2000, almost 2,000 Palestinians have been killed, the economy is in tatters, and Israeli troops operate throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.
Mr. Abbas has said Palestinian attacks against Israel have been counterproductive for the Palestinians, though he has not said what he might do to stop them. 
In renewed violence today, Palestinian gunmen shot and killed a 50-year-old Jewish settler in a roadside ambush near Jenin, in the northern West Bank, the Israeli military said.
Mr. Abbas's choice for interior minister, the post that oversees the security forces, will be closely watched. Hani al-Hassan, the current minister, is likely to be replaced, according to Palestinian sources who are in contact with Mr. Abbas.
The United States favors Muhammad Dahlan, who until last year was in charge of the Palestinians' Preventive Security forces in the Gaza Strip, the sources said. Mr. Abbas is considering other candidates as well, and also is expected to confer with Mr. Arafat on the post.
Mr. Hassan held quiet talks last week with the Israeli president, Moshe Katsav, and said the Palestinians were prepared to retake control of security in the West Bank if the Israeli troops withdrew, the Israeli radio reported.
The Palestinians say their security forces have been decimated by the Israeli military crackdown, while the Israelis say they were forced to act because the Palestinians failed to halt suicide bombings and other attacks that have killed more than 700 Israelis in the current round of fighting.
The Israeli forces have been in or near Palestinian cities and towns in the West Bank since last June, and have given no indications that they are on the verge of leaving.
Mr. Abbas was a key figure in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks in the 1990's, and is seen as a tough, pragmatic negotiator. He is Mr. Arafat's deputy in the Palestine Liberation Organization, and the two men have been close allies since the 1960's, though they have also had bitter arguments over the years. Mr. Abbas has always preferred to operate behind the scenes, in contrast to Mr. Arafat, who enjoys the limelight.
The two men are both looking to move ahead quickly with the diplomatic initiative known as the "road map," which calls on Palestinians and Israelis to take a number of steps that will lead them back to full-fledged peace negotiations.
President Bush last week said he would formally introduce the plan when a Palestinian prime minister with "real authority" was appointed. The United Nations, the European Union and Russia are also backing the proposal.
But the plan has been sidelined as the Middle East violence grinds on, and the conflict in Iraq could also prevent any movement in the coming days and weeks.
Mr. Sharon says he supports the plan in principle. But his government objects to several key points, and wants the violence to end before taking the steps outlined in it.

(By The New York Times), UNITED NATIONS, March 19 -- The Security Council's special coordinator for the Middle East said today after the appointment of a Palestinian prime minister that "for the first time in two and a half years, I believe we have a real opportunity to begin rebuilding the shattered Israeli and Palestinian relationship." 
The envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, told the Council that he saw "a small window of opportunity to get back to the table and out of the abyss of terrorism, violence, economic misery and general human suffering."
He called on the Palestinian Authority to declare an unequivocal end to violence and on the Israelis to stop attacks on civilians and demolition of Palestinian homes, and to dismantle West Bank settlements built in the last two years.
But Mr. Roed-Larsen laced his cautious optimism with sharp criticism of both sides. He called Palestinian suicide bombings "mass murder." He dwelt even more on recent deaths of Palestinians and one American in confrontations with Israeli troops in the West Bank and Gaza. The American, Rachel Corrie, was crushed by an Israeli military bulldozer.

HEADLINE: BLOCKS; 
Homes Where Industry Shied Away

BYLINE:  By David W. Dunlap 

 BODY:
MAYOR MICHAEL R. BLOOMBERG'S plan to build or preserve 65,000 housing units is less a cohesive single program than a patchwork of actions and aspirations; a sum of parts as small as the rezoning of a few rather scraggly blocks in the Morrisania section of the South Bronx that might -- just might -- create some 300 apartments.
 Each piece of the patchwork has its own complications. For instance, there is concern that an important financing tool, the federal low-income housing tax credit, may be jeopardized by President Bush's tax cut proposal. 
 In the case of Morrisania, the complexity is historical. Though residential rezoning in the old manufacturing district along Washington and Third Avenues is now embraced by City Hall as part of the mayor's plan, it was a step that the city itself resisted in the early 1990's, when the Economic Development Corporation envisioned the creation of an industrial park. 
Last week, Amanda M. Burden, director of the City Planning Department, announced a new approach: a hybrid zoning district on 14 blocks from East 163rd to East 168th Street, allowing low-density light manufacturing and medium-density apartment houses, typically six stories.
In their environmental assessment, city planners estimated the rezoning had the potential for 321 units, said Kelly Murphy, deputy director of the Bronx planning office. Mixed industrial-residential zoning, called MX, was first applied to the Port Morris section of the Bronx in 1997.
"This is going in the right direction," said Adolfo Carrion Jr., the Bronx borough president, who holds a master's degree in urban planning. "I'm not going to pretend that it's going to be a SoHo or a TriBeCa, but it will be better for businesses and residents."
Because the proposal is beginning a 150-day public review, Mr. Carrion shied from commenting too specifically, though he noted that six-story buildings were the "signature stock for the working-class areas of the city."
A leading Bronx developer, Procida Realty and Construction Corporation, believes the rezoning "can't happen soon enough," said Christine Procida, its senior vice president. "We have a database full of people asking for housing." Working with the Economic Development Corporation, Procida is already planning a two-block retail center called Washington Plaza, between 163rd and 164th Streets, including a much-needed supermarket.
Foundations are being excavated for Taino Plaza, a six-story, 105-unit apartment building at Washington Avenue and 164th Street, by the South Bronx Overall Economic Development Corporation. It required a variance but would have been allowed automatically under the new zoning, said Raffaela Petrasek, senior vice president of the city Economic Development Corporation.
OFFICIALS are also working with Katz Metal Fabricators and the Falcon Construction Corporation on industrial projects that would have retail space.
Morrisania's industrial zone developed alongside and to the east of the New York Central rail line. There were breweries, bakeries, commercial laundries and, until 1975, a large plant operated by the Coca-Cola Bottling Company of New York, said Carlos J. Tejada of the Bronx planning office.
As a neighborhood, Morrisania was in dire straits by the 60's. "Its streets -- the playgrounds of its children -- are littered with broken glass, abandoned tires, discarded furniture, overturned trash cans and cannibalized cars," the City Planning Commission said in 1969.
Residential rezoning has long been a priority of Community Board 3. This was outlined formally in a community-based plan in 1992, the first such plan to be issued under Section 197-a of the City Charter.
At the time, however, city officials were pursuing development of the Morrisania industrial park, which would have preserved some of the substantial apartment buildings and local landmarks like the 19th-century Centenary Methodist Church, said R. Andrew Parker, who was the planner in charge.
The industrial park faced one insuperable problem. "There were just no takers," recalled Fernando Ferrer, who was then borough president and is now president of the Drum Major Institute for Public Policy. "Morrisania wasn't in the remotest sense an industrial park, just a hodgepodge of industrial users under what used to be the Third Avenue el."
With its junkyards and parking lots, Morrisania is an increasingly conspicuous anomaly in a residential swath that takes in the Melrose Commons Urban Renewal Area to the south, the Claremont Village complex of public housing to the north and a corridor on the Boston Road to the east.
"It makes enormous sense in terms of residential redevelopment," Mr. Ferrer said. As to the rezoning, he said yesterday, "The only good thing I've derived is that I've lived long enough to see it."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: DESERT FRONT; 
In Day of Waiting, First Surrenders and the First Missile Attack

BYLINE:  By PATRICK E. TYLER 

DATELINE: KUWAIT, March 19 

 BODY:
Army engineering battalions acting as the vanguard of invasion late today pushed into the demilitarized zone along the Iraqi border as the first soldiers from Saddam Hussein's army, a group of 17, surrendered.
 Later in the day, the air war against Iraq opened with what military officials said wasa limited cruise missile strike aimed at Saddam Hussein, his sons and senior Iraqi leaders. 
 The missile attack followed a punishing day of sandstorms that raked the war zone along a 60-mile front, while American and British warplanes flew small-scale bombing missions against a dozen Iraqi artillery and surface-to-surface missile positions in southern Iraq that were within range of allied forces, military officials said.
United States military officials warned Iraqis against following Mr. Hussein's orders to destroy their oil fields, while Special Operations forces were said to be spreading through southern Iraq to prepare the battlefield. 
Late tonight, an American and British Army strewn across a vast desert landscape stood in eerie silence and at a high state of readiness under dusty moonlight, awaiting President Bush's order to move into Iraq. 
The White House acted only an hour and a half after the expiration of a 48-hour ultimatum demanding that the Iraqi leader and his sons leave the country. Earlier, the White House spokesman Ari Fleischer had warned that the nation was "on the brink of war" and that "Americans have to be prepared for loss of life." 
American warplanes dropped about two million leaflets on southern Iraq during the day, telling Iraqi troops how to surrender and how "to avoid destruction." They were instructed to drape white flags on their tanks and military vehicles, move away from them, throw down their weapons and wait for allied forces to round them up for processing.
Rumors of defection and uprising streaked through the region like tracer fire. First came word that Mr. Hussein's trusted deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz, had defected, and then that residents of Basra, Iraq's southern port, were staging an uprising. Both were quickly deflated. 
Mr. Aziz turned up in Baghdad to give a news conference, and United Nations humanitarian workers on the Iranian border near Basra said they could detect no unusual activity in the city. 
Also tonight, in the most explicit warning to date, an Air Force mobile broadcasting aircraft beamed a message in Arabic to the Iraqi people saying that "The days of Saddam's regime are over" and asserting that the Iraqi leader had personally issued orders to destroy Iraq's richest southern oil fields.
The broadcast, monitored and translated by The New York Times, said: 
"You will face complete destruction if you comply with these orders to sabotage the oil wells. He can't destroy them himself. He will need your help. Follow the instructions of the coalition. You have two choices: listen to Saddam and face the consequences, or refuse to follow his orders and save yourself for a post-Saddam Iraq." 
The effort to protect Iraq's oil resources reflected the intensity with which the Bush administration is seeking to prevent the repeat of the environmental and economic disaster inflicted on Kuwait by Iraqi forces 12 years ago. But it also underscored the critical role those oil resources are expected to play in financing Iraq's reconstruction as Washington faces massive rebuilding costs and uncertain partners with whom to share the burden.
The first Iraqi soldiers to surrender came as a group of 15 men, according to Capt. Darren Theriault, commander of the headquarters company of the Third Infantry Division's First Brigade. Later, two more Iraqi soldiers gave themselves up near a farming settlement on Kuwait's border with Iraq. 
All 17 were in Kuwaiti custody, officials said. 
"There are no prisoners under American control at this moment, but we are prepared to deal with that," Capt. Theriault said. 
Mass surrender by tens of thousands of Iraqi troops was a daunting logistical challenge of the 1991 war. 
In the Persian Gulf, the commander of naval forces in the region, Rear Adm. John M. Kelly, said Iraqi air defense forces fired repeatedly Tuesday night at American warplanes that are rapidly escalating operations over southern Iraq. In response, Admiral Kelly said, Navy jets early this morning bombed a series of targets that he refused to specify, saying only that they were related to Mr. Hussein's "command and control capabilities."
At the same time, Navy officials said that their fear that Mr. Hussein had dispatched more than 250 small cargo and fishing vessels into the gulf from Iraqi ports to conduct suicide missions against allied warships was a false alarm. The vessels, mostly small traders manned by South Asian crews, were either fleeing the region or were ordered to leave Iraq after Mr. Bush's Monday night speech.
Most of the dhows were checked and allowed to leave the Persian Gulf. But one was attacked by a Kuwaiti Coast Guard vessel, killing a crewman in what the Navy described as an "unfortunate accident."
At midmorning, the commander of the Navy's Fifth Fleet, Vice Adm. Timothy J. Keating, flew aboard the carrier Abraham Lincoln to rouse a crew of 6,000 that tomorrow will enter the ninth month of its deployment, one of the longest in modern naval history.
Facing a throng of sailors on the hangar deck, the admiral told the crew members that their names would be written "in gold" on the pages of history for helping to liberate the Iraqi people.
"Folks who have never known freedom, who have never been able to worship at the time and place of their choosing, will now be able to speak freely, to worship when and where they choose, to go where they choose," the admiral said. 
His remarks were greeted enthusiastically by some, but many sailors listened with arms folded and expressions of skepticism or uninterest. Some may have been puzzled by his expression of concern about freedom of worship in Iraq, a right that is well protected among the Muslim population.
"It doesn't really matter what they say," said Eli Muhammad, a 30-year-old electronics technician who works to maintain the carrier's radar system. "Whatever happens, whatever the president tells us to do, we'll do, so we can go home."
The imminence of war touched off final acts of political desperation by Arab leaders who had been counting on the legal authority of a United Nations Security Council resolution to ease the political backlash of a highly unpopular war. 
In Cairo, President Hosni Mubarak warned Egyptians to brace themselves for regional upheaval.
"As an Arab nation, we must continue to exert all efforts to rescue the people of Iraq from annihilation, the land of Iraq from division and the resources of the Arab nation from being tampered with," he said in a nationally televised address.
In Bahrain, King Hamad made a last-ditch appeal, as other Arab leaders had before him, for Mr. Hussein to go into exile. He even offered his own tiny nation, home to the American Navy in the gulf, as a refuge for the Iraqi leader.
Saudi Arabia, whose leaders in January had first privately advocated an arrangement to offer Mr. Hussein exile as a strategy to avert war, issued a statement today saying reports that it was pursuing such a strategy were "baseless." 
Late today, as troops moved into attack positions, the Third Infantry Division, which will lead the thrust toward Baghdad, readied itself by clearing sand from personal gear and weaponry. A sandstorm that set up a pall of dust over the region dissipated as the day wore on and the army shook itself off and carried on.
"There's a heightened sense of anticipation," said Col. William F. Grimsley, commander of the first brigade. "The trick is not to let it become overwhelming."
While the soldiers readied their gear, logistics experts fretted over the problem of creating a network to supply a fast-moving force that consumes 15 million gallons of fuel a day.
Maj. Gen. Dennis K. Jackson, director of logistics and engineering for Central Command, said in an interview today that it was possible that the advance of armored columns and helicopter-borne troops would be limited by the ability of fuel tankers to keep up.
But Colonel Grimsley had another concern. As night fell on the desert and the swirling plumes of dust settled, what was missing, he said, was any sign of defensive preparation by Iraqi forces on the other side of the border.
"Surprisingly," he said, "we have seen very little over there since the president's speech."

HEADLINE: THREATS AND RESPONSES: CALIFORNIA; 
Approach of War Reveals An Alienation in California

BYLINE:  By DEAN E. MURPHY 

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, March 19 

 BODY:
As Americans braced in recent days for a war against Iraq, many Californians were feeling strangely out of it. The great expanse between the coasts appeared ever vaster. The sense of threat, so acute in the East, was real but less immediate here.
 The University of California Board of Regents canceled a meeting in San Francisco today because of "concerns about travel," but the National Guard soldiers posted at the Golden Gate Bridge amounted to a small fraction of the deployments in New York or Washington. 
 Even when the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences decided to forgo the traditional red carpet entrance to Sunday's Oscar ceremonies in Los Angeles, officials said it was more a matter of wartime propriety than battle-eve jitters. 
From stockbrokers in San Francisco to software engineers in Silicon Valley to studio executives in Los Angeles, many Californians were puzzled by the connection between the terror attacks of Sept. 11 and the danger posed by Saddam Hussein, something taken for granted in many other parts of the country.
"I am hoping the administration has so much more knowledge that it can justify its actions, because on the face of it, I can't see a reason for doing this," said David Randall, a philanthropic fund-raiser in San Francisco.
"There are many good reasons to get rid of Saddam," Mr. Randall said. "But when did the events of Sept. 11 get transformed into going to war with Iraq? Why war with this one country, right now? I can't figure out how we got to this point."
That confusion is evident even though California has contributed more men and women to the call-up of reservists and National Guard forces than any other state. The defense industry pumps about $30 billion a year into California's economy. And while 29 military bases were closed in the 1990's, 61 installations remain in use statewide.
But California's isolation from Washington, geographically and, in recent years, politically, has helped foster a sense of alienation. The state, which had such an affinity for Bill Clinton, voted decisively against President Bush in 2000.
"There is a growing disbelief among Californians that the White House is really representing their views and interests," said Mark Baldassare, the director of research at the Public Policy Institute of California, a nonpartisan group in San Francisco that recently conducted an opinion poll of public attitudes toward President Bush, the war, which was then imminent, and other issues.
Mr. Baldassare said this attitude had been building for several years, starting with the state's energy crisis and the administration's handling of it. "Because of this disconnect," he said, "many Californians don't give the president the benefit of the doubt on the issue of Iraq any more than they give the president the benefit of the doubt on whether we really need to do away with taxes on dividends or whether a tax cut will lead to a better economy."
In fact, many people acknowledged that they might feel differently if a Democrat were leading them into battle. "I was wondering if I would feel more comfortable if it were Bill Clinton and Al Gore saying we needed to do this now, and I think I would," said Felicia Marcus, who was the regional administrator in California for the United States Environmental Protection Agency in the Clinton administration.
In some lunchtime and water-cooler chatter there has even been longing for President Clinton, a Hollywood favorite, who, the reasoning goes, would never have allowed a war to play havoc with Oscar night, one of the state's most hallowed traditions.
Some say the chasm in attitudes between East and West is new only in its intensity. Many residents have always enjoyed thinking of themselves as different from the rest of the country, especially those in the Hollywood pop-culture factory. 
"Californians love that sense of distinctiveness," said Peter Bart, editor of Variety. "We're not going to see the 60's again, but I think we are going to see a lot of rebellion against the mandates of Washington. This is an unpredictable and bizarre place, and I think we are definitely heading into an intensely politicized time in Hollywood."
Since many of the most prominent antiwar spokesmen in recent months have been Hollywood celebrities, this has further bolstered California's self-image and the state's image around the country as the epicenter of antiwar sentiment. The Academy Awards on Sunday night, if they come off as planned, will probably only harden that perception.
Robert Greenwald, a Hollywood producer and director who helped found Artists United to Win Without War, said a number of celebrities had committed to wearing antiwar pins at the awards, including Ben Affleck, Kirsten Dunst, Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Dustin Hoffman, Jessica Lange, Meryl Streep and the entire U2 rock band.
Doubting in California, however, is not the sole province of Hollywood, or even of the career leftists and peace advocates who were among those blocking streets today in downtown San Francisco. The police said one peace demonstrator died when he jumped from the Golden Gate Bridge in an apparent suicide.
"There is less fear of conforming here," said Warren Langley, the former president of the Pacific Stock Exchange. "People are more willing to question what the president says."
Mr. Langley found himself in an unusual place last week: At the San Francisco jail after being arrested for blocking the entrance to the exchange in an antiwar protest. The blockade was his first act of civil disobedience -- he even attended an evening of training in preparation -- but probably not his last, he said.
"It has been 30 years since I even had a traffic ticket," said Mr. Langley, who led the exchange between 1996 and 1999 and was arrested. He also happens to be a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel who was once an instructor at the Air Force Academy, "We are not going to stop this war. I know that," he said. "But I have to find a way I can help others, help us as Americans become good citizens of the world again."
It is also the case, some say, that Californians do not feel as unsafe as people in other parts of the country.
"We didn't feel or see any of the shocks of Sept. 11 except on television," said Steven Maviglio, a spokesman for Gov. Gray Davis. "We don't have anything like they do in Washington, where trucks are rolled up on the grounds of the Washington Monument, or where there was a mad rush for duct tape."
Robert J. Waste, a professor of public policy at California State University, Sacramento, said the state's ethnic and racial diversity and large immigrant population also played a part, making it distinctive -- and less receptive to the president's message.
"The deepest penetration of the president's case for war is among white males and Republicans," Professor Waste said. "That is not the whole of California."
An opinion poll conducted last week in the Sacramento area by the university's Institute for Social Research pointed to diversity as a determining factor on the war question.
The poll showed that support for a war was weakest among racial minorities and strongest among men. In El Dorado County, a mostly white and conservative area in the Sierra Nevada, 65 percent of respondents favored military action. In Sacramento County, where there are large immigrant and minority communities, support was 49 percent.
"California is more diverse than the rest of the country, and this diversity is the hardest part of the sell for war," Professor Waste said. 
Mr. Baldassare of the Public Policy Institute said an opinion poll conducted last month by the group showed that the troubled California economy had colored the views of residents about many subjects, like the popularity of Governor Davis (he registered a 60 percent disapproval rating; to the state's future (only 28 percent said the state was headed in the right direction), to President Bush's handling of the situation in Iraq (50 percent said they disapproved, while 46 percent approved).
"People are in a kind of nervous mood I haven't seen since the early 1990's," Mr. Baldassare said. "They are very wary of the state's vulnerable position economically right now. That has made people cautious about things they might view as extraneous events, including going to war with Iraq."
It is not just Californians who view themselves as different and apart. So do some of their visitors.
David Houston, a self-described conservative from Tampa Bay, Fla., who was on a vacation in California, said many people in the state seemed out of touch with the rest of America. "It is obvious a lot of people here are against the war," he said. "Of course, if a lot of them went to visit the World Trade Center, they might think differently."

HEADLINE: MOVIE GUIDE 

 BODY:
 A selective listing by critics of The Times of new or noteworthy movies playing this weekend in New York City. * denotes a highly recommended film. Ratings and running times are in parentheses.

Now Playing

"ALL THE REAL GIRLS," starring Paul Schneider, Zooey Deschanel and Patricia Clarkson. Written and directed by David Gordon Green (R, 108 minutes). Mr. Green follows "George Washington," his luminous found fable of Southern childhood, with a more conventional story of young love. Mr. Schneider plays a small-town cad whose easygoing promiscuity is derailed by Ms. Deschanel, whose character has just returned home from boarding school. Their sweet, fumbling romance is captured with scruffy, low-key lyricism. The film is an awkward hybrid of free-form, do-it-yourself filmmaking and professional discipline (supplied by the wonderful Ms. Deschanel, and by Ms. Clarkson), but its beauty and sincerity overcome its flaws and hesitations (A. O. Scott).

"BEND IT LIKE BECKHAM," starring Parminder Nagra. Directed by Gurinder Chadha (PG-13, 112 minutes). In this genial, unchallenging ethnic sports comedy, Jess (Ms. Nagra) is a talented and passionate soccer player, whose Indian immigrant parents living in a suburb of London disapprove of her athleticism. The central drama is hardly new -- the film is something between a Punjabi "Billy Elliot" and "My Big Fat Sikh Wedding" -- but the compulsive proliferation of subplots makes it much longer and sloppier than it should be. Still, the cast is good-humored and appealing, especially the diminutive Ms. Nagra, who steers through a predictable series of obstacles with fierce, pouty determination (Scott).

* "CITY OF GOD," starring Alexandre Rodrigues, Leandro Firmino da Hora and Seu Jorge. Directed by Fernando Meirelles (R, 130 minutes; in Portuguese, with English subtitles). A scorching anecdotal history of gang warfare in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, "City of God" is narrated by Rocket (Mr. Rodrigues), a young photographer who chronicles the deterioration of the housing project in which he grew up from a shantytown into a war zone. The movie, which begins in the 1960's and ends in the early 80's, parallels Rocket's story with the rise of his childhood playmate, Li'l Ze (Mr. da Hora), from a petty thief into a ruthless drug dealer and neighborhood kingpin commanding a small army of gun-toting children. The history is told in a loose, tall-tale style that suggests a quasi-cinema-verite version of Martin Scorsese's "Goodfellas" (Stephen Holden).

"DAREDEVIL," starring Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner. Written and directed by Mark Steven Johnson (PG-13, 96 minutes). Sometimes playing a comic-book hero gives actors a chance to show suave, stylized moves. After stripping off their civvies, they emerge from the phone booth a star. Christopher Reeve gave a breezy, farcical charge to Superman and Clark Kent. As Batman and his alter ego, the wastrel playboy Bruce Wayne, Michael Keaton seemed to have a thousand things on his mind, most of them unpleasant. But poor Mr. Affleck is lost in the minor, passable "Daredevil," in which he portrays the blind, red-costumed and horn-headed crime fighter whose other senses -- hearing, touch, taste -- were exaggerated in the chemical accident that cost him his sight. A big man, Mr. Affleck is shriveled by the one-dimensional role. Even his scarlet leather outfit makes him diminutive. The interlocked double D on his left breast makes him look like part of the food-service industry: "Hi, I'm Daredevil, and I'll be your superhero this evening" (Elvis Mitchell).

* "GANGS OF NEW YORK," starring Leonardo DiCaprio, Daniel Day-Lewis and Cameron Diaz. Directed by Martin Scorsese (R, 165 minutes). Long awaited, enormously expensive, endlessly gossiped about, Mr. Scorsese's brutal epic of mid-19th-century Manhattan is a near-great film that, as time goes by, may well make up the distance. As has happened before with this director's films, the fairly conventional story -- a revenge tragedy pitting a young Irish immigrant (Mr. DiCaprio) against his father's killer, a nativist warlord (Mr. Day-Lewis) -- is less interesting than the setting. Mr. Day-Lewis gives his character, known as Bill the Butcher, an earthy Shakespearean grandeur. If Mr. DiCaprio and Ms. Diaz (in the underimagined role of a spirited pickpocket) don't shed their movie-star auras, they do show themselves to be intrepid and engaging actors. But the real achievement of the movie is the way it brings history to life, not merely by meticulously recreating its details but by offering a troubling and timely interpretation of how the violence and iniquity of the past continue to ramify into the present. The film, flawed and indelible, is nothing less than an attempt to re-imagine the germs of America's historical identity (Scott).

"HOW TO LOSE A GUY IN 10 DAYS," starring Kate Hudson, Matthew McConaughey and Bebe Neuwirth. Directed by Donald Petrie (PG-13, 100 minutes). Yet another mediocre New York romantic comedy, yes, but notably less mediocre than "Maid in Manhattan" and "Two Weeks Notice." This is because Ms. Hudson and Mr. McConaughey are an energetic, well-matched comic pair and because the writers have smuggled a few sharp, funny jokes into the lockstep conventions of the plot. The premise, too, has a nice frost of screwball cynicism, as the two principals woo each other for venal, professional reasons. Ben (Mr. McConaughey), a tomcatting ad man, must make a woman fall in love with him if he is to win a big account; to write a feature article for a women's magazine, Andie (Ms. Hudson) must drive a man away. Would you believe that they actually fall in love? Nobody would, but it's sometimes fun to pretend, just as it's fun to pretend that the advertising and magazine industries are untouched by recession and Staten Island is full of people who talk as if they're from Texas (Scott).

"THE HUNTED," starring Tommy Lee Jones and Benicio Del Toro. Directed by William Friedkin (R, 94 minutes). It's probably best that the plot of "The Hunted" -- such as it is -- doesn't get in the way of the action sequences, most of which involve Mr. Jones chasing Mr. Del Toro throughout the Pacific Northwest with occasional stops for hand-to-hand combat that make you fear for the actors' safety. Mr. Del Toro is Aaron Hallam, a government-sanctioned killing machine being pursued by L. T. Bonham (Mr. Jones), an independent-contractor tracker brought in by the F.B.I. before Hallam slaughters a cross-section of the population of the Pacific Standard Time Zone. This isn't a movie -- it's a police report -- and the strictly-the-facts terseness of the story makes that more than clear. That tone is first reflected in the use of Johnny Cash's laconic moroseness over the opening title to set the mood, but it also establishes a level of expectation that the film can't live up to. Mr. Friedkin might as well paint bull's-eyes on the backs of the actors, since it's obvious that "The Hunted" regards them as nothing but expendable (Mitchell).

* "LAUREL CANYON," starring Frances McDormand, Christian Bale, Kate Beckinsale, Natascha McElhone and Alessandro Nivola. Written and directed by Lisa Cholodenko (R, 103 minutes). Ms. McDormand is indelible as Jane Bentley, a leonine, free-spirited Hollywood record producer of a certain age in Ms. Cholodenko's follow-up to "High Art." Once again, the milieu is upscale bohemian, with the setting moved from the New York art world to the Los Angeles rock scene. Tensions build when Jane's son (Mr. Bale) by a former liaison and his wife (Ms. Beckinsale), both doctors, pay her a prolonged visit while she is completing an album with a British rock band. Although the music is more 70's and 80's than contemporary in flavor, this sexy movie, which portrays the Laurel Canyon neighborhood as a voluptuous lotus land, is a balanced, snappily written study of the reverse generation gap. Mr. Nivola smolders as Jane's much-younger lover (Holden).

"THE LIFE OF DAVID GALE," starring Kevin Spacey. Directed by Alan Parker (R, 130 minutes). In this would-be thriller, Mr. Spacey plays a death-penalty opponent facing execution for murder. As the title character, a downtrodden philosophy professor and activist who has become an alcoholic criminal, he evinces a weariness in his voice. The words float out of his mouth as if he were too tired to muster the strength for a single inflection, and this gives the picture the merest trace of believability. But that's before the crude, bullying narrative begins peppering the audience with kidney punches: "David Gale" may be the first liberal-leaning movie that could be brought up on assault charges since its director made "Midnight Express." Mr. Parker seems to think audiences are incapable of coming to their own conclusions, so he relieves them of that burden by doing it for them (Mitchell).

* "THE SAFETY OF OBJECTS," starring Glenn Close, Dermot Mulroney, Jessica Campbell, Joshua Jackson and Patricia Clarkson. Directed by Rose Troche (R, 120 minutes). Ms. Troche's adaptation of A. M. Homes's book of stories, which weaves together jarring comic-gothic vignettes of suburban misery into a somber, lurid tapestry, invites comparison to Robert Altman's "Short Cuts." But whereas Mr. Altman cobbled Raymond Carver's sorrowful deadpan into a vision of social disconnection, Ms. Troche mines Ms. Homes's jagged minimalism for its grim, compassionate metaphysics. The four families under scrutiny, who live within a few yards of each other, present a tableau of fallen humanity, trying to exercise free will in a cruel and absurd universe. Ms. Close is especially fine as a mother grieving for her comatose son (Mr. Jackson), but the rest of the cast comes close to matching her precision and restraint. Though it has some awkward patches, and occasionally risks melodrama, "Safety" is on the whole a remarkably graceful satire, out of which sympathy sprouts like an unruly weed (Scott).

* "SPIDER," starring Ralph Fiennes, Miranda Richardson and Gabriel Byrne. Directed by David Cronenberg (R, 98 minutes). This bleak minimalist film adapted from Patrick McGrath's novel (with a screenplay by the author) crawls into the mind of Dennis Cleg (Mr. Fiennes), a paranoid-schizophrenic in his 30's who is discharged from a mental hospital into a grim halfway house near where he grew up in east London. The desolate urban environment mirrors the mental condition of a man whose warped memories of a homicide two decades earlier come flooding back as he revisits childhood landmarks. Mr. Fiennes's mumbling, agitated psychotic is an uncompromising portrait of a sad, creepy wreck. Ms. Richardson is equally disturbing in the dual roles of his demure mother and a Cockney tart, who personify the mother-whore dichotomy that obsesses Dennis. The recurrent imagery of spider webs, jigsaw puzzles and tangled string adds a layer of poetic creepiness (Holden).

"SPUN," starring Jason Schwartzman, John Leguizamo, Mena Suvari, Patrick Fugit, Brittany Murphy and Mickey Rourke. Directed by Jonas Akerlund (not rated, 96 minutes). In its comically expressionistic rendering of the drug experience (in this case crystal methedrine), "Spun" could be called "Requiem for a Dream II." The movie, which owes a huge debt to Darren Aronofsky's druggy nightmare, examines the wasted lives of a circle of speed freaks in North Los Angeles Valley. Mr. Schwartzman is a college dropout on a downhill spiral; Mr. Leguizamo a paranoid drug dealer named Spider Mike and Ms. Suvari his strung-out girlfriend; Ms. Murphy a stripper who snorts speed; and Mr. Rourke, in a swaggering macho turn, the cowboy chemist who cooks up the poison. With its bleached-out colors and MTV-style visuals (including pornographic cartoon fantasies), the movie is a prolonged immersion in hell (Holden).

"TEARS OF THE SUN," starring Bruce Willis and Monica Bellucci. Directed by Antoine Fuqua (R, 118 minutes). And also of boredom, frustration and fatigue, as an honorable intention -- to explore the moral conundrums of humanitarian military intervention -- bogs down in dramatic and ideological incoherence. Mr. Willis plays a United States Navy Seal who parachutes into the jungles of war-torn Nigeria to rescue an American doctor (Ms. Bellucci). He and his men end up trying to save a few dozen refugees from becoming victims of a ghastly genocidal campaign. The film's sentimentality is so overpowering, and so dumb, that it fails as drama, as action and as geopolitical fable. The filmmakers have gone to the trouble to invent a fictitious civil war in a real country, and for what? To soothe the American conscience about its failure to prevent actual recent slaughters? To give Mr. Willis another opportunity to exercise his talent for weary, manly stoicism? To give the egregious Hans Zimmer, who wrote the score, a chance to incorporate drums and pseudo-African choral effects? (Scott).

"WILLARD," starring Crispin Glover, R. Lee Ermey, Laura Elena Harring and Jackie Burroughs. Written and directed by Glen Morgan (PG-13, 105 minutes). This remake of the popular 1971 horror thriller about a cowering mama's boy who avenges himself on the world by mobilizing an army of rats (500 actual rodents were trained for the film) has a stylish gothic look. But like many remakes, it is so self-conscious about its own past (and its debts to "Psycho" and "The Birds") that it plays as a wooden, not terribly scary exercise in recycling. The screenplay is too clunky for the actors to do much with their characters. But Mr. Glover, shamelessly hamming it up as the rodents' best friend and leader, makes Willard a flashily demonic goofball (Holden).

Oscar Jockeying, Down to the Wire
 The Oscar campaign is over. The votes, due last Tuesday, are in the hands of Price Waterhouse, being tabulated for Sunday night's ceremony (related article, Page 1 of Weekend). There are no more advertisements to be run, no more hastily arranged tributes to be held, no more talk shows to be booked with Oscar contenders. 
 Yet the dirty tricks and wild accusations continued unabated through the final days. Who was responsible for getting Samantha Geimer, who in 1977 was the 13-year-old victim of Roman Polanski's sexual advances, to write a warmly phrased opinion article in The Los Angeles Times asking Oscar voters not to take Mr. Polanski's personal life into account when judging "The Pianist"?
And who was then responsible for leaking the transcript of the 1977 grand jury hearings on the Polanski case to an Internet site, the Smoking Gun (www.thesmokinggun.com), where Ms. Geimer's testimony can be read?
A spokesman for the Smoking Gun has said that the documents came from open court files, but that hasn't stopped speculation that the records were dug up by a rival distributor hoping to harm Mr. Polanski's Oscar chances.
The tooth-and-claw competition reached a new level last weekend, when The Los Angeles Times reported that an opinion article in The Los Angeles Daily News and The Long Beach Press-Telegram -- an endorsement of Martin Scorsese for best director, signed by Robert Wise, the venerable Hollywood filmmaker and past president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences -- had actually been written by a Miramax publicist, Murray Weissman, and submitted to Mr. Wise for his approval. Miramax subsequently reprinted the article as an advertisement in several publications.
When the academy suggested that the advertisement was a violation of its bylaws, which forbid individual members to reveal how they will vote, Miramax stopped running it. But nowhere does Mr. Wise say he is voting for Mr. Scorsese. His most enthusiastic statement took the form of a question: "Could this be the year that Oscar catches up with the rest of us and recognizes the wonderful body of work of this great director?" 
In a statement issued by Rick Sands, chairman of worldwide distribution for Miramax, the company said, "We were completely unaware that this was something academy members found offensive, and since there is nothing that addresses this in the academy marketing guidelines, we certainly did not know this practice was a violation of academy rules."
Mr. Sands cited other examples of academy members endorsing particular nominees in advertisements, including last year's "Moulin Rouge" campaign, to which Mr. Wise also lent his name.
One veteran Oscar campaigner, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said: "There's a lot of hypocrisy in the academy's position. What this really boils down to is an East Coast-West Coast spat." Miramax, though a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Corporation, is based in New York; the academy was founded by Hollywood studio heads and continues to be a Hollywood-centered organization even as relatively few Hollywood films receive nominations.

Hong Kong Holdout
The Hong Kong film industry is no longer the creative center it was in the 1980's and early 90's. Many of its leading figures -- directors like John Woo and Tsui Hark and performers like Jackie Chan, Jet Li and Chow Yun-Fat -- have gone international, making films in Hollywood and Europe with only occasional visits home. The industry itself is shaky, faced with a weakened local economy and stronger competition from big-budget American films. 
But Johnnie To continues to keep the faith. As a producer or director, Mr. To has had his name on about 50 films since his 1980 directorial debut, "The Enigmatic Case." He is arguably the most interesting figure still working the commercial side of Hong Kong cinema. (Wong Kar-Wai, whose "In the Mood for Love" was an international art house success, remains a major force, though even his worst enemies wouldn't accuse him of being commercial.) 
The latest of Mr. To's films to reach the United States is "Fulltime Killer," which opens today in Manhattan (review, Page 31). Based on a novel that was a best seller in Hong Kong, about the rivalry between a flamboyant Cantonese hit man (Andy Lau) and his buttoned-down Japanese counterpart (Takashi Sorimachi), the film is much more stylized and spectacularly violent than Mr. To's usual work, which has had a gritty, street-level quality closer to the work of Don Siegel ("Dirty Harry") and Phil Karlson ("The Phenix City Story").
Mr. To entered the film business through a time-honored method. "I was working at a TV station as a messenger," he recalled in an interview at the Toronto Film Festival, where "Fulltime Killer" was shown. "The drama department accepted me as an assistant director, but I only spent two years doing that. At that time, it was easy to become a director because there were many new stations and they all needed new productions."
After his first feature, Mr. To spent seven more years in television, honing his technique, then returned to the movies for "Happy Ghost 3," a supernatural comedy starring Maggie Cheung. His first big hit was "All About Ah-Long," a 1989 tear-jerker starring Chow Yun-Fat.
Mr. To has merrily continued to mix genres. "First is action, second is comedy, and in the middle is some drama," Mr. To said, an analysis that could apply to the internal structure of his films as well as to the course of his career. He followed "Fulltime Killer" with "Love on a Diet," in which two of Hong Kong's most attractive performers, Andy Lau and Sammi Cheng, don fat suits.
His company, Milky Way Image, released seven titles in 2001. The main reason Mr. To can work so quickly is his creative partnership with Wai Ka Fai, a writer as soft-spoken and retiring as Mr. To is exuberant. Mr. Wai is responsible for all phases of production up to actual shooting: finding source material, writing scripts and helping with casting and location scouting. Asthe British director Michael Powell did with his screenwriting partner, Emeric Pressburger, Mr. To gives Mr. Wai equal status in the credits: "Fulltime Killer" is a film "by Johnnie To and Wai Ka Fai."
Until a museum mounts a more thorough retrospective of Mr. To's work, the best way to see some of his older films is on video. Among the ones available in the United States are "The Mission" and "Running Out of Time," both from 1999. "I made 'The Mission' for 500,000 American dollars, including cast," Mr. To said, explaining why he has so far chosen to remain in Hong Kong. "On a Hollywood film, that would not pay for the catering."
