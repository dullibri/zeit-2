HEADLINE: Struggling Against a Venti Starbucks Tide

BYLINE: By KIRK JOHNSON

 BODY:
SEATTLE -- This city got caffeinated over the past couple of decades, buzzed on its rise in the pop culture as a symbol of hipster-geekster cool, but also on the real stuff: coffee.
Like salt and pepper -- or more aptly, cream and sugar -- coffee and Seattle became an item, each word modifying and reinforcing the other, thanks mainly, of course, to Starbucks, the coffee giant that exploded around the world from here. Starbucks exported beans and brews, wrapping it all in a cool, earth-toned vision of Pacific Northwest life that may or may not have reflected reality.
But what is it like to compete head-to-head, latte for latte, against Starbucks in the throne room itself? Ask Demi Larsen. She's a 25-year-old manager at a Tully's Coffee, a struggling local chain that positioned itself years ago as the alternative choice for Seattle coffee-heads -- brightly lighted where Starbucks was dim, medium roast where Starbucks was dark. 
''Starbucks opened the conversation,'' Ms. Larsen said in a Tully's near the University of Washington. But where Starbucks has become a designer global brand, she said, Tully's tried to hold its roots as a local joint where the coffee comes first. ''I have my Coach bag and I have my Gucci sunglasses and I have my Starbucks coffee,'' she said of the brand mentality. ''And there is a Starbucks avoider we definitely get -- 'Are you guys owned by Starbucks? No? O.K., good. We can get our coffee then.' ''
Trying harder because you're No. 2, though, is perhaps a better slogan than it is a business model. This month, Tully's, which expanded to about 200 stores at its peak -- mostly on the West Coast, from here down into California -- filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection and closed many of its shops as it deals with rising costs, sour real estate decisions, relentless competition from the big kid on the block and perhaps the harsh reality that Coach and Gucci are hard to beat.
Why Seattle became synonymous with coffee at all, to the degree that the glass windows of a 1970s-vintage Starbucks have become a downtown tourist photo-op, is a chicken-and-egg question if ever there were one. Did coffee become huge here because the place so needed stimulants -- a chemical restorative to the gloomy damp -- or was it on some level a marketing creation that became real over time by force of repetition?
''The 'idea of Seattle' was, and is, an idea of urban livability that lives on in the DNA of every upscale coffee retailer, whether they think of it that way and acknowledge it or not,'' said James Lyons, a senior lecturer in the English department at the University of Exeter in England and author of ''Selling Seattle,'' a book about how Seattle identity and Seattle products, from coffee to grunge music, was harnessed together for fun and profit.
''Every time I see a new, independent coffee store opt for outfacing window seating, so you can sip your latte and watch the world go by, the store owes a debt to Starbucks and its origins in Seattle,'' Dr. Lyons said in an e-mail.
Tully's president and chief executive, Scott Pearson, said that prices for coffee and dairy products have risen in ways that cannot be fully passed on to customers, and that store locations locked in before the great recession, when the economic future seemed as frothy as bone-dry cappuccino, have been hard to sustain in tougher times. The company will continue to operate, he said, and hopes to emerge from bankruptcy protection early next year.
Starbucks, meanwhile, is not standing still waiting for the next challenger to step up.
The company's senior vice president for global coffee, Craig Russell, said that with recent renovations of stores around the world, the company is reaching back into its own past for echoes of how the first Starbucks felt 40-odd years ago, before anyone thought of it as Seattle institution.
''They have a sensibility of the Pacific Northwest, but they're locally relevant,'' he said. ''As an example, I might say, we have a store in France -- part of it is made from barrel staves, from wine barrels.''
As with any industry that carves its initials deep into a city's psyche -- entertainment in Hollywood, or big finance in New York -- there are also places and companies here that have found niches beyond the swilling down of the coffee itself.
Home Espresso Repair and Cafe, for example -- a company started and staffed by former Starbucks employees -- has two tables, a banged-up guitar on the wall and a back room full of home-brew machines being lovingly restored. Some are huge antiques from an era of brass and iron, with milk-frothers that look as if they could put out three-alarm fires. Others are compact and lithe, Scandinavian designs that could be art objects.
''Some people think huge companies like Starbucks or Tully's put a bad name on coffee,'' said Shari Rainlyn, who repairs machines and makes coffee in the front. ''Really, places like my shop wouldn't be here if it wasn't for the huge companies. Not that I go there to get my coffee on Saturday morning. I don't.''

HEADLINE: Firms Don't Share Consumer Optimism

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ and NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Consumers may finally be feeling more optimistic about the economy, but corporate America is not sharing the sentiment.
A host of market bellwethers reported disappointing results Tuesday and cut their outlook for future growth, sending stocks into a tailspin and highlighting the divide between companies and consumers.
It was Wall Street's second big drop in the last three trading days, with household names like Xerox, 3M and DuPont leading the way down as the Dow Jones industrial average dropped more than 240 points. The Dow is now down 3.7 percent from its high for the year reached earlier this month.
The concerns among business leaders extend well beyond earnings -- a Federal Reserve regional survey released Tuesday showed new signs of weakness in the domestic manufacturing sector, even as global growth slows.
Corporate executives also reiterated the danger posed to the economy if Washington cannot avert sharp tax increases and spending cuts in early January, the fiscal cliff that many economists say heightens the risk of recession. This uncertainty is compounded by the prospect of a new Fed chairman by early 2014. 
The pessimism is all the more notable because after years of wariness, consumers are feeling more buoyant. Consumer confidence is at its highest point since before the financial crisis. The housing market is showing signs of life. And retail sales actually sped up in the third quarter, fueling the hopes of retailers for a robust holiday season.
''Normally, you think of consumer confidence as more important,'' said Ethan Harris, chief United States economist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''But the business sector is a quarter or two ahead this time.''
One reason for the disparity is that businesses are much more focused on conditions abroad than consumers in the United States. With growth in China slowing and parts of Europe in recession, cooling international sales are weighing on corporate earnings. The prospect of slowing global demand for oil generated a sell-off Tuesday, as crude fell 2.2 percent, to $86.67, its lowest level since July.
Indeed, the sectors that rely more on international sales have been among those hit the hardest. Xerox, 3M and United Technologies each lowered their outlook.
While the fiscal cliff looms large in boardrooms, consumers are less concerned about whether Congress will extend Bush-era tax cuts set to expire in January and whether it will come up with a deal to cut the deficit and avert automatic spending cuts.
''Clearly, there is something going on, with consumers going one way and businesses going the other,'' said Paul Ashworth, chief United States economist at Capital Economics.
Looking ahead, optimists say the new willingness of consumers to spend will ultimately bolster corporate results, but there is a lingering fear that the struggles of American companies may be pointing the way.
''The heads of the large corporations have their fingers on a lot of information,'' said Bernard F. McGinn, president of McGinn Investment Management. ''The decisions they make are of a scale many times what the consumer does.''
A case in point is DuPont, the chemical maker, which said Tuesday it would eliminate 1,500 jobs. Dow Chemical disclosed plans to cut 2,400 workers, or 5 percent of its global work force, and trim $500 million in costs as it copes with what the company called a ''slow-growth environment in the near-term.''
The growth in corporate profits of the last few years had been forecast to ebb in the latest quarter. But sales have been unexpectedly weak, and those correlate closely with customer demand. As of Tuesday, 91 of 145 big companies that had reported quarterly results said revenue was below analysts' expectations, according to Thomson Reuters.
The weakest link in the global chain has been Europe. The deepest fears of a collapse in the euro appear to have receded since the European Central Bank indicated in July that it would step in to support the Continent's weaker economies. Now, attention has shifted to the protracted recession that some parts of Europe appear to be entering.
Moody's said on Tuesday that it was downgrading the credit rating of five Spanish regions. That led investors to sell Spanish government bonds and European banks, sending leading indexes down more than 2 percent in France and Germany.
For many investors, the more unpredictable factor will be the Chinese economy, which has been growing at a much slower rate.
DuPont's chief executive, Ellen J. Kullman, said Tuesday that her company's disappointing profits ''reflect continued weak market conditions in Europe and uncertainty in Asia.'' The company's shares fell 9 percent.
The Dow Jones industrial average fell 1.82 percent, or 243.36 points, to 13,102.53, its worst performance since June. The losses added to the big declines on Friday, and dropped leading indexes to their lowest levels since early September, before the Federal Reserve announced its latest monetary stimulus program.
Since the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index hit this year's high of 1,465.77 on Sept. 14, the benchmark index has fallen 3.6 percent. It declined 1.44 percent, or 20.71 points, to 1,413.11.
The Nasdaq composite index, which led losses last week, fell less than other major gauges, dropping 0.88 percent, or 26.49 points, to 2,990.46.
In the bond market, interest rates declined. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 15/32, to 98 25/32, while its yield fell to 1.76 percent from 1.82 late Monday.
Until recently, the American economy had largely managed to shrug off these global worries. Now, with Washington deadlocked at least until the election and quite possibly beyond, executives are signaling turbulence ahead in the United States, too.
''We did not predict the incremental strains on business from the widespread economic uncertainty, especially in the United States,'' Ursula M. Burns, the chief executive of Xerox, said on Tuesday in a call announcing her company's disappointing third-quarter results.
The biggest domestic threat to American companies is the fiscal cliff, but investors are focusing on the longer-term possibility that the aggressive monetary stimulus of the last few years will come to an end when the term of Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, expires in early 2014.
In the meantime, stronger consumer spending could still help some companies. Whirlpool executives on Tuesday cited the improving housing market and strengthening consumer demand as improving the company's outlook.
So, will the views of consumers prevail?
''Right now it's a tug of war,'' said Mr. Harris of Bank of America. ''Ultimately, if businesses pull back and slow down hiring, it will trickle down to the consumer.''
Before the last recession, in 2007 and 2008, consumers grew pessimistic well before business leaders did, Mr. Harris said, weighed down by the deteriorating housing market and surging gasoline prices. The plunge in confidence among business leaders came mainly after the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing stock market crash, Mr. Harris noted.
But this time, Mr. Harris expects economic growth to slow to an annual rate of 1 percent in the next two quarters, well below his 1.7 percent estimate for the third quarter.
The pattern was different before the brief recession in 2001, said Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays. Back then, businesses were the first to pull back as the tech bubble burst and companies cut back on spending.
On the other hand, he said, in 1990 and 1991, consumers pulled back first amid a surge in oil prices after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait.
On the way out of a recession, he added, consumers often point the way.
''Once businesses go into contraction mode, they typically won't stop until they see sales stabilize, and that usually comes from the consumer,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Sale Brings Former Owner Back to the Essex House

BYLINE: By TERRY PRISTIN

 BODY:
When the Essex House, the Art Deco hotel on Manhattan's Central Park South, changed hands last month, it was a homecoming for two major players in the hotel industry.
The buyer, Strategic Hotels and Resorts, a real estate investment trust based in Chicago that owns 18 high-end hotels, bought back the 44-story hotel from the same company to which it had sold the Essex House seven years ago -- Dubai Group. And Marriott International, which is now operating the hotel, also has a history there; the Marriott Corporation, from which it was spun off, owned the hotel from 1969 to 1985.
The sale of this prized asset is part of an attempt by the royal family of Dubai to retrench and reorganize its real estate holdings. Dubai Investment Group, as the company was then known, and its sister companies had made a heavy bet during the boom years on trophy properties in the United States, only to have their ambitions curtailed by the recession.
Last year, Dubai Group transferred control of its United States properties to Silverpeak Real Estate Partners, a company created by Mark A. Walsh, who headed Lehman Brothers' real estate operations. Dubai Group was recently sued by three banks after failing to reach an agreement on restructuring its debt. 
As it turned out, the sour economy was not the only problem to plague the Essex House.
After Dubai Investment Group bought it in 2005 for $423.9 million, it brought in Jumeirah Group, the royal family's five-star hotel management company, to run the hotel. Jumeirah sought to create a flagship that would make its brand as well known in North America as it is in the Middle East and Europe.
The new owner emblazoned the Jumeirah name on the hotel marquee in letters that dwarfed the words Essex House, and poured $91 million into the property, updating the bathrooms, refurbishing the rooms with period furniture and creating the glamorous South Gate restaurant in the space formerly occupied by Cafe Botanica.
But despite these efforts, the Essex House did poorly, hotel specialists said. Last month, Dubai Group defaulted on $303 million in loans and then sold the hotel to Strategic for $362.3 million, with KSL Capital Partners of Denver joining Strategic as a minority partner.
At 509 rooms, the Essex House is smaller than it was when Strategic last owned it because 90 rooms have since been converted into condos. Even so, Strategic got the hotel back for $685,000 a unit, $45,000 less per unit than the 2005 selling price. Nine unsold condos also came with the deal, but those without views of the park will probably revert to hotel rooms, said Laurence S. Geller, the chief executive of Strategic.
The hotel was a poor fit for the Jumeirah brand, said Arthur Adler, chief executive of Jones Lang LaSalle Hotels Americas, who represented the sellers in the recent sale.
''This was a six-star location with a four-and-a-half-star hotel. It didn't really fit with their strategy,'' he said. ''When travelers came from overseas, this wasn't the Jumeirah experience they were looking for.'' Most of the bathrooms, for example, are smaller than what five-star customers expect.
Silverpeak declined to comment.
Mr. Geller said foreign companies and smaller brands do not have the marketing muscle, including brand recognition and rewards programs, needed to make a large New York hotel successful. Mr. Geller signed a 50-year operating contract with Marriott International, which he said was underrepresented in New York compared to its peers.
A decade ago, Strategic sued Marriott, accusing the management company of deceptive business practices, but the two parties eventually reconciled, and Marriott now manages one-third of Strategic's properties.
Several hotel specialists said they expected the newly renamed J. W. Marriott Essex House to do well. ''Marriott is a very powerful marketing organization,'' said John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting U.S.A. ''They put heads in beds. They fill up rooms.''
Arne Sorenson, Marriott's chief executive, said that in the hotel's first two weeks under the Marriott flag, 40 percent of the customers were members of the Marriott rewards program.
He described the J. W. Marriott brand as ''approachable'' or ''casual'' luxury and said that room rates were likely to be at least $150 less than those at the Ritz-Carlton a block to the east on Central Park South. At present, rates at the Essex House start at $549 a night, compared with $895 a night for the Ritz-Carlton, according to their respective Web sites. Mr. Sorenson acknowledged that Marriott had bid on the hotel after it went on the market in March. ''We love this hotel,'' he said. ''In some respects, we've been trying to get it back ever since we sold it.''
As a sign of its faith in the Essex House, Marriott agreed to guarantee $21.5 million of annual net operating income for the next eight years, substantially more than the hotel was earning under the Jumeirah brand. If the revenue falls short, the hotel operator will contribute up to $40 million toward reaching that goal.
Strategic itself plans to spend $18.3 million to renovate public spaces and make other improvements.
Mr. Geller said he sold the hotel in 2005 because at that time he would have had to spend much more -- at least $50 million -- to upgrade it. But he said he had been eager to return to the lucrative Manhattan hotel market. ''I missed having a hotel in New York, but I couldn't afford one,'' he said.
For many years, analysts have criticized Strategic over being more heavily leveraged than its publicly traded peers. To buy the Essex House, Strategic obtained a $190 million loan from Bank of America and teamed up with KSL, but the cash-short hotel company still had to lay out $85 million.
''We don't think the company has done enough to fund the acquisition of the Essex House,'' said Enrique Torres, a hotel REIT analyst at Green Street Advisors in Newport Beach, Calif.
But Strategic recently placed its Four Seasons Resort in Jackson Hole, Wyo., on the market, and Mr. Torres said a sale of that property would improve the company's balance sheet, offsetting the Essex purchase.
One way to increase revenue from the hotel would be to turn more rooms into condos. Mr. Geller said there is another advantage to this strategy. ''At 500 rooms, I have to sell a lot of meetings,'' he said. ''At 400, I wouldn't.''
To Mr. Geller, who was raised in London and began his hotel career more than half a century ago as a kitchen porter, the Essex House offers other moneymaking opportunities, especially given the transformation that Time Warner Center has brought to the neighborhood. ''When we owned this hotel before,'' Mr. Geller said, ''Central Park South stopped at Sixth Avenue.''
Now the back door of the Essex House is opposite the rear entrance of the Park Hyatt at the new superluxury condominium tower at One57, which is under construction on 57th Street between Seventh Avenue and Avenue of the Americas.
Mr. Geller said he would work with KSL to figure out how best to fill the empty retail spaces along 58th Street, including the former Alain Ducasse restaurant, which was evicted by Dubai Group in 2006 because it was not earning revenue for the hotel.
During his previous ownership of the Essex House, Mr. Geller said, the hotel, which has a small but elegant ballroom, earned more than $3 million a year on weddings and bar mitzvahs -- business that was lost when Jumeirah ran the hotel. ''We'll get back the catering business,'' he said.
''I look at this as an incredibly interesting mixed-use real estate opportunity,'' Mr. Geller added.

HEADLINE: Getting More Bang for the Fed's Buck

BYLINE: By JOSEPH A. GRUNDFEST, MARK A. LEMLEY and GEORGE G. TRIANTIS. 
Joseph A. Grundfest, Mark A. Lemley and George G. Triantis are professors at Stanford Law School. Mr. Grundfest was a commissioner of the Securities and Exchange Commission from 1985 to 1990.

 BODY:
Stanford, Calif.
IN September, the Federal Reserve announced that it would begin purchasing $40 billion of mortgage-backed bonds every month until the outlook for the labor market improved substantially or inflation reared its ugly head.
The Fed hopes that these purchases will lower mortgage rates, boost new construction, prop up home values, lift stock prices and otherwise energize the moribund job market.
Experts disagree on whether these purchases will stimulate employment and promote recovery, or trigger an inflationary spiral and saddle the Fed with substantial losses if interest rates spike before the Fed can unwind its position. 
We don't intend to weigh in on these debates -- but we do want to start a different one: is the mortgage market really the smartest place to spend all this money? Wouldn't the Fed get more employment bang for its monetary buck by purchasing state and municipal bonds?
Instead of a third round of so-called ''quantitative easing,'' known in the financial markets as QE3, maybe it's time for a QE-Muni. Here's why.
State and municipal bonds help finance new infrastructure projects like roads and bridges, as well as pay for some government salaries and services, by borrowing against future tax receipts. With about $3.7 trillion in debt outstanding, it's a big and sprawling marketplace for bonds. But even at that size, it's less than half as large as the securitized mortgage market.
So every Fed dollar spent in the muni market would absorb a larger percentage of outstanding debt and is likely to have a greater effect on reducing the bonds' interest rates than the same expenditure in the mortgage market. The greater the effect in reducing borrowing costs in either market, the more powerful the impact on employment is likely to be.
In addition, while the current Fed program helps keep mortgage rates low, its effect on the economy isn't direct. Rock-bottom rates, naturally, will prompt some to buy homes or spend more on renovations -- both of which spur job creation. But some homeowners will simply refinance to increase their savings, which has a less immediate stimulus effect. In contrast, lowering the borrowing costs for states, cities and counties should not only forestall tax increases (which dampen individual spending), but also make it easier for local governments to pay for police officers, firefighters, teachers and infrastructure improvements.
Finally, while the private sector is hiring (with a net gain of 4.7 million jobs since February 2010), the public sector continues to lay off workers. We've lost a million government jobs since 2010. Republicans and Democrats alike have been decrying the failure to stimulate the economy through the infrastructure improvements that are necessary to keep our economy competitive. But shrinking tax revenues and limited debt service capacity have tied the hands of state and local governments.
To be sure, our proposal raises pragmatic, political and legal challenges. For starters, the muni bond market is highly fragmented, and many bond issues are illiquid. Having the Fed train billions of dollars of buying firepower on this market could roil the pricing of individual bond offerings.
This problem could be addressed, we think, by having the Fed announce the amount and quality of muni debt that it's willing to buy in a given month; sellers could then choose whether or not to come to the table. (That would also allow the Fed to sidestep the politically loaded question of which state's bonds to buy: the market can make that decision.)
From a political perspective, some will object that our plan would unfairly bail out states and municipalities that have been profligate in the past, a problem economists call moral hazard.
Such an objection might be addressed, in part, by restricting the Fed to purchases of bonds that pay for critical infrastructure or hiring rather than, say, new sports stadiums.
A still bigger problem with our proposal is simple. It is illegal, at least as the law currently stands. The Federal Reserve Act prohibits the Fed from purchasing muni debt with a maturity of more than six months, and none of the beneficial effects we predict from QE-Muni can occur unless the Fed is able to buy longer-dated muni paper.
But after the elections, Congress will head into the mother of all negotiation sessions as it tries to avoid the fiscal cliff. All options will be on the table. And as both Republicans and Democrats look for strategies that create the greatest number of jobs at the lowest cost to the public treasury, wouldn't it make sense to give the Fed another tool to help it spend our money more effectively?
Yes, we can and should debate whether another round of quantitative easing is the medicine that the economy needs now. But if it's the medicine we're destined to get, shouldn't we do all we can to assure that it works as best it can?

HEADLINE: Iran's Threat To Oil Market Fails to Send Prices Higher

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Iran threatened on Tuesday to halt all its oil exports if the West's antinuclear sanctions on the country are strengthened, apparently in the hope that such a warning would spook the international petroleum market by raising prices and reminding the world of Iran's potential to wreak havoc with the global economy. 
But the threat, made by Rostam Qasemi, Iran's oil minister, at the World Energy Forum, a conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, appeared to have no impact. In a possible reflection of how steeply Iran's influence in the market has eroded, oil prices fell to a three-month low.
Iran holds the world's fourth-largest oil reserves and was once the second-biggest producer in the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, behind Saudi Arabia. But the regimen of American and European sanctions over the past year has severely restricted its ability to produce and sell oil, the country's most important export.
The International Energy Agency, a group of mostly Western oil importers, reported this month that Iran's daily production fell to a nearly 25-year low of 2.63 million barrels a day in September and that oil exports that month totaled only 860,000 barrels a day, compared with 2.2 million barrels a day at the end of 2011. Iran has disputed those figures.
At the same time, Iranian officials have acknowledged that the Western sanctions have wounded the country's economy. Outside experts, noting a severe devaluation in the currency and other troubling indicators, have said the country's economic problems are severe and worsening quickly. The United States and European Union have said more sanctions are looming.
Mr. Qasemi was quoted by news agencies at the Dubai conference as saying Iran had contingency plans to survive without any oil revenue if further sanctions were applied. The sanctions are meant to pressure Iran into suspending its uranium enrichment, which Western nations suspect is meant to enable Iran to produce nuclear weapons.
''If you continue to add to the sanctions, we cut our oil exports to the world,'' the minister was quoted as saying. ''We are hopeful that this doesn't happen, because citizens will suffer. We don't want to see European and U.S. citizens suffer.''
But Mr. Qasemi's remarks, which might have once caused oil traders to bid up the price on fears of a supply shortage, had no effect. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, the price of the benchmark grade fell $1.98 a barrel or 2.3 percent to $86.67, the lowest closing price since July 12.
''It's a classic weak man's poker hand,'' Cliff Kupchan, a Washington-based analyst at the Eurasia Group, a consulting firm, said of the Iranian minister's remarks. ''It's what you do if you're running out of chips and you need more money.''
Oil traders attributed the weakness in the oil market to fears about a global economic slowdown that would reduce demand in the months ahead.

HEADLINE: For Venezuela, a Season of Joy in a Faraway Place

BYLINE: By WILLIAM NEUMAN; María Eugenia Díaz contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CARACAS, Venezuela - As Marco Scutaro stared into the falling rain and prepared to glove the pop-up that would be the last out of the National League Championship Series on Monday night, the television announcer here crowed, "It had to be a Venezuelan!"
When Scutaro was named the most valuable player of the N.L.C.S. a short time later, it was merely the latest milestone in what has been a banner year for Venezuelan-born ballplayers in the major leagues. 
There are a total of nine Venezuelan-born players on the two teams in the World Series, the San Francisco Giants and the Detroit Tigers, which newspapers here said was a record number.
"It's going to be a very Venezuelan Series," said Francisco Suniaga, a novelist and Giants fan who lives in Caracas and who sometimes writes about baseball. He recalled the years of his childhood when Luis Aparicio, the White Sox shortstop, was his country's big star in the major leagues. "It was lucky if a Series would have one Venezuelan," he said. "Now there are nine."
Venezuelans make up the second largest group of foreign-born players in the big leagues, after players from the Dominican Republic, and this year some of the sport's biggest feats had a Venezuelan accent.
Miguel Cabrera, of the Tigers, became the first player in nearly half a century to win the triple crown, leading the American League in batting average, home runs and runs batted in.
Felix Hernandez became the first Venezuelan-born player to throw a perfect game, in August, for the Seattle Mariners.Johan Santana became the first Mets pitcher and the fourth Venezuelan to throw a no-hitter.
And Omar Vizquel was a fixture in the sports pages here as he wound up his long career as one of the game's greatest shortstops.
Cabrera is joined on the Tigers by his fellow Venezuelans Anibal Sanchez, Avisail Garcia and Omar Infante. The Giants who come from Venezuela are Scutaro, Pablo Sandoval, Hector Sanchez, Jose Mijares and Gregor Blanco.
Two other Venezuelans were possible inclusions on the World Series rosters, one for each team.
This is a baseball-loving country and the sports pages here closely follow the Venezuelans playing in the major leagues, regularly printing their statistics and featuring their highlights.
Scutaro was on the cover of the country's two major sports dailies Tuesday, raising his M.V.P. trophy over his head in the rain. "Venezuela Becomes Giant," said the headline in Meridiano, the largest sports daily.
"I was saying on my radio show this morning that Venezuelan fans and journalists have to thank the gods for the great year our baseball players have had in the big leagues," said Humberto Acosta, who hosts a radio show and writes a newspaper column about baseball.
He said the success of Venezuelan ballplayers was not a matter of chance. "It's a product of the turn that the big-league organizations have made toward Latin America and Venezuela in particular, because this is a baseball country."
Several major league teams have academies to develop young players in Venezuela, although the number of academies has been shrinking in recent years in response to the violence and unsettled economic climate in the country.
Many major league players return here each fall to play in the Venezuelan league, whose season started this month. Venezuela's socialist president, Hugo Chavez, is an avid baseball fan, as is his mentor, Fidel Castro, the former president of Cuba.
Suniaga, the novelist, recalled listening to the World Series on the radio as a child. He remembered Willie Mays, the Giants star, coming to Venezuela to play in the Caribbean championship series in the late 1950s.
It felt like a very long time ago.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''In the High-Tech Patent Wars, an Inventor's Lament'' (Bits blog, Oct. 15) conflates perceived concerns about our patent system and hand-wringing about some high-profile lawsuits to conclude that innovation is threatened. Nothing is further from the truth. 
For more than two centuries, American patent laws have supported innovations that made us the world leader in breakthrough ideas and technologies. While no system is perfect, we must avoid the urge to ''fix'' marginal imperfections with hammers rather than tweezers.
The misguided focus on the so-called smartphone war is a case in point. History is full of patent disputes involving novel inventions, from the cotton gin to the sewing machine to Alexander Graham Bell's telephone. In each case the litigation abated, technology survived, often improved, and lives were made richer.
The shift to mobile technology that is defining the 21st century is supported by research and development investment motivated and protected by strong patent laws. We should not overreact or encourage regulation aimed at limiting inventors' ability to enforce the fundamental property right contemplated by our Constitution.
Given the state of global competition, and an economy increasingly dependent on knowledge and innovation, we must preserve incentives to invent, not diminish them.
DONALD J. ROSENBERG Executive Vice President and General Counsel, Qualcomm San Diego, Oct. 22, 2012

HEADLINE: The Big New Push to Export America's Gas Bounty

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
JUST off the coast of Texas, Excelerate Energy is hoping to strike it big.
The Houston energy company plans to build a multibillion-dollar offshore export terminal halfway between Corpus Christi and Galveston to ship natural gas around the world.
As one of the first United States companies to be granted an export license, Excelerate Energy is looking to capitalize on an American oil and gas boom that is reshaping the global energy markets. 
Once dependent on natural gas imports, the United States has gone from a buyer to a potential seller after a flurry of recent natural gas discoveries across the country accessible with new extraction technology.
The newly available resources, mostly from so-called shale gas deposits, have brought the price of American natural gas down to as little as a fifth of the price in other countries, particularly those in fast-growing Asian economies.
The wide price disparity between American and global markets has energy giants like Exxon Mobil and BP eager to sell cheap American natural gas to foreign buyers to cash in on robust global demand.
To stake its own claim, Excelerate Energy is negotiating with a handful of foreign companies to secure long-term contracts to ship natural gas abroad. The firm, half-owned by the billionaire George B. Kaiser, expects to sign agreements by early next year. The first shipments are expected to leave the Texas coast by 2017.
''There's so much potential for the U.S. to take advantage of high prices in global markets,'' said Rob Bryngelson, the 44-year-old chief executive of Excelerate Energy. ''We've got to capitalize while we can.''
With 15 other export projects currently under review by the Energy Department, America could soon become the world's second-largest natural gas exporter behind Russia, which remains the largest seller because of its long-term contracts to energy buyers across Europe and farther afield.
Demand for natural gas is expected to increase by 50 percent over the next 20 years, according to the International Energy Agency. Most growth will come from emerging markets like India and China that are reliant on energy imports to support their economies.
Obstacles remain. Big American consumers of natural gas like the petrochemicals industry worry that record-low domestic gas prices will rise if energy companies are allowed to export natural gas. Politicians also are concerned about the impact of exports on the country's energy security.
''People are struggling to decide what to do with this energy gift,'' said Roger Ihne, a principal in the energy practice of the consultancy Deloitte in Houston.
The glut puts the United States at the center of the increasingly globalized natural gas market.
Unlike the oil industry, which relies on a few global benchmark prices, the natural gas sector was a regional business until recently. Prices still vary wildly among continents, and most producers depend on vast pipeline networks to supply local customers like energy utilities and industrial companies.
Yet technology is changing how business is done. That includes how natural gas is extracted from the earth -- via a technique called hydraulic fracturing, or fracking -- and how the fuel is transported over long distances. By converting their product to liquefied natural gas, or L.N.G. -- a condensed, cooled and pressurized form of the fuel -- natural gas suppliers can ship overseas in large tankers rather than depend on decades-old pipelines, which often run through politically unstable countries.
With the potential to ship anywhere in the world, energy companies are connecting regional natural gas markets to a greater extent than ever before. Analysts say producers can hunt for the highest price across different continents before deciding where to ship the gas.
For example, Qatar, the world's largest L.N.G. exporter, has shifted supplies from its European customers to new clients in Asia because Europe's economic problems have reduced demand there.
In Asia, political decisions like Japan's move to close its remaining nuclear power plants after the disaster at the country's Fukushima reactor have increased demand for L.N.G. imports. This year, Cheniere Energy, a Houston energy firm, signed a 20-year deal with the Korea Gas Corporation to ship natural gas to South Korea beginning in 2017. Cheniere, which plans to export from Louisiana, also has a long-term contract with GAIL India, the country's largest natural gas distributor.
''Asian companies are out in front in signing natural gas contracts,'' said Teri Viswanath, a commodity strategist at the French bank BNP Paribas in New York. ''For countries like China, the tremendous domestic demand ensures it will always be an importer.''
Stronger ties within the natural gas industry are also bringing international energy companies to America. By acquiring stakes in American energy projects, analysts say, foreign firms are seeking access to the country's vast untapped resources.
In early October, Golden Pass Products, a venture whose majority owner is the state-owned Qatar Petroleum International, was granted a license to export liquefied natural gas from a proposed site in Texas. The British energy company BG Group, which owns shale gas deposits from Texas to New York, also plans to ship American natural gas from its operations in Louisiana.
Despite the multibillion-dollar investments, changes are not expected to happen overnight. Building L.N.G. terminals, for example, can take years. And many utilities, particularly in Europe and Asia, are locked into contracts with existing natural gas producers that could limit the opportunities for new entrants like American companies.
Yet the expansion of the natural gas industry in the United States and elsewhere, including in East Africa and South America, is expected to transform the sector over the next 20 years.
''We still have regional markets, but they are becoming more tied together with each successive year,'' said Joseph A. Stanislaw, a founder of the consultancy Cambridge Energy Research Associates.

HEADLINE: Canada's New Pipeline Woes

BYLINE: By IAN AUSTEN

 BODY:
OTTAWA -- AND you thought pipeline politics in the United States were treacherous. Rebuffed by Washington on bringing the Keystone XL pipeline down through the western United States, Canada now finds that its Plan B -- to build a pipeline to its west coast for shipping to Asia -- has become mired in domestic politics thick enough to rival the tarlike oil it hopes to sell.
Getting the oil to the Far East first requires building a $5.5 billion, 730-mile pipeline from landlocked Alberta over a series of mountains to the coast of northern British Columbia. About 220 tankers a year would then navigate some of Canada's most scenic yet treacherous waters to complete the trip. 
While opposition from environmentalists and some native groups was always expected, the Enbridge Northern Gateway Project has unexpectedly united British Columbians who normally are on opposite sides. Mistakes by Enbridge, which is based in Canada, have further fueled the resistance. They included missteps at regulatory hearings and the handling of a recent pipeline spill in Michigan, which was sharply criticized by the American authorities.
To illustrate the depth of opposition in British Columbia, Christy Clark, the province's premier, said that she was at a meeting over the summer in the affluent section of Vancouver.
''Someone got up and asked some very pointed questions about moving this very dangerous commodity up our coast,'' she said. ''The kid was going into grade six.''
Although Ms. Clark leads a pro-business, right-of-center party, she has not endorsed the pipeline.
''British Columbians are not happy with the idea that we'll bear 100 percent of the risk without getting any of the benefits,'' Ms. Clark said.
Her major condition for approval -- that Alberta share its royalties from the oil sands with British Columbia -- is seen as simply a way for her government to oppose the pipeline without directly objecting to energy projects. Alberta once led a long and heated constitutional battle to retain all of its natural resource revenue and it shows no signs of changing its mind about that issue. After public hearings, a federal review panel's decision on the project is not likely until the end of next year. But a growing number of Canadians say it may already be doomed.
Kinder Morgan, an American pipeline company, has said that it plans to seek permission late next year to expand its existing pipeline from Alberta to near Vancouver, British Columbia's largest city. But that plan has already gotten strong opposition, particularly from Vancouver.
In addition to the oil industry and the province of Alberta, which owns the oil sands, Enbridge counts the current Conservative federal government as an ally. It has strongly endorsed the project as a way for Canada to expand its economy by selling to buyers beyond the United States, long its only foreign energy customer.
Members of the government of Prime Minister Stephen Harper do not hold much back in criticizing opponents.
''They attract jet-setting celebrities with some of the largest personal carbon footprints in the world to lecture Canadians not to develop our natural resources,'' Joe Oliver, the natural resources minister said, in an unusual open letter to critics. ''Finally, if all other avenues have failed, they will take a quintessential American approach: sue everyone and anyone to delay the project even further.''
Those remarks and others seem to have backfired, prompting a debate about free speech and creating sympathy for pipeline opponents.
Enbridge has also fumbled its efforts to win over native groups. A 1997 ruling by the Supreme Court of Canada recognized their title to some of the land now needed for the pipeline. The decision means that dissatisfied native groups can potentially block the pipeline through the courts.
Enbridge has offered native groups a 10 percent stake in the pipeline. But that has still left many of them unconvinced. And the company's efforts to win them over have sometimes had the opposite effect.
In a regulatory filing, Enbridge described an encounter one of its employees had earlier this year at a hearing in Burns Lake, British Columbia. ''A Wet'suweten Elder blew a myriad of tiny feathers over a Northern Gateway representative in attendance.''
The company said the ''feather incident'' was a warning that it was breaking traditional native laws against trespassing, an offense it understood to be ''punishable by death.''
Enbridge's analysis was backward, however. The eagle down ceremony, as it is properly known, is a peace offering, not a death threat.
''It's the highest honor you can ever have,'' said Art Sterritt, the executive director of Coastal First Nations, a coalition of native groups. ''For them to get frightened by that is the absolute height of ignorance.''

HEADLINE: Gleaning Clues on Sunny Days From the Clouds

BYLINE: By DAVID FERRIS

 BODY:
CARLOS F. COIMBRA knew from the outset that he would have to crack the code of clouds. As an engineering professor new to the University of California's campus in Merced, he led a successful drive to get 15 percent of the school's power from an array of solar panels.
But clouds, wandering and capricious, had foiled his efforts on two occasions by casting sudden shadows, forcing the school to rely on conventional power instead. To neutralize the clouds, he would have to track them.
So Professor Coimbra, a Brazilian-born expert in fluid mechanics with a flair for computer modeling, tried a new kind of forecast. The campus would make better use of sun power if he could figure out exactly when a puffy drifter would arrive overhead. He wrote a computer algorithm to project how clouds move and change shape as they move across the sky -- one of the most complex and chaotic phenomena on earth, influenced by an endless set of variables. 
Now, six years later, Professor Coimbra, 44, and his collaborator, Jan P. Kleissl, 37, have created a forecasting engine that they say is 20 to 40 percent more accurate than the model in common use. Weather, energy and power grid experts said that the innovation could accelerate the adoption of renewable energy, save billions of dollars in energy costs and help turn cloud-watching from an idle pastime into a vital and profitable part of the weather forecast.
''I can't tell you what's going to happen at 4:23 p.m. on a Sunday,'' said Professor Coimbra, whose forecasts extend to seven days but with decreasing accuracy. ''But I can tell you what will happen between noon and 6 today.''
Potential cost savings are drawing the interest of companies that build and operate solar-power plants, as well as utilities and grid operators. Each bets a bottom dollar on when the sun will come out tomorrow. A fine-tuned forecast makes it easier for utilities and grid operators to use the sporadic power of sun and wind when they are available, giving renewable energy a reliability close to that of a fossil-fuel or nuclear power plant.
Furthermore, it could help utilities predict exactly when homeowners will turn on their air-conditioners in the summer, which could reduce the power grid's need for backup power plants.
As it saves money in energy markets, the technology could also shake up the world of weather forecasting by providing greater resolution. Such data could give airports a firmer window of when storms will arrive and leave, resulting in fewer flight delays.
It could tell farmers when to expect the first frost, or when a rainstorm will hit, reducing the need to pump water for irrigation. A precise prediction could guide the maneuvers of forest firefighters, project the path of bioterror attack or pinpoint the path of a tornado.
Melinda C. Marquis, the renewable energy project manager at the government's Earth System Research Laboratory in Boulder, Colo., speculated that this technology, born to serve renewable energy, might end up changing our relationship with weather. ''Any improvement that we make here for renewable energy will be very, very important, in some cases more important, for other sectors of the economy,'' she said.
But the forecasts are likely to find their first application at solar and wind farms. Currently, the caprice of weather makes electricity more expensive for producers and consumers of utility-scale renewable power. Traditional weather forecasts aren't accurate enough to predict when the sun will poke through the clouds on a partly overcast day and make mistakes in estimating the length and strength of high winds.
To compensate, some solar and wind farms maintain large, expensive banks of backup batteries to store surplus energy and release it when needed. Grid operators scramble to buy power on the spot market when weather-related energy sources fall short, buying power for 10 to 100 times more than they would if they bought a day ahead, according to Manajit Sengupta, a scientist who leads solar-forecasting efforts at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory. A perfect forecast for wind, if it represented 20 percent of the power supply, would save $1.6 billion to $4.1 billion a year, according to several studies.
The spikes and troughs of wind and sun, known in the power industry as ''ramp events,'' cast another shadow for plant operators. Abrupt changes can damage equipment and cause backup batteries to fill or drain too quickly, shortening their life spans, and, with them, the useful life of the plant.
The test sites that Professor Coimbra and Professor Kleissl use are small affairs, made up of a few small, spindly weather instruments that reside on rooftops and alongside solar arrays at facilities in Washington State and throughout California, from Davis down to San Diego.
The most important instrument is a fisheye camera that points at the sky, taking photos of five square miles every 30 seconds. This device, engineered by Professor Kleissl, tracks cloud speed and creates a forecast for the next three to 20 minutes.
For longer time frames, Professor Coimbra's number crunching takes over. A self-learning computer algorithm, it digests dozens of measurements -- solar irradiance, wind speed, satellite images, soil moisture -- and sorts out which are relevant and which are noise. Such modeling has been used to predict the behavior of other complicated systems, like the interaction of molecules or the swings of the stock market, but it has never been used to create hyperlocal forecasts.
In the two years since Professor Coimbra moved to University of California, San Diego and started a partnership with Professor Kleissl, their team of graduate and postdoctoral students has grown from seven to 25 as research money comes in.
The California Public Utilities Commission issued a $1.5 million grant to improve forecasts of San Diego's ever-changing coastal fog, and the California Energy Commission gave $1 million to help Professor Coimbra develop an accurate model of the thick, ground-clinging fog of the Central Valley.
The two researchers are awaiting approval of projects to model the weather above the military's large solar installations in and near the Mojave Desert, where the North American monsoon can create violent summertime storms.
So far, however, the only commercial application is at a 22-acre field of kiawe trees in Hawaii, at the site of a proposed five-megawatt power plant in Kalaeloa, Oahu. The builder, Scatec Solar North America, hopes that an accurate profile of the ''solar resource'' will compensate for the island's vulnerabilities: bright sun, sudden squalls and a small, outdated power grid that cannot handle large spikes in the power supply. An accurate forecast would eliminate the cost of backup batteries and make it easier to find investors, the chief executive, Luigi Resta, said.
Back in California, the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state power grid, is about to compare the forecasts of the University of California, San Diego, against its own, a model based on temperature, time of day and historical records of energy use that has not been tweaked in decades. If the San Diego model is more accurate -- say, correctly guessing that a region uses 900 megawatts of electricity on a hot summer day instead of 1,000 -- ''then that's some money'' that will be saved by ratepayers, said Jim Blatchford, the smart grid solutions manager.
Professor Coimbra's prognostications could even give racecar drivers the inside track. A private company, Forecast Energy, has hired him to create a model that could, for example, inform a driver's team during inclement weather exactly how wet the track will be for the next 10 laps -- data that could determine the crucial decision to use slower, safer wet-track tires or faster, dry-track tires to win the race.
How solar forecasting will be used as it matures is anyone's guess, but it could be handy for anyone who needs a more exacting snapshot of the weather -- like Professor Coimbra himself, who keeps a careful eye on distant thunderheads as he rides his motorcycle along Interstate 15. As he does so, he ponders the sort of question that perplexes farmers, pilots, backyard grillers, and anyone else whose fortunes depend on the whimsical schedule of clouds.
''Is the rain going to get there before I get to Point B?'' he asked. ''Or can I go 50 miles more?''

HEADLINE: Cities Enticed by Pay-if-You-Save Energy Deals

BYLINE: By JIM WITKIN

 BODY:
WHEN the city of Brea, Calif., about 25 miles southeast of Los Angeles, set out to reduce its carbon emissions and save money on energy costs, the challenge was the same faced by many other cities nationwide: allocating the funds to pay for the program.
Finding projects to make city buildings more energy efficient was far easier. So the city turned to a form of financing that has become common among government agencies at all levels: an energy-savings performance contract that requires no upfront costs and allows the city to pay for the project over time using the savings on utility bills. 
''There is no other way we could have undertaken this scope of project in this efficient a manner or time frame,'' said Charlie View, Brea's director of public works. The project included installing high-efficiency lighting systems in 14 city buildings and 4,000 street lamps, updating heating and cooling systems at six buildings and installing 1.8 megawatts of solar panels at three sites.
An energy service company, Chevron Energy Solutions, a unit of the Chevron Corporation, performed all the work and provided all the new equipment. The company's contract with the city guarantees the project will deliver a certain level of savings on energy costs. If the project fails to perform to the guarantee, the energy service company is on the hook to make up the difference. If savings exceed the guarantee, the city keeps the excess.
The project, completed in 2011, is expected to save the city 40 percent on energy costs and $13 million over the next 25 years. Performance shows the project is exceeding these estimates by about 10 percent, said Mr. View. From the savings, the city will pay off two bonds issued to finance the project; the payback period is about 20 years, which is common for these types of projects.
The business model and performance-based contracting offered by energy service companies are not new; the market began to form in the early 1980s after the energy crises of the previous decade, which saw prices rise drastically. Today, about 35 large energy service companies offering contracts with guaranteed savings as their core business model dominate the market, according to the National Association of Energy Service Companies, a trade association.
What has changed is the growing appeal of the model among public entities. Now, 80 to 90 percent of energy service company revenues come from projects with municipalities, public universities and schools, hospitals and federal government agencies.
''Most public facilities in most parts of the country are starved for any kind of investment for improvements,'' said Don Gilligan, the trade association president. Many of these aging buildings are wasting 25 to 35 percent of what they pay on their energy bills, he estimated.
''A performance contract allows them to redirect the money they currently spend on wasted energy to pay for the capital cost of an improvement with no tax increases,'' he said. ''That is a very big payment stream and a very attractive driver for public institutions.''
At the federal level, since 1998, 25 agencies have used performance contracts on about 580 projects, saving $13.4 billion and enough energy to power a city of 900,000 residents for a year, according to the Federal Energy Management Program.
Wide use of performance-based contracts has also required a reworking of purchasing policies for public agencies. Long-term agreements with vendors were outside the bounds of traditional procurement rules, so legislation authorizing the use of performance contracts for federal agencies was enacted as part of the Energy Policy Act of 1992. Now almost all states have passed similar legislation.
Unlike some aspects of energy policy, the legislation has generally received bipartisan support, said Charles H. Goldman, a senior scientist at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in Berkeley, Calif., who has studied the market since 2000. The energy service company market ''is an example of a successful private sector industry that is relatively self-sustaining and doesn't rely on a lot of incentives or subsidies outside the basic economics of these projects,'' he said.
Today, energy service companies account for 10 to 15 percent of the jobs created among companies that provide energy efficiency improvements, and many of these jobs are local, Mr. Goldman said, because there ''are often provisions in the contracts that strongly encourage the use of local small businesses as subcontractors.''
Still, performance-based contracts are not suitable for every market, every project or every type of building, said Brittany Gibson, an analyst with Pike Research, an energy research and consulting company -- notably for residential or private commercial property owners, for a variety of reasons.
In the commercial sector, the hurdle is often the so-called split-incentive problem, she said. Renters in commercial buildings typically pay their own energy bills. This reduces the incentive for building owners to commit to long-term contracts to pay for energy-efficiency improvements because the owners do not benefit from the savings.
Yet in the public sector, opportunity abounds, she said. Based on a study completed this year, Pike Research is expecting the energy services market to grow annually by 11 to 14 percent through the end of the decade, reaching an estimated $13 billion to $16.5 billion by 2020.
Driving this growth, said Ms. Gibson, are federal and state policies that set aggressive energy conservation goals for their buildings. At the same time, she said she expected capital budgets for such projects to remain tight.
In 2007, for example, Congress passed a law requiring all federal agencies to improve the energy efficiency of their buildings 30 percent by 2015. And in December 2011, President Obama directed agencies to spend $2 billion on energy efficiency projects through the end of 2013, specifically using performance-based contracts. Suitable projects should be easy to find; federal agencies occupy nearly half a million buildings.

HEADLINE: After Federal Jolt, Clean Energy Seeks New Spark

BYLINE: By JOHN BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- PRESIDENT OBAMA'S 2009 stimulus package included the largest single piece of energy legislation in American history, a $90 billion money pile for energy projects from the mundane to the exotic.
In less than three years, it financed construction of solar and wind farms, doubling renewable electricity generation. It paid for the installation of 13 million ''smart'' electrical meters, a start to modernizing the country's electrical grid. It paid to weatherize a million homes, saving low-income families an average of $400 a year on their utility bills. It provided a spark for the domestic electric vehicle industry, financing construction of more than two dozen advanced battery factories. And it provided the seed money for what may emerge as a new industry in America: the production of liquid fuel from bacteria and other microorganisms.
The spending package provided billions for high-speed rail and mass transit, for job training and for carbon capture demonstration projects.
But the stimulus money is almost all gone, leaving many of these projects without a government benefactor and making them orphans in a competitive marketplace dominated by the deep-pocketed fossil fuel industries. 
What happens now?
The Obama administration's clean energy venture has been contentious from the start, generating enormous debate over the role of government generally and over the financing of energy technology and innovation specifically.
Republicans have made an issue of Solyndra, the California solar panel maker that declared bankruptcy after receiving a stimulus-backed $528 million loan guarantee. Similar opprobrium has greeted the bankruptcy filing last week of A123 Systems, a maker of batteries for electric cars that got $132 million of a $249 million stimulus grant. Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, have used such failures as case studies in what they call government overreach, crony capitalism and the distortion of free markets.
''I had a friend who said you don't just pick the winners and losers,'' Mr. Romney said in his first debate with President Obama. ''You pick the losers.''
The administration's defense has been that successes have far outnumbered failures in the clean energy loan program and that even failures can provide knowledge that will pay off down the road. Energy Secretary Steven Chu, a Nobel Prize winner in physics, has said: ''We're swinging for the fences. We're going to strike out a lot, but we'll hit a few grand slams.''
Mr. Romney has made clear his distaste for government subsidies for alternative energy and for government acting as a venture capitalist for individual clean energy companies. He has said he would eliminate the production tax credit for wind turbine makers, for example, and would apply much stricter standards to the Energy Department's loan guarantee program, if not do away with it entirely, even though it was created under the George W. Bush administration with bipartisan support.
Oren Cass, Mr. Romney's chief domestic policy adviser, said in an interview that wind, solar and other clean energy had not yet proved to be competitive in price against natural gas and coal, and that subsidizing them had not produced the jobs the president promised in selling the stimulus.
''If we're going to tackle this problem, it's going to have to come through technological innovation,'' Mr. Cass said. ''So what's the right way to facilitate innovation? There is a surprisingly straightforward answer: The way to promote innovation is to rely on free enterprise and competition to spur innovation in the private sector, while providing some government support for basic and applied research.''
David B. Sandalow, the acting undersecretary of energy, said that the clean energy spending under the stimulus program had planted seeds that would make a difference in the nation's energy future. He cited projects financed by the new Advanced Research Projects Agency-Energy to design advanced batteries, modernize the grid and create new classes of liquid fuels. Although Mr. Romney has expressed support for Arpa-E, which gets roughly $250 million in annual appropriations, his budget and tax plans would reduce money for some projects that the Energy Department considers most promising.
Mr. Sandalow acknowledged constraints on the federal budget and the likelihood that there would be no major infusion of new money like that provided by the stimulus any time soon. But he expressed hope that the government would not abandon its role as incubator of future technology.
''Let's hope we have the wisdom to sustain investments in technologies that will change the lives of our children and grandchildren,'' Mr. Sandalow said.
But raw politics seem to be in greater supply in Washington today. Michael Grunwald, a Time magazine correspondent who chronicled the stimulus program in his book, ''The New New Deal,'' said that many of the initiatives paid for by the stimulus had bipartisan support before President Obama included them in the 2009 spending package. ''Arpa-E was authorized by Bush but not funded until Obama,'' he said in an interview. ''But as long as it's supported by Obama, you'll just hear Republicans talking about the losers.''
So where will the impetus -- and the money -- for energy innovation come from?
Michael A. Levi, senior fellow for energy and the environment at the Council on Foreign Relations, said there were two main avenues for government support for scaling up the clean energy industry.
The first, he said, is to put money into individual companies through subsidies, grants or loans, a path that is politically perilous and difficult to carry out in a big government bureaucracy.
''The second,'' he went on, ''is to create demand through a federal clean energy or renewable energy standard, or a price on carbon, all of which would make the market for innovative clean energy technologies bigger and increase incentives for innovators. The two parties are sharply split on all those possibilities.''
President Obama has abandoned his support for a cap-and-trade system to limit greenhouse gas emissions, advocating in its place a goal to double the nation's production of clean energy by 2035. Though the president's idea has enjoyed bipartisan support in the past, Congress has not moved to embrace it.
In recent months a discussion of imposing a carbon tax has been percolating in Washington as part of a broader tax reform and deficit reduction plan. Such a tax might generate new money for clean energy development, but in the current fiscal and political environment such tax revenue is more likely to be devoted to other purposes.
There is also a growing discussion of how to attract more private capital to the clean technology sector. Some economists and green tech entrepreneurs have advocated a change in federal tax law to allow renewable energy companies to use a tax-advantaged investment device known as a master limited partnership, which has attracted $350 billion in private investment but is limited to oil and gas extraction and pipeline projects.
Another proposal is to allow real estate investment trusts, which are like mutual funds for real estate, to cover energy transmission networks and renewable energy generation.
States and cities are pursuing projects to leverage relatively small amounts of public money to attract private capital for energy efficiency and innovation projects. Connecticut's Clean Energy Finance and Investment Authority is using a portion of its federal stimulus dollars to provide incentives for private banks to help homeowners install solar heating or make their properties more energy-efficient.
Ron Pernick, a founder of Clean Edge, a green technology research firm, and co-author of ''Clean Tech Nation: How the U.S. Can Lead in the New Global Economy,'' said that despite the politicization of climate change and clean energy policy, he was hopeful that the country would find a way to convert to a clean energy economy.
''Why am I optimistic?'' he asked. ''Because these are not nice-to-have industries; these are need-to-have industries.''
''We can meet these challenges, but it's going to take technology,'' he added. ''It's going to take sources of energy that are faster, lighter, cleaner and cheaper.''

HEADLINE: Bigger Than Either of Them?

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
''DRILL, baby, drill.'' It is among the best-remembered lines of the 2008 presidential campaign, colorfully capturing the desire of many Americans for cheap, reliable energy produced at home rather than in unpredictable places like Iran or Venezuela.
No slogan in the current presidential campaign has emerged to match it, but energy has taken center stage again as an issue that encompasses concerns about the environment and national security, and now, even more pressingly, economic revival.
Presidential campaigns have a way of producing stark contrasts between candidates. In the presidential debates, President Obama and Mitt Romney clashed sharply on fossil fuels and renewable energy.
The Republican nominee accused the president of picking a lot of losers with $90 billion worth of government largess for Solyndra, the California solar company, and other green enterprises. ''And by the way, I like coal,'' he said in the first debate. Mr. Obama countered that the oil industry was the true recipient of ''corporate welfare'' in tax breaks: ''Does anybody think Exxon Mobil needs some extra money, when they're making money every time you go to the pump?'' 
But such differences may be more rhetorical than real; the marketplace, technological change and Middle East tensions are driving Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney to much the same place on the country's energy future.
Both candidates say they support nuclear power and biofuels, though neither is advocating strongly for either. Both say they want to encourage more oil drilling in places like North Dakota, Texas and Alaska to lower dependence on oil from the Middle East. Even while the current administration's Environmental Protection Agency has more aggressively regulated mining and drilling, Mr. Obama, like Mr. Romney, has celebrated the boom in domestic natural gas production and wants to spread its use for power production and even export.
In a twist few would have predicted when Mr. Obama first entered the White House and much as it may dismay him, fossil fuels have eclipsed renewable energy and climate change in the national discussion -- even as climate scientists warn that the droughts that scorch corn crops and the faster melting of Arctic ice and glaciers around the world are signs of things to come.
''Last time we were electing a president, it looked like we were running out of energy, and this time we're debating how to use what now seems to be ample resources for decades to come,'' said Daniel Yergin, the energy historian. ''The country needs to decide the pace and scale of domestic energy development as well as the mix among oil, natural gas, coal, renewable and nuclear we will use. But the marketplace itself will have a bigger role than the election campaign in what the mix eventually will be.''
The oil and shale gas drilling boom is reshaping the nation's energy map, and it is still difficult to predict the extent of its ramifications. With domestic oil production climbing rapidly since 2008, oil imports have been cut to just over 40 percent of domestic supplies, the lowest level in two decades, from 60 percent.
Over the same period, domestic natural gas production has risen by 15 percent, producing a glut that has forced down the gas price by nearly two-thirds. Plentiful, cheap natural gas has crowded out much of the expected growth of renewable energy like wind and solar power, but it has cut domestic consumption of dirtier coal even more sharply.
Electrical generation from wind, solar, geothermal and biomass have expanded to 5.8 percent of the country's electricity, from 3.1 percent, since Mr. Obama took office, partly because of tax incentives and other support from the administration's stimulus package. But the expansion of power driven by natural gas has arguably been even more impressive. Cheap natural gas fuels a bit more than 30 percent of American power production, up from just over 20 percent in 2008.
On the stump, Mr. Obama has not been shy in heralding the boom in domestic oil and gas drilling under his watch. Not to be outdone, Mr. Romney has put ''energy independence'' -- including the expansion of hydrocarbon exploration and production, building the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada and removing federal regulations on coal -- at the top of his five-point plan to produce millions of jobs.
Certainly the two have different energy visions. Mr. Romney's proposal to expand state regulatory control over drilling and mining on federal lands would represent a break from government policies dating back to Theodore Roosevelt, in the highly unlikely event that Congress could be coaxed to go along. And the two candidates are on opposite sides of a gaping divide over coal, with Mr. Obama pushing to phase out coal-fired electrical generation while Mr. Romney favors burning more coal to keep mine operations rolling.
But how much does the nation's energy future depend on who wins the race?
No doubt the nation has several important decisions to make in the next couple of years. Should it limit hydraulic fracturing, the contentious method of blasting water through tight rocks to gain access to oil and gas, with new regulations? Should the federal government aggressively open up more offshore drilling in Alaska's Arctic and off the coasts of Virginia and the Carolinas? Should it export vast amounts of its new bounty of natural gas, potentially jeopardizing the low price that is currently benefiting domestic consumers and manufacturers? Should the country allow construction of the Keystone XL pipeline, which would secure oil supplies from Canada, but also guarantee the spread of mining for oil sands, which has a higher carbon footprint than most conventional oils? Does coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel, have a future in America?
Either Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will have to decide along with, of course, the new Congress and in many cases the states. The two candidates and their parties have different constituencies that are tugging them in opposite directions on these questions. But the election will probably matter only on the margins of energy policy. The same cannot necessarily be said, however, about the flip side of energy policy -- environmental policy -- where a Romney Environmental Protection Administration would probably look very different from Mr. Obama's.
''I think on oil and gas production, pipelines and natural gas exports the differences between the two are marginal,'' said David Goldwyn, formerly the State Department's coordinator for international energy affairs under Mr. Obama, ''but on greenhouse gas emissions issues the differences are significant.''
Mr. Romney has proposed excluding greenhouse gases from the Clean Air Act, reversing new mercury standards for coal and slowing the advent of automobile fuel efficiency standards, and he could be expected to use his executive and regulatory powers to make policy adjustments. Nevertheless, he would probably need support from Congress and the courts to veer radically off the established Obama course.
With the economy still weak and the federal government in financial crisis, new energy tax incentives, mandates and subsidies are pretty much off the table, no matter who is elected in November. Politicians of both parties have learned from the Solyndra fiasco about the risks, financial and political, of spending taxpayer money on solar and other renewables, given their continuing problems competing in the marketplace. Even the wind production tax credit, so crucial to the expansion of wind farms around the country, is about to expire, and wind power companies are letting workers go. Apparently Mr. Obama is not able to save the tax credit from Congressional budget-cutters, and as president, Mr. Romney would not want to save it.
Both a second Obama administration or a Romney administration would most likely support new exports of liquefied natural gas, given the domestic bounty and opportunity to reduce the trade deficit, although Democratic and Republican energy experts have suggested that regulatory approvals for proposed export terminals are not likely to happen quickly, to leave time to measure the impact exports might have on domestic gas prices.
The Obama administration opposed approval of the Keystone pipeline last January mainly because of Nebraska's concerns about its route over a sensitive aquifer. Now that Keystone has altered the route, many energy experts, including some Democrats, expect Mr. Obama to go along, to create jobs but also to replace oil shipments from the Persian Gulf and Venezuela.
To the dismay of environmentalists, the Obama administration is still pushing for oil drilling in the Alaskan Arctic, though the president seems less likely to approve drilling off the Carolina and Virginia coasts, where many experts doubt that there are large reserves to be found anyway.
It is true that Mr. Obama still talks up developing renewable energy sources and his concern over climate change, but the campaign rhetoric has clearly shifted from four years ago, when he and his Republican opponent at the time, Senator John McCain of Arizona, favored some form of carbon cap and trade legislation to combat global warming. Not even the Democrats mention reviving market-based emissions trading anymore, after that stalled in Congress nearly three years ago.
Instead, Mr. Obama, who originally ran as a champion of solar and wind power, has presided over the nation's greatest fossil fuel boom since the discovery of Alaska's giant Prudhoe Bay field more than four decades ago. After temporarily halting oil and gas drilling in the Gulf of Mexico after the disastrous 2010 BP spill, he reopened the gulf for drilling and then expanded offshore exploration to the Alaskan Arctic for the first time in decades. In their party platform at their convention this summer, Democrats advocated even greater production of domestic natural gas. The Obama administration established some new emissions standards for hydraulically fractured wells, but gave the oil and gas industry plenty of time to comply and otherwise tilted in their favor, and there is no sign a second Obama administration would be tougher. With the exception of New York State and a few other localities, little has been done through governmental authority to slow the boom in hydraulic fracturing.
Energy politics have shifted because a persistently sluggish economy with roughly 8 percent of American workers unemployed has made it a pocketbook issue. The oil and gas boom has produced one of the economy's few bright spots. Drilling and support jobs have increased by nearly 25 percent since the first half of 2008 to nearly 200,000 jobs, despite the financial collapse and recession. Those jobs pay about $34.50 an hour, nearly 50 percent higher than the national average. A refinery boom based on new domestic oil and gas production has made the United States a refined petroleum product net exporter for the first time since the Truman administration.
Several petrochemical plants are being planned or expanded on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, steel plants in the Midwest are adding shifts to build oil and gas pipelines, and many economists predict a manufacturing renaissance based on low prices of natural gas -- a key component for the manufacture of plastics, fertilizers and chemicals. To save on costs, municipal governments and companies are switching thousands of buses and trucks every year from diesel to natural gas fueling.
''Both candidates are trying to stay out of the way of the gas boom,'' said William K. Reilly, who was administrator of the E.P.A. under the elder President Bush. ''It's associated with thousands of jobs that are on everybody's mind right now. And beyond that, it's raising the possibility of a new industrial renaissance.''
According to the Dow Chemical Company, cheap domestic natural gas has allowed the industrial sector to add 500,000 jobs since 2010. The company has also assembled a list of 91 proposed plant investments announced by Dow and many other companies over the last 18 months because of the lower gas prices; they are valued at $70 billion and represent one to three million jobs for the production of steel, aluminum, tires, machinery and other products, Dow says.
The biggest difference between the candidates is over coal, but even there the ultimate policy differences may be a lot narrower than environmentalists or coal companies would want or expect. A Romney television commercial blanketing the airwaves in coal-producing states captures the urgency of the issue with a miner accusing the Obama administration of ''attacking my livelihood.''
Mr. Obama has worked to shut down older coal-fired power plants. He has pushed policies regulating mercury, hazardous air pollutants like sulfur dioxide and greenhouse gases. But concerns about lost coal mining jobs have slowed other environmental initiatives to control ozone emissions and coal ash, and few energy experts say they think a second Obama administration would apply many new regulatory controls until the economy picked up. Mr. Romney has pledged to repeal the Obama coal regulations, although that would require Congressional approval, which would be very difficult without a big Republican majority in the Senate. Even then, some regulatory reversals could be challenged in the courts. And finally, many states have adopted their own tough anti-coal regulations.
A Romney administration would most likely try to help the coal-mining companies by discontinuing the characterization of carbon dioxide as a pollutant under the Clean Air Act, which gave the E.P.A. powerful new authority to control greenhouse gases. Since the courts upheld the authority, it would take an amendment to the Clean Air Act to exclude the gas. That would require 60 votes in the Senate, which would be extremely difficult.
Whatever the Romney administration might try, coal appears to be on a steep downward slide. About a third of the nearly 600 coal plants in the United States are over 50 years old, and most energy experts say they believe all of those will be out of service over the next 20 years or so. While a few new coal plants may be built, for the most part the older plants will be replaced by gas-fueled plants, many of which can produce electricity for less than half of what it costs to run a coal-fired unit because of the gas glut and price collapse.
''Coal will regain a bit of market share as natural gas prices recover somewhat, but most coal-to-gas substitution will be permanent,'' according to a recent Moody's Investors Service report, which predicted that over the next decade, coal's share of domestic electricity mix would drop to a third from a current 40 percent. (Coal represented 48 percent of the mix in 2008.)
A Romney administration would probably try to encourage more coal exports to compensate for lower domestic demand. The coal industry is angling to build several export facilities in Washington and Oregon. But the proposed ports face a lengthy permitting process, and the two environmentally sensitive states remain responsible for resolving many of the issues no matter who is president.
''The future of coal as a fuel of choice for power plant operators appears to be on an irreversible decline regardless of who is elected, though who is elected will effect the rate of decline,'' said Michael Webber, associate director of the Center for International Energy and Environment Policy at the University of Texas at Austin. ''Obama would speed it up and Romney would slow it down, but it will happen regardless. Even the president, as powerful as he is, cannot overcome the fundamentals of the market, and the market says coal's days are numbered and the market sees gas as the rising star.''

HEADLINE: Who Threw Israel Under the Bus?

BYLINE: By EFRAIM HALEVY. 
Efraim Halevy was the director of the Mossad from 1998 to 2002 and the national security adviser to the Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, from October 2002 to June 2003.

 BODY:
Jerusalem
ON Monday, in their final debate, Mitt Romney denounced President Obama for creating ''tension'' and ''turmoil'' with Israel and chided him for having ''skipped Israel'' during his travels in the Middle East. Throughout the campaign, Mr. Romney has repeatedly accused Mr. Obama of having ''thrown allies like Israel under the bus.''
But history tells a different story. Indeed, whenever the United States has put serious, sustained pressure on Israel's leaders -- from the 1950s on -- it has come from Republican presidents, not Democratic ones. This was particularly true under Mr. Obama's predecessor, George W. Bush. 
Just one week before the Iraq war began in March 2003, Mr. Bush was still struggling to form a broad international coalition to oust Saddam Hussein. Unlike in the 1991 Persian Gulf war, Russia, a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council, decided to opt out, meaning that the United Nations could not provide formal legitimacy for a war against Mr. Hussein. Britain was almost alone in aligning itself with America, and Prime Minister Tony Blair's support was deemed crucial in Washington.
Just as the British Parliament was about to approve the joint venture, a group of Mr. Blair's Labour Party colleagues threatened to revolt, demanding Israeli concessions to the Palestinians in exchange for their support for the Iraq invasion. This demand could have scuttled the war effort, and there was only one way that British support could be maintained: Mr. Bush would have to declare that the ''road map'' for Middle East peace, a proposal drafted early in his administration, was the formal policy of the United States.
Israel's prime minister at the time, Ariel Sharon, had been vehemently opposed to the road map, which contained several ''red lines'' that he refused to accept, including a stipulation that the future status of Jerusalem would be determined by ''a negotiated resolution'' taking into account ''the political and religious concerns of both sides.'' This wording implied a possible end to Israel's sovereignty over all of Jerusalem, which has been under Israeli control since 1967.
On March 13, 2003, senior Israeli officials were summarily informed that the United States would publicly adopt the draft road map as its policy. Washington made it clear to us that on the eve of a war, Israel was expected to refrain from criticizing the American policy and also to ensure that its sympathizers got the message.
The United States insisted that the road map be approved without any changes, saying Israel's concerns would be addressed later. At a long and tense cabinet debate I attended in May 2003, Mr. Sharon reluctantly asked his ministers to accept Washington's demand. Benjamin Netanyahu, then the finance minister, disagreed, and he abstained during the vote on the cabinet resolution, which eventually passed.
From that point on, the road map, including the language on Jerusalem, became the policy bible for America, Russia, the European Union and the United Nations. Not only was Israel strong-armed by a Republican president, but it was also compelled to simply acquiesce and swallow the bitterest of pills.
Three years later, the Bush administration again pressured Israel into supporting a policy that ran counter to its interests. In early 2006, the terrorist group Hamas ran candidates in the Palestinian legislative elections. Israel had been adamant that no leader could campaign with a gun in his belt; the Palestinian party Fatah opposed Hamas's participation, too. But the White House would have none of this; it pushed Fatah to allow Hamas candidates to run, and pressured Israel into allowing voting for Hamas -- even in parts of East Jerusalem.
After Hamas won a clear majority, Washington sought to train Fatah forces to crush it militarily in the Gaza Strip. But Hamas pre-empted this scheme by taking control of Gaza in 2007, and the Palestinians have been ideologically and territorially divided ever since.
Despite the Republican Party's shrill campaign rhetoric on Israel, no Democratic president has ever strong-armed Israel on any key national security issue. In the 1956 Suez Crisis, it was a Republican, Dwight D. Eisenhower, who joined the Soviet Union in forcing Israel's founding father, David Ben-Gurion, to withdraw from the Sinai Peninsula after a joint Israeli-British-French attack on Egypt.
In 1991, when Iraqi Scud missiles rained down on Tel Aviv, the administration of the first President Bush urged Israel not to strike back so as to preserve the coalition of Arab states fighting Iraq. Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir resisted his security chiefs' recommendation to retaliate and bowed to American demands as his citizens reached for their gas masks.
After the war, Mr. Shamir agreed to go to Madrid for a Middle East peace conference set up by Secretary of State James A. Baker III. Fearful that Mr. Shamir would be intransigent at the negotiating table, the White House pressured him by withholding $10 billion in loan guarantees to Israel, causing us serious economic problems. The eventual result was Mr. Shamir's political downfall. The man who had saved Mr. Bush's grand coalition against Saddam Hussein in 1991 was ''thrown under the bus.''
In all of these instances, a Republican White House acted in a cold and determined manner, with no regard for Israel's national pride, strategic interests or sensitivities. That's food for thought in October 2012.

HEADLINE: Obama and Romney Offer Competing Visions in Dueling Ads

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
With all three debates in the rearview mirror and two weeks to go until Election Day, each campaign turned on Tuesday to making its most persuasive case, in 60-second ads, for why its candidate deserves the presidency.
The names of the ads conveyed the different visions: ''The Clear Path'' from Mitt Romney, suggesting focus and an alternative to the status quo. President Obama released ''Determination,'' evoking steady progress and resolve.
ON SCREEN The ads have many stylistic similarities. Both use quiet piano music for a stirring effect. The candidates speak directly to the viewer, striking a tone of gravity and humility. 
OBAMA'S MESSAGE ''It's an honor to be your president, and I'm asking for your vote,'' Mr. Obama says.
Mr. Obama's ad is the more highly produced, opening with a montage of a factory worker, a freight train and a young girl running into the arms of her father returning from war. The pictures are meant to reflect some of the president's accomplishments during his first four years.
''We're not there yet,'' he says, ''and the last thing we should do is turn back now.''
The ad then features Mr. Obama's direct remarks to the camera. ''Here's my plan for the next four years,'' he says, as text on the screen underlines his bullet points: ''Education & Training,'' ''Invest in American Energy'' and ''Wealthy Pay More,'' among others.
ROMNEY'S MESSAGE Mr. Romney says: ''I'll lead you in an open and honest way. And I ask for your vote.''
The Romney ad consists of two excerpts from his closing statement at Monday night's debate in Boca Raton, Fla. He begins by warning of the economic perils of a second Obama term, and then strikes a bipartisan chord. ''America's going to come back,'' he says. ''And for that to happen, we're going to have to have a president who can work across the aisle.''
SCORECARD Even though the two ads are similar in presentation, Mr. Romney is playing offense and the president defense. The Obama campaign, which said the ad would run in nine battleground states, is responding to what has become a chorus of Republican criticism that the president has nothing to offer in a second term.
The Obama campaign bristles at the suggestion that Mr. Obama has not laid out detailed plans for building on the recovery. The new ad directs viewers to the campaign's Web site, and on Tuesday the campaign also released a glossy 20-page booklet, ''The New Economic Patriotism,'' which it plans to distribute widely.
On offense, Mr. Romney's ad depicts a much different vision of the next four years should Mr. Obama be re-elected. He ticks off how a continuation of current trends would add trillions to the national debt, ''heading toward Greece,'' a further erosion of take-home pay, and high unemployment stranding 20 million people.
Soon after the ads were unveiled, each campaign went into familiar rapid-response mode, trying to undercut the other's claims.
The Republican National Committee dismissed Mr. Obama's booklet as ''more of the same repackaging efforts that he has tried.'' The Obama campaign retorted that Mr. Romney's proposed tax cuts benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. It is a familiar charge that Mr. Romney has rejected, but without supplying enough details to lay the claim to rest. TRIP GABRIEL

HEADLINE: Living Standards In the Shadows As Election Issue

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Taxes and government spending. Health care. Immigration. Financial regulation.
They are the issues that have dominated the political debate in recent years and have played a prominent role in this presidential campaign. But in many ways they have obscured what is arguably the nation's biggest challenge: breaking out of a decade of income stagnation that has afflicted the middle class and the poor and exacerbated inequality.
Many of the bedrock assumptions of American culture -- about work, progress, fairness and optimism -- are being shaken as successive generations worry about the prospect of declining living standards. No question, perhaps, is more central to the country's global standing than whether the economy will perform better on that score in the future than it has in the recent past.
The question has helped create a volatile period in American politics, with Democrats gaining large victories in 2006 and 2008, only to have Republicans return the favor in 2010. This year, economic anxiety, especially in industrial battlegrounds like Ohio, is driving the campaign strategies of both President Obama and Mitt Romney. 
The causes of income stagnation are varied and lack the political simplicity of calls to bring down the deficit or avert another Wall Street meltdown. They cannot be quickly remedied through legislation from Washington. The biggest causes, according to interviews with economists over the last several months, are not the issues that dominate the political debate.
At the top of the list are the digital revolution, which has allowed machines to replace many forms of human labor, and the modern wave of globalization, which has allowed millions of low-wage workers around the world to begin competing with Americans.
Not much further down the list is education, probably the country's most diffuse, localized area of government policy. As skill levels have become even more important for prosperity, the United States has lost its once-large global lead in educational attainment.
Some of the disconnect between the economy's problems and the solutions offered by Washington stem from the nature of the current political debate. The presidential campaign has been more focused on Bain Capital and an ''apology tour'' than on the challenges created by globalization and automation.
But economists and other analysts also point to the scale of the problem. No other rich country -- not Japan, not any nation in Europe -- has figured out exactly how to respond to the challenges. ''The whole notion of the American dream,'' said Frank Levy, an M.I.T. economist, ''described a mass upward mobility that is just a lot harder to achieve right now.''
For the first time since the Great Depression, median family income has fallen substantially over an entire decade. Income grew slowly through most of the last decade, except at the top of the distribution, before falling sharply when the financial crisis began.
By last year, family income was 8 percent lower than it had been 11 years earlier, at its peak in 2000, according to inflation-adjusted numbers from the Census Bureau. On average in 11-year periods in the decades just after World War II, inflation-adjusted median income rose by almost 30 percent.
Matching the growth rates of the postwar period -- when the country was poorer, when harsh discrimination against women and minorities was receding and when the rest of the world was weaker -- is probably impossible. Yet there is still a vast difference, both economically and politically, between incomes that are rising modestly and not at all.
Historically, periods of economic stagnation have tended to bring pessimism, political turmoil and a lack of social progress, said Benjamin Friedman, an economic historian and the author of ''The Moral Consequences of Economic Growth.'' The political volatility and partisan rancor of the last several years seem to fit the pattern.
The recent stagnation has also led, economists say, to confusion and even scapegoating about the real sources of the problem. The causes that can seem obvious, and that often shape the political debate, are not necessarily the correct ones.
Take immigration, especially illegal immigration. Whatever other problems it may cause, evidence suggests that it has not played a significant role in the income slump.
It may have caused a slight decline in the wages of native-born workers without a high school diploma (and maybe not even that). But most illegal immigrants lack the skills to compete with the bulk of native workers, according to research by Giovanni Peri, Chad Sparber and others. Notably, incomes in some states with large immigrant populations, like California, have risen faster than in states with relatively few immigrants, like Ohio.
The minimum wage, similarly, appears to play only a minor role in the income slump. It has risen faster than inflation since 2000, even as overall pay at the bottom of the income distribution has not. And the size of the federal government also looks like a dog that is not barking: Washington collected taxes equal to 15.4 percent of gross domestic product last year, down from 20.6 percent in 2000.
A second group of much-cited forces have indeed played a role in middle-class stagnation and inequality, many economists argue, just not as big a role as automation, globalization or education.
Health care costs have grown sharply over the last decade, leaving employers with less cash to use on salaries. Labor unions have shrunk; all else equal, unionized workers earn more, often at the expense of corporate profits. Tax rates have fallen more for the affluent than for anyone else, directly increasing the take-home pay of top earners and indirectly giving them more incentive to earn large amounts.
But many of these factors are particular to the United States, while globalization and automation are obviously universal forces.
One of the more striking recent developments in economics has been economists' growing acceptance of the idea that globalization has held down pay for a large swath of workers. The public has long accepted the idea, but economists resisted it, pointing to the long-term benefits of trade. ''That is starting to change only in the face of very strong evidence over the past decade,'' said Edward Alden of the Council on Foreign Relations.
In particular, job growth and wage growth have been weaker in sectors exposed to global competition -- especially from China -- than in sectors that are more insulated.
Automation creates similar patterns. Workers whose labor can be replaced by computers, be they in factories or stores, have paid a particularly steep price. The American manufacturing sector produces much more than it did in 1979, despite employing almost 40 percent fewer workers.
Workers with less advanced skills have also suffered disproportionately. The pay gap between college graduates and everyone else is near a record. Despite the long economic slump -- and the well-chronicled struggles of some college graduates -- their unemployment rate is just 4.1 percent.
What is the solution to this thicket of economic forces?
That question is the one that Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are trying to convince voters that they can best answer. They both accept that the government and the market have a role, but they put a different emphasis on those roles.
It is hard to see how either globalization or automation can be stopped. The proposed solutions instead tend to involve managing them.
If the economy can be made to grow fast enough, incomes can still rise across the board, as they did when the unemployment rate fell below 5 percent in the 1990s and briefly below 4 percent in 2000. If educational attainment rises, more people will be able to get jobs that benefit from technology and global trade, rather than suffer from it. And if inequality continues to soar, the government could choose to use the tax code to ameliorate it -- a solution that Democrats favor and Republicans say will hurt economic growth.
Maybe the biggest reason for optimism is that there is still a strong argument that both globalization and automation help the economy in the long run. This argument remains popular with economists: Trade allows countries to specialize in what they do best, while technology creates opportunities to extend and improve life that never before existed.
Previous periods of rapid economic change also created problems that seemed to be permanent but were not. Neither the cotton gin nor the steam engine nor the automobile created mass unemployment.
''When technology reduces the need for certain kinds of labor, we know that some inventive people will one day come along and find a way to use that freed-up labor making things that other people want to buy,'' said Mr. Friedman, the economic historian. ''That's what in the long run made the Luddites wrong.''
He added, ''How long does it take the Luddites to be wrong -- a few years, a decade, a couple of decades?''
Perhaps just as important, what happens to the workers who happen to be living during a time when the Luddite argument has some truth to it?

HEADLINE: Apple, Facing More Competition, Introduces a Smaller iPad

BYLINE: By BRIAN X. CHEN

 BODY:
SAN JOSE, Calif. -- Steve Jobs once mocked tablets with small screens, saying they would need to come with sandpaper so people could sand down their fingertips to use them. But that didn't stop his company from shrinking the iPad.
Apple's iPad Mini, which it unveiled at a press event here on Tuesday, weighs about two-thirds of a pound and has a screen that measures 7.9 inches diagonally, making its surface area significantly smaller than that of the 9.7-inch iPad. Philip W. Schiller, Apple's vice president for marketing, said the smaller, lighter tablet would be a good fit for people who want something more portable than the 1.44-pound iPad. 
The company is selling the lowest price Mini for $330, about $130 more than similar-size tablets from competitors.
Apple also introduced an upgrade for its larger iPad, adding a faster processor and the Lightning connector that first appeared in the iPhone 5, and it showed new laptop and desktop computers.
''The iPad is the top-selling tablet in the world, but we're not taking our foot off the gas,'' Timothy D. Cook, Apple's chief executive, said at the event.
The smaller iPad is a bit of a shift for the company. Mr. Jobs once said in a call with investors that 7-inch tablets from competitors like Samsung and Research in Motion were ''tweeners'' that were too big to compete with a smartphone and too small to compete with an iPad.
But with all the action in the tablet market lately, smaller models have become impossible to ignore. Google, Apple's fiercest competitor, recently released its 7-inch Nexus 7 tablet for $200. Amazon recently introduced seven new Kindles, including a 7-inch tablet for $160 and an 8.9-inch tablet for $300. Barnes & Noble's Nook tablet, which starts at $200, has also sold well. Combined, the three companies have sold about 15 million of these smaller, cheaper tablets, according to estimates by Forrester Research.
Apple recognizes that it has competition. At the news conference, Mr. Schiller made a side-by-side comparison of the iPad Mini and a Google Nexus 7. He said the Mini was thinner, lighter and more durable than Google's tablet, and still had a bigger screen.
''Others have tried to make tablets smaller than the iPad, but they've failed miserably,'' Mr. Schiller said while showing images of apps running on the Nexus 7 and the iPad Mini. He noted that the iPad Mini had access to Apple's catalog of 275,000 apps that have already been made for iPads. Most of the 500,000 apps in Google's Android app store are designed for phones, not tablets.
Apple still dominates the tablet market; it announced that it had sold 100 million iPads to date. But it might have sold 15 million more if it had put a smaller, cheaper version on the market earlier, said Sarah Rotman Epps, a Forrester analyst.
''Rather than cede the low end of the market to Amazon and Google, they'd prefer to take it themselves,'' Ms. Rotman Epps said. ''Apple is smart to be acting before it gets to be more of a problem.''
Ms. Rotman Epps said the iPad Mini could appeal to women because it can more easily fit in a purse. It may also have better luck than the larger, more expensive iPad in developing countries like China, where iPad demand has been low compared with demand for cheaper Android tablets.
The iPad Mini's components are on par with those of Apple's other mobile devices: it includes the Lightning connector and a five-megapixel camera. The smaller tablet does not, however, have the high-resolution Retina display of its bigger counterpart, presumably to keep it thinner and lighter. The new iPads will begin shipping Nov. 2, and the version with a cellular connection will ship two weeks later.
Apple also introduced a family of new Macs on Tuesday, including upgrades for the MacBook Pro, iMac and Mac Mini. The 13-inch MacBook Pro notebook now includes a Retina display, which Mr. Schiller said had twice as many pixels as a high-definition television. The iMac is 80 percent thinner and eight pounds lighter than the previous model.
The larger fourth-generation iPad comes about seven months after Apple introduced the last version -- an unusual move, as the company has traditionally waited a year before upgrading products. But this timing allows Apple to market its tablets during the holiday season.
Apple's stock dropped 3.3 percent to close at $613.36. Shaw Wu, an analyst with Sterne Agee, said investors were mostly disappointed by the iPad Mini's price, as some had hoped it would be closer to the prices of Google's and Amazon's tablets.
But Mr. Wu noted that in general, Apple does not try to drive its products down to the lowest price, possibly sacrificing quality. Unlike Amazon and Google, Apple is driven by profits from hardware sales, not content, so Mr. Wu said he expected the iPad Mini to generate solid margins.
''It's like Mercedes and BMW,'' he said. ''Will they go lower than Honda or Toyota? Probably not.'' He added that Apple's strength was its universe of apps, books and music, and that neither Google nor Amazon had all of those bases covered.

HEADLINE: Our Secret Sauce

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
It was striking how much Monday's presidential debate on foreign policy came down to two subjects: America and the Middle East. The two actually provide some instructive contrasts, starting with one that I've noted since the onset of this campaign: the contrast between the high degree of American pluralism and trust that makes our country work, and the near total absence of it in the Middle East, the region most vexing us and most likely to blow up on the next president. Muslims are killing Muslims across the Middle East and Central Asia today: Sunnis versus Shiites, Pashtuns versus Pashtuns and Kurds versus Turks. Christians are not faring well there, either. The absence of pluralism and the prevalence of ''rule or die'' politics -- either my sect or party is in power or I'm dead -- is the dominant political trend in the Arab-Muslim region today. Nobody trusts anybody, but it is impossible to build a modern state or an innovation economy without trust. Meanwhile, here in America, we are debating whether to replace our first black president -- whose middle name is Hussein and whose grandfather was a Muslim -- with a Mormon! Who does that? Nobody else. That radical pluralism is the secret of our sauce, and blessedly so. America, take a bow.
But not for too long. 
We have a very special country, but we have to take care of it, not kick it around like it's a football. And we can't do that if we're imitating the Middle East's rule-or-die politics: my party or scorched earth. Barack Obama has been far from a perfect president. At times, he has treated friends and opponents with arrogance or just a stubborn unwillingness to play the game of politics to co-opt those who needed to be co-opted (he should have embraced the Bowles-Simpson federal debt plan) to get legislation passed. No one would confuse Obama for Lyndon Johnson. But no one would confuse today's Republican Party for the G.O.P. of the 1960s or 1970s, either.
It is impossible to look at the G.O.P.'s behavior in the last four years -- from its unwillingness to consider Obama's jobs bill, which was praised by independent economists, to the unwillingness of its presidential candidates to consider a $1 increase in taxes for $10 of spending cuts, to the time it spent on sheer lunacy such as questioning the president's birth certificate -- and not conclude that many in the party just wanted Obama to fail in the hope that they could pick up the pieces. Too many Republicans, particularly moderate business types, don't want to admit how much their party has been led around of late, not by traditional conservatives, but by a radical Tea Party base that has driven decent, smart conservatives -- like Bob Bennett of Utah, Bob Inglis of South Carolina, Richard Lugar of Indiana and Olympia Snowe of Maine -- out of office.
What I'd say about Obama's domestic and Middle East policies is that, given the messes and political constraints he inherited in both arenas, he did about as well as anyone could. He kept the homeland safe, prevented us from getting drawn into any sinkholes and killed bad guys. It is not the stuff of foreign policy legend, but it was not bad. I'd say the same at home. He stanched the bleeding in the economy and initiated some smart reforms in education, energy and health -- the true effectiveness of which we will only know in the future. It was not exactly the New Deal, but considering the deep hole created by the years of George W. Bush, it also was not a New Depression. A quick turnaround in either arena was never possible.
But while that kind of politics got us through the last four years, it won't get us through the next four. We cannot have another term of partisan gridlock. We are heading into a world where the breakdown of the European supranational state system, combined with the breakdown of the Arab nation state system, combined with climate change, combined with a much greater global interdependence, means that we will be more and more buffeted by problems that are too dangerous to ignore but too complicated and big to fix alone. And when a country finds itself in that kind of situation, there is one thing it absolutely must do, and that is build resiliency.
We need to weatherproof our house so we can control our destiny and play the vital stabilizing role the world needs us to play. And that leads to another difference between us and the Middle East. We don't know how to fix their problems anymore. But we do know how to fix our problems. In the short run, we have to invest in infrastructure, education and research -- the sources of our strength to stimulate growth -- while simultaneously putting in place a credible long-term plan to cut spending and both raise and reform taxes as our economy improves.
Regardless of what they have on their Web sites, neither candidate has spoken honestly to voters in their speeches or commercials about what this will take. Hey, it's election time. What else is new? Well, there is something new. Just doing as well as our domestic political constraints will allow will not cut it anymore -- not given where the global economy, the Middle East and climate change are going. Just doing what the political traffic will bear will not lead us to resiliency. It will lead us to painful, destabilizing vulnerability.
We need a whole new traffic pattern. That will require a president who will dare to challenge the country to do big, hard things together, not just tack with the winds of public opinion, and it will require an electorate that is ready to value and demand such leadership.

HEADLINE: Qatar's Emir Visits Gaza, Pledging $400 Million and Risking Deeper Palestinian Rift

BYLINE: By JODI RUDOREN; Fares Akram contributed reporting from the Gaza Strip, and Robert F. Worth from Washington.

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- The emir of Qatar on Tuesday became the first head of state to visit the Gaza Strip since Hamas took full control of it in 2007, the latest step in an ambitious campaign by the tiny Persian Gulf nation to leverage its outsize pocketbook in support of Islamists across the region -- and one that threatened to widen the rift between rival Palestinian factions.
The emir, Sheik Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani, pledged $400 million to build two housing complexes, rehabilitate three main roads and create a prosthetic center, among other projects, a transformational infusion of cash at a time when foreign aid to the Palestinian territories has been in free fall. The sheik, his wife and the Qatari prime minister led a large delegation that entered Gaza from Egypt and sped in a convoy of black Mercedes-Benzes and armored Toyotas through streets lined with people waving Qatari and Palestinian flags. 
''Today you are a big guest, great guest, declaring officially the breaking of the political and economic siege that was imposed on Gaza,'' Ismail Haniya, the Hamas prime minister, told the emir and his cohort as they sat on sofas in a white shed in the southern town of Khan Yunis, where they plan to erect 1,000 apartments. ''Today, we declare the victory on this siege through this blessed, historic visit.''
In the West Bank, allies of Mahmoud Abbas, the president of the Palestinian Authority, who has struggled to preserve his own legitimacy, warned that the visit set a dangerous precedent of Arab leaders' embracing Mr. Haniya as a head of state and thus cleaving the Palestinian people and territory in two. ''We call on the Qatari prince or his representative to visit the West Bank too!'' blared a headline on an editorial in the leading newspaper Al Quds.
The visit signaled just how much the region had changed for Hamas since the advent of the Arab Spring. Where Egypt under President Hosni Mubarak once allied with Saudi Arabia to squeeze Hamas by keeping the border largely closed, Egypt under a new Islamist president, Mohamed Morsi, opened the crossing to allow the Qatari ruler through. But the visit also reflected the unique foreign policy that has allowed Qatar to straddle competing worlds, bankrolling political movements like Hamas, deemed a terrorist organization by the United States, while maintaining strong links to Washington.
Sheik Hamad, who has ruled Qatar since 1995, has gradually transformed the tiny nation into a regional powerhouse, relying on its immense wealth to extend its influence. That has been especially true in the past two years, as Qatar has played decisive roles in the revolutions in Libya and Yemen and the isolation of the Syrian government.
Qatar allied with the West in helping oust Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi in Libya, while financing Islamists on the ground. In Egypt, it has close ties to the Muslim Brotherhood. In Syria, it provides cash and weapons to Islamists battling President Bashar al-Assad, and at the same time it hosts a large United States military base that affords it protection in a volatile neighborhood.
''Qatar is a secure little kernel with huge resources that has chosen to use those resources in foreign policy,'' said Paul Salem, director of the Beirut-based Carnegie Middle East Center. ''They have no constraints. They can take any position anytime anywhere.''
But eight months after Doha, the Qatari capital, hosted the signing of a reconciliation agreement between the Hamas leadership and Mr. Abbas, the deal has not come to fruition in the form of national elections. On Tuesday the emir's visit drove a deeper wedge between Hamas and Fatah, the party of Mr. Abbas, and raised alarm in Israel.
Hamas has refused to reject violence or recognize Israel, which also considers it a terrorist organization, and has struggled lately to control more militant Islamist groups within Gaza. Since the uprising began in Syria in March 2011, Hamas has closed its offices in Syria, its primary patron, and tried to establish a close and direct connection to Mr. Morsi of Egypt, who was a leader within the Muslim Brotherhood before his election.
Yigal Palmor, a spokesman for Israel's Foreign Ministry, declared that the emir had ''thrown peace under the bus,'' noting that his visit came a few hours after an Israeli soldier was severely wounded when a bomb exploded along the border with Gaza. Southern Israel has faced what he described as ''a steady drizzle of rockets'' in the last few weeks.
''It helps Hamas entrench themselves in Gaza, not to yield one inch to the P.A., and enhancing the division and the reality of two de facto states,'' Mr. Palmor said. ''Most of the money that he's pouring in Gaza will go to Hamas pockets, directly or indirectly. You think that will encourage them to hold national elections?''
The Qatari projects dwarf the roughly $300 million in foreign aid that analysts estimate Gaza receives annually. They come as international donations to the Palestinian Authority have nose-dived, from a peak of $1.8 billion in 2008 to less than $700 million this year, according to a World Bank report. The shift is part of a broader financial crisis that has caused the delayed or partial payment of government salaries three months running, the focus of violent street protests in the West Bank last month.
Nathan Thrall, an analyst with the International Crisis Group, said a critical question was whether rumored visits to Gaza by other regional heads of state would follow Qatar's. He said that Cairo's role in brokering the visit was an important signal in the evolving relationship between Gaza and Egypt, and that Hamas was hoping it would help reverse the so-called ''West Bank-first model of attempting to promote prosperity in Ramallah and austerity in Gaza.''
''The message that Hamas wishes to convey is 'We are the future; the P.A. is disintegrating,' '' he said. ''The argument Hamas is hoping to make is that this is the beginning of a sort of Gaza-first model: Arabs ignoring a failing P.A., and supporting Gaza with sums of money that Europeans, even if they wanted to, couldn't match.''
The six-hour visit ended with a large rally at the Islamic University in Gaza City, where the emir and his wife received honorary doctorates.
Speaking at the university, he called on Palestinian leaders to repair their rift, which he said ''was more painful than the Israeli aggression'' and left them ''without peace negotiations or a resistance and liberation strategy.''

HEADLINE: Foreign Policy Debate's Omissions Highlight Skewed Worldview

BYLINE: By STEVEN ERLANGER; Aurelien Breeden contributed reporting.

 BODY:
PARIS -- Debates are more about scoring points than elucidating problems, just as presidential elections turn more on perceptions of character than on policy promises. But even so, Monday night's American presidential debate on foreign policy presented a skewed vision of the world, even one defined by American national interests.
Iran was mentioned more than 45 times, Israel and China more than 30 times each, Afghanistan 29 times and Mali at least four times. NATO was not uttered, and Europe was referred to only once -- in a list of allies reeled off by President Obama -- and the euro and its crisis were not mentioned at all.
Mitt Romney did, however, state twice that he would not let the United States and its domestic debt go the way of Greece. 
Issues that Mr. Obama highlighted earlier in his term, like nuclear nonproliferation and the problems of climate change, were barely mentioned. In fact, the word climate was not to be found. Mexico was not mentioned, either, and it is pretty close to home. There was no discussion of the progressive decline of the West in terms of global trade or of the rise of competing ideologies, like China's autocratic capitalism, that challenge Western ideas of liberalism, human rights and the power of the individual.
Even Russia and the success or failure of Mr. Obama's ''reset'' policy and the administration's failed bet on former President Dmitri A. Medvedev barely got a mention. And there seemed to be a general denial, suggested Barthélémy Courmont, a political scientist, of what is a common analysis, which is the inexorable weakening of American global influence, as countries like China, Brazil and India begin to wield greater regional and economic power. ''At a time when a growing number of analysts ponder the decline of the United States,'' he wrote in the French newspaper Le Monde, the candidates engaged in ''self-persuasion, to insist on the 'necessary' character of American power.''
In general, there was a sense among analysts and observers outside the United States that these were two intelligent, competent candidates who do not differ overly much on the central issues of foreign policy and were actually debating with domestic constituencies in swing states foremost in mind.
The debate over Iran and Israel was really about Jewish voters in Florida, while the debate over China was really about jobs in Ohio and the Midwest, noted François Heisbourg, a special adviser at the Foundation for Strategic Research, based in Paris. And that makes perfect sense in a tight American presidential election, where most voters do not consider foreign policy a priority, Mr. Heisbourg said.
''The balance was more toward 9/11 than the pivot to Asia,'' Mr. Heisbourg said. ''There was more about risks and threats than friends and allies. Both spoke in a Hobbesian world as tough characters willing to deal with monsters out there, not as people spreading the gospel of working with friends and allies to make the world a better place or spreading U.S. influence to help people get along.''
Le Monde said on its Web site, ''For each question, the two candidates came back to the economic situation of the country, proof that this is the electorate's main preoccupation.''
Mr. Obama even spoke of China as an ''adversary,'' although he said it was also ''a potential partner in the international community if it's following the rules.'' Mr. Romney said essentially the same thing, speaking of confrontation over trade and not about working with China on issues like North Korea, Pakistan and Iran. For Mr. Heisbourg, ''Both were wrong on China, portraying it as an adversary, but each got the message across about defending jobs in Ohio.''
Not surprisingly, the attack that killed Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and three other Americans last month in Libya was an important topic, leading to an essentially roundabout discussion of Syria, where Mr. Romney's sole difference with Mr. Obama was his willingness to provide arms to the rebels. But both agreed that no American troops should be used against Syria.
But given all the praise of the successful intervention in Libya (the vital -- even leading -- roles of France and Britain went unmentioned), there was no discussion of why what was a powerful motivation for American intervention in Libya is not relevant in Syria, where many more people have been killed by another ''dictator.'' That is a question that absorbs many in the Middle East and Europe, however complicated the responses.
There was hand-wringing about the progress of radical Islam, both in chaotic countries and through the ballot box, as a result of the turmoil of the ''Arab awakening.'' But there was little specificity about causes or cures.
There was no mention, let alone discussion, of the role of Turkey or its dilemma as a Muslim nation sharing a border with Syria, no discussion of the aging royal family of Saudi Arabia and its sponsorship of radical and conservative Islam, no mention of Somalia or Islamist threats to allies like Jordan and Morocco. There was a glancing reference to the Palestinians, but no discussion of their divisions, of the role of Hamas, of the separate status of Gaza, of the weakening grip of Mahmoud Abbas and his Fatah movement, of what might happen if and when Mr. Abbas, the Palestinian president and leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, leaves the scene.
And there was no criticism of Israel, its settlements or its occupation of the West Bank. Mr. Romney did say that Mr. Obama had not visited Israel as president even after his 2009 visit to Cairo in which he pledged a new era in relations with the Muslim world.
Mr. Obama responded with descriptions of an earlier visit as a legislator, but Mr. Romney missed an opportunity to respond tartly, for even top Obama aides concede that failing to go quickly to Israel after Cairo to make a similar speech and then calling for a ''settlement freeze'' in East Jerusalem, instead of in the larger West Bank, were errors.
Even on the question of American military strength, there was little debate other than numbers. Mr. Obama is right that the United States has more aircraft carriers than any other nation, and got off a good line about bayonets and horses and the game Battleship. But the United States is reported to have only 11 carriers, and carriers are increasingly vulnerable to more sophisticated longer-range missile attacks.
As for Europe, the lack of attention made perfect sense. Europe is an ally, not a policy dilemma, and the crisis of the euro zone has been technical, lengthy and tedious, and seems to be losing steam. America's own debt problems dwarf those of Europe.
But the French daily Libération asked: ''And what about Europe? It isn't far from Australia in the competition for the status of the most forgotten continent.'' But silence was good for Europe, the paper said. ''At least the euro crisis isn't brandished by Obama as a major source of economic trouble for America, and Romney has stopped making 'European socialism' his campaign scarecrow.''
On the Internet and on Twitter there were thousands of reactions to the debate. But speaking for many was @jonathanwatts, a Latin American correspondent for The Guardian, who wrote: ''Obama won this debate. World lost. Apart from 5 mins on China, it was all Middle East. Where was LatAm, Europe, climate?''

HEADLINE: Among Americans in Israel, More Forceful Backing for Romney

BYLINE: By ISABEL KERSHNER

 BODY:
JERUSALEM -- Americans living in Israel went to the polls this week, dropping sealed envelopes into improvised ballot boxes at community centers in this city and at other locations around the country. Instead of a unifying experience, though, participating in the November presidential elections from afar seemed to accentuate the distance between the American Jewish voters here and those back in the United States.
An American Jewish Committee Survey conducted in early September showed nearly two-thirds of Jewish voters were supporting President Obama, in line with support in past elections. According to exit polls since 1992, about three-quarters of Jewish Americans have supported the Democratic presidential candidate. 
Historically, the vote from Israel has hardly counted. The number of eligible American voters here is now estimated at about 160,000. In 2008, about 30,000 cast absentee ballots. Many here said the process of registering and voting was just too complicated.
But this time as many as 75,000 Americans in Israel have registered for a ballot, spurred on perhaps by the critical issues on the American-Israeli agenda but also by the efforts of iVoteIsrael, a get-out-the-vote group that says it is nonpartisan but that critics accuse of working quietly for the Republicans.
Whatever the reasons -- whether the background of tensions between Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and the Obama administration, the looming threat of a nuclear Iran or simply the greater turnout because of efforts by iVoteIsrael -- a number of people casting their ballots at an event sponsored by the group said they supported Mitt Romney, the Republican challenger.
''In the United States, like most people, I voted Democratic,'' said Dr. Naftali Neal Fish, a clinical psychologist and hypnotherapist who came to Israel from Philadelphia in the 1980s. This was his first time voting abroad. Citing both the crisis with Iran and the economic situation in the United States, where American-Israelis still pay taxes, he said he voted for Mr. Romney.
Orit Straus, an interior decorator who came here with her family three years ago from St. Louis, said she had voted for Mr. Romney ''because I feel he is better for Israel.''
Meir Simchah Panzer, from Virginia, said that there was probably little substantive difference between the candidates but that he was voting for Mr. Romney ''by default; I see somebody who seems genuinely to care and to have principles.''
Daniel Laufer, 26, from North Miami Beach, Fla., said he voted for Mr. Romney because of his ''economic record'' and because he had become ''disenchanted with Obama's Middle East policies.''
iVoteIsrael has sponsored debates around the country and reached out to potential voters through social networks, community e-mail lists and local publications. Its activists have gone door to door, run phone banks, canvassed outside shopping malls and registered parents at Little League games. It has provided drop boxes for registration forms and ballots in locations like pizzerias and private homes, including in several West Bank settlements.
It has not endorsed any candidate, and the Web site of the United States Embassy lists it as a nonpartisan group offering voter assistance. Elie Pieprz, iVoteIsrael's national campaign director, said the group had registered voters from 49 states, including ''thousands'' in critical swing states like Florida and Ohio.
''While the 2000 Bush-Gore presidential elections all came down to 537 absentee ballots cast in Florida, only 64 of those -- out of the many thousands of Floridian-Israelis -- were cast from Israel!'' the group states on its Web site, adding, ''We want to see a president in the White House who will support and stand by Israel in absolute commitment to its safety, security and right to defend itself.''
But critics from the Democratic camp have noted that some of iVoteIsrael's messaging, particularly on its Facebook page, has a distinct anti-Obama flavor, including an appeal to vote from the hawkish former United Nations ambassador, John R. Bolton, who has endorsed Mr. Romney.
Adding to the uncertainty, iVoteIsrael has also been vague about the sources of its financing. Its parent organization, Americans for Jerusalem, is a registered 501(c)(4) organization that does not have to disclose its financial backers. But the Sunlight Foundation Reporting Group said last week that Americans for Jerusalem appeared to have ties to Ronald S. Lauder, the conservative American businessman, philanthropist and supporter of Republican causes. Mr. Lauder's office said it had no comment.
Mr. Pieprz, a former Republican activist who came to Israel in 2010, said only that iVoteIsrael was financed by supporters from the right and the left and that its day-to-day operations were run independently of Americans for Jerusalem.
The apparent growth in absentee voting has stirred a contentious debate over whether the numbers are great enough to make a difference.
''In raw numbers,'' Mr. Pieprz said, ''the votes from Israel can absolutely change an election.''
Republicans Abroad Israel, which represents the party here, has focused its efforts on the senatorial race in Ohio, where the Democrat, Sherrod Brown, has a healthy lead. Marc Zell, a chairman of Republicans Abroad Israel, said it had mobilized dozens of volunteers to submit opinion pieces, letters and responses to the Ohio news media in support of Josh Mandel, the Republican candidate, as well as Mr. Romney and Israel. Mr. Zell added that volunteers from Israel have also been calling potential voters in Florida.
But the idea that Americans in Israel could swing the November elections is largely dismissed by Obama supporters.
Hillel Schenker, vice chairman of Democrats Abroad Israel, said that in 2000: ''Florida was stolen. I don't think it was the absentee ballots but the manipulations.'' Moreover, the skeptics note, most American-Israelis are likely to vote in states like New York, California and Illinois, where they will have zero impact.
David A. Harris, president and chief executive of the National Jewish Democratic Council, said, ''I'd argue that unfortunately for the Romney-Ryan ticket, Americans living in Israel are unlikely to be the difference makers.''

HEADLINE: Better Ways To Deal With China

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Less than a year into a new administration, the nation's trade deficit is soaring. Manufacturers are complaining bitterly that an overvalued dollar is destroying the economy, driving businesses abroad. Congress is bubbling with proposals to punish countries that are flooding the United States with cheaper exports.
The gimlet-eyed realists in the new administration decide it is time to get tough, and it works. Within four years, the currencies of our main trading partners have risen sharply against the dollar; the exchange rate of our main Asian rival has jumped by a third. The trade deficit starts to recede. America -- undisputed leader of the free world -- gets to carve one more notch in its belt.
This is the type of success Mitt Romney hoped to conjure up during the foreign policy debate on Monday night when he promised to get tough on China from ''Day 1,'' designating China a currency manipulator and opening the door for trade sanctions. It is also the image President Obama wanted to convey when he countered that he has been twice as tough on China as his predecessor, George W. Bush.
The vignette, however, is old. 
It comes from Ronald Reagan's second term, when Japan rather than China inspired fears of American decline. Treasury Secretary James A. Baker III, a k a the Velvet Hammer, summoned the finance ministers of Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to the White and Gold Room of the Plaza Hotel in New York on Sept. 22, 1985, to devise an agreement to weaken the dollar.
We also got tough with our trading partners in 1971, when the Nixon administration imposed a 10 percent surcharge on imports to force them -- Japan, above all -- to revalue their currencies and help right an American trade balance that was sliding into deficit for the first time since the 19th century.
Tempting as it is, that approach to economic policy is unlikely to be very effective today. In the 1970s and '80s, the club of industrial democracies was bound by the common Soviet threat. Japan, protected by the American nuclear umbrella, would do what the United States wanted. Today the Soviet Union is gone. China may not be as powerful as the United States, but it is powerful enough to hit back.
More important, trying to push China around like a bulked-up version of 1980s Japan does not fit with our national interests. In fact, it puts at risk a central, long-term American objective: drawing China into the club of prosperous, rule-bound and democratic nations.
As the economists Daron Acemoglu and James Robinson warn in their new book, ''Why Nations Fail,'' China's autocratic government will end up suppressing prosperity, stifling innovation as it clings to power and breeding instability as factions fight for the spoils of growth. Helping steer China away from such an unstable, dangerous course is a core American goal.
China's economy is slowing sharply. Political turmoil is swirling just weeks before only the second peaceful transition of power in the history of the Chinese Communist Party. Loud, unilateral American toughness at this stage is unlikely to help. It may prompt a reaction against the more outward-looking, reform-minded constituencies, strengthening conservative forces that are unwilling to cede any political control.
And for all this risk, getting tough is unlikely to deliver much.
The Chinese currency is the wrong target. Of course China has been manipulating its currency for years, buying mountains of dollars to keep the renminbi cheap and give its exporters a leg up. But Beijing appears ready to correct course.
Factoring in China's fast inflation, which makes its exports more expensive, the real value of the renminbi has risen at least 15 percent against the dollar since mid-2010. Beijing has curbed its dollar hoarding. And its broad trade surplus is falling fast: down to 2.3 percent of its economic output this year from more than 10 percent in 2007.
China's trade surplus with the United States is in part an illusion, because exports assembled in China from imported components are counted as 100 percent Chinese. Yuqing Xing, an economist at the National Graduate Institute for Policy Studies in Tokyo, estimates that China contributed only 3 percent to the value of its exports of iPhones and laptops in 2009.
Chinese labor costs accounted for only $6.50 of the $178.96 wholesale cost of an iPhone 3G exported by China, according to a study by Mr. Xing and Neal Detert. Japanese components accounted for $60.60, German parts for $30.15, Korean components for $22.96 and American parts for $10.75. The numbers are rough. Some of the parts may have been made in China. Still, counting the entire $178.96 as a Chinese export vastly overstates its role.
Even if we conclude that currency manipulation alone is causing our bilateral trade deficit -- a highly unlikely proposition -- we can't blame it on China. ''We have an Asian trade deficit,'' said Clyde Prestowitz, a former trade adviser to the Reagan administration. ''If we were serious, we would say there are a number of countries manipulating their currency and distorting the world economy.''
Joseph E. Gagnon, a former Federal Reserve official at the Peterson Institute for International Economics, says 20 countries actively depress their currencies to bolster their exports, including Japan, Switzerland, Taiwan and Korea. Many may be following China's lead -- trying to stay competitive with the renminbi. Still, if we're going to get tough on currency manipulators, we might want to go after the lot.
China will continue to pose significant economic challenges for the United States in coming years. The cheap currency may recede as an issue. But there is China's theft of foreign intellectual property, its raft of hidden subsidies to domestic companies and its strong-arming of foreign companies to hand over industrial secrets to domestic joint venture partners, among other issues.
Still, getting tough is not the best way to address them.
In the State of the Union address this year, President Obama said he had saved more than 1,000 jobs in the tire industry by imposing tariffs to stop a surge of imports from China. Gary Hufbauer, an economist at the Peterson Institute who worked in the administrations of Gerald Ford and Jimmy Carter, estimated that each job saved cost Americans at least $900,000 in more expensive tires, reducing spending on other goods.
After all is said and done, Mr. Hufbauer concluded, the policy cost the economy 2,531 jobs. And that doesn't even count the effect of China's retaliation: antidumping duties on chicken parts that led to $1 billion in lost sales and reduced employment further.
There are tools to deal with China without setting off a trade war and undermining the national interest. Many economists have suggested changing the rules of the World Trade Organization to allow retaliation against currency manipulators. The European Union would probably support such changes. Interested countries could start the process by forming a voluntary nonmanipulation club and use carrots and sticks -- say, a tax on China's Treasury Bond purchases -- to get reluctant nations to join.
A multilateral approach, with tough talk in private, is also more likely to succeed against other egregious policies. President Obama may talk tough on China on the campaign trail. But his policy of engagement recognizes this. His administration's strategy of taking China's unfair practices to the World Trade Organization, where it has filed three cases since August, is likely to be more productive than unilateral action lacking the legitimacy of international law.
None of this has the gritty ring of a public proclamation to get tough on the cheaters across the Pacific. But all-American grit is unlikely to deliver the results that we need. After all, we still run an $80 billion deficit with Japan.

HEADLINE: Debates Over, Race Reaches Fevered Pitch

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR and HELENE COOPER; Ashley Parker contributed reporting from Henderson, Nev., Jeff Zeleny from Columbus, Ohio, and Jim Rutenberg and Erik Eckholm from New York.

 BODY:
DAYTON, Ohio -- President Obama started making his closing argument for a second term on Tuesday, beginning a furious two-week effort to beat back a late surge by Mitt Romney and hang on to battleground states where voters are already casting ballots in large numbers.
At the beginning of what the campaign described as a round-the-clock blitz, and on the day after his final debate, Mr. Obama tried to address what polling has shown is a consistent question among voters: What kind of agenda does he have for a second term? He released a 20-page booklet encapsulating previously announced policies and contrasting his positions to those of Mr. Romney.
The document contains no new proposals, and was derided by a spokesman for Mr. Romney as a ''glossy panic button.'' But along with a new television advertisement that began running in nine battleground states, the president's aides predicted it would help counter the Romney assault plan for the next two weeks that aims to convince voters that Mr. Obama has no plans to fix the ailing economy. 
Mr. Romney and his campaign spent Tuesday pounding away at points Mr. Romney made during the debate on Monday night, including accusing the president of apologizing for the United States and cutting military spending excessively. Mr. Romney flew from Florida to Nevada, where he mocked Mr. Obama's attacks on him as desperate moves by a losing candidate.
''You know, the truth is that attacks on me are not an agenda,'' Mr. Romney said to a crowd of about 6,000 people in Henderson, Nev. ''His is a status quo candidacy. His is a message of going forward with the same policies of the last four years, and that's why his campaign is slipping, and that's why ours is gaining so much steam.''
In the president's minute-long ad, and in appearances at the start of a frenetic week, Mr. Obama stepped up his effort to convince the nation that he had brought it back from the brink of economic collapse and that Mr. Romney would embrace the policies that caused the problems. Looking directly into the camera, the president asks voters to ''read my plan, compare it to Governor Romney's and decide which is better for you.''
But even as he sought to strike a positive note at the start of a three-day swing that is taking him through Ohio, Iowa, Colorado, Nevada, Florida and Virginia, Mr. Obama also enthusiastically stepped up his attacks. The Republican candidate, the president said at a rally in Florida, wants to ''turn back the clock 50 years for immigrants and gays and women'' and is pursuing a foreign policy that is ''all over the map.''
Appearing later with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at a raucous rally before 9,500 people in Dayton, the president went into a spirited assault, using his new favorite attack word -- ''Romnesia'' -- to highlight his rival's position on the auto bailout, which the White House says was vital to saving jobs in Ohio and throughout the Midwest.
''Last night, Governor Romney looked me right in the eye, tried to pretend he never said, 'Let Detroit go bankrupt,' '' Mr. Obama said, one of many instances all day when he suggested Mr. Romney was not being honest about his positions as he seeks to appeal to a general-election audience after a Republican primary campaign in which he emphasized conservative stances.
With some polls suggesting that Mr. Romney is closing the gap, Mr. Obama's top strategists described twin approaches: to make final appeals to independents, moderates, women and minorities as they offer lacerating assessments of Mr. Romney's qualifications and credibility.
Still, Mr. Obama's schedule and the tenor of his campaign appearances made clear that his primary mission now was to energize his own supporters and get them to vote, preferably right away. In Florida, where he appeared in the morning, and later in Ohio,the constant refrain at his rallies was ''Vote! Vote! Vote!'' Early voting begins in Florida on Saturday and is already under way in Ohio.The terrain that Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney are covering this week illustrates a battleground within a battleground. The campaigns are advertising in nine states -- stretching from North Carolina to Nevada -- but are spending most of their most crucial resource -- their time -- in the Midwest.
Mr. Romney is scheduled to zip back and forth on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday between Ohio and Iowa. Winning those states is the most efficient way for him to block Mr. Obama from returning to the White House or for Mr. Obama to lock down a path to 270 electoral votes.
In a sign of the closeness of the race, a ''super PAC'' supporting Mr. Romney, Restore Our Future, reserved television time in Maine, traditionally a Democratic state. Maine allocates its electoral votes by Congressional district, and Mr. Romney's supporters hope they may be able to pick off the single electoral vote available from the state's more conservative Second District.
In the final two weeks Mr. Romney has the challenge of maintaining a strategy of presenting himself as more reasonable and pragmatic than the image the White House built of him over the summer: that of an out-of-touch, job-killing plutocrat. But to the degree that strategy involves emphasizing more moderate positions than he stressed during the Republican primary campaign, it creates the potential for him to face renewed questions among conservatives on his ideological commitment.
Conversations with a half-dozen conservative activists on Tuesday suggested that many were cutting Mr. Romney some slack. ''There's a caricature of Romney that the Obama campaign has put out, and when he doesn't fit the caricature he is accused of changing his view,'' said Gary L. Bauer, president of the Christian advocacy group American Values.
In the final weeks, Mr. Romney's campaign has been discussing ways to build on gains that have shown him closing Mr. Obama's lead in polls in states like Ohio. Mr. Romney plans to deliver what the campaign describes as a major jobs and debt speech on Thursday in Cincinnati, the third in a series of policy addresses laying out how he would govern.
A new ad released Tuesday night shows Mr. Romney's closing statement from the last debate, arguing that voters have a choice between ''two very different paths'' for the country. ''The president's path means 20 million people out of work, struggling for a good job,'' he says. ''I'll get people back to work with 12 million new jobs.''
The campaign is also mulling whether to expand distribution of the 10-minute biographical video it first showed to rave reviews at the Republican National Convention, or to buy time for a similar biographical commercial in swing states, said two senior strategists, who had participated in those internal deliberations.
Democrats monitoring Republican ad spending said the Romney campaign had begun asking individual television stations about the possibility of buying time for a long commercial.

HEADLINE: Target to Sell Credit Card Business to TD Bank

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
The Target Corporation said on Tuesday that it reached a deal to sell its entire consumer credit card business to the TD Bank Group, ending an almost two-year search for a buyer. 
Target, based in Minneapolis, said the sale price was equal to the gross value of the outstanding receivables at the time of closing. Target's portfolio currently has a gross value of about $5.9 billion.
The two companies also entered into a seven-year deal under which TD Bank will underwrite, finance and own future Target credit card and Target Visa receivables in the United States.
As part of the agreement, TD Bank, based in Toronto, will control risk-management policies and regulatory compliance and Target will continue to perform account-servicing functions. That means TD Bank will make decisions about which applications are accepted and what interest rates are charged to customers, for example, while Target will still handle bill processing and customer service issues.
Target said the agreement would not affect its Red Card credit card holders, who receive a 5 percent discount on purchases.
The transaction, subject to regulatory approval, is expected to close in the first half of next year.
Target expects its third-quarter earnings per share will reflect a pretax gain of about $150 million thanks to a change in the accounting treatment of its receivables from ''held for investment'' to ''held for sale.''
Furthermore, at closing, Target expects to recognize an additional pretax gain of $350 million to $450 million on the sale of its portfolio. Target says it plans to use 90 percent of the net proceeds to reduce the company's debt; the rest will be for buying back stock over time.
In a statement, Ed Clark, group president and chief executive of the TD Bank Group, said that the agreement would ''significantly expand our presence in the North American credit card business and will establish TD as a key player in the space.''
Target said in January 2011 that it intended to sell its credit card business, but delayed that plan at the beginning of this year.

HEADLINE: The Austerity Trap

 BODY:
In Monday night's presidential debate, Mitt Romney echoed other Republican politicians, saying that under President Obama's economic policies, the United States is ''heading toward Greece.'' Mr. Romney was invoking Greece apparently to make the point that deep and swift budget cuts are needed in the United States to avoid a debt crisis. 
That bizarre comment, sadly, is no surprise in a campaign that has parted ways with the facts. The president's budget, as scored by the Congressional Budget Office, would stabilize the ratio of federal debt to the economy over 10 years.
What is more disturbing is that the comment displays willful ignorance about the lessons of Greece, and such ignorance can only lead to bad policy decisions at home. The lesson that should be learned from Greece is that its fiscal mess has been made far worse by severe budget cuts.
New data from the European Union, released on Monday and analyzed in The Times by Landon Thomas Jr. and David Jolly, show that countries that have most ruthlessly cut their budgets -- Greece, especially -- have seen their overall debt loads increase as a share of the economy.
The data provide objective support for what has been clear to just about everyone except pro-austerity German officials and deficit-crazed Republican politicians. Namely, deep government budget cuts at a time of economic weakness are counterproductive, complicating, if not ruining, the chances for economic growth.
The new European statistics also dovetail with a recent analysis by economists from the International Monetary Fund. They found that budget cutbacks are much more damaging to economies recovering from recession than has been previously believed. The reason is that with interest rates stuck near zero, there is no room to lower them when fiscal policy is tightened, and thus no way to offset the pain of budget cutbacks.
If governments push ahead anyway with deep spending cuts, the result is only more economic weakness without the hoped for budget improvement. That has been the case in Greece and other nations of Europe, like Ireland, Portugal, Spain and Britain. If Republican policies to slash government programs while excessively cutting taxes were carried out here, the United States would experience a similar effect.
Taken together, the Greek experience and the recent European research, show that for the United States, a ''grand bargain'' on the deficit should include two main parts: spending in the near term to boost the recovery, coupled with tax increases, and spending cuts to reduce the deficit as the economy regains its health.
Mr. Obama is better positioned than Mr. Romney to deliver that agenda. Mr. Obama could make his jobs plan, introduced last September but blocked by Congressional Republicans, part of the budget package to be negotiated after the election, when politicians must agree on tax increases and spending cuts to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff.
Mr. Romney's agenda is missing a direct focus on jobs, foolishly relying instead on high-end tax cuts and deregulation to help the recovery. And he and his party continue to insist on premature deficit reduction that, in a fragile economy, is the real road to Greece.

HEADLINE: Debates Over, the Final Decision Awaits

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Obama and Romney Bristle From Start Over Foreign Policy'' (front page, Oct. 23):
For the final debate, Mitt Romney appeared in a new role of practically a cheerleader for President Obama. He agreed on almost everything and applauded Mr. Obama for many foreign policy achievements.
The question is, Can we trust this cheerleader, whose advisers include a good number of neoconservatives? Is he not a wolf in sheep's clothing? And if Mr. Obama's policies are so good, why would we want to replace him with Mr. Romney? 
ALEXANDER SOIFER Colorado Springs, Oct. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
Mitt Romney held his own, and more, in the debate with President Obama regarding foreign policy and the need for a strong economy and military to resolve America's failing leadership in the world.
He did not stoop to childish jabs as the president did, nor did he embarrass the president over his deadly failure to protect his ambassador and three other Americans from a terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya.
Mr. Romney demonstrated a presidential command of the knowledge, concern and solutions needed, while President Obama poses the threat of American military and economic weakness.
DANIEL B. JEFFS Apple Valley, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
It looked to me as if this last presidential debate was the exact opposite of the first debate. This time it looked as if Mitt Romney was asleep. The debate was officially about foreign policy, which is where Mr. Romney is weak.
President Obama kept hitting Mr. Romney on contradictions, and Mr. Romney failed to respond. Mr. Romney also had a last chance to finally reveal the specifics of his plans for the economy, and he failed to do so.
MARC PERKEL Gilroy, Calif., Oct. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
The core idea in ''The Opiate of Exceptionalism'' (news analysis, Sunday Review, Oct. 21) was corroborated by the presidential debate on foreign policy. Americans need, and want, to continue to believe that they are an ''exceptional'' nation, a special people.
If there was one thing both presidential candidates agreed on, it was that America has to lead, has to expand its influence worldwide, as well as exert its will, for achieving a better world. Mitt Romney was more adamant in this respect, with his Hollywood-style belief that America should take up the mantle of world leadership, and be honored to do so. Yet President Obama seemed to be on the same page.
Sadly, it all sounds like a 21st-century version of the 19th-century British imperialist and supremacist rhetoric.
ANDREA CHIOVENDA Jalalabad, Afghanistan, Oct. 23, 2012
The writer, a Ph.D. candidate in anthropology at Boston University, is conducting ethnographic fieldwork in Afghanistan.
To the Editor:
In ''Presidential Mitt'' (column, Oct. 21), Bill Keller wrote that if Mitt Romney is elected, ''he will be hostage to the same far-right forces he kowtowed to in the primaries.'' That, in a nutshell, is a central concern of many.
Undoubtedly Mr. Romney has learned the lessons from the first President Bush not to renege on the principles and promises that helped him secure the nomination (''read my lips ...''). Equally likely, if elected he will try mightily to prove his conservative bona fides to the Republican base.
Any such strategy will be a surefire prescription to repeat some of the disastrous and wrongheaded policies of the second President Bush.
LEE A. SPIELMANN New York, Oct. 23, 2012
To the Editor:
This season's debates proved one thing: the format is outmoded and this TV show should be canceled. Changing moderators is just a cast change. The actors have learned their lines and studied their roles. The lost live TV news conference should be reinstated and required for the next presidential election season.

HEADLINE: Stocks on Wall St. Fall Sharply

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL POPPER

 BODY:
Stock fell sharply for the second time in three days after a new batch of American corporate executives raised concerns about global economic growth. &#xa;
&#xa;The Dow Jones industrial average finished the day down 1.8 percent, or 243.36 points, to end at 13,102.53, its worst performance since June. The losses added to the big declines on Friday, and dropped leading indexes to their lowest levels since early September, before the Federal Reserve announced its latest monetary stimulus program. 
Since the Standard &#x26; Poor&#x2019;s 500 index hit this year&#x2019;s high of 1,465.77 on Sept. 14, the benchmark index has fallen 3.6 percent. It finished Tuesday down 1.4 percent, or 20.71 points, to 1,413.11.
Share futures were falling even before the opening bell because of disappointing financial results from American companies. The chemical maker DuPont said Tuesday morning that its revenue was down 9 percent in the third quarter from a year ago, and that it would eliminate 1,500 jobs. The company&#x2019;s stock ended down 9.1 percent.
Thomson Reuters said Tuesday that 63 percent of the companies that have reported earnings so far have given revenue figures for the third quarter that were lower than what analysts expected.
Investors selling off stocks sought out the safety of Treasury bonds, pushing the yield on the benchmark 10-year bond down to 1.75 percent from 1.82 percent Monday.
&#x201C;Most of the action appears related to the weak revenues we&#x2019;ve seen reported by companies, especially very large companies,&#x201D; said Tim Ghriskey, the chief investment officer at Solaris Group.
Before trading in the United States, stocks in Europe headed into negative territory. Moody&#x2019;s said it was downgrading five of Spain&#x2019;s regions, underscoring the continuing recessionary woes in Europe&#x2019;s weakest economies. Spanish bond yields were up to 5.57 percent from 5.44 percent on Monday. Those yields are still far below the elevated levels reached over the summer before the European Central Bank announced plans to buy the bonds of struggling euro zone countries.
The signs of slow economic growth in Europe and around the world are particularly weighing on energy companies and conglomerates that derive much of their revenue from international sales.
&#x201C;What the corporate heads of manufacturing and global businesses are telling you is that things are slowing down,&#x201D; said Bernie McGinn, the founder of McGinn Investment Management.
Adding to the gloom was a growing sense among investors that Ben S. Bernanke, the Federal Reserve chairman, will step down when his term ends in early 2014, regardless of who wins the presidential election. There is some concern among investors that without Mr. Bernanke the Fed would not continue with its big bond-buying programs.
The technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index, which led losses last week, fell less sharply than other major indexes on Tuesday, closing down 0.9 percent, or 26.49 points, to finish at 2,990.46.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With: Polio Expert Naveen Thacker

BYLINE: PAMPOSH RAINA


HIGHLIGHT: On World Polio Day, looking at what helped India win the battle against the crippling disease. 

 BODY:
 India appears have succeeded in the fight against polio, with no new cases reported in the country since January 2011. The country will be certified "polio-free" in January 2014 by the World Health Organization if no new cases are reported between now and then, and has already been removed from a list of countries with "active transmission of wild poliovirus." 
 The difficulty India has had controlling other infectious diseases, like tuberculosis and dengue, makes polio's eradication here even more remarkable. In honor of World Polio Day, which is Wednesday, India Ink interviewed Dr. Naveen Thacker, part of the team that led India's eradication effort. 
 In e-mailed responses, he explained the reasons for India's success with polio and the difficulties it encountered on the way. 
 Q. 
What were the two or three most important things that India's policy makers did to eradicate polio in the country? 
 A. 
Firstly and critically, there was strong leadership and political support at every level of government.
Crucially, the government set up the India Expert Advisory Group to ensure that we could identify and address challenges quickly and effectively. For example, being able to identify high-risk children that were missed in a polio vaccination round meant health workers could go back and ensure that each and every child received their polio vaccine.
Secondly, the government of India and public-private partnerships together put in almost $1.5 billion to the polio eradication campaign. Combined with the partnership of Rotary International, the World Health Organization, Unicef, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, India was able to deliver vaccines to those that had previously been unreached. In Bihar, and Uttar Pradesh, we made history by administering over 900 million doses of oral polio vaccine.
Linked to this, utilizing new technological innovations was crucial to India's eradication success. For example, genetic sequencing helped us quickly identify where an outbreak of the virus had originated, so that we could prevent more polio cases. Furthermore, the new bivalent vaccine in 2008 meant children were better protected against polio and it cost less money.
 Q. 
What was your contribution to the overall polio eradication program in India?
 A. 
I got involved in polio eradication in 1994, when there was a polio outbreak in my home state of Gujarat, where I personally saw 55 cases in less than two months. Initially I was involved in creating awareness of the polio virus and wrote small booklets that I distributed to all pediatricians in India and Rotary clubs of polio-endemic countries. In total, I wrote over 8,000 postcards a year to pediatricians and Rotarians to support Pulse polio [the government vaccination program] and report cases of acute flaccid paralysis.
Stemming from this, I was invited to be a member of the India Expert Advisory Group and have served for more than a decade, contributing to the government's polio policy, with recommendations on behalf of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics. I have also published a number of papers, chapters in books, newspaper articles and delivered more than 100 guest lectures and talks on polio, including a talk at the National Institutes of Health in 2007.
 Q. 
What hurdles were encountered while making people aware of the polio eradication program, especially in rural India? How were those overcome? 
 A. 
It was difficult to convince people to take repeated polio doses and there were some pockets of resistance, particularly in western U.P., in minority communities. This resistance mainly stemmed from false rumors about the polio vaccine.
This was overcome by involving religious leaders, local medical practitioners and huge celebrities like Amitabh Bachchan, who together highlighted the necessity for polio eradication. Where the mass marketing campaign did not reach, the door-to-door campaign by 2.3 million volunteers across the country meant that we reached children in the hardest-to-reach rural communities.
 Q. 
Were people more receptive to the anti-polio drive in urban India?
 A. 
Yes, the mass-media polio campaign meant we reached the urban population with polio messages much more easily than in rural areas. There were still challenges. For example, some middle-class communities were reluctant to take repeated doses as they felt their child was fully protected. We got past this challenge by engaging members of the Indian Academy of Pediatrics, who were able to convince parents of the need to take additional polio drops.
 Q. 
Can the Indian model of success be replicated in countries such as Nigeria, Afghanistan and Pakistan that are struggling to fight the disease? Is it true that Indian expertise is being sought by some of these countries?
 A. 
Absolutely, many experts said that polio eradication was impossible in India. We've proven that by investing in the polio program, both politically and economically, and embracing new technological innovations that we can totally eradicate polio. If the endemic countries follow this example and develop accountability mechanisms, work around security challenges and ensure community involvement in the polio program, we can eradicate polio everywhere.
Our model is being replicated, which is why this year there are fewer cases so far than at any other time in history. With 171 cases this year so far, compared to 467 at this point last year, we're seeing a remarkable reduction in global polio cases. India has received experts from endemic countries and shared best practice with them. Many of the surveillance medical officers from the National Polio Surveillance Project [a collaboration between the World Health Organization and the Indian government] are stationed in Nigeria helping with their program.
 Q. 
Some African countries---Angola, Chad and Democratic Republic of Congo--which were previously declared polio-free have again reported an outbreak of polio. What should be done to ensure that India doesn't fall into that trap, too?
 A. 
That's a good question, and we've seen suspected cases recently in India that thankfully didn't turn out to be polio. To remain polio-free we must ensure the maintenance of our highly sensitive surveillance system, so that we can detect outbreaks early, and we must also sustain high levels of polio immunization through routine immunization. 
Furthermore, like China did in 2010 when polio came into their country from polio-endemic Pakistan, we need to ensure that we can rapidly respond to any polio importation. Globally, we've made amazing progress, but 99 percent reduction in polio cases isn't good enough. We need to finish the job.

HIGHLIGHT: An impressive achievement, in the wrong direction. 

 BODY:
Schularick and Taylor have an update to their article on post-crisis economic performance. They previously showed that the United States is doing a bit better than one might have expected from the historical record. Now they show that the UK is doing significantly worse:
Their exegesis:
The pink range indicates the expected recovery path. As we noted in our original column, the US exceeds expectations here. The US growth path manages to emerge from and stay above the predicted range by years 3-4-5 (i.e. 2010-12). In contrast, the UK path is disappointing, and can't really be called a recovery yet.
Even using the maximal measure of excess credit based on bank and shadow bank data to bias the forecast path down as far possible, it is still not possible to account for the UK's dismal performance. The UK was on a similar path to the US in years 1-2 (2008-09), but falls well behind the US in years 3-4 (2010-2011), only to drop below the forecast range in year 5 (2012).
...
Future economic historians will debate whether US policy in recent years can take some credit for supporting the economy at a level above a range of plausible alternative paths. But the UK's policy choices will not find refuge so easily, since there the output path has now diverged below what a wide range of plausible historical projections might excuse. 
Gee, remember the enthusiasm with which the Cameron/Osborne turn to austerity was greeted by VSPs on both sides of the pond, with David Broder urging Obama to "do a Cameron"?

HEADLINE: The Family Doctor, Minus the M.D.

BYLINE: TINA ROSENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: America has a serious shortage of primary care physicians. But Family Health Clinic in Delphi, Ind., is a model of how nurses can help fill the gap. 

 BODY:
The Family Health Clinic of Carroll County, in Delphi, Ind., and its smaller sibling about 40 minutes away in Monon provide full-service health care for about 10,000 people a year, most of them farmers or employees of the local pork production plant. About half the patients are Hispanic but there are also many German Baptist Brethren. Most of the patients are uninsured, and pay according to their income - the vast majority paying the $20 minimum charge for an appointment. About 30 percent are on Medicaid. The clinics, which are part of Purdue University's School of Nursing, offer family care, pediatrics, mental health and pregnancy care. Many patients come in for chronic problems: obesity, diabetes, hypertension, depression, alcoholism.
What these clinics don't offer are doctors. They are two of around 250 health clinics across America run completely by nurse practitioners: nurses with a master's degree that includes two or three years of advanced training in diagnosing and treating disease. By 2015, nurse practitioners will be required to have a doctorate of nursing practice, which means two or three more years of study. Nurse practitioners do everything primary care doctors do, including prescribing, although some states require that a physician provide review. Like doctors, of course, nurse practitioners refer patients to specialists or a hospital when needed.
America has a serious shortage of primary care physicians, and the deficit is growing. The population is aging - and getting sicker, with chronic disease ever more prevalent. Obamacare will bring 32 million uninsured people into the health system - and these newbies will need a lot of medical care. According to the American Association of Medical Colleges, the United States will be short some 45,000 primary care physicians by 2020.
The primary care physicians who do exist are badly distributed - 90 percent of internal medicine physicians, for example, work in urban areas. Some doctors go to work in rural areas or the poor parts of major cities, treating people who have Medicaid or no insurance. But they are few.
In part it's the money. Primary care doctors make less than specialists anywhere, but they take an even larger financial hit to treat the poor. Particularly in the countryside - even with programs that offer partial loan forgiveness, it's very hard to pay off medical school debt treating Medicaid patients, much less those with no insurance at all.
And the job of a primary care doctor today is largely managing chronic disease - coordinating the patient's care with specialists, convincing him to exercise or eat better. Poor patients can be a frustrating struggle. Compared with wealthier patients, they tend to have more serious diseases and fewer resources for getting better. They are less educated, take worse care of themselves and have lower levels of compliance with doctors' orders. Very few people start medical school hoping to do this kind of work. Those who do it may burn out quickly.
It might seem that offering the rural poor a clinic staffed only by nurses is to give them second-class primary care. It is not. The alternative for residents of Carroll County was not first-class primary care, but none. Before the clinic opened in 1996, the area had some family physicians, but very few accepted Medicaid or uninsured patients. When people got sick, they went to the emergency room. Or they waited it out - and then often landed in the emergency room anyway, now much sicker.
Just as important, while nurses take a different approach to patient care than doctors, it has proven just as effective. It might be particularly useful for treating chronic diseases, where so much depends on the patients' behavioral choices.
Doctors are trained to focus on a disease - what is it? How do we make it go away?
Nurses are trained to think more holistically. The medical profession is trying to get doctors to ask about their patients' lives, listen more, coach more and lecture less - being "patient-centered" is the term - in order to better understand what ails them. 
"I've been out of nursing school since 1972 and I still remember that when faculty members finished talking about the scientific parts of the disease they would talk about the psycho-social part," said Donna Torrisi, the executive director of the Family Practice and Counseling Network, which has three clinics in Philadelphia. "It's not about the disease, it's about the person who has the disease. While in the hospital you'll often hear doctors refer to a patient as 'the cardiac down the hall.'" 
Younger doctors are no doubt better at this than their older peers. But the system conspires against them. The 15-minute appointment standard in fee-for-service medicine - which pays doctors according to how many patients they see and treatments they provide - makes it unlikely that doctors will spend time discussing a patient's life in any detail. Physician reimbursement places a zero value on talking to the patient. But nurse practitioners are salaried, giving them the luxury of time. At the Family Health clinics, appointments last half an hour - an hour for a new diabetic or pregnant patient.
Jennifer Coddington, a pediatric nurse practitioner who is a co-clinical director of Family Health Clinics, said that she spends a lot of time teaching patients and their families about their diseases and how to manage it. "We want to know socially and economically what's going on in their life - their educational level, how are they making it financially," she said. "You can't teach patients if you're not at their educational level. And if a patient can't afford something, what's the point of trying to prescribe it? He's going to be non-compliant."
A physician might suggest that a patient lose weight and hand him a diet plan - or refer him to a nutritionist. At the Family Health clinics, nutrition counselors - graduate students at Purdue - will sit down with patients to talk about the specific consequence of their diet, and suggest good foods and how to cook them, Coddington said. "When you don't have enough money to buy fruits and vegetables, so you go to the dollar menu at McDonald's - we help those people put planners together for the week."
Data has shown that nurse practitioners provide good health care. A review of 118 published studies over 18 years comparing health outcomes and patient satisfaction at doctor-led and nurse practioner-led clinics found the two groups to be equivalent on most outcomes. The nurses did better at controlling blood glucose and lipid levels, and on many aspects of birthing. There were no measures on which the nurses did worse.
Nurse-led clinics can save money - but not always in the obvious way. Many are cheaper than comparable physician-led clinics. Suzan Overholser, the business manager of the Family Health clinics, said that their cost per patient was $453 per year - lower than the Indiana average for similarly federally qualified clinics (all the others physician-led) of $549. But nurse-led clinics aren't always cheaper. Coddington examined published studies of clinic costs and found that in some cases, nurse-managed clinics had slightly higher per-patient costs than traditional clinics.
Although nurses are paid less than doctors (Medicare reimburses them at 85 percent of what it pays doctors,) nurse-led clinics are often very small, and so don't have the variety of practitioners necessary to keep a clinic running at full capacity. They also serve the most difficult and expensive patients.
The biggest financial benefit, however, likely comes from offering patients an alternative to the emergency room. Coddington's review cites studies showing large savings in paramedic, police, emergency room and hospital use. A traditional clinic in an underserved area would do that, too, of course - it's just that nurses tend to go where doctors won't.
There are about 150,000 nurse practitioners in America today. The vast majority practice in traditional settings - only about a thousand are in nurse-managed clinics. One reason these clinics are rare is that they may equal traditional clinics in health care, but not in business success.
Nurse-managed clinics have to overcome regulatory and financial obstacles that traditional clinics don't face. Powerful physicians' groups such as the American Academy of Family Physicians oppose allowing nurses to practice independently. "Granting independent practice to nurse practitioners would be creating two classes of care: one run by a physician-led team and one run by less-qualified health professionals," says a paperfrom the A.A.F.P., citing the fact that doctors get more years of education and training. "Americans should not be forced into this two-tier scenario. Everyone deserves to be under the care of a doctor."
Only 16 states and Washington, D.C., allow nurses complete independence. In other states, some of the restrictions are bizarre - in Indiana, for example, nurse practitioners may do everything doctors do, with two exceptions: they can't prescribe physical therapy or do physicals for high school sports.
Jim Layman, the executive director of the Family Health clinics, said he thought that nurse practitioners cared for the majority of Medicaid patients in Indiana. But if you look through Medicaid records, you'll find only doctors - nurses are not allowed to be the primary caregiver of record. So the Family Health clinics, like others, employ a physician off-site from 4 to 6 hours a week who uses electronic health records to examine a sample of cases and consult when necessary. Medicaid is billed in his name.
It is not easy for nurse-run clinics to win status as a Federally Qualified Community Health clinic, which would allow them to get federal grants. This is largely because most come out of universities, and most universities don't want to cede control to the community - a requirement for this status. Purdue decided it would, and the Family Health clinics qualified in 2009. Before that, they received some money from the state, and raised the rest from local March of Dimes, United Way and Chamber of Commerce donations, plus fund-raising dinners and auctions. This was enough to support just one full-time provider at each clinic. Getting F.Q.C.H. status allowed them to hire more staff and move the Carroll County clinic into a modern new building - and probably saved them from collapse. "It would have been very difficult for us had we not gotten F.Q.C.H. status," said Coddington. The Affordable Care Act - Obamacare - did authorize $50 million for five years for nurse-managed clinics. So far 10 clinics have gotten a total of $15 million.
In some ways, the nurse practitioner-managed clinic is a throwback to the small-town family practice, when your doctor asked about the schoolyard bully and your dad's unemployment. Among the many changes needed in how America values and reimburses health care, it's important to encourage and support these clinics. They may be old-fashioned, but that doesn't mean they should be financed with bake sales.

HEADLINE: Collective Rebuttal Delivered in Third-Party Debate

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: Some call them spoilers and sideshows, but the third-party candidates for president held a serious discussion on civil liberties, "super PACs" and the war on drugs. 

 BODY:
Even though a debate featuring third-party presidential candidates was supposed to highlight the breadth of ideological diversity in American politics, Larry King, the moderator, had to remind the four nominees that they had to actually disagree about something to issue a rebuttal.
Tuesday night's meeting of long shots, held in Chicago, was intended as a rebuttal to the debates held between the nominees for the Democratic and Republican Parties. Not only have the candidates from the Green, Libertarian, Constitution and Justice Parties been excluded from the showdowns sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates, so have the issues they care about most: civil liberties after Sept. 11, the role of corporate money in politics and a political class more concerned about keeping power than answering to the people. 
Sometimes, those issues can contribute to a sideshow stereotype, as when drug legalization became a major topic - and source of consensus - at the Chicago debate, which was sponsored by Free and Equal, a nonprofit group that promotes open elections.
The call by the liberals, Jill Stein of the Green Party and Rocky Anderson of the Justice Party, for an end to the war on drugs was amplified by Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate. Mr. Johnson offered bona fides on the question: "I have drank alcohol, I have smoked marijuana" - though not anymore, he said. Even Virgil Goode of the conservative Constitution Party, who opposes legalization, said he would cut financing for federal drug enforcement in the name of closing the deficit.
But their passion and refusal to compromise on the principles that reflect their ideas of American democracy marked each person on stage. In an illustration of the circular nature of the political spectrum, the staunch liberals and small-government conservatives all firmly opposed the practice of indefinite detention without trial and said that the Pentagon's budget should be cut as the United States takes a less aggressive posture.
"We cannot be the policemen of the world," Mr. Goode said, followed shortly by Ms. Stein's similar sentiment: "A foreign policy based on militarism and brute military force is making us less secure, not more secure."
The particular set questions, submitted by social media and the event's organizers, disproportionately addressed issues where the candidates' views are alike. It took a question about the cost of college to reveal strong differences. Ms. Stein, a physician, and Mr. Anderson, a former Democrat and mayor of Salt Lake City, both said the government should provide free higher education. The right-leaning candidates both said they would cut Pell grants, Mr. Johnson reasoning that guaranteed government loans make universities "immune from pricing."
And even Mr. Johnson and Mr. Goode had differences. The latter said he would cut off immigration until the unemployment rate dropped to 5 percent, while Mr. Johnson, a former New Mexico governor who unsuccessfully ran in the G.O.P. primary, wants to make it easier for immigrants to get work visas.
Both men have been seen as possible spoilers for Mitt Romney, and Mr. Goode seemed to particularly relish that potential. A former Virginia congressman, he overcame Republicans' efforts to keep him off the ballot in that state, and he frequently contrasted his plans to cut the budget with the slower approach of the Republican ticket.
While the six questions at the Free and Equal debate touched on topics neglected in the official face-offs, the candidates were not asked to delve into the issues that have dominated the conventional discussion, including jobs, health care, and taxes.
Because the debate focused on ideas and principles - rather than the candidates' records and qualifications - the tone of the debate was genuinely warm, without any of the direct engagement or interruptions that have marked the Obama-Romney and Biden-Ryan debates. In fact, the only person on the defensive at any point was the red-suspendered Mr. King.
After the first question was asked and answered (pretty much everyone thought the "top 2" primary system like that adopted in California this cycle is a bad idea), one of the candidates pointed out that they had skipped opening statements. Mr. King was quick to deflect responsibility.
"It was not in my notes," the veteran interviewer said. "I'm a Jewish guy from Brooklyn, so I do what I'm told."
Free and Equal announced it would hold a second debate on Oct. 30 in Washington with just two candidates, to be chosen by viewers in an online vote.

HIGHLIGHT: Unusual subject matter, such as climate change and shifting population, makes its way into the design of two new scarf collections. 

 BODY:
Climate change and shifting population patterns are not typically fashion fodder - which makes two new scarf collections all the more intriguing. For the latest Sportmax Carte Blanche collaboration, the creative consultant and Design Miami and Design Miami/Basel co-founder Ambra Medda tapped the illustrator Ying Wu, a Royal College of Art graduate whose work she discovered at the most recent Salone del Mobile in Milan. Wu's silk foulards comment on the unforeseen side effects of unbridled economic growth, a phenomenon that the Chinese-born artist has experienced firsthand and frequently alludes to in her work. With their poster-art palette and Maurice Sendak-ish animal imagery, Wu's scarves are highly decorative. But if you look closer, says Medda, "you start to realize that there is a whole other dimension that brings you back to a starker reality." The limited-edition collection will be available at the Sportmax flagship store in Milan in January.
Only marginally less colorful is the reality explored by the Dutch photographer and designer Reineke Otten, who devised the palette for her collection of statistics-driven silk scarves from Data.gov and The CIA World Factbook. "I was fascinated by the idea of seeing people as color pixels," says Otten, who created the scarves as part of her larger World Skin Colors project. After compiling information on the distribution of skin colors, G.D.P., number of airports and other factoids from 231 countries - a time-consuming process that involved four months of plugging numbers into spreadsheets and a close study of the Pantone color system - Otten was able to map the world's complexion, wealth and access to air travel in pie charts, polka dots and other symbols. Because each country generates unique data, no two designs are alike. Beginning this month, Otten's United States and Israel squares, packaged in the same cardboard used for archive folders, will be available at the Jewish Museum in New York. They come with a small caveat: "Like populations, these maps are ephemeral," she says, "snapshots of the world as it is composed today, poised to change tomorrow."

HEADLINE: Why Are States So Red and Blue?

BYLINE: STEVEN PINKER


HIGHLIGHT: Theories about our right-wing and left-wing mind-sets don't explain why they are tied to geography. 

 BODY:
Regardless of who wins the presidential election, we already know now how most of the electoral map will be colored, which will be close to the way it has been colored for decades. Broadly speaking, the Southern and Western desert and mountain states will vote for the candidate who endorses an aggressive military, a role for religion in public life, laissez-faire economic policies, private ownership of guns and relaxed conditions for using them, less regulation and taxation, and a valorization of the traditional family. Northeastern and most coastal states will vote for the candidate who is more closely aligned with international cooperation and engagement, secularism and science, gun control, individual freedom in culture and sexuality, and a greater role for the government in protecting the environment and ensuring economic equality.
But why do ideology and geography cluster so predictably? Why, if you know a person's position on gay marriage, can you predict that he or she will want to increase the military budget and decrease the tax rate, and is more likely to hail from Wyoming or Georgia than from Minnesota or Vermont? To be sure, some of these affinities may spring from coalitions of convenience. Economic libertarians and Christian evangelicals, united by their common enemy, are strange bedfellows in today's Republican party, just as the two Georges - the archconservative Wallace and the uberliberal McGovern - found themselves in the same Democratic Party in 1972.
But there may also be coherent mindsets beneath the diverse opinions that hang together in right-wing and left-wing belief systems. Political philosophers have long known that the ideologies are rooted in different conceptions of human nature - a conflict of visions so fundamental as to align opinions on dozens of issues that would seem to have nothing in common.

Conservative thinkers like the economist Thomas Sowell and the Times columnist David Brooks have noted that the political right has a Tragic Vision of human nature, in which people are permanently limited in morality, knowledge and reason. Human beings are perennially tempted by aggression, which can be prevented only by the deterrence of a strong military, of citizens resolved to defend themselves and of the prospect of harsh criminal punishment. No central planner is wise or knowledgeable enough to manage an entire economy, which is better left to the invisible hand of the market, in which intelligence is distributed across a network of hundreds of millions of individuals implicitly transmitting information about scarcity and abundance through the prices they negotiate. Humanity is always in danger of backsliding into barbarism, so we should respect customs in sexuality, religion and public propriety, even if no one can articulate their rationale, because they are time-tested workarounds for our innate shortcomings. The left, in contrast, has a Utopian Vision, which emphasizes the malleability of human nature, puts customs under the microscope, articulates rational plans for a better society and seeks to implement them through public institutions.
Cognitive scientists have recently enriched this theory with details of how the right-left divide is implemented in people's cognitive and moral intuitions. The linguist George Lakoff suggests that the political right conceives of society as a family ruled by a strict father, whereas the left thinks of it as a family guided by a nurturant parent. The metaphors may be corollaries of the tragic and utopian visions, since different parenting practices are called for depending on whether you think of children as noble savages or as nasty, brutish and short. The psychologist Jonathan Haidt notes that rightists and leftists invest their moral intuitions in different sets of concerns: conservatives place a premium on deference to authority, conformity to norms and the purity and sanctity of the body; liberals restrict theirs to fairness, the provision of care and the avoidance of harm. Once again, the difference may flow from the clashing conceptions of human nature. If individuals are inherently flawed, their behavior must be restrained by custom, authority and sacred values. If they are capable of wisdom and reason, they can determine for themselves what is fair, harmful or hurtful.
But while these theories help explain why the seemingly diverse convictions within the right-wing and left-wing mind-sets hang together, they don't explain why they are tied to geography. The historian David Hackett Fischer traces the divide back to the British settlers of colonial America. The North was largely settled by English farmers, the inland South by Scots-Irish herders. Anthropologists have long noted that societies that herd livestock in rugged terrain tend to develop a "culture of honor." Since their wealth has feet and can be stolen in an eye blink, they are forced to deter rustlers by cultivating a hair-trigger for violent retaliation against any trespass or insult that probes their resolve. Farmers can afford to be less belligerent because it is harder to steal their land out from under them, particularly in territories within the reach of law enforcement. As the settlers moved westward, they took their respective cultures with them. The psychologist Richard Nisbett has shown that Southerners today continue to manifest a culture of honor which legitimizes violent retaliation. It can be seen in their laws (like capital punishment and a stand-your-ground right to self-defense), in their customs (like paddling children in schools and volunteering for military service), even in their physiological reactions to trivial insults.
Admittedly, it's hard to believe that today's Southerners and Westerners carry a cultural memory of sheepherding ancestors. But it may not be the herding profession itself that nurtures a culture of honor so much as living in anarchy. All societies must deal with the dilemma famously pointed out by Hobbes: in the absence of government, people are tempted to attack one another out of greed, fear and vengeance. European societies, over the centuries, solved this problem as their kings imposed law and order on a medieval patchwork of fiefs ravaged by feuding knights. The happy result was a thirty-fivefold reduction in their homicide rate from the Middle Ages to the present. Once the monarchs pacified the people, the people then had to rein in the monarchs, who had been keeping the peace with arbitrary edicts and gruesome public torture-executions. Beginning in the Age of Reason and the Enlightenment, governments were forced to implement democratic procedures, humanitarian reforms and the protection of human rights.
When the first American settlers fanned out from the coasts and other settled areas, they found themselves in anarchy all over again. The historian David Courtwright has shown that there is considerable truth to the cinematic clichés of the Wild West and the mountainous South of Davy Crocket, Daniel Boone and the Hatfields and McCoys. The nearest sheriff might be 90 miles away, and a man had to defend himself with firearms and a reputation for toughness. In the all-male enclaves of cattle and mining towns, young men besotted with honor and alcohol constantly challenged one another's mettle and responded to these challenges, pushing rates of violence through the roof.
Another cliché of the cowboy movies also had an element of historical truth. As more women moved west, they worked to end the lifestyle of brawling, boozing and whoring they found there, joining forces with the officials in charge of the rowdy settlements. They found a natural ally in the church, with its co-ed membership, norms of temperance and Sunday morning discipline. By the time the government consolidated its control over the West (and recall that the "closing of the frontier," marking the end of American anarchy, took place just more than a century ago), the norms of self-defense through masculine honor, and the restraint of ruffianism by women and church, had taken root.
But then why, once stable government did arrive, did it not lay claim to the monopoly on violence that is the very definition of government? The historian Pieter Spierenburg has suggested that "democracy came too soon to America," namely, before the government had disarmed its citizens. Since American governance was more or less democratic from the start, the people could choose not to cede to it the safeguarding of their personal safety but to keep it as their prerogative. The unhappy result of this vigilante justice is that American homicide rates are far higher than those of Europe, and those of the South higher than those of the North.
If this history is right, the American political divide may have arisen not so much from different conceptions of human nature as from differences in how best to tame it. The North and coasts are extensions of Europe and continued the government-driven civilizing process that had been gathering momentum since the Middle Ages. The South and West preserved the culture of honor that emerged in the anarchic territories of the growing country, tempered by their own civilizing forces of churches, families and temperance.

Steven Pinker is Harvard College Professor of Psychology at Harvard University and the author, most recently, of "The Better Angels of Our Nature: Why Violence Has Declined."

HEADLINE: Former Assistant Principal Penalized for Missing Work to Go to Second Job

BYLINE: DANIELLA SILVA


HIGHLIGHT: Maizelin Knowlin, who was assistant principal at Public School 276 in Canarsie, Brooklyn, left work early and was paid for work she did not do, a city panel said. 

 BODY:
A former assistant principal at a Brooklyn public school was penalized for leaving work early or not showing up on 32 occasions while she worked a second job, the city's Conflicts of Interest Board announced on Wednesday.
The former assistant principal, Maizelin Knowlin of Public School 276, had in 2010 when the Department of Education said in a report that she lived in New Jersey but enrolled her children in New York City schools by giving a false Brooklyn address.
At P.S. 276 in Canarsie, Ms. Knowlin's workday ended at 3:20. But during the 2006-7 school year, she also worked as a program coordinator at the Flatbush Y.M.C.A., according to an settlement agreement she reached with the conflicts board. Eighteen times, Ms. Knowlin began working at the Y program at 3 p.m., the settlement says. On 14 other occasions, Ms. Knowlin was paid for working at an education department after-school program when she was actually working at the Y, the settlement said.
Ms. Knowlin was fired in March 2011 for the workday violations. The conflicts board fined her $2,500, but forgave the fine after she showed proof of financial hardship; she was still unemployed as of last month. She stated in her settlement that she had "significant outstanding debts, and would not be able to make any monthly payment to the board as a penalty for the violations cited above and still be able to pay for other basic living expenses."
In other actions against city education workers on Wednesday, the board announced that it had fined a former Education Department human resources director, Vivian Nero, $4,000 for misusing her position to get her two adult children jobs at city schools. The program that Ms. Nero works for is called Children First.

HEADLINE: Wall Street Leaders Peer Into Economic Gloom

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: At the Buttonwood Gathering, hosted by The Economist magazine, it was clear that executives were contending with a world that is not easy to figure out. 

 BODY:
Uncertainty seems to be the reigning theme on Wall Street these days. Just from looking at recent earnings reports, it is clear that executives are contending with a world that is not easy to figure out.
Three senior financiers shared their thoughts on these broad risks during a conference in New York on Wednesday, opining on the sovereign debt crisis in Europe, the evolution of China's economy and the sluggish economy at home. The discussion during the afternoon panel tended to veer into the technical and philosophical, as perhaps was fitting for the Buttonwood Gathering, hosted by The Economist magazine.
But when it came to the economy at home, each panelist had strong views.
 "I'm sorry, but we're in the first or second inning of a long process over many years, probably a decade," said David H. McCormick, co-chief executive and member of the management committee of the giant hedge fund Bridgewater Associates.
The outlook for economic growth is "fragile," he said, with risks "largely to the downside."
The rate of growth over the next few years will be "painful," said another panelist, Roger C. Altman, founder and chairman of Evercore Partners. "We'll have, in most respects, subpar growth."
After that difficult period, though, the housing market and the broader economy are likely to improve, Mr. Altman said.
One source of optimism can be found in Silicon Valley and other hubs of tech innovation, said the third panelist, Stephen Pagliuca, managing director of Bain Capital.
Political factors also present risks for doing business. For Mr. Pagliuca, who has watched his firm's name be dragged through the mud during this year's presidential race, those concerns are especially familiar.
"As we know painfully at Bain Capital, you have to separate the political hyperbole as to what you are versus what you really are," he said at the conference.
Talk turned to the so-called fiscal cliff, the spending cuts and tax increases that are set to go into effect at the end of the year if lawmakers cannot agree on a budget.
Mr. McCormick of Bridgewater argued that going over the cliff would not be as damaging as some people have speculated. Mr. Altman and Mr. Pagliuca predicted that lawmakers would reach an agreement to avoid that situation.
The question of political leadership was a theme of the day and a focus of an earlier speech by Mohamed A. El-Erian, chief executive of Pimco, who contended that politicians were not doing enough to help the global economy.
With the presidential election coming up, politics is not far from the minds of Wall Street executives. Last week, David A. Viniar, Goldman Sachs's chief financial officer, said that political speeches could cause market swings.
The panelists were asked about central banks, which have pumped huge amounts of stimulus into economies around the world, making them popular with traders and others in global finance.
"History will look back on them as having responded in a way that was both necessary and heroic," Mr. McCormick said. The years since the financial crisis "would have been radically different and much, much worse had they not done what they've done."

HEADLINE: The Flawed Case for Fiscal Stimulus

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: The safety-net programs in the federal stimulus that helped fight the recession came at a cost of weakening incentives to work or hire, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
A fundamental flaw in much of the advocacy for government spending to "jump-start the economy" has been a failure to adequately distinguish government transfers to individuals from government spending on goods and services.
When the Obama administration designed the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act in early 2009, its chief economic adviser and one of the act's enthusiastic advocates was Prof. Christina Romer of the University of California, Berkeley. Ever since, Professor Romer has insisted that opposition to the act's purported stimulus value is largely motivated by ideology, contrary to empirical evidence, and is getting in the way of the even bigger stimulus that is needed.
The recovery act had three basic components: government purchases, transfers to the poor and unemployed, and so-called tax cuts. (Parts of the act gave resources to state and local governments, which they could devote to the same three components.)
I agree with Professor Romer that plenty of historical episodes featured surges in government purchases of goods and services, especially but not exclusively purchases by the Defense Department. Moreover, I agree with her that historical episodes can be informative about the modern-day effects of government purchases.
The fatal flaw in Professor Romer's evaluation of recovery act's effects occurs when she assumes that transfers to the poor and unemployed have the same employment and output effects as government spending on goods and services.
Economic theory and common sense tell us that paying someone to build a tank or pave a highway - as government purchases often do - has a very different effect than paying them for not working or paying them for earning less rather than more - as the law's transfers did.

Professor Romer calls herself "an empirical economist" and might therefore eschew economic theory and common sense until it is supported by empirical evidence. But she fails to mention that dozens, if not hundreds, of empirical studies have found that safety-net programs discourage people from working and discourage employers from hiring (there are so many studies that there are now studies of studies, summaries of meta-analyses and so on).
That literature offers a range of estimates, and sometimes passionate arguments among its authors, but certainly does not support the idea that incentives are negligible, especially when the government obtains the large majority of the proceeds of a person's work.
Understandably the law was put together hastily in early 2009 as people feared that the recession was getting out of control, and some bases were momentarily left uncovered. But almost four years later, an empirical economist should have noticed that the legislation eroded incentives to work and eroded incentives for employers to hire or avoid layoffs, and that these parts of the act by themselves are likely to have reduced employment and certainly did not expand it as much as government purchases would.
An empirical economist would also notice that the demographic groups whose work incentives were eroded the most by the law, like unmarried people, were remarkably the same groups whose employment and work hours fell the most. By further expanding safety-net programs, a bigger stimulus would only have created more groups with labor-market outcomes like the unmarried and enlarged the ranks of people for whom government help permitted them to spend more by working less.
Professor Romer might point to a study the President's Council of Economic Advisers released shortly after she left in 2010, contending that extending the duration of unemployment insurance increased national employment. But that study suffers from the same flaw, because its estimates are based on the backward assumption that the historical "multipliers" for government purchases apply to transfer-program spending too.
In my new book, I explain how the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act did not erode work incentives by extending unemployment benefits (those extensions, examined in the White House study, were put in place by other legislation), but rather by giving unemployed people bonuses, paying for most of an unemployed person's health insurance and expanding the food stamp program, to name just a few provisions.
Throughout the time Professor Romer has been trying to convince us that the law expanded our economy, she has failed to mention that it eroded work incentives, and she has not explained how its transfers could possibly have the expansionary effects of historical military buildups and the like.
One might expect that the tax credits part of the law would have enhanced incentives and thereby help offset the incentives that were eroded by its transfers. However, many of the tax credits were withheld from people from high incomes. Regardless of whether redistribution is achieved by collecting more taxes from families with high incomes, providing more subsidies to families with low incomes, or both, an essential consequence is the same: a reduction in the reward to activities and efforts that raise incomes.
Studies suggest that the American Reinvestment and Recovery Act helped keep living standards out of poverty, a great benefit that may be worth depressing the labor market. But empirical evidence, economic theory and common sense all contradict Professor Romer's assumption that transfers to the poor and the unemployed raise employment about as much as the same amount of government spending on goods and services.

HEADLINE: From 'Frontline,' a Look at the Skeptics' Advance

BYLINE: FELICITY BARRINGER


HIGHLIGHT: A PBS "Frontline" documentary examines the ideology that animates the political strategists arguing for skepticism about climate change. 

 BODY:
Less than 24 hours after the final presidential debate ended with the words "climate change" left unsaid, PBS aired a report that essentially explains the omission.
"Climate of Doubt," a "Frontline" documentary presented on Tuesday night, probably allots the biggest single block of national airtime to climate skeptics like Myron Ebell of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, Tim Phillips of Americans for Prosperity and S. Fred Singer than we've seen in a long time.
Very little of the production is about the science of climate change. The focus is rather on the ideology and political heft of the skeptics' movement, and the way it found new life as the economy fell to pieces and the Tea Party arose from the wreckage.
The outlines of the story about sowing doubt about the scientific consensus on climate change have been presented before: the historians Naomi Oreskes and Eric Conway recounted it in their book "Merchants of Doubt," as did the late climate scientist Stephen Schneiderin "Science as a Contact Sport."
But "Frontline" brings the story up to date. Its examination of how the skeptics have made the issue untouchable is built up brick by brick through interviews with some of the movement's leading political strategists and their political victims, like the former South Carolina Congressman Bob Inglis, who was defeated in a Republican primary in 2010. The correspondent, John Hockenberry, asks Mr. Ebell about that rout, which many attribute to Mr. Inglis's speaking out about climate change and the need to arrest it.
Mr. Ebell: Bob Inglis was defeated in a Republican primary, 79 to 21 percent. Now, how many times has an incumbent who isn't in prison or facing a prison sentence lost his own primary by 79 to 21 percent? This was overwhelming. But, what's happened is --
Mr. Hockenberry: The smile on your face suggests: "Man, we won one!"
Mr. Ebell: Of course we won one!
This is one of several exchanges that demonstrate, far better than words on a page, the single-minded pursuit of ideological victory that animates people like Mr. Ebell and Mr. Phillips. Another example is when Mr. Phillips discusses his take-no-prisoners strategy on Republicans who stray from the fold by talking about alternative energy sources.
Mr. Hockenberry: You said "We've made great headway." What it means for candidates in the Republican side is, if you buy into green energy or you play footsie on this issue, you do so at your political peril?
Mr. Phillips: You do. Absolutely. And that's the big change, and it is important. Again, I remember four, five or even three years ago, John, a lot of Republicans, they would play games with this. They'd say: "O.K., oh gosh, I think I need a green energy agenda. But I won't go all the way and support cap and trade." They did. They tried to walk down the middle. And that's wrong. I think it's philosophically inconsistent, but it's also politically disadvantageous. And we've worked hard to make that so, by the way.
Those who worry about climate change and want to see action taken may squirm with impatience at the limited air time for rebuttal, particularly in the opening segments of the piece. But Mr. Hockenberry's polite, noncombative style, even when he is confronting Dr. Singer with scientific reports on the question, gives his interviewees the space they need to be themselves. And the result -- particularly Dr. Singer's brisk, confident certainty in the following exchange -- is arresting.
Mr. Hockenberry (Reading from a National Academy of Sciences report): "Climate change is occurring and is largely caused by human activities and poses a significant risk for a broad range of human and natural systems." You say that's false.
Dr. Singer: Yes.
Mr. Hockenberry: False.
Dr. Singer: False.
Mr. Hockenberry: And if most of the climate scientists believe that statement, they are deluded?
Dr. Singer (with a smile): Yes.
Mr. Hockenberry: And you are seeing something they are not seeing?
Dr. Singer: Yes.
Mr. Hockenberry: So it's 97 percent of them and one of you?
Dr. Singer: Well, you can put it that way if you like. But I don't think that's the way it works. There's hundreds of us -- hundreds, thousands of us. ...
Shortly before that exchange, in one of the few segments devoted to the scientific arguments, climate scientists are shown explaining how skeptics can cherry-pick data to argue that there has been no warming in the last decade or so. As Andrew Dessler, a scientist at Texas A & M, put it, "You can, if you want, very carefully select the end points of your time series, the starting month and the ending month, and then maybe you come up with something that shows no warming."
The one-on-one interviews that dominate the piece are leavened with video clips from hotel meeting rooms where skeptical choirs are being preached to, Tea Party rallies and shots of ocean waves off the North Carolina coast, which is likely to be inundated in a climate-changed world, even though the North Carolina Legislature recently considered banning the acknowledgment of rising sea levels in official deliberations on coastal development. One of the bill's supporters describes how he relies on a book by Dr. Singer for his information.
In the end, the thinking behind the producers' decision to go light on science and heavy on ideology in Mr. Hockenberry's questioning and in the editing of the piece becomes clear. The takeaway from "Climate of Doubt" is that science and its evidence are of secondary importance in the skeptics' world.
It's more about fighting what they see as an ideology that wants to subordinate their rights to the authority of the federal government.
Mr. Hockenberry: How does free-market conservatism relate to climate change and the scientific argument over climate change?
Mr. Phillips: It doesn't, to the scientific side. It very much so relates to the policies that the left pushes in the name of global warming. Every once in a while I'll make a statement about the science, but that's a tiny percentage of what we do ..."

HEADLINE: U.S. Accuses Bank of America of a 'Brazen' Mortgage Fraud

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The bank is accused of selling "defective" mortgages to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the government-controlled housing giants, which were stuck with more than $1 billion in losses and many foreclosures. 

 BODY:
 9:34 p.m. | Updated 
Five years after the housing market crumbled, government officials are still trying to assign blame for the problems that fueled the mortgage boom and bust.
On Wednesday, federal prosecutors in New York took aim at Bank of America. They accused it of carrying out a scheme, started by its Countrywide Financial unit, that defrauded government-backed mortgage agencies by churning out loans at a rapid pace without proper controls. In a civil suit, prosecutors seek to collect at least $1 billion in penalties from the bank as compensation for the behavior that they say forced taxpayers to guarantee billions in bad loans.
Financial firms have been battling chaotic - and at times redundant - litigation related to the mortgage mess. The cases have come from a patchwork of federal agencies, state officials and shareholder suits, some of which have been resolved in multibillion-dollar settlements.
"They never know who's going to be coming after them next," said Dan Hurson, a former federal prosecutor who now defends securities cases. "There's no central traffic cop."
Still, the public has been frustrated with the limited number of criminal actions that have been filed since the financial crisis. Few cases have taken aim at top executives. Even in the latest case against Bank of America, no company officials were sued as part of the complaint. Angelo R. Mozilo, the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, never faced criminal charges but did agree in 2010 to pay $67.5 million to settle a civil fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Hurson said that the government had yet to overcome the notion that federal authorities were reluctant to pursue the top rungs of Wall Street. The criminal actions to come from the crisis, he noted, have focused on "small-time operators."
The government, however, has contended that it has aggressively pursued mortgage fraud. As the legal deadline approaches for filing crisis-related cases, President Obama formed a mortgage task force to investigate wrongdoing. The unit recently announced its first case, taking action against JPMorgan Chase over mortgage deals created by Bear Stearns, the firm that JPMorgan bought during the crisis.
The legal problems for Bank of America, however, have taken a deeper financial toll, costing the bank billions in write-downs and settlements. Much of its problems stem from its takeover of Countrywide Financial, once the nation's largest mortgage lender. The bank also struck a $2.4 billion deal in September to settle a class-action lawsuit over shareholder claims that it misled investors about the 2009 purchase of Merrill Lynch.
In the lawsuit on Wednesday, the Justice Department attacked a home loan program known as the "hustle," which the bank inherited from Countrywide in 2008 and kept alive through 2009.
Prosecutors say the venture was a symbol of Wall Street's slipshod standards during the mortgage bubble. According to the lawsuit, Countrywide rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and passed them on to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-controlled mortgage financial giants that guaranteed the loans. The two entities were ultimately stuck with heavy losses and a glut of foreclosed properties.
"The fraudulent conduct alleged in today's complaint was spectacularly brazen in scope," Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. "This lawsuit should send another clear message that reckless lending practices will not be tolerated."
Mr. Bharara filed the civil suit along with the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The government watchdog for the bank bailout program, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, also joined the complaint.
In a statement, a Bank of America spokesman said the bank "has stepped up and acted responsibly to resolve legacy mortgage matters; the claim that we have failed to repurchase loans from Fannie Mae is simply false." The spokesman, Lawrence Grayson, added, "At some point, Bank of America can't be expected to compensate every entity that claims losses that actually were caused by the economic downturn."
The case builds on a broader federal crackdown of Wall Street that continues years after the onset of the crisis. In a last-ditch effort to hold financial firms accountable, Mr. Bharara this month sued Wells Fargo over questionable mortgage deals.
The assertions in the Bank of America suit, however, do not shed much new light on the mortgage mess. The Federal Housing Finance Agency last year sued 17 big banks over losses sustained by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over different mortgage-related products. The twin mortgage finance companies, also bailed out by taxpayers in 2008 and still controlled by the government, continue to push firms like Bank of America to repurchase billions of dollars in bad loans.
The flurry of litigation, which comes on the cusp of the presidential election, has caused some on Wall Street to question whether the effort is rooted in political motivations.
Other white-collar lawyers say the complaints rehash old claims put forth by private investors. JPMorgan says that the government urged it to buy Bear Stearns, a defense that does not apply to Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide as part of an aggressive expansion effort.
Still, a lawyer close to the Bank of America case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was continuing, argued that the bank had already repaid Fannie Mae for some of the soured loans in question. Other loans, this person argued, were never before disputed by Fannie Mae.
The lawsuit threatens to impose steep fines on the bank. The Justice Department filed the case under the False Claims Act, which could provide for triple the damages suffered by Fannie and Freddie, a penalty that could reach more than $3 billion.
The act also provides an avenue for a Countrywide whistle-blower, Edward J. O'Donnell, to cash in. Under the act, the government can piggyback on accusations he filed in a lawsuit that was kept under seal until now.
Mr. O'Donnell, who lives in Pennsylvania, was an executive vice president for Countrywide before leaving the company in 2009. The government's case in part hinges on the credibility of his claims.
In the 46-page lawsuit, prosecutors contend that Countrywide abandoned its lending standards in 2007 with the creation of the "hustle" program. Short for "HSSL," or "High-Speed Swim Lane," the program adopted the motto "move forward, never backward," prosecutors said, citing Countrywide documents.
With the goal of generating a high number of loans, Countrywide tore down internal controls known as tollgates that were in place to slow the mortgage process and root out risky borrowers. The firm at one point removed trained underwriters from the loan process, opting instead to rely on "unqualified and inexperienced" loan processors.
At times, prosecutors claim, loan processors crossed a legal line. Some "repeatedly did manipulate" loan forms, jotting down higher incomes for borrowers so they would qualify for Fannie Mae's standards.
By early 2008, the lax standards started to show. More than a third of the unit's loans were defective, a significant jump over the industry standard of about 5 percent.
Despite the poor performance, prosecutors said, the bank sold the loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and "concealed the defect rates and continued the hustle."

HEADLINE: Republican Homes Bounce Back

BYLINE: FLOYD NORRIS


HIGHLIGHT: Home prices have recovered from the credit crisis lows in nearly all states expected to vote for Mitt Romney, and are below the crisis lows in most states expected to support President Obama. 

 BODY:
The uneven recovery in home prices seems to be favoring Republican voters over Democratic ones. 
The Federal Housing Finance Agency's House Price Index reported Wednesday that prices rose 4.7 percent nationally over the 12 months through August. That was the fastest annual pace since 2006.
Averages can be deceiving. In some places prices are still falling, while in others they are rising at a fast clip.
State-by-state figures are available only on a quarterly basis, with the second quarter the most recent one.
Those figures show that prices were above the recession low -- defined as the minimum level from 2007 through 2010 -- in 33 states. In the other 17 states, prices now are lower than they were at the recession bottom.
The Times lists 18 states as leaning to or solidly for Barack Obama, and 24 states as likely or certain to back Mitt Romney, with eight states viewed as tossups. 
Home prices have recovered from the lows of the crisis in 22 of the 24 Republican states, the exceptions being North and South Carolina. 
But prices are below the crisis lows in 12 of the 18 Democratic states. They are up at least a little bit in California, Oregon, Maryland, Vermont, Michigan and Hawaii. 
Of the eight tossup states, prices are above the crisis low in five of the states (Colorado, Virginia, Florida, Iowa and Ohio) and below that level in three states (New Hampshire, Wisconsin and Nevada).
If you assume that the tossup states with prices that have recovered will back Mr. Romney, along with all the states listed as leaning Republican, he would have 281 electoral votes, to 257 for Mr. Obama, and would become president.
But if you think that all the states listed as leaning might still switch, and assume they will actually vote with their home prices, that changes the vote in only one state, North Carolina, which has 15 electoral votes. Then Mr. Obama wins with 271 electoral votes, three more than needed.
Does this make any sense? Perhaps. Mr. Romney has called for relying on the market to solve the crisis. In states where the market is cooperating, that might seem to be a better prescription than it does in areas where prices are still falling.

HEADLINE: Nations With Difficulties Sag in Survey of Brand Images

BYLINE: STUART ELLIOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Two nations whose economies have been under scrutiny during the euro zone crisis each fell five places on the eighth annual Country Brand Index survey from FutureBrand, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies. 

 BODY:
In an annual study that ranks perceptions of the world's nations as if they were consumer product brands, nations with problems have suffered dents to their images.
Two nations whose economies have been under scrutiny as part of the euro zone crisis, Italy and Spain, each fell five places in the eighth annual Country Brand Index survey from FutureBrand, part of the Interpublic Group of Companies.
Italy dropped to 15th place from 10th last year, while Spain fell to 19th from 14th.
Conversely, the European nation with what is generally perceived as the strongest economy, Germany, rose four places in the 2012 survey, to seventh place.
The United States fell to rungs, to eighth place. It was in fourth place in the 2010 survey and finished first in 2009, a ranking that was attributed at the time to optimism surrounding the dawn of the Obama presidency 
"Global political and financial events had a large impact" in the 2012 survey, said Daniel Rosentreter, chief strategic officer for North America at FutureBrand.
Chris Nurko, global chairman at FutureBrand, pointed to results that displayed the effects of what he called "the paradox of bad news."
For instance, Japan declined in the 2011 survey in the aftermath of a devastating earthquake and tsunami that year. But in this survey, Japan rose to third place from fourth.
And in an example of good news helping a country's brand image, Britain climbed two places this year, to 11th place. Mr. Nurko attributed the change to the good will generated by events like the Summer Olympics and the jubilee celebration for Queen Elizabeth.
The 2012 survey, which is to be released by FutureBrand on Wednesday, also has a new top country, Switzerland, which climbed from second place on last year's list.
Canada, which was first in 2011, switched places with Switzerland.
Here are the top 10 countries in the 2012 survey: Switzerland, 1; Canada, 2; Japan, 3; Sweden, 4; New Zealand, 5; Australia, 6; Germany, 7; United States, 8; Finland, 9; and Norway, 10.
And here is the top 10 from last year: Canada, 1; Switzerland, 2; New Zealand, 3; Japan, 4; Australia, 5; United States, 6; Sweden, 7; Finland, 8; France, 9; and Italy, 10.

HEADLINE: The Third-Party Debate

BYLINE: JULIET LAPIDOS


HIGHLIGHT: Last night Gary Johnson, Jill Stein and other long shot candidates agreed on a number of issues that Democrats and Republicans won't even broach. 

 BODY:
Few voters realized there was another presidential debate on Tuesday. Even fewer watched it. The biggest "name" there wasn't a politician, but the moderator, Larry King, who called the candidates "Don Quixotes." 
That was apt. Because the Commission on Presidential Debates excludes parties with less than 15 percent support across the country, the Free and Equal Elections Foundation held an event in Chicago for the also-runnings: Gary Johnson of the Libertarian Party, Jill Stein of the Green Party, Rocky Anderson of the Justice Party and Virgil Goode of the Constitution Party.
Though in a sense these candidates represent the extreme left and the extreme right of the political spectrum, they readily agreed on a number of issues that Democrats and Republicans won't even broach-a reminder that the left/right construct doesn't always make sense (or that it's more circular than linear), and that the establishment parties still overlap a great deal.

Neither President Obama nor Mitt Romney mentions the War on Drugs on the campaign trail. The topic never came up at their debates. No matter who wins, the "war" will almost certainly continue apace.
But Mr. Johnson seemed to find the current system ridiculous. "I've smoked marijuana and I've drunk alcohol," he said, not boastfully but as a matter of fact. "I don't do either anymore. In no category is marijuana more dangerous than alcohol. The drug problem is prohibition related, not use related."
Ms. Stein made the same point: "the most serious health impact from marijuana is the illegal drug trade." And Mr. Anderson suggested that drug offenders not convicted of another crime don't belong in prison. Only Mr. Goode was something of an outlier, arguing against legalization. But he called drug use "a state issue" and said he wanted to cut financing for drug enforcement (on economic grounds.)
Late last year, Congress passed a National Defense Authorization Act that explicitly allowed indefinite military detention without charge or trial. It had bipartisan support and the president signed it into law. It is not an issue in the campaign, and did not come up at the official debates.
Last night, Mr. Anderson called the Act "the very definition of tyranny," and no one disagreed.
Everyone argued that the Pentagon's budget is too large. Mr. Goode said "The United States should stop trying to be the overseer of the world. That would save us billions and billions of dollars." Mr. Johnson said he would cut defense spending by 43 percent and warned that drone strikes kill "a lot of innocent civilians. " Ms. Stein said she would outlaw drone strikes.
Other topics proved more contentious. Ms. Stein came out in support of free college for all (a GI Bill for everyone) while Mr. Johnson said he'd do away with federal college loans: "Free comes with a cost. Free is spending more money than you take in." Mr. Johnson said it should be easier to obtain work visas, while Mr. Goode said the U.S. should stop issuing green cards until the unemployment rate falls below 5 percent.
Since the 2000 election, when Ralph Nader helped George W. Bush take Florida (Mr. Nader received almost 100,000 votes in that state), Americans have been especially wary of third-party candidates. Just mentioning Jill Stein will, in some circles, lead to angry arguments about "spoilers." But there are downsides to excluding fringe candidates from the national conversation. Their relative invisibility means the plausible candidates don't have to defend the views they hold in common.

HEADLINE: What Obama Said About Immigration in His Off-the-Record Interview

BYLINE: MICHAEL COOPER


HIGHLIGHT: In the interview he gave this week to The Des Moines Register, the president used his perceived anonymity to explain why he thinks the political calculus will make it possible for him to overhaul the nation's immigration laws next year. 

 BODY:
Curious about what President Obama might say when he believes he is off the record and can therefore afford to be "very blunt?" 
In the case of the interview he gave this week to The Des Moines Register, the president used his perceived anonymity to explain why he thinks the political calculus will make it possible for him to overhaul the nation's immigration laws next year. 
"The second thing I'm confident we'll get done next year is immigration reform," Mr. Obama said in an interview he gave as he sought the newspaper's endorsement. "And since this is off the record, I will just be very blunt. Should I win a second term, a big reason I will win a second term is because the Republican nominee and the Republican Party have so alienated the fastest-growing demographic group in the country, the Latino community. And this is a relatively new phenomenon."
"George Bush and Karl Rove were smart enough to understand the changing nature of America," he continued. "And so I am fairly confident that they're going to have a deep interest in getting that done. And I want to get it done because it's the right thing to do, and I've cared about this ever since I ran back in 2008."

Of course, there is a deja-vu quality to Mr. Obama's goal of overhauling the nation's immigration laws in the first year of his second term: he wanted to do so in the first year of his first term, too. Inan interviewwith Jorge Ramos of Univision in 2008, he said: "I cannot guarantee that it is going to be in the first 100 days. But what I can guarantee is that we will have in the first year an immigration bill that I strongly support and that I'm promoting. And I want to move that forward as quickly as possible."
Mitt Romney has pointed to that promise repeatedly to criticize the president. When Mr. Ramos asked Mr. Obama about that statement at a town-hall-style meeting in Miami this year, Mr. Obama said he had not anticipated that Republicans who previously supported reform "suddenly would walk away."
Mr. Obama did try in December 2010 to pass the Dream Act, a bill that would give legal status to at least 1.2 million young illegal immigrants who came to the United States as children. After an intense campaign by the White House, the bill passed the House of Representatives. 
In the Senate, it failed - by 5 votes - to gain the 60 votes needed to go to the floor. With no prospect of passing legislation in Congress, Mr. Obama used executive authority in June to offer reprieves from deportation to hundreds of thousands of young illegal immigrants.
Mr. Romney said during the primaries that he would veto the Dream Act and has made it clear that he opposes amnesty for people in the country illegally, but has never precisely clarified what he would do about more than 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States.
The Romney campaign responded to Mr. Obama's statement by reminding voters of the president's failure to enact legislation during his first term. "He's caught making secret promises to an editorial board in Iowa, which also happens to be a promise he made in 2008, a promise he failed to keep, and a promise he doesn't repeat publicly,'' Alberto Martinez, and adviser to the Romney campaign, said in a statement.
Generally, Mr. Obama sounded almost as cautious in remarks he thought were off-the-record as he does in on-the-record interviews. There was nothing like Mr. Romney's remark at what he believed was an off-the-record fund-raiser earlier this year that 47 percent of Americans see themselves as victims, or like Mr. Obama's remarks at what he thought was a closed fund-raiser that small-town Pennsylvania voters, bitter over their economic circumstances, "cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them." 
The White House agreed to make the interview public after the paper's editor wrote a blog post lamenting that "The Des Moines Register's publisher and I spoke with President Barack Obama this morning - but we can't tell you what he said."
The published remarks shed light on what it's like when the president of the United States asks a newspaper for its endorsement.
"Thank you, guys," the president is quoted as saying in the transcript. "I appreciate you taking the time. I want your endorsement."

After his interviewers thanked him, Mr. Obama said: "You'll feel better when you give it. All right? Bye-bye."

HEADLINE: Keeping Cash on Hand, Just in Case

BYLINE: ANN CARRNS


HIGHLIGHT: The recent cyberattacks on big American banks raise the question: Is it a good idea to hide some cash at home, just in case? 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, I joked in a postthat interest rates were so low on savings accounts that it might make sense to store cash under your mattress -- or at least somewhere safe in your home.
But the recent "denial of service" attacks on big banks in the United States that temporarily blocked some customers from using their online accounts got us at Bucks wondering again: Is having some cash on hand, in case of an extended outage, a good idea? And how much is reasonable?
The attacks, which struck a half-dozen large banks, including Bank of America and Chase, last month and, more recently, additional banks like Capital One, affected the banks' online accounts only. The banks' mobile banking applications and telephone banking systems, as well as their automatic-teller machines, weren't affected. So customers could still get cash from the A.T.M.'s.
Mark Pipitone, a spokesman for Bank of America, had this to say in an e-mail: "It's important to point out that most of our customers experienced no difficulties on 9/18. Our other channels, including mobile banking, banking centers and A.T.M.'s, were available and unaffected."
Chester Wisniewski, senior security adviser at the electronic security firm Sophos, said the A.T.M. networks that are run by the major banks are less vulnerable to cyberattackers because they are largely private systems that aren't exposed to the Internet. "Is it likely that they could impact those A.T.M. networks? Largely, no," he said.
Some private-label A.T.M.'s, like those in gas stations or convenient stores, might, in theory, be subject to similar, if less high-tech, "denial of service" attacks because they sometimes use telephone lines to reach their networks. So an organized attack could conceivably work by tying up phone lines, just as Internet attacks tie up Web sites by flooding them with traffic and slowing them so much that regular customers can't use them.
So what about hiding some cash at home? I personally don't do it, even though there are now clever gadgets, like fake electrical outlets, that help make hiding places less obvious. I can barely remember to keep cash in my wallet for everyday purchases; never mind hoarding piles of it for some unlikely catastrophe.
But Mr. Wisniewski said that especially since the attacks of 9/11, he is a proponent of having cash on hand, and he often travels with as much as $1,000 in his wallet. He doesn't like to say where he keeps it at his house, for obvious reasons, but he says he wants to have enough available to cover costs like food and transportation for a week or two, if necessary. (He's also a diabetic, so he likes to have two months of his medication on hand, too.) How much you feel safe keeping around is up to you, he said. "It all depends on your personal level of paranoia."
One caveat about keeping it at home, he said, is that "the better you are at hiding it, the more likely you are to forget where it is."
The major banks we contacted dodged the cash-on-hand question. They generally would prefer, after all, that you keep your cash with them.
Wells Fargo and Chase referred me to tips from the , which largely focused on advice like using antivirus software on your computer and strong online passwords.
Citibank didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
Have the recent denial-of-service attacks caused you to change your banking habits? How so?

HEADLINE: Obama's Aura of Defeat

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: Why he seems like he's losing even though he might still be on his way to the narrowest of wins. 

 BODY:
In an argument that was echoed and amplified around the liberal twittersphere yesterday, New York's Jonathan Chait made the case that the Romney campaign has bluffed the press into covering the last two weeks of the campaign as though Obama's losing. Like George W. Bush in 2000, who famously (and probably foolishly) campaigned in California to lend himself an air of inevitability in the closing days of the campaign, Team Romney's current brash confidence is designed to persuade the media to overlook the underlying numbers that still point to an advantage for the incumbent. And it's working, Chait argues: The "widespread perception that Romney is pulling ahead," he writes, "is Romney's campaign suckering the press corps with a confidence game."
I agree with Chait that the numbers still show Obama with a slightly clearer path than Romney to an (excruciatingly narrow) electoral college victory. But if you're looking for a reason (besides, of course, the national polling showing an ever-so-slight Romney edge) why the media narrative has tilted toward the Republicans over the last week or so, I think the Romney campaign's guarantee of victory has mattered much less than the Obama campaign's recent aura of defeat.
Losing campaigns have a certain feel to them: They go negative hard, try out new messaging very late in the game, hype issues that only their core supporters are focused on, and try to turn non-gaffes and minor slip-ups by their opponents into massive, election-turning scandals. Think of John McCain's desperate hope that elevating Joe the Plumber would change the shape of the 2008 race, and you have the template for how tin-eared and desperate a losing presidential campaign often sounds - and ever since the first debate cost Obama his air of inevitability, he and his surrogates have sounded more like McCain did with Joe the Plumber than like a typical incumbent president on his way to re-election. A winning presidential campaign would not normally be hyping non-issues like Big Bird and "binders full of women" in its quest for a closing argument, or rolling out a new spin on its second-term agenda with just two weeks left in the race, or pushing so many advertising chips into dishonest attacks on its rival's position on abortion. A winning presidential campaign would typically be talking about the issues that voters cite as most important - jobs, the economy, the deficit - rather than trying to bring up Planned Parenthood and PBS at every opportunity. A winning presidential campaign would not typically have coined the term "Romnesia," let alone worked it into their candidate's speeches.
Now this is not a normal re-election campaign. When incumbent president win, they usually expand their original majorities, but barring a completely unexpected polling shift, Obama's 2008 majority will shrink no matter what. He's been running a heavily negative campaign from the beginning, and the late-game approach has only accentuated aspects of the White House's strategy (the focus on social issues, the quest for "shiny objects" - hey, bayonets! - to change the subject from the economy, etc.) that have been present all along. What the press has read as signs of "Joe the Plumber"-esque desperation over the last few weeks may not be signs of an impending defeat; it may just be the way that Obama has to win, if win he does. But if so, it won't look like the winning re-election campaigns we've seen in the recent past, and that reporters have grown accustomed to covering.

HEADLINE: The Final Frenzy

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: In the last two weeks of the campaign, the president's theme is trust. 

 BODY:
DAVENPORT, Iowa - The "48-hour fly-around campaign marathon extravaganza," as President Obama called it, began today with his crowd-pleasing "Romnesia" routine and familiar pledges of more teachers and bridges.
But the real theme of the final two weeks, as the president and his aides made clear, is going to be trust. As in, you can't trust Mitt Romney, and you can trust me.
"Trust matters," Mr. Obama told the crowd of more than 3,000, gathered at the Mississippi Valley Fairgrounds this morning. "And here's the thing: Iowa, you know me. You know I say what I mean and mean what I say."

The plea for trust (as opposed to just a vote) is a tough sale even to the crowds of supporters he will address in Iowa, Colorado, Nevada, Florida, Virginia and Ohio today and Thursday. Most of the country is in a permanent show-me mood, burned by politicians too often, and the president's biggest challenge is stimulating enthusiasm and turnout from a disillusioned base that doesn't want to hear about Washington's gridlock.
But the Obama campaign is convinced that the public will be more alienated by Mr. Romney's wild inconsistency than by the president's own inability to fulfill all of his promises.
"You have never seen a major party nominee this close to an election try to fudge what he is going to do as president," said David Plouffe, one of the president's senior campaign aides, speaking of Mr. Romney to reporters while cruising down an Iowa interstate. "This is about the presidency of the United States of America. It's as big as anything gets. To have someone say, don't pay attention to what I said before -- these are huge things."
He added: "This is about trust. And you cannot trust Governor Romney."
Mr. Obama argues that he holds the same values he espoused 10 or 12 years ago, and has come through on the biggest promises he made in 2008: health care reform, millions of new jobs, a greener economy, an end to the Iraq war and the coming withdrawal from Afghanistan, and a focus on Al Qaeda that has significantly reduced its power.
He's hoping voters will forgive him for the growing poverty rate, the slow progress on educational achievement, and an unfulfilled immigration agenda, among other disappointments. And of course there's been no discussion at all of a few other things he used to talk about, including campaign finance reform and a reduction in gun violence.
There will be plenty of discussion of Romnesia, though, as Mr. Obama closes out his case in the swing states he desperately needs. It makes people laugh, but more importantly it helps persuade listeners that he's right on something important: he has core values that are largely unchanged, while Mr. Romney appears to have none.

HEADLINE: Oct. 23: The Virtues and Vices of Election Prediction Markets

BYLINE: NATE SILVER


HIGHLIGHT: Is the FiveThirtyEight forecast better than Intrade and other betting and prediction markets? 

 BODY:
Tuesday featured what, on the surface, would seem to be a fairly neutral day of polling. Of the 11 national polls published on Tuesday, five showed President Obama ahead, four gave a lead to Mitt Romney and two had a tied race. On average among the polls, Mr. Romney led by 0.3 percentage points, the same as his average margin in the previous edition of the same polls.
The volume of battleground state polling was light on Tuesday, and what polls there were require a few cautions. For instance, an Old Dominion University poll of Virginia put Mr. Obama seven points ahead there - but the poll had an extremely long field period, having been started in September, with about two-thirds of its interviews coming before the first presidential debate in Denver. It thus receives little weight in the forecast.
The best-looking result of the day for Mr. Romney was probably an American Research Group poll of New Hampshire, which had him up two points there - although its prior poll of the state had Mr. Romney up four points, so this isn't necessarily a sign of a change in his favor.
Similarly, a SurveyUSA poll of Ohio had Mr. Obama three points ahead there - a decent result for him, but the same as in its previous poll of the state.
Mr. Obama's chances of winning the Electoral College were down slightly in the FiveThirtyEight forecast, to 68.1 percent from 70.3 percent on Monday. Some of the decline was because of the sharp decrease in the stock market on Tuesday, which still has some influence on the FiveThirtyEight economic index. Some of the rest is because among the various national polls, the one that the model rates most highly is the national tracking poll run by ABC News and The Washington Post, and it showed a slight decline for Mr. Obama.
At the political betting market Intrade, however, traders seemed to have a much stronger opinion about the day's news. Mr. Romney's stock, which can be read as a forecast of the chance that he will win the Electoral College, rose to 45.4 percent from 39.7 over the course of the day.
The probabilistic forecasts issued by FiveThirtyEight have been quite close to Intrade and those at other trading and betting markets over the course of the election. The spread as of Tuesday night - with Intrade implying that Mr. Obama has a 55 percent chance of winning the election, and FiveThirtyEight a 68 percent chance - is much wider than usual.
However, Intrade is also something of an outlier relative to other prediction markets. Another prediction market, Betfair, gave Mr. Obama about a 63 percent chance of winning as of early Wednesday morning. The consensus of sports books, similarly, implied that he has about a 65 percent chance. These values are not significantly different from the FiveThirtyEight forecast.
The general question of whether FiveThirtyEight ought to be better than prediction and betting markets is an interesting one. I am far from an efficient-market hypothesis purist, but markets are tough to beat in most circumstances. Furthermore, the FiveThirtyEight forecasts are public information, and bettors can use our forecasts along with those of our competitors to calibrate their estimates of the outcomes.
A 2009 paper by David Rothschild found that FiveThirtyEight's forecasts were somewhat better than Intrade's over the course of the 2008 presidential election cycle. Mr. Rothschild wrote, however, that Intrade's forecasts would have outperformed FiveThirtyEight's had they been corrected to adjust for the market's tendency to overrate the chances of the trailing candidate (what is known as a

HEADLINE: In Democratic Stronghold, Ryan Puts Focus on Poverty

BYLINE: TRIP GABRIEL


HIGHLIGHT: Paul Ryan highlights an issue the Republican ticket has shied away from: poverty. 

 BODY:
Extending the Republican ticket's lean toward the middle, Representative Paul D. Ryan expressed compassion for Americans in poverty and laid out a vision for fixing the broken engine of upward mobility. 
Poverty has been all but absent from the speeches of Mr. Ryan and Mitt Romney, except when they accuse President Obama of presiding over years of increased reliance on food stamps and the highest poverty rate in a generation.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Ryan struck a notably empathetic tone toward the poor, even if he did not offer new antipoverty proposals.
"Americans are a compassionate people, and there's a consensus in this country about our fundamental obligations to society's most vulnerable," Mr. Ryan said.
He spoke in Cleveland, in Cuyahoga County, where Mr. Obama won his largest margin of any Ohio county in 2008. The Republican ticket's furious effort to wrest the state from Mr. Obama has brought Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney not only into traditional Republican strongholds, but to Democratic bastions as well, in hope of prying away voters disappointed by the president. 
Mr. Ryan cited grim numbers -- 46 million people living below the poverty line, a high school dropout rate of 50 percent in major cities.
"In this war on poverty, poverty is winning," he said. "So what is the alternative approach that Mitt Romney and I are offering?"
He made the traditional conservative case that government antipoverty programs create a "culture of dependency," implying that they be significantly scaled back. He argued that the best route out of poverty lies in an unfettered free-enterprise economy that robustly creates jobs. 
"We need a real recovery," Mr. Ryan said. "Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified and ready to deliver this recovery - because he understands how an economy works and what makes it grow."
Mr. Ryan agreed that government has a role to provide a "safety net." But he called for reforming Medicaid and the food stamp program to remove federal mandates and let states manage the antipoverty programs.
In a response, the Obama campaign cited an analysis of the House budget Mr. Ryan wrote, by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which said it would "impose extraordinary cuts in programs that serve as a lifeline for our nation's poorest and most vulnerable citizens."
"The American people understand that Mitt Romney would take us back, and no change in rhetoric in the campaign's final weeks can change that," Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said in a statement.

HEADLINE: Romney Plans Economic Speech in Iowa

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In a speech on Friday, Mr. Romney will frame the economic choice facing voters, a top adviser said. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney plans to deliver a closing speech framing the economic choice facing voters during a campaign visit to Ames, Iowa, on Friday, a top adviser to Mr. Romney's presidential campaign said on Wednesday.
The speech will come just over a week before Election Day and as voters across Iowa and several other swing states are voting early. Aides said Mr. Romney would seek to reinforce in voters the economic differences between the two presidential candidates.
Aides declined to provide details about what Mr. Romney would say in the speech. The last major address Mr. Romney delivered was focused on foreign policy, and came earlier this month at the Virginia Military Institute.
Mr. Romney had considered giving an economic speech on Thursday in Cincinnati, according to some top advisers earlier in the week. It was not immediately clear why the campaign decided on delivering the address in Iowa instead.
Both states -- Ohio and Iowa -- are seen as critical to Mr. Romney's efforts to win the White House. Public polls have consistently shown Mr. Obama to be leading in both, though by narrow margins. Aides in each campaign say the states are very close.
The economy is also doing better in the two states than the nation over all. The unemployment rate in Iowa is 5.2 percent, well below the national rate of 7.8 percent. The unemployment rate in Ohio is 7 percent.
Mr. Romney has made the economy the cornerstone of his bid to unseat President Obama, arguing that the current administration has done too little to help the country recover from the economic collapse at the end of 2008.
His campaign is pressing that issue in television ads across the battleground states. But with no more debates attracting millions of viewers, the candidates are eager to find ways to help their closing messages break through the clutter of the final weeks.
The campaign said on Wednesday that Mr. Romney planned a noon rally in Ames at Kinzler Construction Services.
An earlier version of the caption for the photo at the top of this post incorrectly stated that it was in Las Vegas. The photograph was taken in Reno.

HEADLINE: Paul Ryan's Poverty Play

BYLINE: CHARLES M. BLOW


HIGHLIGHT: Ryan's speech in Cleveland on Republican plans for the poor was perhaps the most galling attempt at self-moderation yet. 

 BODY:
Paul Ryan gave a speech on poverty and economic mobility.
No, that's not the beginning of one of those a-man-walks-into-a-bar jokes. It actually happened.
Ryan delivered the speech Wednesday in Cleveland. "In this war on poverty," he said, "poverty is winning." What he didn't say is that he and his budget have taken sides in that war - and not on the side of the poor.
This is just the latest of Mitt Romney's home-stretch attempts to kick up the dust of confusion, soften harsh rhetoric and policies, and slip into the White House.
But there's a problem: Ryan's budget was actually printed - on paper, at that. It was passed by the House in March. It can be examined and evaluated.
At one point on Wednesday, Ryan said: "Where government is entrusted with providing a safety net, Mitt Romney and I have our own vision for how to keep it strong."
Well, let's see what the paper trail says.
According to a March Report from the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities:
House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan's budget plan would get at least 62 percent of its $5.3 trillion in nondefense budget cuts over ten years (relative to a continuation of current policies) from programs that serve people of limited means. This stands a core principle of President Obama's fiscal commission on its head and violates basic principles of fairness.
At another point on Wednesday, he said: "The short of it is that there has to be a balance - allowing government to act for the common good, while leaving private groups free to do the work that only they can do."
It is funny that you should mention these "private groups," Mr. Ryan.
In a series of letters early this year the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops strongly rebuked the Ryan budget.
One letter read:
Congress faces a difficult task to balance needs and resources and allocate burdens and sacrifices. Just solutions, however, must require shared sacrifice by all, including raising adequate revenues, eliminating unnecessary military and other spending, and fairly addressing the long-term costs of health insurance and retirement programs. The House-passed budget resolution fails to meet these moral criteria. We join other Christian leaders in insisting a "circle of protection" be drawn around essential programs that serve poor and vulnerable people.
Another letter read:
At a time of great competition for agricultural resources and budgetary constraints, the needs of those who are hungry, poor and vulnerable should come before assistance to those who are relatively well off and powerful. With other Christian leaders, we urge the committee to draw a "circle of protection" around resources that serve those in greatest need and to put their needs first even though they do not have powerful advocates or great influence.
Yet another read:
The moral measure of this budget debate is not which party wins or which powerful interests prevail, but rather how those who are jobless, hungry, homeless or poor are treated. Their voices are too often missing in these debates, but they have the most compelling moral claim on our consciences and our common resources.
Ryan, of course, is Catholic.
Now, back to Ryan's speech. He said: "The truth is, Mitt and I believe in true compassion and upward mobility - and we are offering a vision based on real reforms for lifting people out of poverty."
However, Ryan's 2010 budget (promulgated when the Democrats still controlled the House) proposed eliminating the capital gains tax. According to a 2011 Congressional Research Service report, the main drivers of income inequality in this country from 1996 to 2006 were the growth of capital gains and dividends:
Capital gains and dividends were a larger share of total income in 2006 than in 1996 (especially for high-income taxpayers) and were more unequally distributed in 2006 than in 1996. Changes in capital gains and dividends were the largest contributor to the increase in the overall income inequality.
In subsequent budgets, including the most recent one that passed the House, Ryan dropped the language about eliminating the capital gains tax, but it's not clear what his plans are. In a June interview, he was asked directly if he would "lower the write-offs for 401(k)s or capital gains and dividends?"
His answer was evasive and left room for interpretation: "I don't know the answer to your question. What I do know is, we think the smart thing to do - a lot of other countries have done this - is to lower our tax rates."
Ryan also said on Wednesday:
Mitt Romney and I want to apply this idea to other anti-poverty programs, such as Medicaid and food stamps. The federal government would continue to provide the resources, but we would remove endless federal mandates and restrictions that hamper state efforts to make these programs more effective.
Very interesting, but is it accurate?
ThinkProgress points out that Ryan's budget would gut "healthcare for low-income families":
According to the Congressional Budget Office, Ryan's plan to block grant Medicaid - which provides health care to low-income individuals - would "involve reduced eligibility for Medicaid and CHIP, coverage of fewer services, lower payments to providers, or increased cost sharing by beneficiaries-all of which would reduce access to care." A new study by the Urban Institute finds that Ryan's plan would reduce Medicaid enrollment by a whopping 50 percent.
So Ryan - the man whose budget would wreak havoc on the poor - steps to a podium and pretends to be a defender of the poor.
Sometimes you just run out of words for galling.

HEADLINE: In Albany, Honoring Producers Of Alcohol

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
ALBANY -- The state capital has seen its share of drinking over the years. But rarely has the imbibing had such an imprimatur as on Wednesday, when Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo held a summit meeting devoted to alcohol.
At one point in the day, the Executive Mansion was transformed into an elaborate tasting room: nearly two dozen breweries, wineries and distilleries offered samples, and visitors were given souvenir corkscrews bearing Mr. Cuomo's name.
The reason for the gathering was to highlight one of New York State's growing industries, a bright spot at a time when the state's unemployment rate stands at 8.9 percent. Mr. Cuomo said he had seen ''phenomenal growth'' in the industry during his 22 months as governor: according to the New York State Liquor Authority, the number of farm wineries has increased 17 percent, the number of microbreweries 74 percent and the number of farm distilleries 211 percent. 
Many of the purveyors who were on hand said they were thrilled that Mr. Cuomo wanted to highlight their industry, especially given the sometimes hostile relationship with regulators.
''For four years now, I've been trying to make a connection with the governor's office,'' said Ralph J. Erenzo, a founder of Tuthilltown Spirits in the Hudson Valley, who said a state official had once likened him to a drug dealer. He called the summit meeting ''a wonderful change from the old days.''
Eager to give the industry a lift, Mr. Cuomo pledged to make a series of policy changes in response to complaints from manufacturers, many of them small breweries and wineries, about matters like licensing.
Mr. Cuomo said the state would allocate as much as $3 million to pay for new advertising for the state's producers of wine, beer and spirits. And after hearing complaints that it was difficult to find New York wines and beers at the State Fair and at the Saratoga Race Course, he said he would see to it that both the fair and the state's racetracks did a better job promoting local products.
The wine-and-beer gathering followed a playbook Mr. Cuomo set in August, with a yogurt summit meeting held to promote and assist the state's expanding industry in Greek-style yogurt. As was the case with yogurt, the mixing of alcohol and policy making proved fodder for humor.
''Is there a connection between my governorship and people drinking more?'' Mr. Cuomo said. ''I don't know. But, if they're drinking more New York product, great -- I'm happy.''
Ever the politician, Mr. Cuomo kept his own alcohol preferences close to the vest. Asked his favorite brew by a reporter, he said his only preference was ''New York beer.'' Pressed on whether he was more of ''a beer guy or a wine guy,'' he professed himself to be ''a beer and wine and hard cider and distilled products guy.''
For some, the highlight of the day came at the mansion. The tasting was large enough that the Cuomo administration produced a map that showed which alcohol purveyors could be found where.
Mr. Cuomo worked the crowd without a drink, although he occasionally stopped for a taste.
He inspected a bottle of Vintner's Vodka, a grape-based vodka produced by Finger Lakes Distilling (''He was pretty interested in what defines certain products, for instance, what makes a vodka a vodka,'' its president, Brian A. McKenzie, said), and then a bottle of bourbon whiskey from Tuthilltown Spirits (Mr. Cuomo said he had it on hand at the mansion).
And he sampled the Wet Hop IPA from the Saranac Brewery in Utica, which was made with locally grown hops.
''He loved it,'' said Fred Matt, the president of the Matt Brewing Company, which makes Saranac.
''I'm going to get him to come pick hops with us next year,'' Mr. Matt added.

HEADLINE: Illinois Debt Takes Toll, Study Finds

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
For years, Illinois has racked up billions in public debt to plug budget holes, pay overdue bills, and put money into its mismanaged pension funds. And for the people who live there, this has resulted in decrepit commuter trains and buses, thousands of unsound bridges, 200 hazardous dams and one of the most inequitable public school systems in America.
Those are the conclusions of a new examination of Illinois' finances by the State Budget Crisis Task Force, which was released Wednesday. 
The group, led by the former Federal Reserve chairman, Paul A. Volcker, and the former New York lieutenant governor, Richard Ravitch, recommended an overhaul of Illinois' budgeting practices, to make it harder to kite money from year to year and raid special-purpose funds. It also warned that tax increases may be in store.
''It would be better for Illinois to start on a long-run path to a sustainable budget than to live beyond its means for several more years and then face a sudden, painful reckoning,'' the task force said.
Illinois has the lowest credit rating of the 50 states and has America's second-biggest public debt per capita, $9,624, including state and local borrowing. Only New York State's debt is bigger, at $13,840 per capita. But Illinois has not been able to use much of the borrowed money to keep its roads, bridges and schools in good working order, because years of shoddy fiscal practices have taken a heavy toll, the report said.
''Illinois has been doing back flips on a high wire, without a net,'' the task force said in the report, which was issued in Chicago.
The task force has been examining the finances of the states out of a concern that huge fiscal problems at the state and local level are being overlooked as the election-year debate in Washington focuses on the federal debt and deficit.
Nearly two-thirds of the Illinois state government's $58 billion in direct debt consists of bonds the government issued to cover retirement payments for workers, including a $10 billion pension obligation bond that broke all previous records in 2003.
Yet despite all that borrowing, Illinois' public pension system is still in tatters. In fact, its total pension shortfall is conservatively estimated at $85 billion. Recent changes that raised the retirement age for new workers and limited the pensions that future workers can earn have not reduced the existing obligations.
The task force said that further reductions in pension benefits appear inevitable, though legally difficult, because the state has promised more than it can deliver.
While many states have heavy debt burdens and unfunded pensions, the task force warned that Illinois' problems had been building for decades and were advanced. The state was ''insolvent'' even before the financial crisis hit in 2008, the report said, but that was hard to detect because ''budget gimmicks became a standard practice.''
During the 2001 recession, for instance, the state started issuing a type of short-term debt permissible only during emergencies, and within certain limits. But even after the recession, the emergency borrowing continued. The money was used to pay overdue bills.
The task force noted that Gov. Pat Quinn had inherited the insolvency from the previous governor, Rod R. Blagojevich, who is serving a prison sentence for corruption. The $10 billion pension obligation bond was issued on Mr. Blagojevich's watch, and prosecutors said at his trial that he had used the transaction to raise campaign money in a pay-to-play scheme. The state paid a total $76.3 million in issuance fees, but the pension fund ended up worse off than ever, because bondholders were promised that the state would divert its pension contributions to pay their interest.
Mr. Quinn has been trying to push through some fiscal reforms, the report said, but he was running into intense opposition at nearly every turn. In August he warned that by 2016, Illinois will be paying more for public pensions than for education, and he called back the legislature for a special pension session. But lawmakers rejected his proposals.
Time appears to be running out for a relatively painless fiscal reform, the task force said. Besides a pension system in desperate shape, the government faces decreasing transfers from the federal government, the imminent expiration of a temporary state income tax increase that was enacted in 2011, and escalating state Medicaid costs.
''Retirees may lose their pensions as the funds dwindle, low-income and disabled people may lose their health care as costs escalate, and citizens and businesses seeking a stable environment may face steep and sudden tax increases,'' the report said.
Illinois' budget director, Jerry Stermer said at Wednesday's news conference that the state had made drastic reductions in spending, which this year would be back to about the level in 2008.
''This report is required reading for every public official in Illinois,'' Mr. Stermer said.

HEADLINE: Ukraine's Troubling Trends

BYLINE: By HILLARY RODHAM CLINTON and CATHERINE ASHTON

 BODY:
IT has been 21 years since Ukraine gained its independence from the Soviet Union. Since then, Ukrainians have made much progress on reforming and modernizing their country. Ukraine has also become an important partner on a number of pressing global and regional issues, from nuclear nonproliferation to food security and the settlement of protracted conflicts.
Ukraine now stands at an important juncture. Many of its neighbors in Central and Eastern Europe have shown the world what can be accomplished in terms of democratization and economic prosperity. Ukraine has the capacity to do the same. Important steps now have to be taken by the Ukrainian government to fulfill its full potential. 
This is especially true when it comes to strengthening democratic institutions to ensure the respect of fundamental freedoms. Ukraine's parliamentary elections at the end of this month will be an important bellwether for the state of these institutions. At the moment, there are some worrying trends, as confirmed by the latest interim report by the election observation mission of the O.S.C.E.'s Office for Democratic Institutions and Human Rights.
We are concerned about reports of the use of administrative resources to favor ruling party candidates and the difficulties several media outlets face. Similarly, we are concerned about the continuation of the practice of the Central Election Commission holding closed pre-session meetings and the lack of representation of some political parties on district and precinct election commissions. Distribution of material or financial benefits to voters is another issue that should be investigated and halted.
We regret that the convictions of opposition leaders during trials that did not meet international standards are preventing them from standing in parliamentary elections. The Ukrainian government needs to address these selective prosecutions, including the case of former Prime Minister Yulia V. Tymoshenko and other former senior officials.
The United States and the European Union are doing their part for a free and fair election, supporting election observers and helping to train election officials, encourage voter education and protect the rights of candidates and voters.
But these are not the European Union's elections or America's elections. They are Ukraine's. This is a moment when Ukraine's leaders should deliver for their citizens. They expect President Viktor F. Yanukovich and his government to address these concerns, especially to ensure that the right to political participation is upheld and to provide for fair media access for all candidates.
We know this is possible because Ukrainians have done it before. Just over two years ago, they elected a new president in what many observers consider the country's freest and fairest national election. With that contest, Ukrainians set their own high standard, a standard that should be met in this month's election.
We are also mindful of Ukraine's broader reform agenda. While some progress has been made, we hope the elections will lead to a vigorous and effective effort by the country's leaders to advance important core reforms, including the investment climate and the energy sector. Much is at stake here for Ukraine's future.
The European Union and Ukraine have completed negotiations on an ambitious Association Agreement that will provide for the country's political association and economic integration with the European Union, including by establishing a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area. It would offer Ukrainian businesses greater access to 500 million consumers in the European Union and advance Ukraine on the path toward a modern European democracy.
But the European Union will only be able to move forward with such an ambitious agenda if the democratic rights of the Ukrainian people, including freedoms of expression, political participation, association and media, are respected, the rule of law is put on strong footing, and progress is made on the overall reform agenda.
It remains deeply in our common interest to see an independent, prosperous and irreversibly democratic Ukraine that is associated with the European Union. We want to pursue deeper, mutually beneficial partnerships with Ukraine and will continue working toward a day where Ukraine will fully realize its own potential and take its place among the modern democracies of Europe.
Hillary Rodham Clinton is the U.S. secretary of state. Catherine Ashton is the high representative of the European Union for foreign affairs and security policy.

HEADLINE: Europe Trying to Catch Up in Teaching e-Business

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE

 BODY:
PARIS -- When Google announced this year that it would sponsor a chair at H.E.C. Paris, one of the most prestigious business schools in France, the news was welcomed by both academics and digital entrepreneurs.
The Google@HEC chair -- the first direct investment by the company in a business school -- is seen as a sign that Europe is finally trying to catch up with the United States in teaching digital entrepreneurship. While it is not the first European foray into this field, it comes amid the realization that universities in Europe are lagging behind their U.S. counterparts.
''We need role models for the digital economy,'' said Eloïc-Anil Peyrache, an associate dean at H.E.C. 
Dr. Peyrache said that students were becoming more interested in the subject. ''Most of this is the willingness to open up your new company, of which two-thirds is related to the Web,'' he said.
A decade ago, most of H.E.C.'s graduates would have found employment in big corporations or consulting firms, but the more recent graduates were more likely to go at it alone, he said.
The grandes écoles, the elite French schools where most corporate or government leaders are traditionally trained, have been teaching digital entrepreneurship for several years.
Business schools are seeing the urgency of building e-business curriculums and programs lest they miss out.
''In the next coming years there will be a difference in the business schools where this is worked out and those where it won't be,'' said Bernard Ramanantsoa, H.E.C.'s dean.
Essec , another grande école, started teaching ''Managing IT in a Networked World'' last year as part of its Global M.B.A. program, which is taught in both Paris and Singapore. The course combines the more traditional discipline of information technology management with e-business.
Peter O'Connor, who teaches the course at Essec, said it had been conceived to keep up with what he called the ''digitalization'' of virtually all aspects of business.
''The wide-scale acceptance of it has come in the last two or three years, as we've seen the value of having a digital strategy in vast amounts of businesses,'' Dr. O'Connor said.
A course on e-business entrepreneurship, also in its second year at Essec, is especially popular because, together with another course on business planning, it allows students to apply to the school's incubator, which provides start-ups with seed money and office space.
Professor Antonio Dávila, who heads the Entrepreneurship Department at the I.E.S.E. Business School , which has campuses around Spain, said that online commerce was by far the most popular post-graduate plan among his students.
''Digital entrepreneurship is what marketing was in the '80s and '90s and banking and consulting in the 2000s,'' he said.
Part of the appeal resulted from decreasing interest in more traditional fields because of the global economic slowdown. ''On the Internet, if you are successful in about five years, you're global,'' he said.
More business schools are using both traditional professors and outside experts who are well-versed in real-life changes.
This is the strategy that the Google@HEC chair employs. Instead of paying for a single professorship, as the word ''chair'' might suggest, Google is supplying the school with experts, both from its own ranks and from outside companies.
''What they can learn is how to actually use the practical experience of building and running an e-commerce Web site,'' said Michel Bénard, who is university relations manager at Google France.
Celine Lazorthes, an H.E.C. graduate and digital entrepreneur who now mentors students at her alma mater, said that Google's investment was a step forward.
''In France, we need to make better links with companies,'' she said.
Ms. Lazorthes thinks that students, particularly those opening H.E.C.-based start-ups, can benefit from Google's technical guidance and market data.
In Denmark, the Copenhagen Business Schools, or C.B.S., has tried to teach the subject for decades, said Jan Damsgaard, the head of the Department of IT Management.
The school was a pioneer in developing a center of electronic commerce in 1998, with a dedicated professor and a resource center, but it may have been too early for its own good. In 2005, it shut down when the dot-com bubble burst, and it never reopened.
Still, the school is considered to be on the cutting edge of including instruction on doing business online. Since last year, C.B.S. has offered a course on social media marketing. ''Nowadays it is in everything,'' said Dr. Damsgaard about e-business at C.B.S.
Still, the United States is far ahead in promoting Internet companies.
''If you are trying to prepare business students for the world and you are not taking into account digital technology, you are failing in your mission,'' said Andrew McAfee , a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Dr. McAfee, who teaches and researches the business effects of information technology, said U.S. schools were better placed to attract outside experts, since most of them worked in the country.
''It is easy for us to bring people into class,'' he said. ''High-tech is mainly centered in the States.''
Mr. O'Connor of Essec said that the United States was several years ahead of Europe and Asia, mostly because of the presence of venture capital and the positive attitude toward risk-taking, and even failure, in e-business in the United States.
''There is such a concentration of talent, money and facilities in Silicon Valley that it is going to be successful for a very long time,'' he said.
However, he was optimistic about transferring that expertise across the Atlantic and around the world.
As e-businesses gain importance in places like Russia, China and India, the global expertise and demand will no longer be focused in the United States. Business school curriculums will follow the trend, he explained.
''The amount we're trailing is definitely reducing rapidly and will disappear,'' he said of European business schools.

HEADLINE: A Master's Degree by Way of the Trading Floor

BYLINE: By D. D. GUTTENPLAN

 BODY:
LONDON -- David Dukes had a problem. For many years he worked as a futures trader, buying and selling complicated financial instruments tied to movements in the price of stocks and commodities in the United States and government bonds across Europe. Like Sherman McCoy, the bond trader at the heart of Tom Wolfe's novel ''The Bonfire of the Vanities,'' successful traders can earn enough money to live like ''Masters of the Universe.''
As the headlines about Kweku Adoboli , the former UBS trader accused of causing losses of $2.3 billion, show, however, the fall from grace can be dramatic. 
After several years as a trader, Mr. Dukes was put in charge of his employer's training and recruitment efforts. The company, Futex, had long offered ambitious university graduates an intensive 12-week training course with the promise that the best-performing recruits would be able to continue trading with the company's backing -- and its money. Futex also had an apprenticeship program for people who wished to skip university and get onto the trading floor more quickly, after a year of training. Both training routes are popular. ''We get somewhere in the region of 200 applicants a week,'' Mr. Dukes said.
The problem, he said, is that while the company can test applicants for mathematical ability and knowledge about the markets, ''it's very difficult to say how people will perform once they start trading with real money.''
Futex is a proprietary trading business, meaning that employees trade on the company's account rather than on behalf of clients. They keep a share of their profits that starts at 50 percent and can rise to 90 percent for those who are most successful. ''On an exceptional day, you can make six figures,'' Mr. Dukes said.
But a run of bad trades can wipe out the company's profit. ''We've found that in order to maintain an edge over the market in today's world, an increase in academic knowledge is required,'' he said.
Mr. Dukes took his problem to the University of Hertfordshire , which responded by offering to develop a Master of Science degree in proprietary trading. It is a one-year course for those who choose to study full time, but ''students can also dip in and out,'' Quintin McKellar, vice chancellor of the university, said in an interview.
The first group of 20 students began classes on Oct. 1; a second intake will start in January.
Tuition for the course is £16,000, or about $25,600. ''There's no difference in fees from any of our other master's degree courses,'' Dr. McKellar said. However, instead of traveling to the university's campus in Hatfield, which is just north of London, students will ''spend a lot of time on the trading floor, with actual traders,'' he said.
Dr. McKellar, who was formerly the dean of the Royal Veterinary College in London, said that the University of Hertfordshire was increasingly seeking opportunities to offer what he called ''corporate degrees,'' partly as a response to cuts in government financing.
''We have a subsidiary company called Exemplas that began as a way of helping small- and medium-sized businesses,'' Dr. McKellar said. ''That work used to be funded by government, but funding for that sort of thing has dried up.''
''The whole ethos behind a corporate degree is that, instead of forcing the business to choose from courses we already offer, it lets the business act as the senior partner,'' he added.
Mr. Dukes, the trader, agreed. ''We were able to cherry-pick the elements we wanted,'' he said.
The first 14 weeks of the course are spent primarily on the company's electronic trading floor, either at its headquarters in Woking, southwest of London, or at its office in London's financial district. The next 14-week module is devoted to classes on markets, financial institutions and policy, followed by another 14 weeks learning about the global economy.
''We want traders who can understand the impact of macroeconomic events on share prices,'' Mr. Dukes said. ''They need to understand the impact of the sovereign debt crisis on bond prices in different currencies, and the possible influence of decisions made by the European Central Bank, governments or the European Commission.''
Students spend the final seven weeks of the course working on a thesis based on data they have gathered during the course.
''Futex has made a commitment to hire some of the graduates,'' Dr. McKellar said. He added that students in the university's corporate degree programs ''have a slightly better record of graduating with first-class honors'' -- the highest academic achievement -- than other students.
As to the risk that Hertfordshire trading graduates might end up in the wrong kind of headlines, Jonathan Easter, chair of the university's finance and economics department, said: ''The program is designed to help graduates develop the ability to build sustainable, successful positions.''
''This is vital for them, not least because ultimately they will be trading on their own account, not with client money,'' Mr. Easter said. ''The program will therefore ensure that graduates are aware of all relevant regulatory controls, and Futex will closely monitor behavior and trades of all graduates who go on to work for them.''

HEADLINE: Data Hints at China Manufacturing Rebound

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- Conditions in the Chinese manufacturing sector improved slightly in October, according to a survey released Wednesday, underpinning the view that the world's second-largest economy after that of the United States had at least stabilized in recent weeks.
The purchasing managers' index published by the British bank HSBC rallied to 49.1 points in October -- a marked improvement from the 47.9 recorded for September and the firmest result in three months. Closely watched by analysts, the preliminary reading of the HSBC index provides one of the earliest insights into how the Chinese economy is faring each month. A final version of the October figure is set to be published Nov. 1, when a separate measure compiled by the Chinese authorities is also due for release. 
Analysts said the improvement in the October reading reflected the effect of a steady drip of stimulus measures introduced by Beijing. A gradual improvement in overseas demand in recent months also has helped. A subindex measuring new export orders, for example, rose to a five-month high of 47.3 points as orders for the Christmas season came in.
The reading provided a ''positive sign,'' and ''further evidence of a pickup for the fourth quarter,'' economists at Australia & New Zealand Bank in Hong Kong wrote in a research note. At the same time, however, the October number was still below 50 points -- the level that separates expansion from contraction, showing that the companies polled in the survey still faced considerable challenges.
Lackluster overseas demand for Chinese exports and moves last year by Beijing to dampen the rapid pace of growth and cool inflation and a red-hot property market have slowed down the Chinese economy this year. The health of the important property sector, in particular, continues to worry some analysts. They fear that many developments that were rushed out when the Chinese authorities engineered a major stimulus program in late 2008 and 2009 may ultimately go sour.
Reflecting a widespread recognition that future economic expansion is likely to be much more subdued than in the past, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank both lowered their economic growth forecasts for China this month.
The I.M.F., for example, said it expected the Chinese economy to expand by 7.8 percent this year -- a pace that easily outpaces the United States or Europe, but falls short of China's 9.3 percent expansion in 2011, and its 10.4 percent growth rate in 2010.
For next year, the I.M.F. forecasts 8.2 percent growth in gross domestic product -- in other words, a slight pickup from this year, but no return to the double-digit growth rates of the years before the global financial crisis. Economic data for September, and the HSBC index for October, underlined that view, showing that the pace of growth appeared to have stabilized and could pick up in the coming months.
Thanks to a series of recent measures to bolster the economy, in the fourth quarter of this year, ''growth has likely bottomed out and is headed for a gradual recovery,'' Qu Hongbin, chief China economist at HSBC, wrote.
Over the past year, the authorities have loosened lending constraints for banks in a bid to encourage more loans and have stepped up infrastructure project approvals. Two small interest rate cuts in June and July also aimed to improve growth.
The ongoing financial turmoil in Europe and the risks associated with the looming ''fiscal cliff'' in the United States, however, mean that the outlook remains ''challenging,'' Mr. Qu said.
Released Wednesday, a purchasing managers' index for manufacturing and services businesses in the euro zone, compiled by Markit, an economic data firm, underlined his point: The preliminary reading for October fell to a 40-month low of 45.8 points, from 46.1 in September, confounding expectations for a slight rise.

HEADLINE: Brooklyn Lures A Second Team To New Arena

BYLINE: By DAVID W. CHEN and JOSEPH BERGER; Reporting was contributed by Charles V. Bagli, Ken Belson, Jeff Z. Klein and Michael Schwirtz.

 BODY:
Brooklyn, which has been without a professional sports team for half a century, is suddenly home to two after the announcement on Wednesday that the New York Islanders would leave suburban Nassau County for the new Barclays Center in 2015.
The announced move of the hockey franchise, which won four Stanley Cups a generation ago but in recent decades has become synonymous with losing, was heralded by city leaders as an unexpectedly rapid vindication of the controversial development project that opened last month with the promise of transforming the heart of the borough.
The 25-year deal still requires approval by the National Hockey League and would essentially double the number of professional sports games at the $1 billion arena each year. The arena is already home to the Brooklyn Nets, which relocated from New Jersey and is scheduled to host its first regular-season game next week.
Along with an already rich slate of concerts and other events, including recent sold-out appearances by Jay-Z and Barbra Streisand, this suddenly flush calendar has accentuated fears of those in the surrounding brownstone neighborhoods that the community could be overwhelmed. 
Though other developers of sports sites have watched the ''if you build it they will come'' approach end in disappointment, the Barclays Center suddenly finds itself one of nine arenas nationwide that showcases teams from both the National Basketball Association and the N.H.L. One of the other arenas, of course, is Madison Square Garden, home to the rival Knicks and Rangers, which means New York City will soon have six major professional teams across four boroughs.
''Not long ago, I think it's fair to say the idea of a big league sports team coming to Brooklyn was considered little more than a pipe dream,'' Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said at a news conference, flanked by Charles B. Wang, the Islanders owner; Bruce C. Ratner, the developer of the Barclays Center; and Gary Bettman, the N.H.L. commissioner, among others.
The team vowed not to change its name, keeping ''New York'' in place of the trendy ''Brooklyn'' label. But the symbolism of its move from the suburbs to the heart of the city's largest borough was underscored by the apparent need to update the team logo, which features the outline of nearly all of Long Island, but cuts off Brooklyn and Queens.
Mr. Ratner, who still owns a majority stake in the arena, started meeting with Mr. Wang six or seven years ago, usually in the team owner's favorite Chinese restaurant, the Orient, in Bethpage. The talks picked up in earnest several months ago, but Mr. Wang, who attended Brooklyn Technical High School, did not make up his mind until he saw the arena.
Mr. Ratner predicted that the heavy dose of sports, especially in winter, would not crowd out entertainment events like the recent concerts. ''Like Carnegie Hall,'' he said, ''it will be a place where there's great stuff always.''
Details of the deal were not made public, but people involved in the talks said there were no financial incentives involved, nor any involvement from the city government. A preliminary analysis by the city's Economic Development Corporation did estimate, however, that the Islanders deal could generate $175 million in economic activity each season. For years now, Mr. Wang has been eager to upgrade or replace the team's aging home, which opened in 1972, and is now one of the older arenas in professional hockey. Last August, Nassau County voters, who pay among the highest local taxes in the nation, soundly defeated a contentious proposal to spend $400 million to overhaul the arena. The team publicly toyed with moving to another city with a modern arena, including Quebec City, Kansas City and Seattle.
The Islanders' current lease requires them to play at Nassau Coliseum through the 2014-15 season, and Mr. Wang said at a news conference that the team would honor that agreement.
For a glorious stretch, the Islanders rose quickly from cellar-dweller to powerhouse, and dwarfed their bitter rivals, the Rangers, whose Stanley Cup drought -- which eventually ended in 1994 -- was hockey's answer to the World Series-challenged Red Sox or Cubs. Led by Hall of Famers like Mike Bossy, Bryan Trottier and Denis Potvin, they won four straight Stanley Cups from 1980 to 1983 and reached the 1984 Cup final, a run that encompassed 19 consecutive series victories, still a league record.
Then came a long, steady decline. Attendance plummeted. Even the front office became an embarrassment: one owner, John Spano, was convicted of fraud, because it turned out he did not have enough money to buy the team.
On Wednesday, some Nassau officials seemed caught off guard by the Islanders' departure, setting off a round of sniping between political opponents.
''This is a sad day for Nassau County and unfortunately another crippling hit to our local economy,'' Kevan Abrahams, the county's Democratic leader, said in a statement. ''To lose the Islanders, Nassau's only professional sports franchise, is an epic failure of leadership at all levels.''
But Edward P. Mangano, the Republican county executive, blamed his rivals for blocking his efforts to overhaul the Nassau Coliseum and the 77-acre Nassau County Hub that surrounds it. ''No one has done more to retain the New York Islanders than my administration,'' he wrote on Twitter. ''It's sad and unfortunate that political opponents chose to oppose my plan and instead continued to support the Culture of NO on Long Island.''
It is unclear what effect the arrival of the Islanders might have on the Rangers, with their fiercely loyal fan base, or the New Jersey Devils, who play in Newark. Both teams had supported the idea of a new Islanders arena on Long Island.
The Rangers are owned by Madison Square Garden, which broadcasts the Islanders' games. And the Rangers are in the midst of a three-year renovation of the Garden and have been steadily raising ticket prices. So any extra income would probably offset any loss of fans who might, for whatever reason, switch allegiances (just as some Knicks fans have threatened to support the Nets after the team declined to re-sign Jeremy Lin).
The Barclays Center is not ideally suited for hockey -- a hockey rink is bigger than a basketball court -- and the size of the arena's interior was reduced to pare costs. As a result, the arena has room for 14,500 seats for hockey, far smaller than most other hockey stadiums and 3,500 seats fewer than are available for Nets games. The Islanders' current home, the Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum in Uniondale, has a capacity of about 16,250, but the team's average home attendance last season was 13,191.
Still, the team's move to Brooklyn leaves many unanswered questions, especially for a contingent of steadfast opponents of the development project -- which includes a plan for 15 residential towers over the next 25 years and possibly an office building or hotel -- who view it as a publicly subsidized land grab that featured a string of broken promises and threatens to overwhelm the adjacent neighborhoods.
''My longtime concerns with the Barclays Arena and Atlantic Yards project continue to remain -- living wage jobs, affordable housing and quality of life,'' said Councilwoman Letitia James of central Brooklyn. ''I look forward to reviewing this deal with my colleagues.''
Current Islanders season-ticket holders will have first rights to buy tickets in Brooklyn. Within minutes of the announcement, Barclays was selling them.
While some fans regarded the move as a betrayal, others took some consolation in the fact that the team would remain on the island after which it was named, accessible by the Long Island Rail Road.
One rabid Islanders fan, Harris Peskin, 21, a student at Cardozo Law School who lives in Greenpoint, came out to the arena with an Islanders hockey shirt when he learned the announcement was made. He described the day as bittersweet, because his earliest memories, he said, were of going to the coliseum and ''smelling popcorn and talking to my father about the dynasty.''
Mayor Bloomberg, who is not known for being much of a sports fan, did try to bolster enthusiasm. The mayor suggested that, perhaps, all the Islanders needed to change their fortunes was a change of venue.
''Brooklyn, I'm sure, will help them get their mojo back,'' he said. ''And no, 'Mojo' is not the name of a hip new Brooklyn neighborhood.''

There are plans to add more seats for the hockey configuration. (Sources: SHoP Architects and Aecom) (B15)

HEADLINE: Prison May Be the Next Stop On a Gold Currency Journey

BYLINE: By ALAN FEUER

 BODY:
MALIBU, Calif. -- High above the cliff tops and the beach bars, up a winding mountain road, in a borrowed house on someone else's ranch, an unusual criminal is waiting for his fate.
His name is Bernard von NotHaus, and he is a professed ''monetary architect'' and a maker of custom coins found guilty last spring of counterfeiting charges for minting and distributing a form of private money called the Liberty Dollar.
Described by some as ''the Rosa Parks of the constitutional currency movement,'' Mr. von NotHaus managed over the last decade to get more than 60 million real dollars' worth of his precious metal-backed currency into circulation across the country -- so much, and with such deep penetration, that the prosecutor overseeing his case accused him of ''domestic terrorism'' for using them to undermine the government.
Of course, if you ask him what caused him to be living here in exile, waiting with the rabbits for his sentence to be rendered, he will give a different account of what occurred. 
''This is the United States government,'' he said in an interview last week. ''It's got all the guns, all the surveillance, all the tanks, it has nuclear weapons, and it's worried about some ex-surfer guy making his own money? Give me a break!''
The story of Mr. von NotHaus, from his beginnings as a hippie, can sound at times as if Ken Kesey had been paid in marijuana to write a script on spec for Representative Ron Paul. At 68, Mr. von NotHaus faces more than 20 years in prison for his crimes, and this decisive chapter of his tale has come, coincidentally, at a moment when his obsessions of 40 years -- monetary policy, dollar depreciation and the Federal Reserve Bank -- have finally found their place in the national discourse.
A native of Kansas City, Mr. von NotHaus first became enticed by making money while living with his companion, Talena Presley, without a car or electric power in a commune of like-minded dropouts in a nameless village on the Big Island in Hawaii. It was 1974, and Mr. von NotHaus, 30 and ignorant of economics, experienced ''an epiphany,'' he said, which resulted in the writing of a 20-page financial manifesto titled ''To Know Value.''
In it he described his conviction that money has a moral aspect and that any loss in its value will cause a corresponding loss in social and political values. It was only three years after President Richard M. Nixon had removed the country from the gold standard, and Mr. von NotHaus, a gold enthusiast, began buying gold from local jewelers and selling it to his friends.
One day, he recalled, ''we were all sitting around thinking, 'Wow, we ought to do something with this gold.' And I said: 'Yeah, we could make coins. People love coins. We could have our own money!' ''
Within a year, he had established the Royal Hawaiian Mint, a private -- not royal -- producer of collectible coins. Hitchhiking to a library in the county seat of Hilo, he said, he looked up ''minting'' in the encyclopedia and soon was turning out gold and silver medallions with images of volcanos and the Kona Coast.
So went the better part of 20 years. Then came 1991, which saw the emergence of a successful local currency in Ithaca, N.Y., called the Ithaca Hour. The 1990s were a time of great ferment in the local-money world with activists and academics writing books and papers, like Judith Shelton's ''Money Meltdown.'' Mr. von NotHaus, traveling with his sons, Random and Xtra, to adventuresome locations, like Machu Picchu, read these seminal works.
''I had been working on it since 1974,'' he testified at his federal trial in North Carolina. ''It was time to do something.''
The Constitution grants to Congress the power ''to coin money'' and to ''regulate the Value thereof'' -- but it does not explicitly grant an exclusive right to do such things. There are legal-tender laws that regulate production of government currency and counterfeiting laws that prohibit things like ''uttering'' gold or silver coins ''for use as current money.''
Mr. von NotHaus claims he never meant the Liberty Dollar to be used as legal tender. He says he created it as ''a private voluntary currency'' for those conducting business outside the government's purview. His guiding metaphor is the relationship between the Postal Service and FedEx. ''What happened in the FedEx model,'' he testified, ''is that they'' -- a private company offering services the government did not -- ''brought competition to the post office.''
To introduce the Liberty Dollar in 1998, Mr. von NotHaus moved from Hawaii to Evansville, Ind., where he joined forces with Jim Thomas, who for several years had been publishing a magazine called Media Bypass, whose pages were filled with conspiracy theories and interviews with militia members, even Timothy McVeigh.
Working from the magazine's office, Mr. von NotHaus lived in a mobile home and promoted his nascent currency to ''patriot groups'' on Mr. Thomas's mailing list while reaching an agreement with Sunshine Minting Inc., in Idaho, to produce the Liberty Dollar. His marketing scheme was simple: he drove around the country in a Cadillac trying to persuade local merchants like hair salons and restaurants to use his coins and to offer them as change to willing customers.
Banks, of course, did not accept his money; however, to ensure that it found its way only into hands that wanted to use it, Mr. von NotHaus placed a toll-free number and a URL address on the currency he produced. If people mistakenly got hold of it, they could mail it back to Evansville and receive its equivalent in actual dollar bills.
Now jump ahead to 2004. A detective in Asheville, N.C., learned one day that a client of a credit union had to tried to pass a ''fake coin'' at one its local branches. An investigation determined that some business acquaintances of Mr. von NotHaus were, court papers say, allied with the sovereign citizens' movement, an antigovernment group.
Federal agents infiltrated the Liberty Dollar outfit as well as its educational arm, Liberty Dollar University.
In 2006, with millions of the coins in circulation in more than 80 cities, the United States Mint sent Mr. von NotHaus a letter advising that the use of his currency ''as circulating money'' was a federal crime.
He ignored this advice,and in 2007, federal agents raided the offices in Evansville, seizing, among other things, copper dollars embossed with the image of Mr. Paul.
Two years later, Mr. von NotHaus was arrested on fraud and counterfeiting charges, accused of having used the Liberty Dollar's parent corporation -- Norfed, the National Organization for Repeal of the Federal Reserve -- to mount a conspiracy against the United States.
At his federal trial, witnesses testified to the Liberty Dollar's criminal similitude to standard American coins. They said his coins included images of Lady Liberty and cheekily reversed ''In God We Trust'' to ''Trust in God.'' Then again, his coins were made of real gold and silver, as American coins are not, and came in different sizes and unusual denominations of $10 and $20.
In his own defense, Mr. von NotHaus testified about a ''philanthropic mission'' to combat devaluation with a currency based on precious metals and asserted that he was not involved in ''a radical armed offense against the government or their money.''
It was, of course, to no avail; and in 2011, a jury found him guilty after a 90-minute deliberation.
These days, Mr. von NotHaus paces shoeless in a mansion, in the hills above the ocean, that was lent to him by a friend. His sentencing has yet to be scheduled, and this leaves time for reflection. He feeds the hummingbirds outside his window. He reads books on fiat currency. He is even writing a book -- on the gold standard, of course.
''The thing that fires me up the most,'' he will say, ''is this is what happens: When money goes bad, people go crazy. Do you know why? Because they can't exist without value. Value is intrinsic in man.''

HEADLINE: Market Slides as Investors Ponder Corporate Reports

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks ended lower for a second day on Wednesday, as investors reacted to another round of underwhelming corporate results and the Federal Reserve said it would stick to its stimulus plan until the job market improves. 
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index has lost 3.6 percent over the last five sessions, hurt by weak earnings outlooks and revenue shortfalls from large multinational companies. The index is now down 3.9 percent from its closing high of 1,465.77 set on Sept. 14.
Boeing, the aerospace and defense company, bucked the trend with a more optimistic outlook, but it could not break away from the rest of the market as it was pulled into negative territory in the afternoon. Shares of the company, a Dow component, fell 0.2 percent to $72.71.
The Fed, in its latest policy statement, said it would keep buying $40 billion in mortgage-backed debt each month to keep interest rates low until the job picture becomes better.
''Unemployment is staying where it is, new jobs are minimal, and the Fed is staying defensive,'' Allan Flader, a financial adviser at RBC Wealth Management in Phoenix, said. ''I would be surprised if they went to a neutral stance anytime soon.''
On Sept. 13, the Fed disclosed a third round of economic stimulus, or quantitative easing, known as QE3.
The Dow Jones industrial average shed 25.19 points, or 0.19 percent, to 13,077.34 at the close. The Standard & Poor's 500 index dropped 4.36 points, or 0.31 percent, to 1,408.75. The Nasdaq composite index slipped 8.77 points, or 0.29 percent, to end at 2,981.70.
Among the day's gainers, Facebook, which reported a surprising gain in mobile advertising revenue in its quarterly results on Tuesday, gained $3.73, or 19.13 percent, to $23.23, its biggest one-day gain since it began trading in May. Dow Chemical, the nation's largest chemical maker, said late Tuesday it would cut 5 percent of its work force and shut 20 plants to counter a slowing global economy. Its stock jumped 4.7 percent to $29.88.
But shares of the movie rental company Netflix tumbled 11.9 percent to $60.12 after it cut its subscriber forecast, and shares of the data-storage equipment maker EMC fell 0.9 percent to $24.46 after it cut its full-year outlook.
Homebuilders' stocks ranked among the session's best performers. An index of housing stocks shot up 0.7 percent. Shares of PulteGroup, one of the largest homebuilders, gained 0.8 percent to $17.45.
Sales of new single-family homes in the United States soared 5.7 percent in September to the highest in nearly two and a half years, providing more evidence that the housing market's recovery is improving.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 7/32, to 98 16/32, and the yield rose to 1.79 percent from 1.76 percent late Tuesday.

HEADLINE: U.S. Accuses Bank of America Of a 'Brazen' Mortgage Fraud

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
9:34 p.m. | Updated
Five years after the housing market crumbled, government officials are still trying to assign blame for the problems that fueled the mortgage boom and bust.
On Wednesday, federal prosecutors in New York took aim at Bank of America. They accused it of carrying out a scheme, started by its Countrywide Financial unit, that defrauded government-backed mortgage agencies by churning out loans at a rapid pace without proper controls. In a civil suit, prosecutors seek to collect at least $1 billion in penalties from the bank as compensation for the behavior that they say forced taxpayers to guarantee billions in bad loans.
Financial firms have been battling chaotic - and at times redundant - litigation related to the mortgage mess. The cases have come from a patchwork of federal agencies, state officials and shareholder suits, some of which have been resolved in multibillion-dollar settlements.
"They never know who's going to be coming after them next," said Dan Hurson, a former federal prosecutor who now defends securities cases. "There's no central traffic cop." 
Still, the public has been frustrated with the limited number of criminal actions that have been filed since the financial crisis. Few cases have taken aim at top executives. Even in the latest case against Bank of America, no company officials were sued as part of the complaint. Angelo R. Mozilo, the former chief executive of Countrywide Financial, never faced criminal charges but did agree in 2010 to pay $67.5 million to settle a civil fraud case brought by the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Mr. Hurson said that the government had yet to overcome the notion that federal authorities were reluctant to pursue the top rungs of Wall Street. The criminal actions to come from the crisis, he noted, have focused on "small-time operators."
The government, however, has contended that it has aggressively pursued mortgage fraud. As the legal deadline approaches for filing crisis-related cases, President Obama formed a mortgage task force to investigate wrongdoing. The unit recently announced its first case, taking action against JPMorgan Chase over mortgage deals created by Bear Stearns, the firm that JPMorgan bought during the crisis.
The legal problems for Bank of America, however, have taken a deeper financial toll, costing the bank billions in write-downs and settlements. Much of its problems stem from its takeover of Countrywide Financial, once the nation's largest mortgage lender. The bank also struck a $2.4 billion deal in September to settle a class-action lawsuit over shareholder claims that it misled investors about the 2009 purchase of Merrill Lynch.
In the lawsuit on Wednesday, the Justice Department attacked a home loan program known as the "hustle," which the bank inherited from Countrywide in 2008 and kept alive through 2009.
Prosecutors say the venture was a symbol of Wall Street's slipshod standards during the mortgage bubble. According to the lawsuit, Countrywide rubber-stamped mortgage loans to risky borrowers and passed them on to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, the two government-controlled mortgage financial giants that guaranteed the loans. The two entities were ultimately stuck with heavy losses and a glut of foreclosed properties.
"The fraudulent conduct alleged in today's complaint was spectacularly brazen in scope," Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan, said in a statement. "This lawsuit should send another clear message that reckless lending practices will not be tolerated."
Mr. Bharara filed the civil suit along with the inspector general of the Federal Housing Finance Agency, which oversees Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The government watchdog for the bank bailout program, the special inspector general for the Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, also joined the complaint.
In a statement, a Bank of America spokesman said the bank "has stepped up and acted responsibly to resolve legacy mortgage matters; the claim that we have failed to repurchase loans from Fannie Mae is simply false." The spokesman, Lawrence Grayson, added, "At some point, Bank of America can't be expected to compensate every entity that claims losses that actually were caused by the economic downturn."
The case builds on a broader federal crackdown of Wall Street that continues years after the onset of the crisis. In a last-ditch effort to hold financial firms accountable, Mr. Bharara this month sued Wells Fargo over questionable mortgage deals.
The assertions in the Bank of America suit, however, do not shed much new light on the mortgage mess. The Federal Housing Finance Agency last year sued 17 big banks over losses sustained by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac over different mortgage-related products. The twin mortgage finance companies, also bailed out by taxpayers in 2008 and still controlled by the government, continue to push firms like Bank of America to repurchase billions of dollars in bad loans.
The flurry of litigation, which comes on the cusp of the presidential election, has caused some on Wall Street to question whether the effort is rooted in political motivations.
Other white-collar lawyers say the complaints rehash old claims put forth by private investors. JPMorgan says that the government urged it to buy Bear Stearns, a defense that does not apply to Bank of America, which acquired Countrywide as part of an aggressive expansion effort.
Still, a lawyer close to the Bank of America case, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the case was continuing, argued that the bank had already repaid Fannie Mae for some of the soured loans in question. Other loans, this person argued, were never before disputed by Fannie Mae.
The lawsuit threatens to impose steep fines on the bank. The Justice Department filed the case under the False Claims Act, which could provide for triple the damages suffered by Fannie and Freddie, a penalty that could reach more than $3 billion.
The act also provides an avenue for a Countrywide whistle-blower, Edward J. O'Donnell, to cash in. Under the act, the government can piggyback on accusations he filed in a lawsuit that was kept under seal until now.
Mr. O'Donnell, who lives in Pennsylvania, was an executive vice president for Countrywide before leaving the company in 2009. The government's case in part hinges on the credibility of his claims.
In the 46-page lawsuit, prosecutors contend that Countrywide abandoned its lending standards in 2007 with the creation of the "hustle" program. Short for "HSSL," or "High-Speed Swim Lane," the program adopted the motto "move forward, never backward," prosecutors said, citing Countrywide documents.
With the goal of generating a high number of loans, Countrywide tore down internal controls known as tollgates that were in place to slow the mortgage process and root out risky borrowers. The firm at one point removed trained underwriters from the loan process, opting instead to rely on "unqualified and inexperienced" loan processors.
At times, prosecutors claim, loan processors crossed a legal line. Some "repeatedly did manipulate" loan forms, jotting down higher incomes for borrowers so they would qualify for Fannie Mae's standards.
By early 2008, the lax standards started to show. More than a third of the unit's loans were defective, a significant jump over the industry standard of about 5 percent.
Despite the poor performance, the bank sold the loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and "concealed the defect rates and continued the hustle," the prosecutor said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Oil Refining's Fortunes Rise

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS

 BODY:
THREE RIVERS, Tex. -- The refinery business has long been the difficult stepchild of the oil industry, expensive to run, prone to accidents and a low-margin headache for executives who preferred drilling for gushers.
But signs of the improving fortunes for the industry can be seen at Valero Energy's Three Rivers refinery here, about 70 miles south of San Antonio at the doorstep of a giant new shale oil field.
Five years ago the midsize operation barely eked out a return from the gasoline and diesel fuel it produced from crude oil, and the company considered selling the plant. It was processing increasingly expensive oil from Africa and the Middle East, and the costs were high to ship it by tanker, unload it in a nearby port and then transport it here by a 55-mile-long pipeline. The price of the refinery's main power source, natural gas, was soaring too.
Now a new drilling boom in South Texas is delivering local crude oil several dollars a barrel cheaper than international prices. Another domestic drilling surge, in natural gas, has produced a 60 percent drop in domestic prices over the last four years. Together those changes have provided the Valero refinery $665,000 a day in savings, raising profit by 400 percent since 2008. 
''Three Rivers has gone from a marginal refinery to a crown jewel refinery,'' said Harry Wright, the Valero vice president who runs the plant. The refinery's reversal is just one example of how the American energy sector is remaking itself as it unlocks vast deposits of fossil fuels in a corridor that stretches from North Dakota to South Texas -- and in the process has turned the United States into a net exporter of refined petroleum products for the first time since the Truman administration.
Profits are flowing at most refineries, especially those close to the newly drilled Midwest and Southwest shale oil fields and to Gulf of Mexico ports. Those operations make up roughly three-quarters of the country's refining sector. The refiners are buying up fleets of railroad cars to connect with new shale fields, and investing heavily in new pipeline terminals, storage tanks and equipment to produce diesel for Europe and Latin America.
But the sector has been historically volatile, and some analysts caution that the refiners are vulnerable to any economic downturn, either globally or in the United States, and higher natural gas prices that could be caused by a cold winter.
In the last two years, San Antonio-based Valero, which is the world's biggest independent refiner and has 13 United States refineries, has spent $50 million to improve the Three Rivers plant. It bought 20 acres across the Frio River to build truck transfer stations to unload crude brought from the Eagle Ford shale field just down the road, and it put in new pipelines and equipment to refine that crude.
Spreading across South Texas, the Eagle Ford has been transformed by new drilling technologies from a marginal oil and gas field to one of the fastest developing in the world in just the last four years. Eagle Ford oil production has tripled in the last year alone to 310,000 barrels a day.
And now the pipeline that once brought foreign oil from the gulf port of Corpus Christi to Three Rivers has been reversed, sending Texas crude to other refineries along the coast for processing into diesel and other products for export far and wide, from Mexico to the Netherlands.
The drilling boom has allowed many refiners to buy crude at a huge discount -- sometimes $20 or more a barrel -- below international benchmark prices. That is especially true for refineries that operate in the core of the country, where there is a glut of crude from the North Dakota Bakken shale formation because of insufficient pipelines. Historically, until the last couple of years, American crudes typically were priced 50 cents to a dollar higher than international crudes.
The price advantage of United States refiners over their foreign competitors helped the country last year become a net exporter of refined petroleum products for the first time since the late 1940s, producing nearly $10 billion in annual revenue from daily net exports of 370,000 barrels a day of gasoline and diesel.
Over the first eight months of this year, according to the Energy Department, those net exports have surged to 975,000 barrels a day. The country may be able to export another half million barrels of diesel fuel over the next few years, according to Thomas P. Barney, chief economist of Marathon Petroleum.
The export boom is particularly welcome because it comes as demand for gasoline and diesel fuel is sluggish in the United States and American refineries have excess capacity to meet local demands. But global gasoline and diesel demand is still growing, and closings of several Caribbean and European refineries in recent years have opened an opportunity.
''Exports are where the growth is, since most people expect domestic demand to be flat or declining going forward,'' said Anthony Rouse, chief economist at Phillips 66, the global refinery giant. Phillips 66 is planning to increase its United States export capacity by 40 percent by the end of next year, he said.
Still, the refinery comeback does not necessarily mean lower prices at the pump for consumers, since oil prices are determined by global markets. Meanwhile, even the refiners face several potential setbacks. Exports of diesel are vulnerable to a European economic collapse, some analysts caution, and the refineries also face pressure from competitors in emerging markets in Asia, the Middle East and South America.
''We may be peaking out here in the next six to 12 months,'' said Chi Chow, a Macquarie Capital refinery analyst.
Energy experts note that the refinery business has been prone to expensive accidents, including the Chevron refinery fire in California in August that helped cause gasoline prices to shoot up in some parts of the state to over $5 a gallon for regular grade.
Some critics argue that growing exports are one reason supplies shrank in California, though refinery executives say strong foreign sales guarantee that refineries will keep operating at high capacity, improving efficiency and keeping costs down.
Many companies still view profits from exploration and production in the oil fields as more reliable than those from refining. Several of the largest integrated oil companies, including ConocoPhillips, Marathon Oil and BP, have recently sold refineries or shed entire refining businesses.
But companies like Valero and Dallas-based HollyFrontier are betting that the revival will last.
HollyFrontier, whose refineries are concentrated in the nation's heartland, where crude oil prices are lowest, showed an increase in net income of almost 150 percent in its latest quarter, year over year, to $502 million.
Michael C. Jennings, HollyFrontier's chief executive and president, estimated that the typical refinery in the central United States had nearly tripled its profit margin for every barrel of refined product sold because of savings in transportation costs and the replacement of internationally priced crude with American shale and Canadian crudes.
''You have an industry that has struggled through time,'' and has been given new life ''because of cheaper access to its principal raw materials, oil and natural gas,'' Mr. Jennings said. ''This industry is being reborn in a manner such that we are consistently making money.''
The low natural gas prices are helping all the refineries, even less fortunate ones far from the new oil fields. For Valero, the fall in gas prices since 2008 now accounts for annual savings of more than $1 billion.
The changing economics are reflected in the bustle at Valero's Three Rivers refinery, where workers are busy welding pipes and applying aluminum insulation on a new flash drum, a giant tower meant to process the lighter crudes from the Eagle Ford.
Another truck comes rumbling into the new transfer station every five minutes to bring a total of 45,000 barrels of Eagle Ford crude to the refinery, and a brand new pipeline is bringing in an additional 40,000 barrels a day.
''This is a huge competitive advantage,'' said William R. Klesse, Valero's chief executive and chairman. ''The change in oil and gas production is the biggest thing in my career, and I've been through the Arab oil embargo, price controls, the Iraq-Iran war, the price break in 1986, and the Iraq and Afghanistan wars.''

HEADLINE: Capsized Franchise Has Only Sunk Further Into Depths of Despair

BYLINE: By KEN BELSON; Jeff Z. Klein contributed reporting.

 BODY:
For many Islanders fans, the good old days are painfully difficult to remember not because they were not good but because the team that won four straight Stanley Cups in the 1980s has morphed into a derelict franchise that has alienated all but its most die-hard followers.
Since those glory years, the Islanders have lurched from one troubled owner to another. A carousel of general managers has fired a parade of coaches. Players have skated in front of fewer and fewer fans, some of whom have sat with umbrellas open because of Nassau Coliseum's leaky roof. 
In 2000, Charles B. Wang and Sanjay Kumar bought the team and vowed to halt the long fall and to revitalize what was once considered a model franchise with stable management and devoted players. Proud immigrants whose company, Computer Associates, was based on Long Island, they wanted to give back to the community by saving the team.
Although they were hockey neophytes who read ''Hockey for Dummies,'' co-written by John Davidson, a former Rangers goaltender, they were realistic.
''Let's face it: the Coliseum is a dump, and the team, well, they're losers,'' Wang said at the time. ''It's a real shame. We want to see it change because this is our home. We all deserve better.''
The team ultimately did not change, or at least not enough. On Wang's watch, the Islanders have made the postseason four times and have not won a series. Attendance perked up for a few years when Wang spent freely but dwindled after he slashed payroll to offset growing losses. He has gone without a team president, and the Islanders switched from their flagship radio station to one run by Hofstra University.
Fans, tired of watching games in a drafty, 40-year-old arena, have stayed away. The Islanders averaged 13,191 fans a game last season, second worst in the league and just ahead of the Phoenix Coyotes.
Like his predecessors, Wang fought hard to get a new arena that might generate the extra revenue needed to sign better players and reel in big sponsors and free-spending fans. He also tried to get out from under a lopsided deal with SMG, the company that runs the Coliseum on behalf of Nassau County.
Like his predecessors, Wang has fought a losing battle.
In 2004, he proposed a grand plan to refurbish the Coliseum and build apartments, stores and an office tower nearby. The project turned into a political football as Democrats and Republicans opposed and supported it. When that failed, a far slimmer plan was sent last year to voters, who resoundingly said no.
In between, Wang looked for leverage, even taking the Islanders to Kansas City, Mo., for an exhibition game. Then, Brooklyn, with its Barclays Center, made a deal too good to turn down. The team will depart after its lease expires at the Coliseum in 2015, more than three decades after its last championship. ''It's tough to see them move when they should have a team on Long Island,'' said Al Arbour, the coach of the Stanley Cup teams, who now lives in Florida. ''They got into a pickle and didn't move up in the playoffs. That cost them.''
Since Arbour left in 1994 after his second stint coaching the Islanders, a dozen coaches have led the team, which began as an expansion franchise in 1972. After lobbying by William Shea, who ushered the Mets into existence, the N.H.L. agreed to put a team in the newly built Coliseum to prevent the fledgling World Hockey Association from getting there first.
After a first season that included 12 wins, the Islanders quickly transformed into a powerhouse whose accomplishments dwarfed those of the Rangers, their bitter and more glamorous rivals. Led by the Hall of Famers Mike Bossy, Bryan Trottier, Denis Potvin and Billy Smith, they won a record 19 straight playoff series.
Given the trouble that followed, those players seem almost glad the team is moving.
''I felt terrible that the team won't be there anymore, but I'm behind Charles 100 percent,'' Bossy, now the team's vice president of corporate sponsorships, said Wednesday. ''Today's today; yesterday's yesterday. We did what we did where we did, and now that's changing.''
Not long after Bossy retired, the team began its long slide. In 1992, John O. Pickett Jr., the longtime owner, sold 10 percent of the team to four businessmen who were tasked with running the Islanders. Other than a magical run in the 1992-93 playoffs, the Islanders failed to impress.
In 1997, John Spano agreed to pay Pickett $165 million for the team and its cable television contract. But Spano was later convicted of bank and wire fraud for illegally obtaining loans to buy the team, so Pickett ended up selling the next year to Edward and Howard Milstein and Steven Gluckstern.
The group, which ended up losing about $40 million before it sold to Wang and Kumar, sued SMG over safety concerns and briefly moved the team's furniture, files and memorabilia in a convoy of vans to an office in Manhattan. The group explored playing games in arenas as far away as Hartford.
In some ways, the Islanders have outgrown Long Island, from which young people have fled to states where it is cheaper to live and jobs are more plentiful.
''It was a dying franchise in an economy that has continued to decline,'' said Martin Cantor, the director of the Long Island Center for Socio-Economic Policy.
But mainly, the Islanders have been undone by a rogues' gallery of managers and politicians unwilling or unable to help. This ought to upset the devoted fans. But after years of distress, they, too, seem hopeful that Brooklyn might prove more fertile.
''I thought I'd be angry, but now I'm excited,'' said Larry Ziegler, who lives in East Meadow, about a mile from the Coliseum, and has had season tickets for nearly 20 years. ''I see that they need to move to get to where they need to get to.''

But after the mid-1980s, the franchise's fortunes fluctuated -- almost always for the worse.

HEADLINE: Islanders Leaving, the Glory Long Gone

BYLINE: By GEORGE VECSEY. 
E-mail: geovec@nytimes.com

 BODY:
Brooklyn giveth and Brooklyn taketh away.
The borough that carried a victim's posture for half a century is now collecting sports franchises.
At least Brooklyn is not spiriting away much of anything from the haunted house farther out on Long Island. Maybe the nickname of the team; maybe the orange and blue colors. But Brooklyn cannot carry away the glory of the Islanders because those times have long been atomized into the air we breathe. That team has not existed for decades.
The Islanders are moving to Brooklyn by 2015, by which time the N.H.L. may once again be open for business, Donald Fehr willing. The location is not far from where the Battle of Long Island was fought during the Revolutionary War. That is to say, Brooklyn is part of Long Island, which gives this move some legitimacy. 
The real Islanders cannot be transported to Brooklyn the way the Dodgers were stuffed into a gunnysack and taken to Los Angeles for the 1958 season. The O'Malley family took Pee Wee Reese and Gil Hodges and Carl Furillo and Duke Snider and Don Newcombe and Carl Erskine with them, breaking hearts, and not just in Flatbush and Bay Ridge.
This move breaks few hearts. Anybody who loved the real New York Islanders is harking back to the late '70s into the mid-'80s -- a glorious time of four Stanley Cups and epic players and a coach named Al Arbour.
The Islanders were the best team I ever covered, because of the people who won so many big games, and lit up a dreary barn on the flatlands of central Nassau. Roger Kahn called the Dodgers ''The Boys of Summer,'' in homage to the poem by Dylan Thomas. I called the Islanders the Boys of Winter.
When springtime arrived, the Islanders skated with their Stanley Cups while the loudspeaker played ''We Are the Champions'' by Queen. I cannot hear that song without thinking of Mike Bossy and Billy Smith and Denis Potvin and the rest. But that's over now. That team is not moving to the new arena in Brooklyn.
I could not tell you who coaches the Islanders and I could not tell you who plays for the Islanders, although I still live only a few miles from Nassau Coliseum. The team became irrelevant under Charles Wang, who, unfortunately, seems to be going with the team, like a sack of old sweaty goalie pads.
This move was inevitable because Nassau could not and would not afford a major arena for a major hockey team. Brutally taxed, with an aging population, with the infrastructure of Nassau County long neglected by public officials, citizens were not supporting some pipe dream of an urban center to be constructed by the same Charles Wang.
Dodger fans never really got to vote about subsidizing some new ballpark to keep the Bums in Brooklyn. But in midsummer 2011, geezers who could vaguely remember Bobby Nystrom's big goal in 1980 voted thumbs-down on Wang's real estate boondoggle. With their eyes wide open, they essentially voted thumbs-down on the Islanders, too.
In three years, the Islanders will move to the new arena in Brooklyn that has already plucked the wandering Nets from their wastelands of New Jersey.
The urban politics and economics of the Barclays Center in Brooklyn deserve a separate discussion. For the purposes of this moment, the arena exists, and the reconstructed Nets are about to open a basketball season there, with hardly the history the Islanders have.
The Nets have won zero championships since joining the N.B.A. in 1976-77, whereas the Islanders won four Stanley Cups from 1980 through 1983 after being formed in expansion in 1972. They captured the hearts of the still hopeful working class in suburbia, and then they got good. In 1984, they got to the finals against the Edmonton Oilers of Wayne Gretzky and Mark Messier, looking as if they were skating in slush, after too many playoff rounds.
Sometimes the players wore fur coats and drove flashy cars, but the Coliseum was distinctly plebeian, from when it was built. Still, when Bryan Trottier was elbowing somebody or Clark Gillies was keeping the peace, they lit up the unpretentious suburban night.
The builder of the franchise was bow-tie Bill Torrey, who would open a few bags of potato chips to host the Stanley Cup finals, but hired terrific scouts in Canada and Sweden, who factored in character and intelligence.
The Islanders were deep in champions -- Anders Kallur and Stefan Persson from Sweden, Ken Morrow from the 1980 Olympic team, Bob Bourne, maybe the best athlete on the team, Butch Goring, a scruffy little buzz bomb who could tick off opponents. John Tonelli. Chico Resch. I could name a dozen more. They were modest, as hockey players generally are, but they backed up their low-key goals.
None of them will be skating away to Brooklyn. These Islanders are not the Islanders who have already been mourned, placed in the memory bank.
The good news for anybody who wants to follow the Islanders to the western end of Long Island is that commuting will be easy. After four decades in central Nassau, there is still no rail line to the Coliseum. The new place in Brooklyn is atop the Atlantic Avenue terminus of the Long Island Railroad. The Brooklyn Nets note that there are 11 separate subway lines within walking distance of the arena.
Brooklyn is finally getting its due, attracting immigrants from Russia and the Caribbean and everywhere else, the tired and the poor, the Cyclones playing baseball in Coney Island, and young trendies who cannot afford Manhattan enjoying a glimpse of the Brooklyn sky. Upscale areas are becoming stereotyped for lethal baby strollers pushed by ferocious jogger-parents, as well as for yuppie restaurants that are squeezing out the ancestral homes of the noble knish.
Every time I go past the new arena, I cannot help thinking that the Brooklyn Dodgers could have been playing atop the Atlantic Avenue station. Now the borough is scooping up the Islanders from farther out on the Island. At least the taxpayers got to vote on this move.

HEADLINE: Zynga, Struggling to Be More Than a Fad, Beats Analysts' Forecasts

BYLINE: By DAVID STREITFELD

 BODY:
SAN FRANCISCO -- Zynga is putting all its chips on a game called survival.
The company, which practically invented the notion of using Facebook as a games platform, is firing employees, shutting games and losing players. It warned that its third-quarter numbers would be a pre-Halloween horror, and so investors naturally started thinking about the apocalypse.
The results, released after the market closed Wednesday, were not quite as bad as that. In addition, the company announced a partnership to offer online casino games in Britain where gamblers can wager real money. Such games, which have been banned in the United States, are promoted as highly profitable. 
Third-quarter revenue was $317 million, an improvement over the $300 million to $305 million the company forecast in early October when it warned that tough times were ahead. The number was also significantly higher than the $256 million that downbeat analysts had expected. But revenue was only 3 percent better than 2011.
Still, the stock immediately spiked, rising as much as 30 cents in after-hours trading to $2.42. Zynga shares are down 75 percent from their public offering price last December, and have dropped even more from the level at which executives and early investors cashed out last spring in an unusual $500 million secondary offering.
''In less than 10 months, Zynga has gone from a massive global growth story to a cost-cutting restructuring story,'' said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. ''How did the rug get pulled out from under them so fast? It still amazes us.''
Mr. Greenfield pointed to a new Zynga game, the Ville, in which players create the home of their dreams. In an economy in which hardly anyone can afford to do this in real life, Zynga had high hopes some players would spend money to do it virtually. The Ville was introduced in June and had 7.3 million daily users at the end of July. Today: 1.7 million.
''The decay curve, the half-life, is shortening,'' Mr. Greenfield said. ''It's staggering how fast some of these games have fallen off.''
For all the downward trend, Zynga is still the most popular social gaming company. It is controlled by its founder and chief executive, Mark Pincus, who now has the opportunity to prove he is worth the fortune Zynga has showered on him.
''Is Zynga doomed?'' asked Joost van Dreunen of SuperData Research. ''No. Not yet. But the next play they make is going to be Pincus' most important bet to date.''
Silicon Valley loves to worry about whether it is in a bubble; merely asking the question is proof that it is not true. But for a small group of companies, the bubble has already burst. Groupon, Netflix and, most visibly, Facebook have all been hammered recently as investors began to realign their rosy expectations with cruel reality.
Zynga is by far the most embattled of this select group. Even as its partner Facebook staged a tentative revival Wednesday -- Facebook shares rose 19 percent on the heels of better-than-expected third-quarter numbers -- Zynga's own earnings report raised the question of its long-term viability.
''The last several months have obviously been challenging for us,'' Mr. Pincus said in a conference call with analysts.
The company lost 7 cents a share last quarter; in 2011, it broke even. As part of its reorganization, the company announced a $200 million share buyback plan.
Zynga began cutbacks this week. It is dismissing 5 percent of its 3,000 employees and turning off 13 games. It is also withdrawing support from the Ville.
All that is unlikely to be enough, said Arvind Bhatia, an analyst at Sterne Agee.
''The Zynga model was flaky to begin with,'' Mr. Bhatia said, noting the dependence on Facebook, on a few hit games like FarmVille and CityVille, and on just a few players who were willing to buy virtual tractors to speed their play. ''If they could find a hit, maybe things could turn around. But the recent track record doesn't give you a lot of confidence.''
When Zynga went public in December, the caution of a few skeptics, including Mr. Bhatia, was drowned out by the enthusiasm for getting in on the hot social network scene before shares in Facebook itself were available.
Zynga had a compelling story to offer: In a world starved for time, we would keep in touch with our friends by playing games with them during snatched moments.
''I fundamentally believe that the biggest opportunity is to get people like me to play,'' Mr. Pincus said in an interview with Games Industry International. ''I'm a latent gamer; it's there, it's just in the background because I'm too busy, and I can't find the time, I can't justify the time. But if you could get it in front of me and you could distill it down to something that I could get into in five minutes, and I could play it with friends and other people, you would have me.''
After its debut at $10 a share, Zynga was valued at $7 billion. Early investors and company officials, including Mr. Pincus, sold a few months later at $12 a share.
In that era, Zynga and Facebook were closely tied. But on Facebook's earnings call Tuesday, Mark Zuckerberg distanced his company from Zynga, saying even as revenue from Zynga was down 20 percent annualized, revenue from other gaming companies was up 40 percent.
Translation: a sinking Zynga won't hurt Facebook. As a headline in the TheStreet.com put it: ''Call the Cops, Mark Zuckerberg Just Killed Zynga.''

HEADLINE: Amid Cutbacks, Greek Doctors Offer Message to Poor: You Are Not Alone

BYLINE: By LIZ ALDERMAN; Dimitris Bounias contributed reporting.

 BODY:
ATHENS -- As the head of Greece's largest oncology department, Dr. Kostas Syrigos thought he had seen everything. But nothing prepared him for Elena, an unemployed woman whose breast cancer had been diagnosed a year before she came to him.
By that time, her cancer had grown to the size of an orange and broken through the skin, leaving a wound that she was draining with paper napkins. ''When we saw her we were speechless,'' said Dr. Syrigos, the chief of oncology at Sotiria General Hospital in central Athens. ''Everyone was crying. Things like that are described in textbooks, but you never see them because until now, anybody who got sick in this country could always get help.''
Life in Greece has been turned on its head since the debt crisis took hold. But in few areas has the change been more striking than in health care. Until recently, Greece had a typical European health system, with employers and individuals contributing to a fund that with government assistance financed universal care. People who lost their jobs received health care and unemployment benefits for a year, but were still treated by hospitals if they could not afford to pay even after the benefits expired. 
Things changed in July 2011, when Greece signed a supplemental loan agreement with international lenders to ward off financial collapse. Now, as stipulated in the deal, Greeks must pay all costs out of pocket after their benefits expire.
About half of Greece's 1.2 million long-term unemployed lack health insurance, a number that is expected to rise sharply in a country with an unemployment rate of 25 percent and a moribund economy, said Savas Robolis, director of the Labor Institute of the General Confederation of Greek Workers. A new $17.5 billion austerity package of budget cuts and tax increases, agreed upon Wednesday with Greece's international lenders, will make matters only worse, most economists say.
The changes are forcing increasing numbers of people to seek help outside the traditional health care system. Elena, for example, was referred to Dr. Syrigos by doctors in an underground movement that has sprung up here to care for the uninsured. ''In Greece right now, to be unemployed means death,'' said Dr. Syrigos, an imposing man with a stern demeanor that grew soft when discussing the plight of cancer patients.
The development is new for Greeks -- and perhaps for Europe, too. ''We are moving to the same situation that the United States has been in, where when you lose your job and you are uninsured, you aren't covered,'' Dr. Syrigos said.
The change is particularly striking in cancer care, with its lengthy and expensive treatments. When cancer is diagnosed among the uninsured, ''the system simply ignores them,'' Dr. Syrigos said. He said, ''They can't access chemotherapy, surgery or even simple drugs.''
The health care system itself is increasingly dysfunctional, and may worsen if the government slashes an additional $2 billion in health spending, which it has proposed as part of a new austerity plan aimed to lock down more financing. With the state coffers drained, supplies have gotten so low that some patients have been forced to bring their own supplies, like stents and syringes, for treatments.
Hospitals and pharmacies now demand cash payment for drugs, which for cancer patients can amount to tens of thousands of dollars, money most of them do not have. With the system deteriorating, Dr. Syrigos and several colleagues have decided to take matters into their own hands.
Earlier this year, they set up a surreptitious network to help uninsured cancer patients and other ill people, which operates off the official grid using only spare medicines donated by pharmacies, some pharmaceutical companies and even the families of cancer patients who died. In Greece, doctors found to be helping an uninsured person using hospital medicines must cover the cost from their own pockets.
At the Metropolitan Social Clinic, a makeshift medical center near an abandoned American Air Force base outside Athens, Dr. Giorgos Vichas pointed one recent afternoon to plastic bags crammed with donated medicines lining the dingy floors outside his office.
''We're a Robin Hood network,'' said Dr. Vichas, a cardiologist who founded the underground movement in January. ''But this operation has an expiration date,'' he said. ''People at some point will no longer be able to donate because of the crisis. That's why we're pressuring the state to take responsibility again.''
In a supply room, a blue filing cabinet was filled with cancer drugs. But they were not enough to take care of the rising number of cancer patients knocking on his door. Many of the medicines are forwarded to Dr. Syrigos, who set up an off-hours infirmary in the hospital three months ago to treat uninsured cancer patients Dr. Vichas and other doctors in the network send his way.
Dr. Syrigos's staff members consistently volunteer to work after their official shifts; the number of patients has risen to 35 from 5. ''Sometimes I come home tired, exhausted, seeing double,'' said Korina Liberopoulou, a pathologist on site one afternoon with five doctors and nurses. ''But as long as there are materials to work with, this practice will go on.''
Back at the medical center, Dr. Vichas said he had never imagined being so overwhelmed with people in need.
As he spoke, Elena appeared, wearing a pleated gray head wrap and a loose plum blouse. She was coming for drugs to help her cope with the aftermath of chemotherapy she had recently received from Dr. Syrigos.
Elena said she was left without insurance after quitting her teaching job to care for her cancer-stricken parents and a sick uncle. By the time they died, the financial crisis had hit Greece and, at 58, it was impossible for her to find work.
She said she panicked when she was found to have the same type of breast cancer that killed her mother: the treatments would cost at least $40,000, she was told, and her family's funds were depleted. She tried to sell a small plot of land, but no one was buying.
Her cancer spread, and she could not find treatment until a few months ago, when she sought out Dr. Vichas's underground clinic after hearing about it through word of mouth. ''If I couldn't come here, I would do nothing,'' she said. ''In Greece today, you have to make a contract with yourself that you will not get very sick.''
She said she was dismayed that the Greek state, as part of the bailout, had pulled back on a pillar of protection for society. But the fact that doctors and ordinary Greeks were organizing to pitch in where the state failed gave her hope in her bleakest hours. ''Here, there is somebody who cares,'' Elena said.
For Dr. Vichas, the most powerful therapy may not be the medicines, but the optimism that his Robin Hood group brings to those who have almost given up. ''What we've gained from the crisis is to come closer together,'' he said.
''This is resistance,'' he added, sweeping his eyes over the volunteers and patients bustling around the clinic. ''It is a nation, a people allowed to stand on their own two feet again with the help they give each other.''

HEADLINE: A Pizzeria Owner Learns the Value Of Watching the Books

BYLINE: By IAN MOUNT

 BODY:
Pizza shop owners rarely are celebrated for their innovative company cultures, but Nick Sarillo is an exception. His use of open-book management, his efforts to help community groups raise money and his development of what he calls a trust-and-track management style have spawned a cover article in Inc. magazine and his own recently published book, ''A Slice of the Pie: How to Build a Big Little Business.''
A second-generation pizza entrepreneur -- his father owned a pizzeria in Carpentersville, Ill. -- Mr. Sarillo, 50, opened his first Nick's Pizza & Pub in Crystal Lake, Ill., in 1995 and his second in 2005 in Elgin, a nearby suburb of Chicago. Annual revenues rose to $7 million in 2007.
But while he was sharp on culture, Mr. Sarillo acknowledges he was naïve about numbers. He overborrowed and overbuilt when times were good, then almost lost his business when the economy turned. Only an impassioned online plea to his customers saved Nick's. 
''Barring some sort of miracle, we are going to run out of cash to pay our vendors and team members over the next couple of weeks and will have to close,'' he wrote in a September 2011 e-mail sent to customers and later posted on the company Web site. The following conversation has been edited and condensed.
Q. What was your father's pizza joint like?
A. It was good when my dad was there to tell people what to do. He was a good guy, but he didn't coach much. He just said, ''Get this done now.'' When he wasn't around, it was slack. He always taught me you can never have more than one restaurant because no one cares. Other entrepreneurs were telling me the same thing. But I realized that was because of the culture they created in their businesses. That's where I said I'll do something different.
Q. You describe your management style as trust and track. What does that mean?
A. Especially with a younger generation like we have at this restaurant, they're going to be more motivated and more productive if the managers are more like coaches. Instead of being told what to do, they want to be supported and coached. This trust-and-track model is about giving the team the tools they need, telling them the result we need and trusting them to get there in their own way. At the same time, you have to track the results.
Q. Tell me about your community involvement.
A. As in many companies, I used to write checks and donate -- because I'm a good guy and I care. But there wasn't much awareness in the employees or community about why I was doing that. Then we came up with our fund-raising system. Instead of an advertising budget like most companies -- say 3 percent of sales -- we have zero dollars in our advertising budget and give back 5 percent of our net sales to our community through fund-raising. We do that by allowing organizations, the ones I used to write checks to, to come in and use our building to raise money.
Q. And then you started having problems in the Elgin restaurant? A. When I built my first restaurant in Crystal Lake, it was only 150 seats and about 3,500 square feet. I could have done the same thing in Elgin. But like many entrepreneurs, I have that eternal optimism. The Elgin restaurant is just over 9,000 square feet, with 350 seats. It was a $5 million project with property and building. I overbuilt the restaurant based on the projections that there would be 80,000 people moving into housing development projects there. None of the developments got built.
Q. What happened?
A. Unemployment got really high in our areas, over 10 percent. So the families didn't have money to go out. Sales dropped a little in 2009 and 2010. We did some great promotions where we were giving back, a couple days a week with half-price pizzas for people out of work. Those kinds of things helped us maintain a healthy level of sales to get by. We weren't building any cash, but we were making it.
Q. When did you realize that you weren't making it?
A. Sometime in the beginning of 2011 I asked an adviser for some help, and he schooled me on debt-to-asset ratios on my balance sheet and basically gave me what I would call a come-to-Jesus speech.
Q. What exactly had you missed?
A. I wasn't watching how the liabilities side of my balance sheet was growing. I was incurring more and more debt, and our debt-to-equity ratio was getting way out of whack. A healthy ratio is one to one, but ours was more than three to one. I had millions in debt. I had the $5 million project. And the asset values were decreasing as the property values were going down. That's the downside of having so much success. I got a little complacent about taking on debt.
Q. Given your balance sheet problems, how were you able to get bank loans?
A. When I first got approved for the bank loans, our sales and everything was climbing and improving, and the values of our properties were real high. The bank probably didn't look as close as they should have as well. And they gave us a line of credit that they probably shouldn't have.
Q. By September 2011, things were really bad and you wrote the letter to your customers saying you were about to go broke. How much did it help?
A. I still have that sales report on my wall because it was so amazing. The Elgin restaurant in the first week had an increase of 105 percent and Crystal Lake had an increase of 110 percent. The second week and third week were close to that. They were like 90 percent. And then maybe 85 percent the third week. It was five weeks before sales settled back down again, but not all the way down.
Q. This must have taken a toll on you personally.
A. I've never been in this kind of situation. I've always made my payments, ever since I was 16 years old. So the responsibility at a personal level weighed heavily on me. So much so that -- while I'm very athletic, I work out, I swim a lot -- at the end of this, right around Labor Day, my back tightened up. I'd blown two discs in my back. I totally believe that had something to do with the stress I was holding.
Q. Did the letter get you out of the hole?
A. We got current with all our vendors. We made payroll. We paid our mortgage for that month. But also the bank worked with us on our loan. They deferred our principal for one year.
Q. Are you paying the principal now?
A. Yes. We just started.
Q. Can you keep both restaurants open?
A. Yes, we can, as things are now. It's still not easy.
Q. What does your father say?
A. He's a proponent of selling the restaurant company and starting over. He thinks I work too hard for not much pay, just to get things turned around. A lot of business owners would claim bankruptcy and get out of this and start over again. He's concerned about the stress.
Q. Do you still plan to open more Nick's Pizza & Pub stores?
A. Yeah, I would for sure. What we do in our communities and how we run our business is really amazing, and I would love to bring this to other communities. But it's not going to happen anytime soon.

HEADLINE: Boeing Posts Better-Than-Expected Profit and Raises Forecast for a 3rd Time

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER DREW

 BODY:
Boeing reported third-quarter profits on Wednesday that were better than analysts had expected because of sharp increases in aircraft deliveries. It also raised its earnings forecast for 2012 for the third time.
The company, based in Chicago, increased deliveries of both commercial and military airplanes, with the biggest revenue gains coming from the growing demand for new passenger planes.
Boeing's chief executive, W. James McNerney Jr., said advances in technology were helping the company's jetliner sales surge despite the lackluster economy. He said airlines and leasing companies were moving to replace older planes more quickly than normal to gain fuel savings from new engines and parts made from lightweight composite materials. 
Boeing's military business also remained steady, and other large military contractors reported solid operating results despite a push to tighten defense budgets.
Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, which are both mainly military companies, also beat analyst expectations on Wednesday in reporting third-quarter profits.
Over all, Boeing's third-quarter sales increased by 13 percent to $20 billion from $17.7 billion a year earlier. Its net income dropped, as expected, because of higher pension expenses, but still exceeded analyst expectations.
Third-quarter net income totaled $1.03 billion, or $1.35 a share. That was 6 percent less than the $1.1 billion, or $1.46 a share, that Boeing reported a year earlier.
Analysts surveyed by Bloomberg had expected $1.12 a share.
Boeing said growing sales of its older 737 and 777 commercial models, as well as increasing deliveries of the new 787 and 747-8 jets, should help it earn $4.80 to $4.95 a share for all of 2012. It previously had forecast earnings of $4.40 to $4.60 a share for 2012.
About a year ago, Boeing began deliveries of the 787 Dreamliner, the first passenger jet to make substantial use of the composites, and the 747-8, an enlarged version of the classic 747. Both models were late and over budget. But Boeing is shipping 70 to 85 of the new planes to customers this year, and Robert Stallard, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets, wrote to clients on Wednesday that the company was ''getting pretty good'' at completing ''trouble-free'' quarters.
Boeing said it remained on track to deliver 585 to 600 commercial planes this year, which could enable it to reclaim the top spot in worldwide aircraft sales. Europe's Airbus, which passed Boeing in deliveries in 2003, has projected that it will supply 570 planes to customers in 2012.
Boeing has already started to update its best-selling 737 single-aisle planes, and Mr. McNerney said the company was now considering replacing the metal wings on the larger 777s with the lightweight composites and switching to more fuel-efficient engines on that model.
He said that even with just those changes, rather than a complete redesign, Boeing could deliver cost savings on the 777 that are ''pretty eye-watering.'' He said the company was still considering the options, but expected to start delivering a new version of the 777 by the early 2020s.
In terms of military business, both Boeing and Lockheed, the largest military contractor, said they had increased sales overseas to offset some of the reductions at the Pentagon.
Lockheed said Wednesday that its net earnings from continuing operations increased in the third quarter to $727 million, or $2.21 a share, from $665 million, or $1.99 a share, a year earlier. Its sales were $11.9 billion compared with $12.1 billion a year earlier.
Lockheed said it expected its sales to decline at a low single-digit rate in 2013. But it also expects its profit margins to remain above 11 percent as long as Congress can stave off sequestration, the plan to force large automatic spending cuts at the Pentagon. Both President Obama and his Republican opponent, Mitt Romney, have promised that they would stop the cuts if they win the November election.
Northrop Grumman's earnings also beat analyst expectations, though its quarterly profit fell 12 percent from last year's levels on a drop in net pension income. General Dynamics, another large arms company, missed the analyst consensus on its earnings. Its profits fell by 8 percent, partly because of a $25 million charge to revalue inventory.

HEADLINE: Tax Policy Center in Spotlight for Its Romney Study

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A small nonpartisan research center operated by professed ''geeks'' has found itself at the center of a rancorous $5 trillion debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney.
No white paper or policy manifesto put out during the presidential campaign has proved more controversial than an August study by the Washington-based Tax Policy Center, a respected nonprofit that issues studiously detailed tax analyses.
That study found, in short, that Mr. Romney could not keep all of the promises he had made on individual tax reform: including cutting marginal tax rates by 20 percent, keeping protections for investment income, not widening the deficit and not increasing the tax burden on the poor or middle class. It concluded that Mr. Romney's plan, on its face, would cut taxes for rich families and raise them for everyone else. 
The detailed paper proved kindling for a political firestorm. Mr. Romney criticized the center as performing a ''garbage-in, garbage-out'' analysis and his campaign accused it of partisan bias. The Obama campaign used the center's numbers to argue that Mr. Romney had proposed a $5 trillion tax cut. Economists jumped on the bandwagon too, flinging analyses back and forth and picking apart the projections and assumptions in the report.
At the Tax Policy Center itself, responses ranged from irritation at the partisan nature of some attacks to incredulity over the political hysteria. ''There was this résumé-hunting, White-House-visitor-log'' searching feel to the response, said the center's director, Donald Marron, a former Bush administration economist. ''That was unanticipated,'' he added dryly.
In many ways the report did just what the center was created to do: inject some solid numbers into a shifty, accusatory, raucous political debate. The decade-old center -- a joint project of the Brookings Institution and the Urban Institute, two nonpartisan grandes dames of the Washington world -- was founded precisely to ''fill that niche,'' Mr. Marron said.
''A lot of tax policy discussions are -- how to describe them? -- people yelling at each other,'' he said. ''We believe that good information leads to better policy discussions and ultimately better policy outcomes.''
The center's claim to provide reliable, nonpartisan information comes in part from its staff makeup. It has about four dozen affiliated staff members and scholars -- most are economists, several are considered top experts in their fields, and a number have experience in either Republican or Democratic administrations.
It also is derived by virtue of its ownership of a highly sophisticated tax modeling system, one that took about two years to build and has a small coterie of specialists to tend it. The model resembles those used by government offices to forecast the effect of changes to the tax code, and it relies on about 150,000 anonymous tax returns and a wealth of data on pensions, education, consumer expenditures and economic growth.
''They're one of the few groups that have this very big, very accurate model,'' said Martin A. Sullivan, the chief economist and a contributing editor at Tax Analysts, a specialty publisher. ''What they're doing is just making the best computations available'' for others to interpret, he said.
That includes so-called distributional analyses that show how changes to the tax code would change the relative burden on high-income and low-income families -- a dry tax topic yet one of the most politically potent ones of the campaign, given the broader debate about tax fairness and inequality.
The analysis of the Romney proposal has proved highly controversial not just among politicians, but also among some economists.
Researchers including Martin Feldstein of Harvard and Harvey S. Rosen of Princeton have argued that Mr. Romney's tax math might work if he raised taxes on families making more than $100,000 a year -- not $200,000 to $250,000 a year, as he currently promises -- or if his plan gave a strong jolt to economic growth.
''Reasonable economists disagree on'' the growth effects of plans like Mr. Romney's, said Alan J. Auerbach, a tax expert at the University of California, Berkeley, who added that he did not see the math working out as currently described. ''It matters a lot what kind of reductions you're making or how you're paying for tax cuts.''
Others have argued that the Tax Policy Center filled in too many of the holes in Mr. Romney's light-on-detail proposal -- making a full analysis impossible and skewing the center's paper's results.
''It is not an analysis of Governor Romney's plan,'' said Scott A. Hodge, the president of the Tax Foundation. a nonprofit research group also based in Washington.
''It has been, I think, mislabeled as such and misinterpreted as such. We don't think there are enough details to analyze,'' he said, adding that he believed that it was possible to devise a distributionally neutral, revenue neutral tax reform that cut rates in the way Mr. Romney described.
The Tax Policy Center said that it had sought as many details as possible from the Romney campaign. (Its economists said it has a cordial back-and-forth with the economic policy teams in both campaigns, as it did in 2008.) Given the numbers available, it had tried to perform the analysis in the most generous way possible, and still did not see how Mr. Romney's rate cuts could square with his other goals.
''We wrote a technical, accurate paper given the available information,'' said William G. Gale of the Brookings Institution, one of the paper's main authors, in a recent interview. ''The criticism that you can't analyze the Romney tax plan because there isn't one? That hasn't stopped other economists from analyzing its growth effects. I like to have substantive discussions about tax policy. The uproar about the paper has not been substantive.''
Many economists across the political spectrum have said they found the report's conclusions convincing, like Alan D. Viard, a tax expert at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute.
Mr. Sullivan of Tax Analysts said: ''I like tax reform. I want to broaden the base. It's something I've devoted my life to. And I welcome Governor Romney and the Republicans' strong push, but the plan doesn't work out. It's not mathematically possible.''

HEADLINE: Fed Pledges To Maintain Stimulus

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM; :

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Federal Reserve said Wednesday that it would continue its economic stimulus campaign, aimed at reducing unemployment, amid fresh evidence of a housing recovery that could help to bolster those efforts.
Sales of new homes rose 5.7 percent in September to the highest level since 2010, when the government was offering tax credits to first-time buyers, the Commerce Department said on Wednesday. The report joins other recent data showing rising prices and increased construction in affirming that the housing market is recovering from its prolonged downturn.
The Fed acknowledged that consumer spending, including spending on housing, has strengthened, but it said that it remained convinced that its efforts were necessary to bolster an inconsistent and lackluster recovery. 
Unemployment remains stubbornly high, the domestic economy is growing slowly, the global economy is struggling and a so-called fiscal cliff looms at the end of the year.
''The committee is concerned that, without further policy accommodation, economic growth might not be strong enough to generate sustained improvement in labor market conditions,'' the Fed's policy-making committee said in a statement released after a regularly scheduled two-day meeting.
This was the Fed's last meeting before the presidential election. In holding its course, the Fed again defied the criticism of the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, who has described the central bank's efforts as ineffective and inflationary and who has promised to replace its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke.
Indeed, the statement from the policy unit, the Federal Open Market Committee, once again emphasized that it remained prepared to expand its efforts ''if the outlook for the labor market does not improve substantially.''
The decision was supported by 11 members of the committee. The only opposition came from Jeffrey M. Lacker, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Richmond, who has dissented at each meeting this year.
The Fed announced after its last meeting, in September, that it would buy $40 billion in mortgage securities each month until the jobs outlook improved, a significant expansion of its stimulus campaign. It also said it intended to keep short-term interest rates near zero at least until mid-2015.
The new policy is aimed specifically at helping the housing market by reducing interest rates on mortgage loans. The more people who buy homes, the greater the benefit to the housing market and to the economy in general.
The housing market remains depressed by historical standards. New home sales have reached an annual pace of 389,000, better than the last two years but significantly worse than any other year since 1963.
And housing remains anchored to employment. People need jobs to buy homes.
''All the housing data has taken a turn for the better. Clearly, mortgage rates at such a low level and what appears to be an increase in banks' willingness to make loans has boosted activity off the lows,'' Steven Richiutto, chief economist at Mizuho Securities, wrote in a note to clients. ''But I would still not read too much into this unless employment picks up. We have seen false starts before.''
The Fed's next meeting, scheduled for Dec. 11 and 12, will be more consequential. Under a separate program begun last year, the Fed also is buying about $45 billion in long-term Treasury securities each month. Those purchases are scheduled to end in December. Officials have said they will consider extending the program depending on the condition of the economy.
The central bank appears determined to press its campaign until it is certain of the results, so long as inflation remains under control. It has been chastened by a series of misjudgments, after declaring several times in recent years that the recovery was gaining strength only to conclude that more stimulus was needed.
William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, said in a speech this month that, as a consequence, the Fed had not done enough to support the economic recovery. ''With the benefit of hindsight,'' he said, ''monetary policy needed to be still more aggressive.''
A number of Fed officials also argue that the current policy would be more effective if the Fed defined a clear target for its efforts, like a level of unemployment or economic output. But consensus about the right target so far has proved elusive.

HEADLINE: Romney's Economic Model

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
Mitt Romney's best argument on the campaign trail has been simple: Under President Obama, the American economy has remained excruciatingly weak, far underperforming the White House's own projections.
That's a fair criticism.
But Obama's best response could be this: If you want to see how Romney's economic policies would work out, take a look at Europe. And weep.
In the last few years, Germany and Britain, in particular, have implemented precisely the policies that Romney favors, and they have been richly praised by Republicans here as a result. Yet these days those economies seem, to use a German technical term, kaput. 
Is Europe a fair comparison? Well, Republicans seem to think so, because they came up with it. In the last few years, they've repeatedly cited Republican-style austerity in places like Germany and Britain as a model for America.
Let's dial back the time machine and listen up:
''Europe is already setting an example for the U.S.,'' Representative Kenny Marchant, a Texas Republican, said in 2010. (You know things are bad when a Texas Republican is calling for Americans to study at the feet of those socialist Europeans.)
The same year, Karl Rove praised European austerity as a model for America and approvingly quoted the leader of the European Central Bank as saying: ''The idea that austerity measures could trigger stagnation is incorrect.''
Representative Steve King of Iowa, another Republican, praised Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany for preaching austerity and said: ''It ought to hit home to our president of the United States. It ought to hit all of us here in this country.''
''The president should learn a lesson from the 'German Miracle,' '' Representative Joe Wilson of South Carolina, a Republican, urged on the House floor in July 2011.
Also in 2011, Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, the top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee, denounced Obama's economic management and said: ''We need a budget with a bold vision -- like those unveiled in Britain and New Jersey.''
O.K. Let's see how that's working out.
New Jersey isn't overseas, but since Sessions and many other Republicans have hailed it as a shining model of austerity, let's start there. New Jersey ranked 47th in economic growth last year. When Gov. Chris Christie took office in 2010 and began to impose austerity measures, New Jersey ranked 35th in its unemployment rate; now it ranks 48th.
Senator Sessions, do we really aspire for the same in America as a whole?
Something similar has happened internationally. The International Monetary Fund this month downgraded its estimates for global economic growth, with only one major bright spot in the West. That would be the United States, expected to grow a bit more than 2 percent this year and next.
In contrast, Europe's economy is expected to shrink this year and have negligible growth next year. The I.M.F. projects that Germany will grow less than 1 percent this year and next, while Britain's economy is contracting this year.
Karl Rove, that sounds a lot like stagnation to me.
All this is exactly what economic textbooks predicted. Since Keynes, it's been understood that, in a downturn, governments should go into deficit to stimulate demand; that's how we got out of the Great Depression. And recent European data and I.M.F. analyses underscore that austerity in the middle of a downturn not only doesn't help but leads to even higher ratios of debt to economic output.
So, yes, Republicans have a legitimate point about the long-term need to curb deficits and entitlement growth. But, no, it isn't reasonable for Republicans to advocate austerity in the middle of a downturn. On that, they're empirically wrong.
If there were still doubt about this, we've had a lovely natural experiment in the last few years, as the Republicans in previous years were happy to point out. All industrialized countries experienced similar slowdowns, and the United States under Obama chose a massive stimulus while Germany and Britain chose Republican-endorsed austerity.
Neither approach worked brilliantly. Obama's initial economic stimulus created at least 1.4 million jobs, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. But that wasn't enough, and it was partly negated by austerity in state and local governments.
Still, America's economy is now the fastest growing among major countries in the West, and Britain's is shrinking. Which would you prefer?
I'm not suggesting Obama distribute bumper stickers saying: ''It Could Be Worse.'' He might want to stick with: ''Osama's Dead and G.M. Is Alive.''
Yes, there are differences between Europe and America. But Republicans were right to call attention to this empirical experiment.
The results are in. And, as Representative King suggested, the lessons ''ought to hit all of us here in this country.''

HEADLINE: Reid's Machine Powers Obama In Nevada Test

BYLINE: By ADAM NAGOURNEY

 BODY:
LAS VEGAS -- Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. sat onstage before a crowd of culinary workers here the other morning, listening intently to a man who is not on the ballot but might hold the key to a victory for President Obama in economically ravaged Nevada.
''Mr. Vice President, let me give you some real numbers here,'' Senator Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader, said to union members who had screamed ''Harry!'' when he poked his head around a curtain. ''These people and others have filled 26 field offices around Nevada and have made 3.2 million phone calls. Obama-Biden has 255 team leaders. Mr. Vice President, these folks have registered 70,000 new voters. Three hundred and twenty-five thousand door knocks.''
Mr. Reid has spent the last 10 years building a political machine that helped Mr. Obama win Nevada in 2008 and carried Mr. Reid to a re-election victory two years ago that stunned many pollsters. It is widely praised -- even by Republicans -- as one of the most effective voter-organizing and money-raising political organizations.
But the Reid machine is facing its biggest test yet. 
Mr. Reid's organization is a large reason that Mr. Obama is favored by many analysts to win narrowly in Nevada, despite what may be the worst economic climate in the nation and a sizable population of voters who, like Mitt Romney, are Mormons. Mr. Reid, who has long been strongly supportive of Mr. Obama in Washington -- he maneuvered the president's health care bill through legislative hoops to an unlikely victory in the Senate -- has made it clear that he views a victory for Mr. Obama in his state as a personal mission. This reflects not only his admiration for the president but also his visceral dislike for Mr. Romney, expressed in constant needling and attacks for almost six months.
Even more ambitiously (and perhaps more problematically), Mr. Reid is determined, friends say, to lift Representative Shelley Berkley, a Democrat, to victory over Senator Dean Heller, a Republican, as he seeks to make sure that he does not return to Washington next year as the Senate minority leader.
Mr. Romney is campaigning here for two days this week -- both he and Mr. Obama were in the state on Wednesday -- backed up by a surge of new advertising, reflecting the importance that both he and the president have placed on this state's six electoral votes.
In a contrast that has been noted by the Romney camp, the Nevada Republican Party has collapsed in a storm of factionalism and infighting between Tea Party conservatives and party regulars. A contingent of supporters of Representative Ron Paul of Texas, an unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate, ousted the party leadership in a showdown in the spring.
Mr. Romney's campaign responded by building a parallel political organization, Team Nevada, to match the combined forces of the Reid organization and Obama for America, which built on what Mr. Reid had in place. Aides to Mr. Romney said they had made considerable progress. Hundreds of Romney volunteers, many bused in from Southern California and Utah, gathered recently outside the campaign's headquarters at a Las Vegas shopping center before heading out in white vans to knock on doors in Clark County.
Still, the aides did not dispute the advantage that Mr. Reid had created for the president.
''Turnout is going to be important,'' said Ryan Erwin, Mr. Romney's senior adviser here. ''And, candidly, the Reid machine and the Democrats have been better and more disciplined than we have been for the better part of a decade.''
For all the ways that presidential elections are portrayed as national affairs -- and for all the technology that has transformed the relationship between candidates and voters -- the basic get-out-the-vote mechanics that have empowered political organizations for 100 years remain critical in elections. (Or, at least, close elections. A good organization can, at best, add two or three percentage points to a candidate's vote share, analysts said.)
The Reid army may be using modern tools -- volunteers can be spotted walking through neighborhoods with iPads linked to headquarters, feeding and updating information on potential voters -- but the intent is the same as ever: finding people who like your candidate and making sure they vote.
''Reid, working with various leaders of the Democratic Party, put together a very effective voting machine that's gotten better every election,'' said Eric Herzik, a professor of political science at the University of Nevada, Reno. ''Reid is the conduit to money for candidates, he is a conduit to organized labor, and he has great relations with multiple groups around the state.''
Several early indicators have attested to the effectiveness of the Democratic machine, which draws on the state party, powerful unions like the culinary group Mr. Reid spoke to last week, and the staff members and resources the Obama campaign dispatched to this state.
Voter registration in Nevada closed earlier this month, leaving the Democrats with an edge of 90,000 voters over the Republicans, up from an advantage of 60,000 voters two years ago, the secretary of state's office reported. (Mr. Reid understated the figure in his speech last week.) Democrats have substantially outpaced Republicans in early voting, another way to measure political organization.
The obstacles for Mr. Obama here are considerable. The state's unemployment rate was 11.8 percent in September, a drop from 12.1 percent the month before but still the highest in the nation, and the state has been racked by mortgage foreclosures.
''I don't think that anyone believes that Obama supporters are going to be as motivated this year as they were in 2008,'' said Mason Harrison, the communications director for Mr. Romney's campaign here.
In Mr. Reid, Republicans face an opponent who is fiercely combative and wily, with a command of the ebbs and flows of his state. He is loyal to those he likes (Barack Obama) and unrelenting against those he does not (Mitt Romney).
He has been one of Mr. Romney's top tormentors, at one point claiming that he had failed to pay any federal income taxes for the past 10 years, an assertion that was debunked when Mr. Romney released information on two years of income taxes.
''The man who is leading the Republican ticket for president of the United States is giving used-car salesmen a bad name,'' Mr. Reid said at the rally here.
Mr. Reid's campaign to rebuild the Democratic Party was motivated by self-preservation after he almost lost re-election to John Ensign in 1998 and Republicans went on in 2002 to sweep every contested statewide office.
He displayed his ability to turn out voters in 2010 when he defeated his Republican opponent, Sharron Angle, by five percentage points, after many analysts -- and polls -- predicted that he was headed for defeat.
Mr. Herzik said he had followed Reid workers to observe their efforts in neighborhoods. ''They are like dogs on meat,'' he said.
Mr. Erwin, the Romney adviser, said that for all the work he and other Republicans had done to catch up, he did not dispute that characterization.
''We do know how to run Republican organizations here -- for the first time since 2002, the Republican Party is strong,'' he said. ''But I don't harbor any misconceptions that we've caught up to something that Democrats have built up over a decade.''

HEADLINE: Crucial Subset: Female Voters Still Deciding

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE

 BODY:
DERRY, N.H. -- Emmakate Paris was a one-woman tornado the other day, whipping through the racks at the thrift shop here, hunting for clothes for her children and one special item for herself: a green suit. For Halloween, she wants to dress up as Tippi Hedren in the Hitchcock movie ''The Birds.''
Halloween is a small indulgence in a life that Ms. Paris, 41, said was consumed by worries -- ''about the kids, insurance, vacation, school, taxes, the price of gas, everything.''
She voted for Barack Obama in 2008 but is now torn. Mr. Obama has not lived up to his promise, she said. ''My husband and I both have to work full time, and we're just getting by.'' 
But she is not thrilled with Mitt Romney either. She said he would set women back because he did not understand their needs.
''Women worked so hard to get where we are today and to take our rights away from us is -- no,'' she said, shaking her head.
Behold the coveted female swing voter of 2012. She has slipped a rung or two down the economic ladder from the soccer moms of the more prosperous 1990s, as indicated by her new nickname --waitress mom. Rather than ferrying children around the suburbs in minivans, she is spinning in the hamster wheel of a tight economy and not getting ahead.
The intense competition for the female vote was underscored Wednesday as both presidential campaigns seized on a remark by Richard E. Mourdock, the Republican Senate candidate in Indiana, in a Tuesday night debate that pregnancy is ''something that God intended to happen'' even if it is the result of rape.
Mr. Romney, who had just made an ad for Mr. Mourdock, quickly distanced himself from the statement, while the Obama campaign just as quickly suggested that it reflected the backward thinking of Republicans and said that if elected, they would pose a danger to women's health.
The quadrennial obsession with winning over female voters can sometimes lead to mythmaking. Pollsters now question the validity of soccer moms as a distinct voting bloc; the term came into vogue in the 1996 presidential election but vanished soon after, to be replaced by the equally dubious post-9/11 ''security moms.''
Whether or not the term ''waitress moms'' endures, it defines a distinct demographic: blue-collar white women who did not attend college. And they are getting a lot of attention from both campaigns as the presidential race barrels toward its conclusion because even at this late date, pollsters say, many waitress moms have not settled on a candidate. They feel no loyalty to one party or the other, though they tend to side with Republicans.
''Blue-collar women are most likely to be the remaining movable part of the electorate, which is precisely why both campaigns are going at them as hard as they are,'' said Geoff Garin, a Democratic pollster, who is advising Priorities USA, a pro-Obama ''super PAC.''
About 9 percent of all voters in 2008 were white women without college degrees who had an annual household income of less than $50,000, according to exit polls.
So when the candidates talk about women, which they do a lot these days, the waitress moms are top of mind. Mr. Obama, for example, is now discussing abortion and birth control not as a matter of controlling one's own body but as ''a pocketbook issue for women and families,'' as he said in the recent town-hall-style debate, noting that many women rely on Planned Parenthood not just for contraceptives but for referrals and screenings.
A recent Romney ad featured a young woman telling her newborn: ''Dear Daughter. Welcome to America. Your share of Obama's debt is over $50,000.''
Clearly economic issues are front and center for women here in this blue-collar town in Rockingham County, which Mr. Obama won in 2008 by less than 1 percent of the vote.
Michelle Trulson, 39, actually is a waitress (not all waitress moms are waitresses, of course, nor are they all mothers). She works a second job too, as a lab technician. Fearing that Mr. Romney would undercut her efforts to provide for her family -- and end financing for Planned Parenthood -- she supports Mr. Obama.
''I'm a single mom,'' she said. ''I'm not on welfare. I do work. I don't collect food stamps. But my kids need insurance, so they're on Medicaid and I don't want that messed with.''
And the economy is the reason that Ashley Delpidio, 26, who works in customer service for a health insurance company, supports Mr. Romney -- despite his opposition to abortion rights and mixed statements on birth control.
''I'm a woman, so obviously I believe in woman's rights,'' she said but added that the economy was her overriding concern and Mr. Romney would do better at creating jobs.
While women in general have historically supported Democratic presidential candidates, working-class white women without college degrees are among their weakest links. Mr. Obama lost them to Hillary Rodham Clinton in the Democratic primaries in 2008, and to John McCain, the Republican, in the general election.
But Mr. Obama won women over all because black and Hispanic female voters turned out in greater numbers than usual and supported him overwhelmingly, as did white college-educated women. As he seeks to rebuild a winning coalition in battleground states like this one, analysts say, he needs to keep his losses among waitress moms to a minimum.
''Women are the volatile vote at the end, particularly independent, non-college-educated, married women,'' said Celinda Lake, a Democratic pollster who has long specialized in women's voting patterns. Important as these women are to both campaigns, they are only one slice of the much sliced and diced female electorate. Pollsters tend to find women more interesting than men because women are more likely to be swing voters, while men usually make up their minds early.
Pollsters have found differences among women in all kinds of ways that seem to correlate with their voting habits. Unmarried women, for example, tend to vote Democratic, they say, while married women tend to vote Republican.
The multiple differences among women have created a kind of kaleidoscopic inter-gender gap, from which catchy labels sometimes emerge. Apart from waitress moms, there are now ''Walmart moms,'' a group defined by Public Opinion Strategies, a Republican polling firm -- and adopted by the retail giant -- as any woman who has shopped at a Walmart in the last 30 days. They differ from waitress moms in that many have college degrees and higher incomes.
Actually, there is nothing about Walmart that pegs its shoppers as swing voters, said Will Feltus, senior vice president of National Media, which buys advertising time. Citing data from Scarborough Research, a leading market research firm, he said that a higher percentage of independent female voters was likely to be found at Lord & Taylor, T.J. Maxx and Macy's.
The data yield other tidbits that could be useful to campaigns trying to reach independent women. Their taste in television programming, for example, runs to the daytime soaps, their preferred soft drink is Diet Sierra Mist, and their preference in wine is, fittingly, rosé.
''Groups of women simply don't resemble each other anymore, which is really fascinating,'' said Kellyanne Fitzpatrick Conway, a Republican pollster -- whereas, she added, the gender gap between men and women had become fairly predictable.
''Mars versus Venus,'' she said, ''is a yawner.''

HEADLINE: The Health Care Plans of the Candidates

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Twisting the Facts About Health Care'' (editorial, Oct. 21):
Mitt Romney's health care plan offers 15 guiding principles, but appropriately leaves to Congress the resolution of most details. Obamacare's 2,400 pages were never understood even before passage, push all risk to taxpayers and promise economic disaster.
Coverage without penalty for pre-existing conditions is appropriate if penalties for lack of insurance are sufficient to make mandatory coverage a reality. Unfortunately, Obamacare's penalties are small enough that many will continue without coverage until illness forces their hand, with taxpayers subsidizing their earlier irresponsibility. 
While Mr. Romney's Medicare principles may be more costly to many, without revamping the existing system Medicare will go broke. Requiring those who can afford it to spend more is the only effective solution. Simply cutting provider reimbursement will lead many providers to abandon Medicare recipients, reducing health care availability.
Finally, Medicaid block grants may be the only way to stop spending escalation in states like New York, whose Medicaid tab now exceeds California's despite having half the population. Why should the rest of the country pay for New York's costly choices?
Nobody has the perfect solution, but dismissing Mitt Romney's ideas wholesale and swallowing Obamacare in full will surely bankrupt us all.
KEN FREEMAN Kinnelon, N.J., Oct. 22, 2012
To the Editor:
The problem with Sarah Palin's ''death panels,'' reconfigured as Mitt Romney's description of the reform law's ''unelected board that's 'ultimately' going to tell people what treatments they can have,'' is not that they don't exist but that they do. They do not exist under Obamacare; rather, they are the insurance companies that have been rationing health care for decades.
They exist only to serve the companies' bottom lines, their executives and their shareholders.
Would I rather have the D.M.V. managing my health care, as Speaker John A. Boehner once mockingly suggested? You betcha.
RICHARD M. AUERBACH New York, Oct. 21, 2012
To the Editor:
You say the job of the Obamacare advisory panel is to ''propose cuts to providers and insurers if necessary to meet budget targets.'' Payments to physicians in the Medicaid program are already so low that only a fraction of America's doctors will even treat a Medicaid patient.
Medicare pays more, but not enough to keep tens of thousands of doctors from dropping out of it every year.
A result of this unhealthy trend is that more taxpayers are having a harder time finding a doctor willing to treat them. Under Obamacare it's going to get only worse, particularly for seniors.
You further say the reform law lowers the rate of increase in payments to providers ''to force them to become more efficient.'' Force? More efficient? Really.
Well, what if doctors like me decide that the menacing threat of an audit and a big fine for a minor coding infraction, the mountains of red tape, and the low payments we receive from Medicare for the long hours and longer after-hours we put in to take care of our seniors are not worth it anymore?
What if the ''efficiencies'' the government is pushing, like electronic medical records, turn out to be a mirage, which most have? What if doctors like me say: ''Wait a minute. I have enough patients who pay cash or are well insured to keep me busy from morning until night?''
What if the most efficient thing for doctors to do is not participate in Obamacare?

HEADLINE: Broaching Poverty, Ryan Expresses Empathy

BYLINE: By TRIP GABRIEL

 BODY:
Extending the Republican ticket's lean toward the middle, Representative Paul D. Ryan expressed compassion for Americans in poverty and laid out a vision for fixing the broken engine of upward mobility. 
Poverty has been all but absent from the speeches of Mr. Ryan and Mitt Romney, except when they accuse President Obama of presiding over years of increased reliance on food stamps and the highest poverty rate in a generation.
But on Wednesday, Mr. Ryan struck a notably empathetic tone toward the poor, even if he did not offer new antipoverty proposals.
"Americans are a compassionate people, and there's a consensus in this country about our fundamental obligations to society's most vulnerable," Mr. Ryan said.
He spoke in Cleveland, in Cuyahoga County, where Mr. Obama won his largest margin of any Ohio county in 2008. The Republican ticket's furious effort to wrest the state from Mr. Obama has brought Mr. Ryan and Mr. Romney not only into traditional Republican strongholds, but to Democratic bastions as well, in hope of prying away voters disappointed by the president.
Last week, in nearby Youngstown, Mr. Ryan staged a photo opportunity at a soup kitchen, where he tied on an apron and scrubbed a few pans.
Mr. Ryan cited grim numbers -- 46 million people living below the poverty line, a high school dropout rate of 50 percent in major cities.
"In this war on poverty, poverty is winning," he said. "So what is the alternative approach that Mitt Romney and I are offering?"
He made the traditional conservative case that government antipoverty programs create a "culture of dependency," implying that they be significantly scaled back. He argued that the best route out of poverty lies in an unfettered free-enterprise economy that robustly creates jobs.
"We need a real recovery," Mr. Ryan said. "Mitt Romney is uniquely qualified and ready to deliver this recovery - because he understands how an economy works and what makes it grow."
Mr. Ryan agreed that government has a role to provide a "safety net." But he called for reforming Medicaid and the food stamp program to remove federal mandates and let states manage the antipoverty programs.
In a response, the Obama campaign cited an analysis of the House budget Mr. Ryan wrote, by the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which said it would "impose extraordinary cuts in programs that serve as a lifeline for our nation's poorest and most vulnerable citizens."
"The American people understand that Mitt Romney would take us back, and no change in rhetoric in the campaign's final weeks can change that," Danny Kanner, a spokesman for the Obama campaign, said in a statement.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In N.A.S.L., Minnesota on Road to Another Title, and Perhaps Oblivion

BYLINE: JACK BELL


HIGHLIGHT: The Minnesota Stars of the N.A.S.L. are seeking their second consecutive league title, but the league-owned club may not be around long to celebrate. 

 BODY:
In what sport, in what universe, could a team potentially win its second consecutive league title and then turn out the lights ... for good?
Welcome to soccer in North America and the Minnesota Stars of the N.A.S.L.
The Stars, who play about 20 miles north of Minneapolis-St. Paul, have a chance to defend their title when they face the Tampa Bay Rowdies this weekend. Minnesota won the first leg of the two-game series last week at the National Sports Center in Blaine, Minn., before a crowd of more than 4,000. The return match will be played at Al Lang Stadium in St. Petersburg, Fla., on Saturday night. The Stars finished the regular season in sixth place in the eight-team league before ousting Puerto Rico and then top-seeded San Antonio.
The issue for the soccer team in Minnesota, one that has been around in various incarnations for the past 23 years, is that the Stars are now owned by the North American Soccer League. The owners of the league's other eight teams (nine if you count the incoming New York Cosmos) will vote on whether to continue to finance the club beyond Dec. 31. That vote is scheduled for this weekend.
"There have been other league owned and operated teams in various sports, Phoenix in the N.H.L. and New Orleans in the N.B.A.," the N.A.S.L. Commissioner David Downs said in a telephone interview from league headquarters in Miami. "This is a very unique situation and I think there are two truisms: It makes no sense for a league to own and operate a team in the long run. This was an emergency situation to ensure the league has the minimum number of teams [eight] to be the second division as established by the federation. By the same token, it is absolutely fair to say the league highly values the Minneapolis-St. Paul market. It is a top 15 market and is quite good for us to be in. With our economic model a team should thrive in a market that size with long history of support for professional soccer."
Downs, a former television executive who was also the head of the United States group that was trying to land the 2018 or 2022 World Cups, has been the league's top executive for the past two seasons, but said he planned to step down before next season and retire. The N.A.S.L. expanded this year to San Antonio and will add the Cosmos next year. Traffic, the Brazil-based sports marketing company, is a major player in the N.A.S.L., running three teams.
In Minnesota, the Stars have been seeking a local owner to buy the club, at a modest cost (the entry fee for a new franchise is only $1.5 million and the cost of buying an existing team is comparable) in the hope new management could move the team to a new urban stadium. One stumbling block has been the emergence of the N.F.L.'s Minnesota Vikings, who in negotiations with the state and city for a new stadium in Minneapolis secured the exclusive rights for five years (beginning in 2016) to an M.L.S. team.
"The commitment to the Vikings is not with M.L.S. and it is in a particular venue," said the Stars' top executive, Djorn Buchholz. Buchholz previously worked for the Stars' predecessor, the Thunder, went to work with the league club in Austin after the Thunder folded and then was appointed by the league to run the Minnesota franchise in the absence of an independent owner. "It doesn't prohibit anyone from doing it sooner."
Professional soccer in Minnesota has a long and storied history, dating to the original N.A.S.L. and the Minnesota Kicks, who often drew crowds in excess of 40,000 to Metropolitan Stadium, which is now the site of the Mall of America in suburban Bloomington. Since the demise of the first N.A.S.L. in the mid-1980s, soccer in Minnesota has seen the Thunder and the N.S.C. Stars come and go, while playing in the United Soccer Leagues and now the reborn N.A.S.L.
"I'm cautiously optimistic," Buchholz said about the prospect of finding a new owner. "This is an important weekend. Winning the championship again would make a decision by the board more difficult than it already is. Winning the championship two years in a row makes the team more attractive."
According to Downs, there is one local Minnesota person deeply interested in buying the team, though he declined to identify him.
"Everybody wants Minnesota to stay around," Buchholz said. "It's a matter making it happen."
Though the league remains the designated second division in the United States soccer pyramid, several N.A.S.L. teams -- the Portland Timbers, Vancouver Whitecaps and Montreal Impact -- have all graduated up the ladder to Major League Soccer. And on the horizon for the N.A.S.L. is a potential working agreement with M.L.S. to accept more players on loan or perhaps allow M.L.S. reserve teams to play in the league, as is the case in places like Germany.

HEADLINE: Lazard's Profit Fell 33% in 3rd Quarter

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Lazard said its third-quarter profit fell 33 percent, adding that it was taking steps to cut about $125 million in annual costs, including through layoffs and lower compensation. 

 BODY:
The investment bank Lazard said on Thursday that profit fell 33 percent in the third quarter from the period a year earlier, as the business of advising companies on mergers and bankruptcies declined.
And under pressure from investors like the activist Nelson Peltz, the firm said it was taking steps to reduce annual costs about $125 million, including through layoffs.
Lazard said it earned $35 million in adjusted profit for the quarter, amounting to 26 cents a share. That still exceeded the average analyst estimate of 22 cents a share, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
 Using generally accepted accounting principles, Lazard's profit fell 47 percent, to $33 million.
With the emergence of Mr. Peltz's Trian as a major investor with a 5.1 percent stake, Lazard has embarked on a series of initiatives aimed at both cutting costs and returning more money to shareholders. 
Much of the plan is expected to be completed by the end of the fourth quarter, with results showing over the next two years. They include cutting $85 million in compensation-related expenses and $40 million in noncompensation costs.
Kenneth M. Jacobs, Lazard's chairman and chief executive, said on a conference call with analysts that he expected the cuts to have a "minimal" effect on revenue.
The relative lack of confidence among would-be corporate buyers was evident in the firm's results. Financial advisory revenue was down 13 percent, at $220 million, and both deal and restructuring results were down by double digits. 
Still, Lazard executives argue that their firm is still performing above expectations, landing big cross-border mandates. The firm is involved in several of the biggest deals of the year, including T-Mobile USA's proposed merger with MetroPCS, Anheuser-Busch InBev's $20.1 billion purchase of the rest of Grupo Modelo and Walgreens' deal for an eventual takeover of Alliance Boots.
"We're up when the market's down," Mr. Jacobs told DealBook on Thursday. "That's pretty good outperformance."
He added that many factors for increased deal-making, including rising valuations and the general availability of financing, were present. But clients still showed uncertainty about the economic environment and potential hurdles like the so-called fiscal cliff in the United States, somewhat dampening an appetite for riskier transactions.
Lazard's asset-management arm, which is meant to provide a stable counterweight to the more volatile advisory business, was up slightly. Revenue rose 2 percent, to $220.3 million, as incentive fees grew by double-digits. Its assets under management also increased 8 percent from the second quarter, to $160 billion.
Separately, the firm announced that it had added an outsider, a former Goldman Sachs banker Andrew Alper, to its board.
Shares in Lazard rose 4.4 percent by midday on Thursday, to $29.51.

HEADLINE: What Do Employers Seek in Graduates?

BYLINE: JOYCE LAU


HIGHLIGHT: An IHT Special Report on Education looks at how globalization is affecting the strategies of universities and colleges worldwide as they prepare students to enter a tough job market. Top Asian schools have altered their approaches and improved their standings, while European schools are creating new programs to be more competitive. 

 BODY:
A French consulting firm, Emerging, asked thousands of executives, managers and recruiters from 20 countries to rank universities based on the desirability of their graduates as potential employees.
There are endless rankings being produced these days, measuring every conceivable facet of a university education, from research and teaching, to academic performance, admissions and cost. 
Emerging's list, which was released exclusively in an IHT education report today, can basically be summed up in a question: "You're the boss - which graduate would you pay a salary to work for you?"
Emerging's top 10 looked similar to most top 10s, in that it was dominated by the Ivy League, Oxbridge and top Western schools: 
Universities with the most employable students
1. Harvard
2. Yale
3. Cambridge
4. Oxford
5. Stanford
6. M.I.T.
7. Columbia
8. Princeton
9. Imperial College London
10. Goethe-University Frankfurt am Main
But as Christopher F. Schuetze reports, Asian schools have been edging their way from the bottom, to the middle, to nearly the top. In the past year, Peking University jumped from 109 to 11; the Indian Institute of Science from 134 to 35; Shanghai Jiao Tong from 139 to 44; and the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology from 94 to 46.
Asia-Pacific universities with the most employable students
1. Peking University
2. Tokyo Institute of Technology
3. University of Tokyo
4. Fudan University, Shanghai
5. Monash University, Australia
6. Australian National University
7. Indian Institute of Science
8. National University of Singapore
9. Shanghai Jiao Tong University
10. Hong Kong University of Science and Technology 
Did some schools really improve the quality of their academic offerings so much in just one year? Not necessarily, since employers look for more than just classroom performance. Some experts say that those with cultural experience, language skills and professional contacts related to growing Asia-Pacific economies may be in higher demand.
One article in the special report examines how Asian institutions have been creating more globally minded prorgrams to meet demand. Miki Tanikawa visited the business school at the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, or Kaist, which is ranked No. 129 on the Emerging list. It might not be an obvious, immediate choice for international M.B.A. applicants, but its focus on engineering, English education and foreign exchange is drawing attention overseas.
Chris also looks at how Europeans are trying to play catch-up to the United States in teaching e-business. Though, for now, the birthplace of Google, Facebook and Silicon Valley is still miles ahead of everyone else.
Finally, for aspiring masters of the universe, D.D. Guttenplan checks out a one-year master of science course in proprietary trading, developed in part by Futex. The best-performing recruits will be allowed to trade in real time, with the company's real money. Now that's real proof of confidence in a graduate - when you hand over the purse strings.

HEADLINE: Daily Report: Zynga Stays in the Game

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Zynga is letting employees go, shutting games and losing players. When warned that its third-quarter numbers would be a pre-Halloween horror, investors started thinking about the apocalypse. But the results were not quite as bad as that, David Streitfeld reports in Thursday's New York Times. 

 BODY:
 Zynga, which practically invented the notion of using Facebook as a games platform, is laying off employees, shutting games and losing players. When warned that its third-quarter numbers would be a pre-Halloween horror, investors started thinking about the apocalypse.
The results, released after the market closed Wednesday, were not quite as bad as that, David Streitfeld reports in Thursday's New York Times. In addition, the company announced a partnership to offer online casino games in Britain where gamblers can wager real money. Such games, which have been banned in the United States, are promoted as highly profitable.
Third-quarter revenue was $317 million, an improvement over the $300 million to $305 million the company forecast in early October when it warned that tough times were ahead. The number was also significantly higher than the $256 million that downbeat analysts had expected. But revenue was only 3 percent better than in 2011.
Still, the stock immediately spiked, and was up 13 percent in morning trading at $2.40. Zynga shares are down 75 percent from their public offering price last December, and have dropped even more from the level at which executives and early investors cashed out last spring in an unusual $500 million secondary offering.
"In less than 10 months, Zynga has gone from a massive global growth story to a cost-cutting restructuring story," said Richard Greenfield, an analyst at BTIG Research. "How did the rug get pulled out from under them so fast? It still amazes us."
Mr. Greenfield pointed to a new Zynga game, the Ville, in which players create the home of their dreams. In an economy in which hardly anyone can afford to do this in real life, Zynga had high hopes some players would spend money to do it virtually. The Ville was introduced in June and had 7.3 million daily users at the end of July. Today there are 1.7 million.
"The decay curve, the half-life, is shortening," Mr. Greenfield said. "It's staggering how fast some of these games have fallen off."

HEADLINE: Evercore Profit Falls in Weak M.&A. Climate

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: Evercore Partners said profit slipped 13 percent in the third quarter, as it grappled with a slowdown in its advisory and investment management businesses. 

 BODY:
The investment bank Evercore Partners said on Thursday that profit slipped 13 percent in the third quarter from the period a year earlier, as the firm grappled with a slowdown in its advisory and investment management businesses.
Evercore reported $17.3 million in adjusted pro forma net income from continuing operations, or about 40 cents a share. The result handily exceeded the average analyst estimate of 33 cents a share, according to Standard & Poor's Capital IQ.
Firms that specialize in deal advisory services, like Evercore and Lazard, have been confronted with a slower mergers environment. Despite the absence of blockbuster transactions, however, Evercore said it had found ways to increase its share of the M.&A. market.
 Evercore advised on deals like the spinoff of the Kraft North American grocery business from what is now known as Mondelez International, as well as aiding MetroPCS in its proposed takeover by T-Mobile USA.
"We are pleased with our third-quarter results, reporting our third-best quarter for revenue on sustained strong performance in our advisory business," Ralph Schlosstein, Evercore's chief executive, said in a statement.
Still, the firm's investment management division posted a 15 percent drop in revenue for the quarter, with a 2 percent quarter-on-quarter decline in assets under management. Much of that came from lower revenue in the division's core institutional asset management operation. 
Evercore also said it continued to hold the line on expenses, with its compensation ratio falling slightly, to 60 percent. 
Shares in the firm jumped 7.5 percent by midday on Thursday, to $27.57.

HEADLINE: The Shift Toward Law School Specialization

BYLINE: VICTOR FLEISCHER


HIGHLIGHT: Instead of just offering the traditional, general legal education, law schools may want to considering playing matchmaker, guiding students toward specialties that are likely to endure, including tax or securities law. 

 BODY:
The twilight of the generalist law degree is here. 
AsPeter Lattman reported last week, New York University School of Law is retrofitting its third-year curriculum to allow for increased specialization. Options include advanced study in areas like tax or corporate law, working in Washington at a federal agency or foreign study in Buenos Aires, Paris or Shanghai. 
While the study-abroad aspect of the program has received much of the attention, the heart of the proposal is an important shift toward specialization. 
In the traditional model of legal education, schools offer a general professional degree in law. No majors or concentrations. Schools provide a strong foundation of legal analysis and grounding in the common law, on the assumption that law firms will teach new associates the specifics of what they need to practice law, whether that means drafting deal documents or taking a deposition. 
In the emerging model, law students must add on a degree, certificate or other indication of readiness to engage in a particular practice area or industry. N.Y.U.'s strategy committeedescribed this goal as providing "professional pathways that prepare students to operate in a world that demands increasing specialization." (Full disclosure: I was a visiting professor of law at N.Y.U. in 2010.)
Law schools, like most established enterprises, change only when they have to. In this case, the ripples of change arising from the segmentation of the market for legal services have been felt by corporate clients, law firms and law schools. 
Corporate clients are more savvy, sophisticated and cost-aware. Routine legal work is increasingly outsourced offshore, outsourced to contract attorneys or performed by professionals who do not have a Juris Doctor degree. 
Law school graduates who fail to land one of the shrinking number jobs at big law firms find themselves moving down-market to small law firms for low pay, or competing with college graduates and M.B.A.'s for jobs in compliance, risk management or business development. 
Law firms are struggling with the new normal of a segmented industry. The new economics of the profession are marked by increased lateral mobility among partners, increasing numbers of nonequity partners, increased client scrutiny of fees and a decrease in the routine legal work that used to support the pyramid model. As a result, it is harder for law firms to devote nonbillable time to training entry-level associates. Law graduates are expected to arrive knowing more than just how to "think like a lawyer." The tricky part for law schools is trying to figure out what, exactly, they need to know. 
In my view, law schools should play matchmaker, guiding students toward specialties that are likely to endure. Big firm attorneys in some practice areas will continue to have a comparative advantage over low-cost attorneys, in-house lawyers and other professionals. One area is bet-the-company litigation, where high stakes justify high fees. Another is mergers and acquisitions and securities work, where, in addition to negotiating and drafting documents, lawyers usually quarterback the deal to closing. A third area is any practice that demands highly specialized legal and regulatory knowledge, like bankruptcy, tax and financial regulation. The knowledge required is intrinsically legal and cannot be easily moved offshore or outsourced to nonlawyers or contract attorneys.
N.Y.U.'s shift toward specialization is more significant than it might appear. The school's lawyering program, which is mandatory for all first-year law students, will now include a module on business and financial literacy. N.Y.U. is also introducing an upper division course that will provide an introduction to statistics, accounting and quantitative analysis, which may be followed with additional courses on deals. 
Other schools ought to consider a full first-year deals course, which could also provide a more comprehensive introduction to accounting and finance. But the first-year curriculum is the third rail of law school faculty politics - adding a smidgen of finance to the One-L curriculum is comparable to means-testing Social Security. It's a big step.
Brian Leiter, a well-respected scholar and leading figure in legal education, criticized this aspect of the N.Y.U. plan, noting that the financial literacy course "seems an important kind of course to make available to law students, but to require it seems to involve an assumption about career paths that isn't warranted." 
Few law students go into academia or become public defenders. But the more common narrative is for law students to arrive at law school with a vague notion of doing international or environmental law, then meander aimlessly around the curriculum. Eventually, realizing that gainful employment is probably a good idea, they find themselves in a job interview wondering what in the world a bond covenant is. At that point, offering an elective course in accounting and finance is too little, too late.
Tax can serve as a model for this shift toward specialization. The tax L.L.M., or Master of Law degree, is perhaps the one example of specialized legal education that has already proved successful for both schools and students, at least at the top programs. A tax L.L.M. builds on foundational law school training (unlike a master's degree in tax accounting), and it signals a breadth and depth of tax knowledge that cannot be readily provided by low-cost competitors. Even as the number of large law firm jobs has declined, tax L.L.M.'s have the option of competing for good jobs in accounting firms. Several schools now offer three-year J.D.-tax L.L.M. programs.
Could the same approach work in other areas of law that demand specialized legal expertise, like securities law, banking law or patent law? The critical question is whether there is sufficient market demand to supply an adequate number of jobs with six-figure salaries. 
Promising areas are government relations, energy and regulated industries, health care, telecommunications and intellectual property, and financial regulation. There is a risk that schools will guess wrong on this question, leaving students with a useless certification. But the alternative to specialization is the status quo. 
And the one thing we do know from the data is that private sector demand for smart but financially illiterate law graduates with a general professional degree and no particular industry expertise is, to say the least, dwindling.
None of this solves the broader problem at nonelite schools: the supply of law graduates simply exceeds market demand. The median salary of law school graduates at many schools is about $50,000, while average debt load is now over $100,000. As specialization takes hold, the next logical step is to lobby the American Bar Association to make the J.D. a two-year degree, with an optional third year of specialization for schools where that makes sense. 
For further reading on the current state of legal education, see Brian Z. Tamanaha's "Failing Law Schools" (University of Chicago Press, 2012).

HEADLINE: An Office With an Unexpected View

BYLINE: JON REINER


HIGHLIGHT: A few unemployed people answered an ad on Craigslist, and then things got weird. 

 BODY:
"This is where the movie 'Working Girl' was shot," the coordinator says. "You know, the conference room with the view where that big scene happens, and Melanie Griffith comes out on top." She's stout in a lumpy jacket, and gives off a draft of suppressed ambition, a knowledge of something triumphant that's finagling to surface. 
She's also right. It's the first day of summer, and the 21st-floor view of Ellis Island, the Statue of Liberty and the heaving ferries in New York harbor is a master-of-the-universe kind of panorama. But the office itself, instead of being alive with strivers, is deserted - barren cubicles like empty ice trays, phone jacks forsaken in the grimed walls, overhead fluorescents dark, no paper trail in the trash bins.
The five of us who answered the Craigslist posting about participating in a focus group - Speak with mid-career professionals about getting back to work. Two hundred dollars for a half day - have already been waiting for two hours. We got to know one another in a steamy Au Bon Pain on the building's ground floor, each offering tortured evasions about what we do - "I consult," "I freelance," "I'm an entrepreneur." "I write," I said. "I have a memoir that's been published," stopping short of explaining the uncertainty of the book business. Finally one of the men - I'll call him Harold - a sharpshooter with a fleshy face, pulled back the curtain. "So, we're all unemployed. Four years for me. How long for you?" 
If you have to lie to other people just like you, then you really are in exile. I dropped the charade and confessed to five years since I last worked in an office, in marketing. The others followed: three years from finance; four years from insurance; two years from law. 
We had been instructed to wear business attire, and by the time the coordinator finally came to get us, our stiff collars and dresses were pooled dark with sweat. When I put on the suit, I had assumed it was for a good reason, but this whole setup seemed sketchy. I had to get my kids from school in another two hours, but the last thing I wanted to do was walk out early and blow the money. When we were called up to "Working Girl" land, I fished out of my jacket pocket a sticky building security pass from two years back, the last time I had occasion to dress like this. 
Inside the conference room, the coordinator apologizes for the delay and says: "I'm going to bring in the speaker now." I expect a suit, a blowhard who will glaze us over with "new paradigm" or "market engagement" or "optics." Instead, the person standing uneasily at the table head is a young woman, wearing no makeup, with a spiky crown of bleached hair and a black jacket bunched at the elbows. She introduces herself as a songwriter and performer, and says she's here to talk about the state of the music business and how to make it in a digital world.
This could be all right. I have no designs on a career in the music business, but I can take two hours of jittery rock star speak for $200 in cash. The situation doesn't really make any sense, but I'm used to that. I'll stop at the market on the way home and buy fish for dinner.
But then I notice that the speaker isn't speaking. Her eyes are shifting between the unemployables at the table and the bank of windows, like she's expecting a signal. She says nothing. An uncomfortable minute passes, then a second, while we wait for her words of wisdom about how to make it in the new world order. We feel in the silence a sense of failure, of something gone unexpectedly wrong, of following directions to nowhere. After years out of work, it's not an unfamiliar feeling - I've become conditioned to accept it without panic. Judging from the crimson nesting on the speaker's hollowed cheeks, she's not there yet.
I'm distracted by the sound of a motor coming from outside the building, a whirring stop, start, that seems to be getting closer to our floor. Suddenly a metal scaffold drops down by the windows, and hangs there. We look to the speaker but she is frozen still, her blank expression fixed on us, ignoring what we now all see.
A man dressed in a dark suit and bright tie, mugging like a carny, stands bowlegged on the scaffold. He holds up a stack of lettered signs and flips through them like he's cuing a monologue:
"Let's drink to you getting out of here before 6." 
"Cheers to less work and more play." 
"Come have a drink (on us)."
Only when the man on the ledge sets down his placards do I realize what I'd missed: a camera rig propped on the scaffold, shooting us through the window. I recognize the camera - a model I marketed two jobs ago. Perhaps if I'd sold more of them 
"Cut," our coordinator calls. Three 20-somethings with walkie-talkies enter through the conference room door and confer with her in a corner. After some whispering, she addresses us: "So, this isn't really a focus group. It's a hidden-camera commercial for a vodka company that's going to be broadcast on the Web. The premise is to get people in a business meeting to look really surprised and excited about the prospect of leaving their meeting for a good time."
Harold laughs and the four of us follow his lead. We're less amused by the ad agency's conceit than we are by the surreal fact that here we are - unemployed and getting paid to show up in a vacant office where we pretend to wish we were drinking vodka instead of working. 
Then, even from the perspective of those of us who have supposedly given up looking for jobs that don't exist, reality falls totally off the cliff.
"You guys were really great," the coordinator cheerleads unconvincingly. "But, the director wants you to be more animated, to get up and walk over to the window, gesture, look confused, wave your hands, figure it out, then turn and run out of the room, like you're transformed, like your lives have changed for the better. The reality wasn't quite what the director had in mind, so we're going to shoot it again, and we want you to act this time, like I said, but spontaneous and real. O.K?"
"O.K.," we say, numb but game.
The crew clears out and the rig rises out of view. The five of us practice acting real, hitting our marks by the window with broad caricatures of posture and expression, a poor man's reincarnation of what Melanie Griffith and Harrison Ford performed in this space. Again, 10 minutes drag to 30, and we risk over-rehearsing our spontaneity into staleness. After an hour, the coordinator comes back into the room holding five envelopes.
"We can't get the scaffold to work," she says, not terribly bothered by the fact that the people who are supposed to be making things work can't. Perhaps, in the recession years, the people with jobs have also gotten used to following directions to nowhere. That didn't occur to me all the time I was making calls and sending out résumés, trying to get back to a place I imagined still existed. "There's some mechanical problem and it's stuck on the floor above us. If we take any longer we'll start getting into overtime, and that will be expensive, so we'll go with what we shot. We're releasing you."
I open my envelope in the conference room and count the twenties, not too proud to wait until I'm outside. Not bad for a half-day of work, if that's what it was.

HEADLINE: David Einhorn Continues His Take Down of Fed Policy

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: The hedge fund manager says the central bank's loose-money policy is hindering economic growth, an argument he expanded on during a conference in New York on Thursday. 

 BODY:
It's David Einhorn versus the Fed. 
Mr. Einhorn, the head of Greenlight Capital, is known for his contrarian views, but rarely have his foes been as powerful as the Federal Reserve. The hedge fund manager says the central bank's loose-money policy is hindering economic growth, an argument he expanded on during a conference in New York on Thursday.
"We would be way better off if we did pretty much the opposite of the current monetary policy," Mr. Einhorn said, at the Buttonwood Gathering, hosted by The Economist magazine.
Policy leaders, he said, are engaged in a "reflexive groupthink" in support of the Fed's efforts. Although prominent economists have endorsed the Fed's policy, Mr. Einhorn said that his job as an investor was to "figure out how people actually behave."
Mr. Einhorn insisted that the Fed, by keeping interest rates near zero, was hurting savers and therefore stifling spending and other economic activity. His argument on Thursday echoed the critique of the Fed in Greenlight's latest quarterly letter, which compares recent central bank policy to American Express cards.
Mr. Einhorn has been building this argument for some time. In May, he said in a blog post on The Huffington Post that the Fed's easy money was like an excess of jelly doughnuts.
Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, tackled some of these arguments during a news conference last month, saying that the rising stock prices that come with quantitative easing tend to make people feel wealthier.
But on Thursday, Mr. Einhorn said Mr. Bernanke's argument took its own conclusion for granted: namely, that the Fed's policy promoted growth.
With the Fed pledging to continue on this track for the foreseeable future, Mr. Einhorn's firm has stuck with "a large allocation to gold," according to the investor letter. Gold made a "material contribution" to the firm's performance in the quarter, the letter said.
Other hedge fund managers also took contrarian views as well in other sectors.
Hugh Hendry, who runs the London-based Eclectica Asset Management, offered bearish views on China and Japan when he spoke earlier in the day. Calling himself an "existentialist" and a "student of uncertainty," Mr. Hendry said he was long gold and short the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index.
Others like John A. Paulson, also have a penchant for gold and and a tendency toward gloom. But Mr. Hendry took it a step further. "I'm here to tell you that God is dead," he said on Thursday, referring to the principles of Albert Camus. "I'm sorry about that."
He suggested that the public nature of the conference was preventing him from speaking freely.
"Am I sitting here with video cameras saying the Chinese economy is going to contract 23 percent? Of course I'm not," he said. "But if we have a coffee later, I might say something different."

HEADLINE: A Multitude of Oysters? Looks Can Be Deceiving

BYLINE: EMMA BRYCE


HIGHLIGHT: One setback after another has slowed the recovery of Louisiana's oyster industry. 

 BODY:
Watching a professional shuck oysters is hypnotic. With thick-gloved hands, he steadies the mollusk on a cushion of cloth stained with gray juice and grit. Next he drives a stubby blade into the valve that separates the two shells, wiggling it to slice through the muscle that clamps them shut. Then he jerks the oyster open, and the scent of salt and sea wafts through the air.
Finally, with a flick of his wrist, the shucker flings away the flat side of the shell and inspects the meat encased in the remaining half. If it's good, it is added to a tray that will be hurried out to hungry customers. They may add a dash of lemon and hot sauce before gulping down each glistening blob.
It's an industry that ticks along like a metronome in New Orleans, where I recently spent a long weekend. Restaurants in the French Quarter were full every night of my stay, and part of the draw was the oyster harvest, which began in early October.
With roughly two million acres of public and private oyster beds and annual revenue of $350 million, Louisiana's oyster industry is the largest in the United States. New Orleans prides itself on being the "oyster capital" and has devised endless ways to prepare the delicacy -- pannéed, broiled or baked; in sandwiches, stews or pies; or most traditionally, raw on the half shell.
Still, the industry has yet to bounce back from recent calamities that took a heavy toll on the state's coastal estuaries, where freshwater meets seawater and oysters form part of the ecosystem's bedrock. "The word I would use for recovery is that it's 'beginning,' " said John Supan, an oyster specialist at Louisiana State University who is the director of the Sea Grant Grand Isle oyster hatchery.
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina upended vast networks of reefs along the Gulf Coast. Then came the Deepwater Horizon spill of 2010, which sent oil coursing through the marshes. Oyster beds were disrupted again in late August of this year by the gales and pounding rains of Hurricane Isaac, which sowed muck that impeded the seasonal start of production.
Sal Sunseri, sales manager at the P&J Oyster Company in New Orleans, the oldest shucking operation in the United States, said that while business has gradually been improving since the 2010 spill, the company is still at only 35 percent of its normal production - and the company has yet to resume shucking its own oysters.
Still, it's hard to fully quantify the impacts of storms and spills because the estuarine oyster beds go through natural dips and surges of their own. Louisiana's seem to be undergoing a natural recession at the moment, so "it's hard to say what the man-made impact is, superimposed over the tremendous variation that exists naturally," said Thomas Soniat, a biology professor at the University of New Orleans.
It's particularly difficult to measure the impact of the oil that sullied the estuaries in 2010 and the tar balls that return during major storms in the gulf region.
One ecological shock that scientists target with more confidence is the freshwater diversion of 2010, when Gov. Bobby Jindall ordered the opening of giant valves to pump freshwater into the Mississippi in an effort to force out some of the oil that was seeping in. The diversion severely damaged the oyster beds, which thrive only in a delicate balance of saltwater and fresh.
Mr. Sunseri of P&J Oyster said there was no question that the torrents of freshwater damaged his business. "The approach of an oysterman is to create smaller diversions that replicate the way it used to be -- not these big major diversions that change the environment," he said. Dr. Soniat said the mortality rate was 98 percent in some oyster beds.
Adding to the challenge of recovery, the waves unleashed by Hurricane Isaac churned up marshlands, causing them to release what is known as overburden, an influx of loosened marsh grasses that is then cast atop the reefs. Uprooted, the vegetation rots and bacteria then thrive, sapping the estuarine water of oxygen and effectively suffocating the oysters.
The only solution is dredging. "The challenge is to get out there and clean the reef as well as you can," said Dr. Supan, the Louisiana State researcher. By "raking'' the reefs, the dredgers free oysters from this toxic soup by turning them over "like you're plowing a field," he said.
Ultimately, the most prudent strategy is active reef management, Dr. Supan said. Traditionally, oyster production in the gulf allowed nature to take its course. But other avenues have recently proved attractive.
"Really, when you're managing oyster resources, there are two words: 'plant cultch,' he said. Cultch is a mass of shells, pebbles and gravel; by spreading it on the estuary floor, workers can create a substrate for the oysters to latch onto so they can then cluster to form underwater fortresses.
The Louisiana Department of Wildlife and Fisheries has its own Oyster Cultch Project under way in six estuarine environments across the state, from Sister Lake to Three Mile Bay. By simultaneously building hatcheries where oyster larvae are cultivated, the state hopes to seed the new reefs with generations of oysters that will build new fortresses.
Back in the restaurant in New Orleans where I was lulled by the shucking routine, the piles of oysters teetering atop trays make it hard to absorb the reality that gulf oysters are not yet thriving the way they used to.
The shucker tapped his knife in front of me, sending a tiny round object rolling my way. "A pearl for the girl," he joked. Its shape was rather irregular and it was not exactly lustrous, but to me it was a remarkable thing.
Maybe the enduring oyster itself, which slips so smoothly down millions of throats, ought to be regarded as a kind of treasure, too.

HEADLINE: Santander Earnings Plunge 94% on Real Estate Woes

BYLINE: MARK SCOTT


HIGHLIGHT: Banco Santander of Spain reported a 94 percent drop in net profit in the third quarter after it set aside money to cover potential losses in the Spanish real estate market. 

 BODY:
LONDON - Banco Santander of Spain reported on Thursday that net profit plummeted 94 percent in the third quarter, after the bank set aside money to cover potential losses in the Spanish real estate market.
The bank has faced growing headwinds in its home market as the European debt crisis continues to weigh heavily on the Spanish economy. Santander's international units, including those in Brazil and Britain, also reported subdued performance, a reflection of concerns about the global economy.
As a buffer, Santander - one of Europe's largest banks - said it had set aside 5 billion euros ($6.5 billion), including an additional 1 billion euros in the third quarter, to offset potential losses in the Spanish real estate market. The bank said it now had a total of 9.5 billion euros in reserve to cover bad loans.
 Santander, based in Madrid, said net income in the three months ended Sept. 30 fell to 100 million euros from 1.8 billion euros in the period a year earlier.
The bank's volume of bad real estate loans in Spain and abroad continued to rise. Santander reported that its percentage of so-called nonperforming loans in Spain stood at 6.4 percent, an increase of 1.2 percentage points from the period a year earlier. For its global operations, the figure increased to 4.3 percent.
"The bank's capacity to generate profit enables us to set aside hefty real estate provisions in Spain in 2012 and significantly increase nonperforming loan coverage," Santander's chairman, Emilio Botín, said in a statement.
Shares in Banco Santander fell less than 1 percent in morning trading in Madrid on Thursday.
Santander is reducing its lending in the Spanish real estate market. The bank said its exposure in the sector stood at 26.5 billion euros at the end of September, a reduction of 16 billion euros in the last four years.
Santander's global operations continue to play an important role in offsetting its domestic troubles.
Latin American operations - including units in Brazil, Mexico and Chile - represented 50 percent of the bank's profit in first nine months of the year, the company said. Yet even in these fast-growing markets, the bank reported that net income fell 6 percent, to 3.3 billion euros, for the nine-month period after Santander sold several businesses in the region.
The bank raised about $4.2 billion last month through an initial public offering of its Mexican unit, Grupo Financiero Santander México. The dual listing in New York and Mexico was the third-largest initial public offering this year, after those of Facebook and Japan Airlines.
The bank's core Tier 1 ratio, a measure of its ability to weather financial shocks, rose to 10.4 percent at the end of the third quarter from 9.4 percent in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: The Dark Side of Bipartisanship

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: A new call for loosening restrictions on banks ignores the lessons of the recent past, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
In Washington today, "bipartisan" is a loaded term. The traditional usage of bipartisan refers to an agreement across the usual political divide - sometimes a good idea and in many cases the only way to get things done. But a darker meaning applies all too frequently - to a group in which the members, irrespective of party affiliation, are very close to special interests and work to advance an agenda that helps a few powerful people while hurting the rest of us.
Financial deregulation in the 1980s and 1990s was pushed by both Democrats and Republicans. It reached its apogee when Alan Greenspan, a Republican, was chairman of the Federal Reserve and Robert Rubin, a Democrat, was Treasury secretary. Bill Clinton was president; Newt Gingrich was speaker of the House. 
This is probably why President Obama and Mitt Romney shied away this fall from the issue of who was responsible for the financial crisis that brought us the deep recession and slow recovery of the last five years. Both political parties share culpability for allowing parts of the financial sector to take excessive risk while financing themselves with a great deal of debt and relatively little equity. 
In this context, the new Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative of the Bipartisan Policy Center seems eerily familiar. The introductory white paper published last week reads like a sophisticated manifesto preparing us for another round of deregulation.

We have come a long way since the 1990s -and most of it has been downhill. No reasonable person can now espouse the kind of views that Mr. Greenspan repeatedly laid out during his libertarian push to allow banks to become as big and as dangerous as they wished. (In our book "13 Bankers," James Kwak and I go through the historical record of deregulation - and Mr. Greenspan emerges as a central character.) Mr. Greenspan's bipartisan notion - that any financial-sector mess can be cleaned up easily and cheaply - is now completely exploded.
Still, the new initiative, underwritten by the Heising-Simons Foundation, seems likely for three reasons to push strongly for the rollback of important parts of the Dodd-Frank legislation.
First, the white paper frames the entire issue in a way that is incorrect - but highly informative about the attitudes at work: "Evaluating financial regulatory reform requires consideration of the inevitable trade-off between market stability and the combination of innovation, risk-taking and growth" (see Page 6).
There is no such trade-off. Financial crises destroy growth - and for a long period of time. If you want to undermine American productivity, as well as the power and prestige of the United States, step back and allow the financial sector to go crazy again. In the last decade, the United States lost its stability and its growth. It's too bad the presidential candidates were not pressed on this point during the recent debates, and particularly on the cost of the crisis, estimated by Better Markets to be more than $12.8 trillion.
Second, of the task force's 14 members, an overwhelming majority are very close to the industry's way of thinking. Six are lawyers whose practices - according to their biographies on the Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative's Web site - involve working with major financial-sector players. Two of them, Annette L. Nazareth and H. Rodgin Cohen, are among the most well-known advocates for Big Finance (see this profile of Ms. Nazareth from Bloomberg Businessweek). Another of these lawyers is John C. Dugan, comptroller of the currency from 2005 to 2010, head of an agency famous for being very friendly to the banks under its supervision. Mr. Dugan also features in "13 Bankers" - not as influential as Mr. Greenspan but still a person very much identified with deregulation and nonregulation. 
Another two task-force members are senior figures at companies - Oliver Wyman and PricewaterhouseCoopers - for which Wall Street firms are important clients. Robert K. Steel is also on board; he is currently a deputy mayor in New York City and was previously chief executive of Wachovia and worked at Goldman Sachs for more than 30 years. Mark Olson, currently with Treliant Risk Advisors, is a past president of the American Bankers Association.
Powerful people in the industry were, naturally, happy to have regulators back off and supervision to become super-light in the past. In fact, they lobbied long and hard to make this happen - including, for example, the right to use their own risk models in calculating how much equity capital they needed to have. I hear the same arguments today.
With 10 of the 14 initiative members so close to big players in the financial sector, can this initiative in fact be "independent, objective and fact-based," as its Web site says? Their clients do not want to be regulated effectively.
Not everyone in this group should be considered close to big banks or Wall Street more generally. Three distinguished academicians are involved - John C. Coffee Jr., James D. Cox and Thomas H. Jackson. We shall see to what extent they can provide a counterweight to the financial sector. There is also one independent member from outside the academic world, Eric Rodriguez, vice president at the National Council of La Raza, which the Bipartisan Policy Center describes as "the largest national Hispanic civil rights and advocacy organization in the United States."
If the organizers of the initiative were seeking experienced industry professionals, they should have invited the former insiders who form Occupy the S.E.C. - and who recently submitted another impressive letter on the Volcker Rule in response to a request from Representative Spencer Bachus, Republican of Alabama and chairman of the House Financial Services Committee, for "alternatives" to it.
Third, while the internal governance structure of the initiative is somewhat unclear, there is no reason to be optimistic about the decision-making process and the work product. The directors, Martin Neil Baily and Phillip Swagel, are former senior government officials who now work at research groups (Mr. Baily is at Brookings and Mr. Swagel at the American Enterprise Institute and the Milken Institute) and a university (Mr. Swagel's primary appointment is on the faculty of the University of Maryland).
Both are thoughtful people who are open to discussion. Mr. Swagel recently invited me to a forum at the Milken Institute where we debated - along with Harvey Rosenblum of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas and Peter Wallison of the American Enterprise Institute - whether big banks should be forced to become smaller (and, in my view and Mr. Rosenblum's view, less dangerous). Mr. Swagel and Mr. Wallison strenuously opposed the proposition (you can watch this discussion on the C-Span archive).
Two senior advisers, whose role is not made clear on the Web site, seem very similar to most task force members in terms of their background and current work. Gregory P. Wilson worked in the past with the Financial Services Roundtable (a lobbying group for large banks) and is still an external adviser to the group. James C. Sivon, a top banking lawyer, is a former senior executive at the Association of Bank Holding Companies.
The director of the initiative is Aaron Klein, a former senior Treasury official (under President Obama) who previously worked for Senator Christopher Dodd, Democrat of Connecticut. Mr. Klein wrote the white paper, along with Mr. Baily and Mr. Swagel. It is striking - and disappointing - to see such figures endorse the idea of a "stability-growth trade-off" (see Page 7) for modern financial regulation in the United States. 
This is the same attempted frame for the issues that I hear regularly from industry lobbyists and their lawyers (for example, at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission hearing on the Volcker Rule in May).
This is entirely the wrong way to look at our financial sector, including the global megabanks that have come to predominate. This particular special interest has become too powerful - and is working hard to repeal the restrictions that can limit its ability to damage the economy again.
Subsidizing, with implicit guarantees, the too-big-to-fail financial institutions is unfair and dangerous. Such subsidies distort and destroy markets. They undermine stability and make it harder to sustain growth. Fewer people will benefit from the growth that we do have.
Let's be honest: Everyone would like an arrangement in which they personally get the upside and the taxpayer gets the downside. Imagine how much fun it would be to visit Las Vegas on that basis - and the size of the bets you would make.
Asked to comment, Mr. Swagel said, "It is easy and wrong to say that efforts to change Dodd-Frank are to weaken it." He suggested that this bipartisan initiative could improve financial regulation and that such changes would be good for the economy and for all Americans. 
My view is that, unfortunately, the Financial Regulatory Reform Initiative of the Bipartisan Policy Center seems likely to side with industry lobby groups on all substantive questions. 
I hope I'm wrong, but its initial paper and the task force membership suggest that it will just be another cog in the vast Wall Street influence machinery that has come to dominate Washington.

HEADLINE: The Early Word: Courtship

BYLINE: ASHLEY SOUTHALL


HIGHLIGHT: Political news from today's Times, plus a look at what's happening in Washington. 

 BODY:
 In Today's Times: 
The campaigns are talking about women, specifically, blue-collar women without college degrees who have slipped a rung or two on the economic ladder. Katharine Q. Seelye writes that both campaigns see this subset of swing voters, which made up 9 percent of voters in 2008, as critical to winning the election, tailoring their statements about health care and the economy to what they think those women want to hear.
The presidential campaigns have said little about national security. Scott Shane writes that the next administration must decide whether and how to scale back spending on domestic security programs in the face of guaranteed opposition from the public, Congress and lobbyists.
Nevada's struggling economy is putting Senator Harry Reid's political machine to the test, as he tries to deliver the state to Democrats next month. Adam Nagourney writes that despite infighting among Republicans and an edge among registered voters, victory is far from assured. Mr. Reid's well-oiled operation has to contend with voters' anxieties about the state's high unemployment and foreclosure rates.
Mitt Romney is showing a fresh burst of enthusiasmon the campaign trail, emphasizing his debate performances as his campaign struggles to chart a way for him to get the 270 electoral votes he needs to win the election, Jeff Zeleny and Ashley Parker write. Winning Ohio would be the easiest route, but Mr. Romney's campaign aides say that there are other viable options.
Trying to edge out of a dead heat with Mr. Romney on the campaign trail, Mr. Obama is on a two-day tour of eight swing states. Helene Cooper writes that the Obama campaign is focusing exclusively on eight swing states up until Election Day, and is particularly working to win traditional Democratic constituents like young people, women, blacks and Latinos.
Candidates in House races in Florida are setting a new low bar for dirty politics. Lizette Alvarez writes that the Sunshine State is home to some of the grimiest House contests, as the candidates compete doggedly for individual votes in very tight races.
 Happening in Washington: 
Economic reports scheduled to be released today include September durable goods orders and weekly jobless claims at 8:30 a.m., followed at 10 by last month's pending home sales and weekly mortgage rates.

HEADLINE: Bank of China Profit Rises 17% on Loan Growth

BYLINE: NEIL GOUGH


HIGHLIGHT: The first of China's biggest banks to report quarterly earnings reported a strong rise in profit on growth in new loans. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - The Bank of China, the first of the country's major state-owned lenders to report third-quarter results, said on Thursday that its profit rose 16.6 percent from the period a year earlier, exceeding analysts' expectations. 
Fresh signs that the world's second-biggest economy after the United States may have turned a corner have stimulated demand for new loans, and analysts are forecasting that China's biggest banks will report strong earnings growth for the three months ended Sept. 30. 
Bank of China, the smallest of China's so-called Big Four lenders by assets - the others are the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank and Agricultural Bank of China - said third-quarter net income rose to 34.8 billion renminbi ($5.6 billion). Analysts had expected profit of 33 billion renminbi. 
 The result was a rebound from the second quarter, when the bank reported a year-on-year profit increase of just 5.2 percent, its slowest growth in quarterly profit in three years. 
New lending drove the increase in earnings. For the quarter, Bank of China said total assets expanded 7.7 percent, to 12.74 trillion renminbi, from the period a year earlier. The result was a 14.5 percent rise in net interest income, to 65.4 billion renminbi. 
Wary of signs that Beijing may be moving to partly deregulate the nation's fixed-interest rate regime, which guarantees banks a comfortable margin between their lending and deposit rates, many Chinese banks have in recent years been seeking to reduce reliance on the loan business by tapping other sources of income. 
Bank of China, however, appeared to head in the opposite direction during the third quarter, with net interest income driving results while earnings from transaction fees and commissions lagged. 
Net fee and commission income fell 1.1 percent, to 15.68 billion renminbi, from the year-earlier period. By contrast, the rise in net interest income coincided with the increasing profitability of the lending business. 
Bank of China's net interest margin widened to 2.12 percent at the end of September, up slightly from 2.1 percent at the end of June, after regulators moved this summer to partly loosen lending and deposit rates.

HEADLINE: Powell Gives Obama His Endorsement for a Second Time

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Colin L. Powell, the former Republican secretary of state and retired four-star general, said on Thursday that he was concerned that Mitt Romney was "a moving target" on foreign policy. 

 BODY:
Watch on Youtube.
 12:22 p.m. | Updated Colin L. Powell, the former Republican secretary of state and retired four-star general, said on Thursday that he had decided to endorse President Obama's bid for re-election and was concerned that Mitt Romney was "a moving target" on foreign policy.
In aninterview on "CBS This Morning," Mr. Powell said that he was "more comfortable" with the president's views on immigration, education and foreign policy. 
"I do not want to see the new Obamacare plan thrown off the table," Mr. Powell said. "It has issues - you have to fix some things in that plan - but what I see is that 30 million fellow citizens will now be covered."
It is an open question whether his endorsement will carry as much weight as it seemed to four years ago when he threw his support behind Mr. Obama in the final weeks of his campaign with Senator John McCain. But the president's advisers had been waiting with anticipation of an endorsement, which Mr. Powell did not reveal until his television interview Thursday morning. 
In the interview, Mr. Powell said that the nation's unemployment rate was still too high, but he added: "I think generally we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude." He praised the president for his handling of national security.

"I also saw the president get us out of one war, start to get us out of a second war and did not get us into any new wars," Mr. Powell said. "I think the actions he's taken with respect to protecting us from terrorism have been very, very solid. And so I think we ought to keep on the track that we are on."
On Afghanistan and other foreign policy concerns, Mr. Powell said that he did not believe Mr. Romney "has thought through these issues as thoroughly as he should have." He added, "There are some very, very strong neo-conservative views that are presented by the governor that I have some trouble with."
He said that he still considered himself a Republican, but in "of a more moderate mold." He added, "That's something of a dying breed, I'm sorry to say."
Mr. Powell, a retired Army general who was a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State under President George W. Bush, criticized the Republican Party as failing to recognize a need for compromise. He also had sharp words for Congress, which he said had fallen down on the job in dealing with the nation's fiscal burdens.
Four years ago, Mr. Powell announced his endorsement of Mr. Obama in an appearance on "Meet the Press" on NBC. He did not say during his interview Thursday on "CBS This Morning" whether he would campaign on Mr. Obama's behalf.
"I voted for him in 2008," Mr. Powell said, "and I plan to stick with him in 2012."
 Update: Mr. Obama had no advance warning of Mr. Powell's endorsement and learned about it while waiting to address a rally in Tampa, Fla. Before taking stage, Mr. Obama called Mr. Powell to thank him. "We think it sends a strong signal about why he should be sent back for another four years to be commander in chief," said Jen Psaki, a campaign spokeswoman.
Senator John McCain said Thursday that Mr. Powell had "harmed" his legacy by endorsing Mr. Obama a second time. Appearing on Brian Kilmeade's radio program, Mr. McCain said "General Powell, you disappoint us and you have harmed your legacy even further by defending what is clearly the most feckless foreign policy in my lifetime."

HEADLINE: An Airline Fleet Fueled by Natural Gas

BYLINE: MATTHEW L. WALD


HIGHLIGHT: Qatar, an emirate with relatively little oil and vast supplies of natural gas, wants its national airline to use the latter as fuel. \ 

 BODY:
 At the end of next year, Qatar Airways is scheduled to open a new airport that will include a 25-meter swimming pool and squash courts, among other amenities. But it will also be extraordinary from an energy standpoint because it will pump airline fuel made from natural gas. 
Qatar has relatively little oil and vast supplies of natural gas. Oil goes on tankers to distant destinations, but moving natural gas is much harder for the Persian Gulf emirate. So Royal Dutch/Shell built a gas-to-liquids plant called Pearl that makes a variety of liquid fuels. 
Qatar is not quite the first out of the box with this approach. That would be South Africa, which was driven to make liquids from coal in the days when its apartheid regime faced trade sanctions and the country could not import oil. Now the country makes diesel and jet fuel from coalbecause it makes economic sense. 
Liquids from coal and from natural gas are similar because the first step in either process is to turn the hydrocarbon fuel into a gas consisting of hydrogen and carbon monoxide. From there, further chemical processing yields hydrogen and carbon combinations that are liquid at room temperature. 
In South Africa's case, environmentalists are horrified because such fuels have a bigger carbon footprint than fuel from ordinary oil because of all the extra processing involved. In fact, it is like an extreme version of the tar sands of Alberta, which Canada turns into a crude oil that environmentalists have been trying to keep out of the United States. 
Visiting Washington on Wednesday, the chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar Al Baker, asserted that the fuel is easier on the environment than jet fuel made from petroleum. First, it has no sulfur and thus does not produce sulfur dioxide, which is a more potent global warming gas than carbon dioxide when emitted at low altitudes. (This is tricky: at higher altitudes, sulfur dioxide reflects sunlight back into space and thus in theory combats global warming.)
Second, the jet fuel from natural gas has slightly more energy per pound than jet fuel from petroleum, so flying a given distance requires fewer pounds of fuel. And the lighter the fuel, the greater the fuel economy, he said.
The airline has four aircraft with Rolls Royce engines, and Rolls has approved the use of the fuel. The carrier has 110 aircraft with General Electric engines, and Mr. Al Baker said that it was still awaiting formal approval from G.E. Rolls may have been faster because it supplies engines to Britain's Royal Air Force, and the R.A.F. conducted an early study of the synthetic fuel produced by South Africa. 
A G.E. spokesman, Rick Kennedy, said the company had already signed off on using the fuel in G.E. engines, however. Engines running on the fuel require less maintenance because they do not produce sulfur dioxide, he said, but the company does not see an advantage when it comes to reducing heat-trapping emissions related to global warming. Still, because the fuel is lighter, "you get a better fuel burn,'' he said, which results in lower consumption. 
A Boeing spokesman, Terrance Scott, said the fuel performs similarly to traditional fossil-based fuels. The company has shown more enthusiasm for innovation in bio-based fuels, though. 
The process of making fuel from natural gas "is extremely costly, energy-intensive and has life-cycle issues" that negate some of the benefits from pursuing sustainable fuel options for the broader aviation market,'' Mr. Scott said. "Qatar has the world's largest natural gas reserves, so they have been pushing for innovative uses for it," he noted, and "this is one example that makes sense in that region of the world.'' 
Meanwhile, Qatar Airways is lamenting the European Union's taxes on carbon dioxide emissions by foreign carriers that fly in and out of its airports. Qatar has moved some of its power plants to burn natural gas instead of oil, Mr. Al Baker said, and as a result can assign some carbon credits to the airline. 
But he said he was rooting for the United States, which has taken an aggressive stand against the airline carbon taxes "We are a small country, and we cannot get into battles with large countries like the E.U.,'' Mr. Al Baker said. 
"We will let somebody else do our battle, then benefit,'' he said.

HEADLINE: New Taxes on Global Reinsurers Would Hurt Response to Natural Disasters

BYLINE: J. DAVID CUMMINS AND BRADLEY KADING


HIGHLIGHT: A new tax under consideration aimed at reinsurers based outside the United States would be punitive and could reduce aid for natural disasters by billions of dollars, the authors write. 

 BODY:
 J. David Cummins is a Professor at Temple University's Fox School of Business. Bradley Kading is the President of the Association of Bermuda Insurers and Reinsurers. 
After disasters like earthquakes in California and hurricanes along the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, the public face of recovery often is the insurance companies. Just as important to ensuring this sector's survival are the reinsurers that provide backup insurance coverage, particularly in high-risk areas. 
But legislation proposed by Representative Richard Neal, Democrat of Massachusetts, and Senator Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey, would impose punitive taxes that will drive up the costs for consumers and businesses. A similar proposal is also included in President Obama's budget for the 2013 fiscal year.
The Neal-Menendez bill, H.R. 3157 and S. 1693, is intended to reverse current policies that allow insurance companies based in the United States to claim a deduction as an ordinary business expense on their corporate tax return for the amount of reinsurance premiums paid to a foreign affiliate. The net effect of this legislation, however, would impose a costly tariff on international reinsurance firms. 
Aiming at global insurance companies with these taxes would be disastrous for areas vulnerable to natural calamities. An economic impact study prepared on behalf of an insurance industry coalition by the Brattle Group, a leading economic consulting firm based in Boston, found that the proposed tax would reduce the net supply of reinsurance in the United States by 20 percent. American insurers depend heavily on international reinsurers for nearly two-thirds of their backup catastrophe coverage, with insurers based in Bermuda providing 40 percent.
A new tax that restricts the supply of reinsurance is bad for consumers. For example, in 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused total losses of $125 billion. Insured losses amounted to $62.2 billion, with foreign insurers and reinsurers paying more than 60 percent. Similarly, in the aftermath of the 2001 terrorist attacks on New York, international insurance and reinsurance firms paid 64 percent of the estimated $27 billion in United States payouts for the claims. 
As we learn in Economics 101, reducing the supply of something raises its price. The Brattle Group study estimates that the proposed tax would increase the price of insurance in the United States by 2.1 to 2.4 percent and up to 9 percent in some industries. To maintain their level of coverage, consumers across the county would have to pay a total of $11 billion to $13 billion more annually. Furthermore, because of the design of the proposed tax, it would significantly disrupt insurance markets, yet fail to raise much revenue. 
With the potential losses from extreme weather on the rise, the need for global reinsurance will continue to expand. A recent report by the catastrophe risk management firm Karen Clark & Company, based on an analysis of more than a century of hurricanes, warns that the United States can expect insured losses of at least an average of $10 billion from a hurricane every four years. 
Though reorganizing United States business to avoid the proposed tax may seem like the simple solution, many sound business policies have led several global reinsurers to be started in Bermuda. The regulatory environment there provides a speedy license process, which is supervised by a respected independent regulator, the Bermuda Monetary Authority. 
Even risk-averse capital providers are comfortable with Bermuda's government and its economic environment.
And Bermuda's low-tax environment allows reserves to be built up to cover the huge disasters. Low taxes for reinsurers doesn't mean "no tax" -- all United States-to-Bermuda transactions are subject to a special federal excise tax, which goes into the Treasury's coffers.
Far from being a "tax haven," Bermuda has helped the reinsurance industry develop excellent best practices, innovate to better serve customers and establish highly regarded enterprise risk management programs. This attention to detail helps the major reinsurers retain their important credit ratings, better meet shareholder expectations and demonstrate resilience to global customers. During the worst days of the financial crisis, the Bermuda Monetary Authority tested its reinsurers to determine whether they could still meet their promises if large catastrophic losses occurred. The reinsurers passed these tests, with flying colors.
Bermuda's insurance regulation meets or exceeds standards used by state insurance regulators in the United States. Bermuda's insurance regulator meets international regulatory standards and is regularly measured against the standards by the International Monetary Fund. Bermuda's financial regulators have cooperation agreements in place with many American and international agencies, with more negotiated every day. In addition, European regulators have assessed Bermuda for equivalency with its own new solvency regulation regime. 
Moreover, the Departments of Justice, State and Treasury have all cited Bermuda's government as a cooperative partner and the United States has two tax law enforcement treaties with Bermuda. Many federal and state agencies in the United States have said that Bermuda's government is a cooperative partner in many areas, including financial regulation, protection of sensitive marine environments, anti-money-laundering measures and tax law enforcement. 
With the increased threat of natural disasters, the United States needs a robust insurance market that is open to as many competitors as possible and encourages direct foreign investment - including Bermuda. Establishing a punitive tax that restricts global risk-spreading will increase consumer costs and take away from the pool of money needed for the unforeseen hurricanes, earthquakes and other catastrophes that cannot be handled with traditional insurance alone.

HEADLINE: The Washington Post Endorses Obama

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: The newspaper is "open to the disappointments of Mr. Obama's first term," but said that "there is no way to know what Mr. Romney really believes." 

 BODY:
President Obama picked up the endorsement of The Washington Post, which said the president would be better at helping put the country on a sound, economic footing.
"President Barack Obama is better positioned to be that navigator than is his Republican challenger, former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney," The Postwrites.
The newspaper, which endorsed Mr. Obama four years ago, writes that its eyes "are open to the disappointments of Mr. Obama's first term," which it said included his failure to push for a bipartisan budget deal. The Post said he runs a White House that is "arrogant and thin-skinned."
But the paper says that Mr. Romney has embraced "his party's reality-defying ideology that taxes can always go down but may never go up." While calling his business record "impressive," the paper calls his political resume "thin" and concludes that "there is no way to know what Mr. Romney really believes."
The editorial, which was posted online Thursday afternoon, praises the president for his early efforts to stabilize the economy and for passage of the Affordable Care Act. It lauds him for the battle against terrorism, but says he was "hesitant and inconstant" in dealing with the upheaval in Arab countries.
On balance, though, the paper says that Mr. Obama deserves a second term.
"The president understands the urgency of the problems as well as anyone in the country and is committed to solving them in a balanced way," the paper writes. "In a second term, working with an opposition that we hope would be chastened by the failure of its scorched-earth campaign against him, he is far more likely than his opponent to succeed. That makes Mr. Obama by far the superior choice."

HEADLINE: Romney Adopts Obama's Slogan of 2008 and Promises 'Big Change'

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney started a bus tour across Ohio by casting himself and his running mate, Paul Ryan, as reformers prepared to correct America's course, by reining in debts, salvaging Medicare and reducing taxes. 

 BODY:
 1:49 p.m. | Updated CINCINNATI - With 12 days left until the election, Mitt Romney began offering the outlines of a closing argument here that co-opts President Obama's message from four years ago, repeatedly promising to deliver "big change" at a moment of "big challenges" and calling his opponent a guardian of the status quo.
Mr. Romney, who has narrowed Mr. Obama's lead in state and national polls, started a bus tour across Ohio by casting himself and his running mate, Representative Paul D. Ryan, as reformers prepared to correct America's course, by reining in debts, salvaging Medicare and reducing taxes.
"These challenges are big challenges," Mr. Romney said. "This election is therefore a big choice. And America wants to see big changes, and we're gonna bring big changes to get America stronger again."
The speech highlighted how significantly the Romney campaign's pitch to voters has evolved since he entered the race in 2011. Back then, he devoted much of his time berating the president, and mocked the idea of big change: a standard line back then Mr. Obama for trying to "transform America."
On Thursday, it was Mr. Romney who called for "big change," of the small-government variety, a dozen times, saying that Mr. Obama stood for "the status quo path."
"The path we're on - the status quo path - is a path that doesn't have an answer about how to get the economy going," he said. "The president has the same old answers as in the past - he wants another stimulus, he wants more government workers, and he wants to raise taxes."
The Obama campaign scoffed at Mr. Romney's adoption of their language from four years ago.
 "The only 'change' that Mitt Romney has promised is bringing back the failed policies that caused the economic crisis and putting a rubber stamp for the far-right wing in the White House," said Lis Smith, a spokesman for the president's campaign. "Americans understand that's not 'change' that they can afford."
Mr. Romney appeared to be testing new language as he prepared for a major speech about the economy, which he is to deliver in Iowa on Friday, as he seeks to build on the energy he generated from a series of animated debate performances.
In a dig at the president, Mr. Romney said the debates "had diminished the Obama campaign," which he said had resorted to invoking "Sesame Street" characters, like Big Bird, and playing "word games."
Mr. Romney is traveling on Thursday to three cities in Ohio, whose 18 electoral votes could swing the outcome of a close presidential campaign. After Cincinnati, he heads to rallies in Worthington and Defiance.

HEADLINE: Tallying the Costs of Bank of America's Countrywide Nightmare

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: Countrywide Financial, the subprime lending specialist that Bank of America bought in 2008, continues to drain the bank's resources. With federal prosecutors seeking to collect more than $1 billion in penalties over a Countrywide lending program, DealBook takes stock of all the red ink. 

 BODY:
If only there were mulligans on ill-advised Wall Street takeovers.
When Bank of America bought Countrywide Financial, the subprime lending specialist, it initially paid $4 billion.
Some analysts have pegged the true financial toll -- including write-downs, legal expenses and settlements -- at upward of $40 billion. 
 The costs threatened to widen further on Wednesday, when federal prosecutors in New York sued Bank of America over a mortgage program it inherited from Countywide. The Justice Department seeks to collect more than $1 billion in penalties over the program, known as "the hustle," which prosecutors say churned out fraudulent loans at a rapid pace.
The final cost of that suit could total even more -- $3 billion. The Justice Department, seeking compensation for bad loans that Countrywide steered to government-backed mortgage agencies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, filed the case under a law that could provide for triple the damages suffered by taxpayers. Fannie and Freddie guaranteed the mortgages and later suffered steep losses. 
A Bank of America spokesman, Lawrence Grayson, declined to comment. On Wednesday, when the Justice Department released its complaint, Mr. Grayson cast doubt on the government's claims. 
"Bank of America has stepped up and acted responsibly to resolve legacy mortgage matters; the claim that we have failed to repurchase loans from Fannie Mae is simply false," he said in a statement. "At some point, Bank of America can't be expected to compensate every entity that claims losses that actually were caused by the economic downturn." Bank of America also notes that it is turning around its mortgage business, after whittling down the subprime portfolio and focusing on stronger lending standards. 
Whatever the merits of the case, it further reinforced the notion that Bank of America was better off without Countrywide. 
Once the nation's largest mortgage lender, Countrywide pioneered lending programs that aggressively reached into minority and low-income neighborhoods. But by early 2008, as the mortgage bubble was bursting, the firm was hobbled by soured loans and it needed a buyer. 
Kenneth D. Lewis, then Bank of America's chief, saw an opportunity to seize the company for a bargain price. But that was only the first expense that led to a flood of red ink. 
"Obviously, there aren't many days when I get up and think positively about the Countrywide transaction," Brian Moynihan, Mr. Lewis's successor, once said. 
In financial reports, Bank of America does not break out losses and write-downs sustained by its own mortgage division versus Countrywide, so it is difficult to pinpoint an exact cost of the Countrywide deal. But some of the enormous costs of Countrywide include these bills:

        
January 2008: Bank of America agreed to pay $4 billion for Countrywide.
        
June 2010: The government fines start relatively small, with the Federal Trade Commission leveling a $110 million penalty against two Countrywide mortgage servicing companies accused of overcharging "cash-strapped borrowers."
        
August 2010: Countrywide agrees to pay $600 million to settle a lawsuit from shareholders, including New York pension funds that claimed the lender misled them about its health. 
        
October 2010: Bank of America pays $20 million to cover the former Countrywide chief executive Angelo Mozilo's $67.5 million civil fraud settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
        
January 2011: Bank of America pays more than $2.5 billion to buy back troubled mortgages and resolve related claims from Fannie and Freddie. 
        
April 2011: The spending spree continues with a $1.6 billion payout to Assured Guarantee, which insured the toxic mortgage bonds sold to investors. 
        
May 2011: The Justice Department collects a $20 million fine after accusing Countrywide of wrongly foreclosing on more than 150 active duty members of the military. 
        
June 2011: Bank of America reached a preliminary $ 8.5 billion deal to settle claims by investors who purchased Countrywide mortgage securities that soured when the housing bubble burst. 
        
December 2011: Bank of America pays $335 million to settle claims from the Justice Department that Countrywide carried out a "widespread pattern or practice of discrimination against qualified African-American and Hispanic borrowers." 
        
February 2012: The bank strikes a $1 billion settlement with the federal government over Countrywide loans awarded to "unqualified" borrowers and insured by the Federal Housing Administration. 
        
February 2012: The bank contributes $11.8 billion to a nationwide investigation of foreclosure abuses at five big firms. Some of the improper acts are said to have occurred at Countrywide.

HEADLINE: Lawmakers Seek Urgency in Volcker Rule

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: While regulators hope to finalize the Volcker Rule by the end of the year, Senator Carl Levin and Senator Jeff Merkley argue in a letter that some agencies should publish the final rule even if all are not yet on board. 

 BODY:
With the Volcker Rule, a complex plan to rein in Wall Street risk taking, the waiting is the hardest part. 
A year after first proposing the rule, regulators are still fine-tuning a final version. And the Congressional supporters of the crackdown, which would limit big banks from trading with their own money, are growing antsy. 
"We urge you to move quickly, make the final adjustments needed to simplify and strengthen the October 2011 proposal, and bring the process to a conclusion," Senator Carl Levin, Democrat of Michigan, and Senator Jeff Merkley, Democrat of Oregon, said in a letter to regulators on Thursday. 
The lawmakers pushed the rule through Congress in 2010, arguing that banks should not make risky wagers while enjoying government deposit insurance and other federal support. The rule is named for Paul A. Volcker, a former chairman of the Federal Reserve who campaigned for the ban on proprietary trading.
The letter on Wednesday is the latest Congressional attempt to light a fire under the five regulatory agencies writing the rule, including the Federal Reserve and the Securities and Exchange Commission. In April, 22 senators called for regulators to adopt a final rule by the summer. Representative Barney Frank, the Massachusetts Democrat who co-authored the Dodd-Frank financial regulatory overhaul that created the Volcker rule, once called on regulators to issue a final rule by Labor Day.
Regulators aimed to wrap up in September, but they encountered delays in the wake of JPMorgan Chase's $6 billion trading loss, which became a flash point in the debate over the rule. Regulators, which are still split on certain details of the rule, now hope to finalize the plan by the end of the year.
That's too slow for Mr. Levin and Mr. Merkley. Some regulators, they argued, should publish the final rule even if all the agencies are not yet on board. 
"While American families and businesses should be enjoying the protection of the Volcker rule, your agencies' ongoing failure to implement these important protections has left them and our economy at greater risk of another financial crisis," they wrote.

HEADLINE: The Morning After

BYLINE: TIMOTHY EGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has promised to accomplish 15 different tasks on Day 1 of his administration. Let's sort them by priority. 

 BODY:
President-elect Willard M. Romney - congratulations! It's a Mormon miracle, when you think about it, even bigger than Brigham Young University's stunning upset of No. 1-ranked Miami in 1990.
Turns out, you really could write off 47 percent of Americans, the moochers and victims. All it took was a tough march through the suburbs of Florida, Virginia, Colorado and - ha, ha, Bruce Springsteen - Ohio. 
But be careful crediting providence: it almost went the other way, after that Senate candidate in Indiana, Richard Mourdock, said it was part of God's plan for rape victims to carry their assailants' babies, one day after you cut an ad for him. Good golly, gobsmackers, that was close! 
No, matter, the past is Etch A Sketchable, the whole of it, as you've just shown. From Severe Conservative to Milquetoast Mitt, it's all the same. Now on to governance. 
But before you take the oath, don't forget the pledge - to Grover Norquist. You and Vice President-elect Paul Ryan both pledged fealty to the bearded, much-feared lobbyist. You will never, ever, under any circumstances, war or national emergency, raise taxes.

Next up, look at a map of the world. No matter how many times you said it, Syria is not Iran's route to the sea. A large coastline to the south, the Persian Gulf, isn't going anywhere. 
You've promised to accomplish 15 different tasks on Day 1; let's sort them by priority. The Affordable Care Act is gone, even though you need Congress to act (a mere formality, by Ryan's assurance). All you 20-somethings on your parents' health plans, all you sickly types with pre-existing conditions that you expect the insurance companies to cover, no more Obamacare for you. The ride is over, even if it means leaving 72 million Americans without health insurance, as the Commonwealth Fund, a New York-based research foundation, calculated. Legacy, baby.
"You can kiss the American automotive industry goodbye." So you said, back in the early days of the one-termer you just defeated, should the car companies be rescued by the government. Something was miscalculated there. Let's pull all federal aid and try it again - the Bain way.
Latinos nearly cost you the election, especially in Florida, Colorado and Nevada. Well, those Mexicans, or whatever they are, can start self-deporting. It worked for your grandfather when he hightailed it out of Mexico in the face of official pressure. Just refuse to sign the Dream Act and make things uncomfortable!
On to China, and a trade war. You promised to declare our biggest creditor a currency manipulator on Day 1. Say it loud and clear, brother. But watch for the stock market to crash and the Chinese to retaliate, setting off a domino effect that would rattle a very fragile global economy. Well, heck, they started it.
Speaking of global tantrums, re: climate change, there will be no change from the prior administration. Just do nothing, and never bring it up. 
And here comes a dirty part. You promised to import the messy tar sands oil of Canada through the Keystone XL pipeline, "if I have to build it myself to get it here." The problem is, lots of folks on the prairie don't want an oil pipeline next to the homestead. Maybe Tagg can channel some of that aggressive energy of his out in the flatland, threaten to take a swing at farmers who are afraid of a little industrial intrusion on the corn fields.
Supreme Court: at long last, here comes the revenge of Robert Bork, your top adviser on the Supremes. He's been stewing in bile for decades. Four of the justices are in their 70s, and that lib Ruth Bader Ginsburg, at 79, is a cancer survivor. The gays are this close from upsetting the sanctity of traditional marriage, especially with two states voting to approve of same-sex nuptials yesterday. You'll probably get to name two justices. They'll be in the mold of Clarence Thomas and Antonin Scalia, as you vowed on your Web site. Bork has a list. But watch for libertarian types like Sandra Day O'Connor, an appointee of President Reagan who said she feared stepping down because "it's my party that's destroying the country."
And on this morning after, the morning-after pill itself is a target for elimination. It's in the party platform, for Pete's sake. But if it causes too much of a fuss to mess with women from the get-go, forget about the Taliban wing of the party. You can go both ways, or multiple choice, on the social issues, as always. What matters is that corporations continue to be treated as people, which means somebody ought to be able to marry one, somewhere, in this great land.
Math is not your strong point. You promised a tax cut of 20 percent, costing upward of $5 trillion, and an increase in defense spending of $2 trillion over the next decade, plus putting $716 billion back in Medicare from Obamacare savings - all while bringing the deficit under control. You can't just say, "Of course they add up!" again, and make the numbers whole. That only works on TV. 
On top of all of the above, you promised Jeremy, the college kid from the second debate, a job by 2014. Time for another miracle.

HEADLINE: Judge Releases Romney Testimony in Surrogate's Divorce

BYLINE: SARAH WHEATON


HIGHLIGHT: A judge released more than 430 pages of Mitt Romney talking about Staples in its founder's divorce proceedings, but Maureen Sullivan Stemberg is still not allowed to speak about Mr. Romney. 

 BODY:
A probate court in Massachusetts unsealed 430 pages of testimony by Mitt Romney from 1991, when he was questioned during the protracted divorce proceedings of one of his campaign's top surrogates.
The Boston Globe sought access to transcripts of Mr. Romney's part in the case of Thomas Stemberg, the founder of Staples, and Maureen Sullivan Stemberg. When Ms. Stemberg sued to overturn the couple's 1988 settlement - arguing that Mr. Stemberg had understated the value of Staples stock - Mr. Romney was called to discuss the company's value, having led Bain Capital when it was an early investor in the office supply chain. Mr. Romney frequently points to Staples' success as evidence of his economic prowess, and Mr. Stemberg spoke at the Republican National Convention in August. 
Although records from divorce proceedings from more than a decade had been impounded and the parties are not allowed to talk about them, the judge released transcripts of Mr. Romney's three court appearances when no one, including Mr. Romney's lawyer, objected on Thursday.
Over three court dates in 1991 - June 26, July 27 and Oct. 7 - Mr. Romney delivered what Judge Jennifer Ulwick called a "how-to" for venture capital, as he described Bain Capital's involvement with Staples beginning in 1985. His detail-oriented side on full display, Mr. Romney recounted his negotiations with Mr. Stemberg and said that Bain would be looking for a 58 percent rate of return from a "startup" company like Staples. 
Lawyers had him go into detail about how Bain hedged against risk - many of its investments fail, after all - and how Bain profited from its investments. Mr. Romney also described how much money Bain invested in Staples over three rounds, going into detail about what happened "before the reverse split" or "during the C2 round."
Ms. Stemberg's lawyers at the time grilled Mr. Romney on how successful he and Mr. Stemberg thought Staples might be, a central issue in her complaint. 
However, even Gloria Allred, the high-profile lawyer representing Ms. Stemberg, acknowledged that the transcripts "don't mean much."
That is, she added, "unless my client can speak about them."
Ms. Allred was frustrated when The Globe dropped the second part of its request, which would have allowed both Stembergs to speak publicly about Mr. Romney and his role in their affairs. 
"The Globe's only interest all along, as should have been clear to all parties, was to obtain the transcript of a presidential candidate's testimony," said the paper's editor, Martin Baron, in a statement. It concluded, "The gag order is a matter for others to litigate, if they wish to do so."
Ms. Allred has pledged to do so, hinting at a more dramatic conclusion if Ms. Stemberg is allowed to speak.

HEADLINE: Can Austin Keep Itself Weird?

BYLINE: By RICHARD PARKER. 
Richard Parker's commentary is syndicated by McClatchy-Tribune.

 BODY:
AUSTIN, Tex.
ON the sun-dappled October weekend when the cyclist Lance Armstrong's world fell apart, Austin, the city he calls home and that until recently called him hero, went on with the simple pleasures of Longhorn football, live music, festivals and an amateur cyclist ride through the Hill Country.
But the midautumn bonhomie couldn't hide a sudden anxiety around town. Stunned supporters of Mr. Armstrong arrived for his gala benefit defiant in their Livestrong logos, even as The Austin American Statesman sullenly detailed the charges of doping and cover-up, the fleeing of corporate sponsors and the stripping of Mr. Armstrong's seven Tour de France victories.
Among other things, the Armstrong debacle is a cautionary tale for Austin, one of America's most beloved cities, which I call home. His rise has paralleled the city's ascent from sleepy state capital to international trendsetter. Each year, millions visit for the city's music festivals. Its economy has thrived during difficult times. With its success, Austin has attracted celebrity culture, built a sleek city and even attracted a new sport, Grand Prix racing, one usually reserved for the global elite. 
Yet Austin's very success, like that of its hometown hero, threatens to overwhelm the simple pleasures and values that make it unique.
It's hard to pinpoint just when Austin entered the American field of vision, but a good guess would be with the release of the first two feature films from the director Richard Linklater, ''Slacker'' (1991), a day in the life of the city, and ''Dazed and Confused'' (1993), about the last day of class at an Austin high school. Both films showed townsfolk letting their freak flag fly, intent on having a good time, unaware of things like money, status and material possessions.
Viewers saw Mr. Linklater's Austin as another outpost in what the music critic Greil Marcus called the ''old, weird America.'' Back then, that might have been all anyone outside Texas ever knew about the city.
Twenty years later, it is hard to overstate just how popular Austin has become in the American psyche. When I travel and tell people where I'm from, I almost invariably hear that it is either the coolest town they have ever visited or the place they most want to go on their next vacation. It consistently ranks near the top on lists of where to live, whether you're a college student, recent graduate, single, young family or retiree.
With a nearly maniacal devotion to running, cycling, racing and working out, Austin is among America's most fit cities. It seems to constantly invent more fun things to do. Heck, the Web site Sperling's Best Places recently named us No. 1 in block parties.
Even as the country plunged into recession, Austin continued to create jobs that, in turn, drew Californians by the droves as they fled unemployment and a real estate crash. The local economist Angelos Angelou forecast that the city would see 18,000 new jobs in 2011. He was wrong: the city created 21,000 new jobs. Even layoffs at the computer giant Dell haven't scratched, let alone dented, the economy here.
No one has embodied the rise of Austin better than Lance Armstrong, who went from a local cycling star to an international super-athlete during roughly the same span of years that Austin went from sleepy to sleek and hip. His foundation, Livestrong, turned him into a global celebrity philanthropist.
Other celebrities, too, began to call Austin home -- or at least a second home. It isn't uncommon to dine at Sandra Bullock's restaurant or spot Dennis Quaid in a bar. Matthew McConaughey is often on the Longhorn sideline. Natalie Portman was at the University of Texas's recent home game against Baylor.
But thanks to all that success, Austin is in danger of losing the simple, quirky vibe that made it special in the first place.
Perhaps the harbinger of all this was the death earlier this year of Leslie Cochran, a bearded, 60-year-old man who was usually found at the intersection of Congress Avenue and Sixth Street in high heels and a leopard thong. He ran for mayor three times, usually in a tiara. He was an odd guy, to say the least, and we loved him. Shortly before he died, Leslie warned that Austin risked becoming so big as to be bland.
But Leslie's popularity was less a driving force than a reflection of a culture that blends not just good times but inventiveness and tolerance: ''Slacker,'' rowdy cowboys named Tant, hipsters in bands like Ringo Deathstarr, frat kids, talented musical artists like Marcia Ball, old money, sunset margaritas on Lake Travis and, yes, the waft of marijuana atop Mount Bonnell each evening.
Perhaps it was best for Leslie to pass when he did. There may be nowhere for a man like him among the encroaching slickification of Austin's skyline. In the space of a decade, the sleepy downtown sprouted dozens of soaring skyscrapers filled with expensive condominiums. The simple but gracious four-story stucco Gables West is surrounded on three sides by silver towers named Spring, 360 and Monarch -- and soon will be on a fourth.
A few blocks away, Second Street, once home to little more than a children's museum, has been transformed into a corridor of trendy restaurants, bars and shops, anchored by none other than a W Hotel. Austin's newly inaugurated Fashion Week takes place along this strip. Bawdy old Sixth Street -- Dirty Six, we used to call it -- and the slightly more mature Warehouse District now compete for revelers with Second Street, an area some natives derisively call ''Little Dallas.''
That's saying something in Texas. After all, this is the city that likes to look down its hipster, liberal nose at stuck-up Dallas and stuffy Houston. ''Life's too short to live in Dallas'' is nearly as popular on a bumper sticker or T-shirt as ''Keep Austin Weird.'' And yet, here is Austin emulating them.
And as Lance Armstrong is demolished as a local icon -- what will happen to the name of the Lance Armstrong Bikeway? -- another glamorous cultural event is calling Austin home.
In November, Austin will become the American home of Grand Prix Formula One racing: Big-name sponsors, racecars going 180 miles an hour, $4,300 tickets to V.I.P. seating, Champagne and helicopters flying wealthy fans from locations all over the city to the new $450 million race facility built by a bond trader and a billionaire. For three days, the global elite who follow Grand Prix racing will touch down in Austin from Abu Dhabi before taking off again three days later for São Paulo or Monaco.
It seems a strange departure, frankly, for a city whose reputation was built on sunshine, tacos, good coffee and better margaritas, Willie Nelson, Longhorn football and barbecue.
And in the wake of the Armstrong debacle, it's hard not to think that pride does, indeed, go before the fall. Hopefully, Austin can handle success without letting it go to its head; after all, that is precisely what destroyed the hometown hero.

HEADLINE: Candidates Agree World Is Warming, but Talk Stops There

BYLINE: By JOHN M. BRODER

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For all their disputes, President Obama and Mitt Romney agree that the world is warming and that humans are at least partly to blame. It remains wholly unclear what either of them plans to do about it.
Even after a year of record-smashing temperatures, drought and Arctic ice melt, none of the moderators of the four general-election debates asked about climate change, nor did either of the candidates broach the topic.
Throughout the campaign, Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney have seemed most intent on trying to outdo each other as lovers of coal, oil and natural gas -- the very fuels most responsible for rising levels of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. 
Mr. Obama has supported broad climate change legislation, financed extensive clean energy projects and pushed new regulations to reduce global warming emissions from cars and power plants. But neither he nor Mr. Romney has laid out during the campaign a legislative or regulatory program to address the fundamental questions arising from one of the most vexing economic, environmental, political and humanitarian issues to face the planet. Should the United States cut its greenhouse gas emissions, and, if so, how far and how fast? Should fossil fuels be more heavily taxed? Should any form of clean energy be subsidized, and for how long? Should the United States lead international mitigation efforts? Should the nation pour billions of new dollars into basic energy research? Is the climate system so fraught with uncertainty that the rational response is to do nothing?
Many scientists and policy experts say the lack of a serious discussion of climate change in the presidential contest represents a lost opportunity to engage the public and to signal to the rest of the world American intentions for dealing with what is, by definition, a global problem that requires global cooperation.
''On climate change, the political discourse here is massively out of step with the rest of the world, but also with the citizens of this country,'' said Andrew Steer, the president of the World Resources Institute and a former special envoy for climate change at the World Bank. ''Polls show very clearly that two-thirds of Americans think this is a real problem and needs to be addressed.''
Mr. Steer noted that climate change was no longer a partisan issue in Europe and that China, Japan, Australia and South Korea had taken significant steps to reduce emissions and invest heavily in clean energy technology.
''The real question in this country,'' said Mr. Steer, a British citizen, ''is why politicians don't see it as in their interest to discuss it.''
The list of reasons is long.
Any serious effort to address climate change will require a transformation of the nation's system for producing and consuming energy and will, at least in the medium term, mean higher prices for fuel and electricity. Powerful incumbent industries -- coal, oil, utilities -- are threatened by such changes and have mounted a well-financed long-term campaign to sow doubt about climate change. The Koch brothers and others in the oil industry have underwritten advertising campaigns and grass-roots efforts to support like-minded candidates. And the Republican Party has essentially declared climate change a nonproblem.
The two most effective ways of reducing global warming pollution -- taxing it or regulating it -- are politically toxic in a year when economic problems are paramount. After a bill died in the Senate in 2010, Mr. Obama abandoned his support for cap and trade, a market-based method to limit greenhouse gas emissions, and he has given little hint of what regulatory policies he intends to pursue if he wins a second term. Aides said that he would not propose a carbon tax or other energy tax, but that he would consider supporting one as part of a larger budget and spending deal.
As governor of Massachusetts, Mr. Romney considered joining a regional cap-and-trade system, then abandoned it because of uncertainty over costs. He has opposed Mr. Obama's steps to regulate emissions from power plants and vehicles. He has said he would reverse Mr. Obama's air quality regulations and would renegotiate the auto efficiency standard of 54.5 miles per gallon by 2025 that automakers agreed to this year.
The struggling economy has made it difficult for emerging clean energy companies to get the capital they need to reach commercial scale and compete with producers of traditional energy sources. Government programs to provide that seed money are highly controversial, as the fight over tax breaks for wind power companies and the recent failures of the solar panel maker Solyndra and the advanced battery manufacturer A123 Systems showed.
The Obama administration provided $90 billion in new financing from the 2009 stimulus for clean energy projects, but most of that money is gone.
Though there is little doubt that the burning of fossil fuels and deforestation have altered the earth's climate, some uncertainty remains about whether and when such changes will become unmanageable. Huge technological challenges persist in transforming the energy generation system. Both Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney refer to ''clean coal,'' shorthand for capturing the carbon dioxide emissions from coal-burning power plants, but the technology is still in its infancy.
International efforts to address climate change, which showed great promise when Mr. Obama took office, have sputtered in recent years because of fears that limiting carbon emissions means limiting economic growth. There is also considerable resistance to any plan that would require the United States and other wealthy countries to take stronger measures than those demanded of China, India and other fast-growing economies that are responsible for the bulk of the growth in global emissions.
Mr. Romney's chief domestic policy adviser, Oren Cass, said the nation should not take unilateral steps. ''What it is going to do is hurt our economy very seriously, and it's going to drive a lot of industrial activity from the United States to countries that are, frankly, much less efficient in their use of energy,'' he said at an energy debate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology this month.
Mr. Cass said Mr. Romney's answer was not to tax emissions, impose new regulations or subsidize clean energy ventures. His answer is technological innovation by private industry, without government's thumb on the scale.
''Governor Romney's view is that the private sector can do the best job, that basic research funding is the appropriate role for government and that more aggressive subsidization and investment by the government can, in fact, have a counterproductive effect on innovation in the private sector,'' Mr. Cass said.
Mr. Obama occasionally mentions climate change on the campaign trail, but he generally raises the issue to present a contrast with Mr. Romney.
Last week in Iowa, for example, Mr. Obama expressed support for wind power projects and federal tax breaks for them, which Mr. Romney opposes. He then reprised an applause line from his convention speech.
''His plan would end tax credits for wind energy producers,'' Mr. Obama said. ''My plan will keep these investments, and we'll keep reducing the carbon pollution that's also heating the planet, because climate change isn't a hoax. The droughts we've seen, the floods, the wildfires, those aren't a joke. They're a threat to our children's future. And we can do something about it.''
Joseph E. Aldy, a former top Obama adviser on climate and energy who is now at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, said that a centerpiece of Mr. Obama's approach to climate change was his clean energy standard, a proposal to produce as much as 80 percent of the nation's electricity using clean sources by 2035. About 30 states now have such a standard -- Texas under Gov. George W. Bush was among the first to adopt one -- requiring varying amounts of power to come from wind, solar, nuclear, hydro and other nonpolluting sources.
Mr. Aldy said these plans would spur innovation and provide a consistent market for renewable energy, which today is not competitive with fossil fuels in most parts of the country. They also would avoid taxes and direct regulation, he said, although they would be easy to abandon if energy prices rose as a result and voters became disenchanted.
Christiana Figueres, the United Nations' top climate change diplomat, expressed dismay and frustration with the political conversation in the United States.
''No matter who is elected on Nov. 6, whether they agree on climate or not, it doesn't change the science,'' she said at a forum in New York in September. ''The challenge for any administration that comes in is to take a serious look not only at the cost of climate change for everyone else on the planet, but the cost to this country. And they have to ask themselves, 'What is the cost of not doing enough?' ''

Museums
Asia Society and Museum: 'Bound Unbound: Lin Tianmiao' (through Jan. 27) Lin Tianmiao is one of a rare kind in China, where she lives: a nationally and internationally renowned female artist. This museumwide show presents installations that have not been widely seen. Influenced by American artists like Kiki Smith, Louise Bourgeois and Ann Hamilton -- who made the female body and traditional women's occupations hot topics during the 1990s when Ms. Lin was living in New York -- these productions are not particularly original. But they are striking for their surrealistic theatricality and labor intensive craft. 725 Park Avenue, at 70th Street, (212) 517-2742, asiasociety.org. (Ken Johnson) 
Brooklyn Museum: 'Jean-Michel Othoniel: My Way' (through Dec. 2) Some of the art in this whimsical but cloying midcareer survey can strike you as the sculptural equivalent of haute couture. A bed framed by Murano glass beads is accompanied by veils of tulle, each one hand embroidered with gold thread in a workshop established by Louis XIV. Elsewhere, 4,200 yellow blown-glass bricks, shaped by artisans from Firozabad, India, form a shimmering rectangular solid. Early works in wax, sulfur and obsidian are more personal and provocative, showing the influence of mentors and peers like Felix Gonzalez-Torres, Robert Gober, Sophie Calle and Annette Messager. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Mickalene Thomas: Origin of the Universe' (through Jan. 20) This invigorating exhibition is dominated by big, brash collage-like paintings, thick with color and studded with rhinestones that depict cacophonous landscapes, spatially skewed interiors and, best of all, images of imperious black women among swaths of brightly patterned fabrics. Building on Conceptual identity art, borrowing from art history and 1970s blaxploitation extravagance, they subvert prevailing notions of beauty and taste and subvert the male gaze while offering resounding proof that the political, not only the personal, can also be stunningly pictorial. Bravo. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Materializing ''Six Years'': Lucy R. Lippard and the Emergence of Conceptual Art' (through Feb. 3) This big, intellectually enthralling exhibition of Conceptual works from the 1960s and early '70s is not a conventional museum period survey. Rather, it approximates how the rise of Conceptualism was seen while it was happening by one person: the curator, critic and writer Lucy R. Lippard, who was an extraordinarily energetic participant in and promoter of a trend that brought us the triumph of mind over matter in art. Anyone who wants art to be radically defiant of the market-driven system must see it. 200 Eastern Parkway, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'Caribbean: Crossroads of the World' (through Jan. 6) In size, cultural scope and freshness of material, the three-museum exhibition ''Caribbean: Crossroads of the World'' is a big art event in New York City, itself one of the largest Caribbean cities in the world. Be warned: the thematically arranged show throws you into history at the deep end. Almost all the information is strictly visual; there are very few explanatory labels anywhere. But the visuals are so rich, and interact so provocatively, that you may well be inspired to go out and do some homework and come back for a second look. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org; Also on display at Queens Museum of Art, New York City Building, Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, Queens, (718) 592-9700, queensmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Faking It: Manipulated Photography Before Photoshop' (through Jan. 27) This absorbing, often amusing exhibition offers abundant evidence that photographers have been cheating since shortly after the medium's invention almost two centuries ago. It features prints dating from 1846 to the early '90s made from altered negatives; seemingly realistic images made by piecing together two or more negatives; hand-colored black-and-white prints; Surrealistic montages; and conceptual confections contesting the ideal of photographic truth. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'Picasso Black and White' (through Jan. 23) Billed as the first monochromatic look at Picasso's whole career, this exhibition is as eye-opening as it is elegant. That's especially true among the later works on the upper ramps, which push well past the obligatory Neo-Classicism and Analytic Cubism into bracingly sensual explorations of the figure, strident political cries de coeur à la Guernica, and winking homages to Delacroix and Velázquez. Also notable: Thirty eight of the show's 118 works have never been exhibited in this country, and 5, among them the sharply angular ''Bust of a Woman With a Hat'' (1939), have never been on view publicly. 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'Rise and Fall of Apartheid: Photography and Bureaucracy of Everyday Life' (through Jan. 6) With more than 500 photographs -- supplemented by books, magazines, posters and films -- spread over two floors, this show documenting institutionalized racism in South Africa from 1948 to the election of Nelson Mandela in 1994 can't help but be overwhelming. But it's pitched as much to the mind, as to the heart. On the one hand, it's a grand narrative of stirring sights: ardent faces, agitated bodies, camaraderie, clenched fists, funerals. It's also a disquisition on the ordinariness of goodness and evil, on how people in a particular time and place encounter and partake of both, and go on with their lives. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Japan Society: 'Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)' (through Jan. 6) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art'' at the Metropolitan Museum of Art -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with Japan Society's show giving us a more concentrated view of the style. 333 East 47th Street, Manhattan, (212) 715-1258, japansociety.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Bernini: Sculpting in Clay' (through Jan. 6) Gian Lorenzo Bernini, one of the great marble sculptors of all time, never made an artwork in clay as a finished piece. He did, however, use clay to work out his ideas, and he probably produced thousands of studies in that generously plastic material. But today only 52 pieces in clay are known to have been made by him, and this revealing exhibition presents 39 of them. They range from small, quickly made sketches of angels and other beings that today look surprisingly modern to an amazing, half-size lion pausing to drink from an invisible pool. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Designing Nature: The Rinpa Aesthetic in Japanese Art' (through Jan. 13) Have any artists ever, anywhere, caught the hello-ness of spring and the farewell-ness of autumn more sweetly and sharply than the Rimpa painters of Japan? Two shimmering fall exhibitions -- this show is running in conjunction with ''Silver Wind: The Arts of Sakai Hoitsu (1761-1828)'' at Japan Society -- argue persuasively, that no, no artists ever have. Together the exhibitions add up to one of the largest Rimpa displays seen outside of Japan in years, with the Met's show giving us a broader view of the style. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Regarding Warhol: Sixty Artists, Fifty Years' (through Dec. 31) The Met's latest foray into recent art will undoubtedly be a crowd-pleaser, not the least for the mini-Warhol retrospective of 50 works that forms its spine. But with 100 often significant works by 59 other relentlessly predictable artists -- including Gerhard Richter, Cindy Sherman and Jeff Koons -- it is largely a shapeless, enthusiastic muddle. A dismaying return to the great-man, über-artist approach to art history, it does little to diminish the perception that where new art is concerned, the Met has a very long way to go. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Tomás Saraceno on the Roof: Cloud City' (through Nov. 4) This climbable 28-foot-high aggregate of 16 interconnected polyhedrons made of reflective steel and clear plexiglass creates a kind of Piranesian, walk-in Cubism that is briefly disorienting, but ultimately decorative. The none-too-high standards of participatory fun-house formalism are met; those of conventional plop art are barely exceeded. In the fusion of architecture, art and science, art is the loser, but the views of Central Park's ocean of greenness thrill, providing an immense and calming relief to the work's forced and busy artifice. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Chinese Gardens: Pavilions, Studios, Retreats' (through Jan. 6) To anyone strolling through the Chinese painting galleries at the Met this summer, the whole world will look like a garden of infinite expansion. That's the impression given by the 80 paintings and objects that make up this fragrant exhibition, drawn entirely from the museum's deep holdings, about paradises lost and found; about nature blooming and fading; about cosmological events transpiring in backyard bamboo groves. Metropolitan Museum of Art, (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library and Museum: 'Durer to de Kooning: 100 Master Drawings From Munich' (through Jan. 6) A few years ago the Morgan lent a cache of drawings to the Staatliche Graphische Sammlung in Munich. Now it's payback time, and 100 choice drawings from that venerable German museum are in New York. Mantegna, Michelangelo and Raphael are among the serious marquee names, nicely balanced with cartoon heads by Sigmar Polke. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 686-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Doris Duke's Shangri-La: Architecture, Landscape and Islamic Art' (through Feb. 17) The Honolulu estate known as Shangri La is a masterpiece of refined eclecticism. Doris Duke, the owner, referred to it as a ''Spanish-Moorish-Persian-Indian complex.'' Whatever you call it, it looks magnificent in this show and the accompanying book. Both combine sparkling new color shots of the home and gardens taken by Tim Street-Porter; architectural documents and vintage photographs; pieces of the collection; and projects by contemporary artists who had residencies at Shangri La (which has served, since Duke's death in 1993, as the Doris Duke Foundation for Islamic Art). 2 Columbus Circle, Manhattan, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Born Out of Necessity' (through Jan. 28) The title may or may not have an extra preposition, but the show itself is a fascinating array of recent acquisitions that have a fairly direct bearing on quality of life or actual survival. They range from classic (the 1908 Dixie cup) to cutting edge; cover both analog and digital; and include the tiny (the latest in earplugs) and the quite large (the 1952 United States Army Jeep). Whether born ''of'' or ''out of'' necessity, the displays attest to human ingenuity responding to human need. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Quay Brothers: On Deciphering the Pharmacist's Prescription for Lip-Reading Puppets' (through Jan. 7) The first major museum retrospective devoted to the strange puppet-haunted universe unleashed in the Quay Brothers' stop-action film animations includes their magical miniature stage sets, a sizable sampling of drawings, prints, collages and early illustration designs as well as works by artists who influenced them. More than 30 years of animated and live-action shorts, television commercials, music videos and imaginative documentaries in particular allow devotees and neophytes alike to grasp the essence of Timothy and Stephen Quay's achievement and its evolution, strengths and weaknesses all. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Century of the Child: Growing by Design, 1900 -- 2000' (through Nov. 5) This big, wonderful show at the Museum of Modern Art examines the intersection of modern design and modern thinking about children. A richly thought-provoking study of a great subject, it is loaded with intriguing things to look at -- some 500 items, including furniture, toys, games, posters, books and much more. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
Museum of Modern Art: 'Performing Histories (1)' (through March 11) An awareness of the uprisings, protests, occupations and revolutions erupting around the globe is present in ''Performing Histories (1),'' a show of video, film and photographic work recently acquired by MoMA. Insurrection and resistance pervade the Romanian artist Ion Grigorescu's film ''Dialogue With Ceausescu'' (1978), while the feminist personal as political is employed in Martha Rosler's ''She Sees in Herself a New Woman Every Day'' (1976) and Sharon Hayes's four-channel video ''The Interpreter Project'' (2001). Andrea Fraser's two videos connect politics and the museum. In one she describes how scientific philanthropy in the 19th century directed wealth to museums and other public institutions rather than the poor, while another video delves into how MoMA itself interacted with revolutionaries and communists, like the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Martha Schwendener)
Museum of the City of New York: 'London Street Photography' (through Dec. 2) Arriving from the Museum of London, which presented it in 2010 and owns the more than 150 works on view, this exhibition affords those of us watching the Olympics on TV a glimpse of an older, more eccentric city. It covers the Victorian era to the present, and is particularly rich in images from the mid-20th century. A smaller companion exhibition, ''City Scenes: Highlights of New York Street Photography,'' provides an opportunity to compare and contrast two very different modern cities as they grappled with war, the postindustrial era and various forms of social tension. Fifth Avenue at 103rd Street, (212) 534-1672, mcny.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Ferdinand Hodler: View to Infinity' (through Jan. 7) Near the end of this exhibition you come to a small, chapel-like room containing a painting from 1915 of Ferdinand Hodler's longtime model and lover Valentine Godé-Darel on her deathbed; three small, vibrantly colored landscapes; and a self-portrait. Thus ring the basic themes that unfold in this extraordinarily touching show of late works by the Swiss Symbolist: Self, Other, Love, Death and World. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Rubin Museum of Art: 'Candid: The Lens and Life of Homai Vyarawalla' (through Jan. 14) The Indian photojournalist Homai Vyarawalla (1913-2012) was on the spot time and again to record the history of modern South Asia being made. This small, evocative, event-filled retrospective catches highlights of her career, including her coverage of Mohandas Gandhi's funeral; important events in the career of the charismatic Jawaharlal Nehru; and visits from Nikita Khrushchev, Ho Chi Minh and Jacqueline Kennedy. As one of the few female photographers in the Indian press corps in her day, Ms. Vyarawalla was a pioneer; in 1970 she abruptly put down her camera and disappeared until her recent rediscovery by younger peers. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; South Street Seaport Museum: 'Compass: Folk Art in Four Directions' (through Feb. 3) The American Folk Art Museum presents some 200 works from its unparalleled collection in this beautifully orchestrated exhibition. Paintings, sculpture, textiles, scrimshaw, painted furniture and much, much more are arrayed along themes that reflect the history of Lower Manhattan -- seafaring, commerce, social life and that all-important factor, the weather -- but not too tightly. Poetic license is taken, yielding an intricate constellation of connected artworks, histories and concerns that highlights one of the city's great treasures. 12 Fulton Street, Lower Manhattan, (212) 748-8600, southstreetseaportmuseum.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Wade Guyton: OS' (through Jan. 13) Something of a rarity this fall season, a beautiful, thoughtfully staged show makes a cogent case for a young painter with no overt political ax to grind working in New York. Made entirely with computer, scanner and printer -- the OS refers to computer operating systems -- his works methodically explore the possibilities of technology as just another if especially up-to-date paintbrush. The results are full of glitches and irregularities that provide their own pictorial life, full of the ghosts of painting past and strikingly original. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)

&#x2605; 'Echoes of the Past: The Buddhist Cave Temples of Xiangtangshan' (through Jan. 6) In the Buddhist way of thinking, all things must pass, though that seems a shame if they're as out-of-this-world beautiful as Chinese Buddhist art is. But could that vision of transience be changing in the 21st century, as still-crude technology lets images live on out there in digital clouds? Regret and hope alike run through this multifaceted show that presents a dozen gorgeous sixth-century sculptures and a digital simulation of the cave temple in China from which some of them were long ago removed. Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, 15 East 84th Street, Manhattan, (212) 992-7800, isaw.nyu.edu. (Cotter)

Robert Adams: 'On Any Given Day in Spring and Light Balances' (through Nov. 3) Two new series of landscape photographs attest to the almost classical lucidity of this esteemed American photographer's work, his passion for nature and his impeccable printing technique. Spare, calligraphic images record the movements of flocks of shorebirds, known as brant, at high tide, while lushly dappled views of Edenic forests demonstrate that few subjects catch the play of light and shadow so basic to photography as richly as leaves and trees. Matthew Marks Gallery, 526 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212) 243-0200, matthewmarksgallery.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; 'Distance and Desire': 'Encounters with the African Archive, Part I: Santu Mofokeng and A.M. Duggan-Cronin' (through Nov. 17) Born in Ireland in 1874, Alfred Martin Duggan-Cronin photographed in South Africa until his death in 1954, creating a multivolume book -- a record of indigenous peoples and of ways of life that he feared were disappearing. In 1997, Santu Mofokeng, born in Johannesburg in 1956, completed a book-length compilation of urban African studio portraits dating to the colonial era. The Duggan-Cronin photographs, seen in mounted pages from his books in this show, perpetuate an old view of Africans as being, by definition, rural, tradition-bound, on the verge of extinction. The studio portraits gathered in Mr. Mofokeng's archive present Africans as they chose to see themselves, as global citizens with modern histories. The Walther Collection, 526 West 26th Street, Suite 718, (212) 352-0683, walthercollection.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Thomas Hirschhorn: 'Timeline: Work in Public Space' (through Nov. 3) Running concurrently with his installation at Gladstone Gallery, Thomas Hirschhorn's ''Timeline: Work in Public Space'' is a dense collage of text and photos that guides you through Mr. Hirschhorn's public artworks. (It's a prelude to his ''Gramsci Monument,'' a Dia project in the Bronx that's slated for summer 2013.) The jumble of texts, photographs and diagrams looks provisional, which suits the unfinished space and, more important, Mr. Hirschhorn's ideas about public art (a term he likes to disparage, saying, ''Art is public''). Dia:Chelsea, 541 West 22nd Street; (212) 989-5566, diaart.org. (Rosenberg)
'We the People' (through Nov. 9) Timed to coincide with the final weeks of the presidential election, this enervating exhibition of works by 68 artists extols American democracy. It includes patriotic posters by Norman Rockwell and LeRoy Neiman, but the overall drift is, unsurprisingly, to the left. There are paintings by Alice Neel, Nicole Eisenman and, most prominently, a billboard-size portrait of Mitt Romney by Richard Phillips. Sculptors include Duane Hanson, creator of a startling super-realistic portrait of a scruffy youth titled ''High School Student.'' Robert Rauschenberg Foundation Project Space, 455 West 19th Street, (212) 228-5283, rauschenbergfoundation.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Helen Miranda Wilson: 'New Paintings' (through Nov. 10) Painted with loving care on small panels, Ms. Wilson's works display compositions made mainly of thin stripes in lush, saturated colors. In most there are hypnotic optical effects. Concentric circles pulse and spin. Horizontal bands dip and bulge. Lines defining shapes like bowling pins suggest spectral human figures with radiating auras. Here is proof that beauty is not just in the beholder's eye. Lori Bookstein, 138 10th Avenue, (212) 750-0949, loribooksteinfineart.com. (Johnson)
Galleries: SoHo
Bernadette Corporation: '2000 Wasted Years' (through Dec. 16) A Warholian spoof of branding, publicity and media, this retrospective of the influential collaborative known as the Bernadette Corporation is depressingly arch. Resembling an ultra-hip design and fashion firm's showroom, the installation includes mannequins in avant-garde clothes; videos of runway shows; scarves and other accessories produced by the Bernadette Corporation; conceptually pointed publications; and a trailer for a documentary about the riots during the 2001 G-8 summit in Genoa with commentary by the actress Chloë Sevigny. Artists Space, 38 Greene Street, (212) 226-3970, artistsspace.org. (Johnson)
Galleries: Other
&#x2605; Tony Conrad: 'Doing the City: Urban Community Interventions' (through Nov. 3) Tony Conrad has slowly been emerging from avant-gardist obscurity, and it's about time. His multifold career -- as experimental film and video maker, composer, musician and sound artist -- still looks radical and prescient a half-century after it began. This show includes haunting 1969 sound pieces, and films and videos made in the past and finished in the present. 80WSE Gallery, New York University, 80 Washington Square East, (212) 998-5747, steinhardt.nyu.edu/80wse. (Cotter)
&#x2605; 'A Disagreeable Object' (through Nov. 26) This group show uses a phrase from Giacometti to lend some context to a present in which casual attitudes toward sculpture have become commonplace and plenty of value, material and otherwise, is attached to objects without pedestals. The main point here is a new-old one: what looks like cheerful insouciance about the art object is actually a deadly serious reaction to the vagaries of war, technology and the economy. SculptureCenter, 44-19 Purves Street, Long Island City, Queens, (718) 361-1750, sculpture-center.org. (Rosenberg)
'The Islands of Benoît Mandelbrot: Fractals, Chaos, and the Materiality of Thinking' (through Jan. 27) This heady, compact exhibition presents efforts from the 1960s and '70s to visualize a species of mathematical formulas known as fractals, a term coined by the mathematician Benoît Mandelbrot (1924-2012). The visual impact of the computer printouts, short films, 3-D models, letters, sketches and Polaroids on display is low, but the philosophical import is great considering the enormous advances in scientific imaging technology that have happened since those early days. Bard Graduate Center, 18 West 86th Street, Manhattan, (212) 501-3023, bgc.bard.edu. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info. (Smith)
&#x2605; Penny Slinger: 'An Exorcism Revisited' (through Nov. 30) Born in England, Penny Slinger emerged from art school in 1969, a time when lots of liberations were under way, including the nascent women's movement. The earliest works in her first New York solo are six short films from that year. They're student pieces, but pretty out there for the time. The main piece is her still unpublished book of photo-collages and texts called ''An Exorcism.'' A blend of ''Rebecca'' and ''Story of O,'' it's yet another reminder of the adventure that feminist art in the 1960s and '70s was. Broadway 1602, 1181 Broadway, Third Floor, (212) 481-0362, broadway1602.com. (Cotter)
Toxic Beauty: 'The Art of Frank Moore' (through Dec. 8) This lavishly detailed retrospective pays tribute to a multifaceted career in painting, set design, film and political activism that was cut short by AIDS in 2002, when the artist was 48. In a time -- the 1980s and '90s -- when some artists re-embraced representational painting and others tackled thorny political topics, Moore did both, and with unusual flair, reviving and revising a panoply of outré realist styles in luminous allegorical canvases that comment on, and link, environmental degradation and the tragedy of AIDS. Grey Art Gallery, 100 Washington Square East, (212) 998-6780, nyu.edu/greyart; and the Tracey/Barry Gallery at Fales Library in Bobst Library, 70 Washington Square South, (212) 998-2596, nyu.edu/library/bobst/research/fales. (Smith)
Public Art
'Common Ground' (through Nov. 30) Located on a site known in the 17th century as the Commons -- which also served as the site of Bloombergville, the precursor to Occupy Wall Street one year ago -- this show offers some incendiary critiques. Ian Hamilton Finlay's group of stone slabs arranged on a patch of grass includes inscriptions from the writings of Louis de Saint-Just (1767-94), a French Revolutionary leader. Paul McCarthy's ''Daddies Ketchup'' (2001), a huge inflatable bottle of ketchup makes a Neo-Pop-psychoanalytic connection between patriarchy and power, and Elmgreen & Dragset's aluminum bullhorn housed in a slick, industrial vitrine evokes protesters in Zuccotti Park, who were forbidden from using any amplification devices, developed a signature form of analogue augmentation, the ''people's microphone.'' City Hall Park, Public Art Fund, (212) 223-7800, publicartfund.org. (Schwendener)
&#x2605; Tatzu Nishi: 'Discovering Columbus' (through Nov. 18) In his first commission in the United States, a Japanese artist known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks around the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them, takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, at Broadway and Central Park South. Free tickets available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor. (Smith)
Out of Town
&#x2605; Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden: 'Ai Weiwei: According to What?' (through Feb. 24) As seen in its first American survey, the work of the lionhearted Chinese artist Ai Weiwei, is no match for his prominent role as a human rights advocate. The sculptures and installation pieces too often adhere to the fashionable international genre of handsome, Conceptually generated artworks. Explanatory labels do much of the heavy lifting, along with historically-charged materials and objects, like Chinese antique furniture and wood from destroyed Qing dynasty temples. The artist's photographs and videos suggest that his documentary work may be best. On the National Mall, at Independence Avenue Southwest and Seventh Street, Washington, (202) 633-4674, hirshhorn.si.edu; free. (Smith)
'Anti-Establishment' (through Dec. 21) Contrary to this muddled exhibition's title, the artists it presents are not uncompromising rebels. The show's curator, Johanna Burton, avers that they imagine ''novel collective relationships and emergent models of engaged citizenship,'' but much of the work is more self-reflexively preoccupied with art than with worldly affairs. Best of all is a room full of Abstract Expressionist-style paintings made with Day-Glo paints by Jacqueline Humphries displayed under ultra violet light. It is a lushly visual trip.

'From 199A to 199B: Liam Gillick' (through Dec. 21) Mr. Gillick is a nearly ubiquitous figure on the international art scene as a conceptual artist, speaker, writer and collaborator with other luminaries like Rirkrit Tiravanija and Pierre Huyghe. He designs shiny, quasi-architectural sculptures for sale in commercial galleries, but here the focus is on politically motivated conceptual projects from the 1990s. If sociology and ideology are your things, this show is for you. Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Johnson)
Institute of Contemporary Art, Pennsylvania: 'Jeremy Deller: Joy in People' (through Dec. 30) The British artist Jeremy Deller, the subject of this thought-provoking show, is the anti-Damien Hirst. He has fashioned a Turner Prize-winning career devoted to breaking down the traditional walls between art and the world at large. Rather than producing visually arresting objects for sale in antiseptic galleries he has organized parades; created odd signs and bumper stickers; made a film about Depeche Mode fans around the world; and orchestrated a historical re-enactment of a large, violent conflict between striking coal miners and police in Orgreave, in South Yorkshire, in 1984. University of Pennsylvania, 118 South 36th Street, Philadelphia, (215) 898-7108, icaphila.org. (Johnson)
'Light and Landscape' (through Nov. 11) Temporary exhibitions at this bucolic art park have not been notably cutting edge, but this show of Postmodernist sculptures relating to light organized by the center's new associate curator, Nora Lawrence, may signal a promising change in the program. It includes indoor works by Roni Horn, Alyson Shotz and Diana Thater and elaborate outdoor constructions by Spencer Finch and William Lamson. Most surprising is Peter Coffin's ''Untitled (Sunshine),'' which consists of four loud speakers attached to a tall pole on a grassy hill broadcasting sunny keyboard melodies composed and performed by the jazz musician Bob James. Storm King Art Center, Old Pleasant Hill Road, Mountainville, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, stormkingartcenter.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art: 'Oh Canada' (through April 8) Seesawing between bigness and intimacy, the personal and the communal, this 62-artist survey of contemporary art in the Great White North may tell you more about Canada's identity crisis than it does about Canadian art. A sense of place, if not nationhood, does emerge in stark photographs of Newfoundland by Ned Pratt and Kim Morgan's hanging latex cast of a lighthouse on Prince Edward Island. Elsewhere, cartoonlike pencil drawings by Annie Pootoogook and Shuvinai Ashoona depict contemporary Inuit life and the artist Amalie Atkins stars in a prairie fairy tale involving musical wolves and bears with golden teeth. 87 Marshall Street, North Adams, (413) 662-2111, massmoca.org. (Rosenberg)
National Gallery of Art: 'Roy Lichtenstein: A Retrospective' (through Jan. 13) The first major survey of this Pop artist's career work since his death, at 73, in 1997, is a big show and has some slow spots, but on the whole it moves right along. As always, Lichtenstein's large-featured images, with their Ben-Day dot patterns; thick, black contours; and flat, bright colors are almost ergonomically comfortable to the eye. On the National Mall, between Third and Seventh Streets, at Constitution Avenue NW, Washington, (202) 737-4215, nga.gov. (Cotter)
&#x2605; National Museum of African Art: 'African Cosmos: Stellar Arts' (through Dec. 9) Packed with celestial bodies and patches of darkness sending forth light, this show is about the extent and persistence of cosmological consciousness in art, old and new, from the African continent. It's also a bold demonstration of a more specific reality: that in Africa, art and science, including astronomy, have always intersected, and continue to, whether in prayers on an ancient Egyptian mummy case asking that the deceased owner be lifted to the stars or in a contemporary video projection that simulates the aurora borealis. Visitors to the National Museum of African Art should also take in the smart, stimulating reinstallation of the permanent collection.

Last Chance
&#x2605; Robert Adams: 'The Place We Live, A Retrospective Selection of Photographs' (closes on Sunday) A prophet in the wilderness of modernity, the photographer Robert Adams has devoted almost five decades to decrying what fecklessly industrious humans have done to the landscape of the American West. This splendid retrospective show of more than 250 prints from the late 1960s to 2009 surveys an oeuvre that is as compelling for its understated metaphorical resonance as for its moral ferocity. Yale University Art Gallery, 111 Chapel Street, New Haven, (203) 432-0600, artgallery.yale.edu. (Johnson)
Jonah Freeman and Justin Lowe: 'Stray Light Grey' (closes on Saturday) Your journey through this immersive installation begins in a janitor's closet. From there you pass through a grungy bathroom, an abandoned Off Track Betting parlor, a plastic surgeon's office and a store stocked with nutritional supplements like ''DNA Recalibrator.'' Finally you emerge into a library displaying fake books with titles like ''The Decorated Slave State'' and ''Fun With Your Interneurons.'' You may wish you could see the unmade movie for which all this would make an excellent set. Marlborough Chelsea, 545 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-8634, marlboroughchelsea.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Ralph Humphrey (through Saturday) With rich, soft colors, abrasive, stucco-like surfaces and boxy, built-out forms, the painter Ralph Humphrey (1932-90) put his own idiosyncratic spin on longstanding formalist concerns. He pit the retinal against the physical and pushed the modernist monochrome toward representation with results at once comic and subtly elegiac. This survey of works form the 1970s and '80s should encourage a museum show. Gary Snyder Gallery, 529 West 20th Street, Chelsea, (212) 929-1351, garysnyderart.com. (Smith)
&#x2605; Jesper Just: 'This Nameless Spectacle' (closes on Saturday) Grand mal, la petit mort or divine revelation? The question lingers in the wake of Mr. Just's astounding, 13-minute video ''This Nameless Spectacle.'' On opposite walls, two extremely wide-screen projections follow the peregrinations of a woman rolling herself along in a wheelchair in Paris followed by a young man who might be a stalker and might be an incarnation of the demigod Eros. The climax resembles a scene from David Lynch's ''Inland Empire.'' James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 714-9500, jamescohan.com. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Daniel Joseph Martinez: 'I Want to Go to Detroit: Cheerleaders Cheer' (closes on Sunday) The two series of photographs in this show are from the late 1970s and are indicators of what would be one of several continuing theme in this artist's work: the body as a malleable, manipulatable, invariably political instrument, capable of many potential uses and carrying many conflicting messages. A second exhibition, with exceptionally powerful new photographs by Mr. Martinez touching on the same theme, opens at the gallery on Nov. 4. Simon Preston Gallery, 301 Broome Street, Lower East Side, (212) 431-1105, simonprestongallery.com. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Fireflies on the Water' (closes on Sunday) The museum's retrospective of the Japanese artist Yayoi Kusama has closed but visitors can still view this 2002 installation, which depicts a seemingly endless space. It's a carefully constructed environment of lights, mirrors and water in which viewers can transcend their very sense of self. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Oskar Fischinger: Space Light Art -- A Film Environment' (closes on Sunday) Projected on three adjoining screens, ''Light Space Art'' floods your retinas with intensely colorful, pulsating circles, flowing lines and blinking rectangles. A found film clip shows a spinning globe and the momentary, cartoon apparition of a young girl in a hooded, fur-trimmed coat. Oskar Fischinger created the original film footage in Weimar-era Germany. Newly restored and digitized, it still generates an exhilarating phantasmagoria of abstraction and metaphor. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Signs & Symbols' (closes on Sunday) In the 1950s, Americans were running out of ways to keep their works new and responsive to a world shaken to the core by World War II. For some the solution was passive-aggressive withdrawal into archaic myth, oracular symbolism and private language. Sampling this trend with works from the Whitney's permanent collection, this show presents lugubriously portentous paintings by hall of famers like Rothko and Pollock and by many journeyman players like Mark Tobey and Forrest Bess. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Johnson)

GRAPHIC: PHOTO: TATZU NISHI: 'DISCOVERING COLUMBUS': (through Nov. 18) In his first commission in the United States, this Japanese artist -- known for temporarily privatizing monuments and landmarks around the globe by building fully outfitted living rooms or hotel suites around them -- takes on the statue of Christopher Columbus perched above Columbus Circle. A free timed ticket and a six-story climb (or elevator ride) yields the semi-Surreal sight of the sculpture presiding over an upscale living room. But the ravishing views may be the main treat. Open daily, from 10 a.m. to 9 p.m., at Columbus Circle, at Broadway and Central Park South. Free tickets are available at publicartfund.org, (866) 607-5461 or the information desk at the Shops at Columbus Circle, third floor.

HEADLINE: Transcript of '44 Bretton Woods Conference Found at Treasury

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A Treasury economist rummaging in the department's library has stumbled on a historical treasure hiding in plain sight: a transcript of the Bretton Woods conference in 1944 that cast the foundations of the modern international monetary system.
Historians had never known that a transcript existed for the event held in the heat of World War II, when delegates from 44 allied nations fighting Hitler gathered in the mountains of New Hampshire to create the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. But there were three copies in archives and libraries around Washington that had never been made public, until now. 
''It's as if someone handed us Madison's notes on the debate over the Constitution,'' said Eric Rauchway, a historian the University of California, Davis.
Economic historians who have viewed the transcript say it adds color and detail to the historical record, an already thick one given the many contemporaneous and subsequent accounts of Bretton Woods. The transcript seems to contain no great surprises, but it sheds light on the intense debates as the war raged abroad.
It depicts John Maynard Keynes, the British economist, hurrying to marshal support for the broad agreements on international finance. It underscores the tremendous power then wielded by Britain and, especially, the United States. It also shows the seeds of contemporary disputes being sown.
For instance, seven decades ago, a number of poorer or smaller countries were protesting their International Monetary Fund quotas, which determine power in the fund. Many of those countries, including China and India, are still pushing for more influence today.
In one section of the transcript, an American representative lays out a proposal for apportioning power in the fund and underscores what was at stake, with the war coming to its bloody climax in Europe.
''We fight together on sodden battlefields. We sail together on the majestic blue. We fly together in the ethereal sky,'' said Fred M. Vinson, who later became chief justice of the United States. ''The test of this conference is whether we can walk together, solve our economic problems, down the road to peace as we today march to victory.''
But the response was not one of absolute unity.
''In spite of the very eloquent and moving speech of the United States delegate, on behalf of the Iranian delegation I wish to state that the quota proposed for my country is entirely unsatisfactory,'' a delegate from Tehran responded.
Then, a delegate from China added: ''I hesitate greatly to sound a note of discord at this conference. It has been the effort of the Chinese delegation to promote harmony and the success of this great common enterprise. But every delegation has its difficulties.''
The Netherlands, Greece, Australia, India, Yugoslavia, New Zealand, France, Ethiopia, Norway and Britain then added their comments and objections. ''I think that a lot of people have thought of Bretton Woods as being a stitch-up job between United Kingdom and the United States,'' Mr. Rauchway said. ''But that's overstated, and it's definitely visible in this transcript. You can see the poorer countries fighting their own corner.''
Kurt Schuler a Treasury Department economist, was browsing in an ''out of the way'' section of uncataloged material in the library two years ago when he came across the Bretton Woods document. He flipped through and saw some remarks by Keynes that he was not familiar with, sort of the economists' equivalent of a Bob Dylan fan finding unknown lyrics.
''I checked them against Keynes's collected works,'' Mr. Schuler said. ''And I knew I had something.''
His research revealed that there were three copies of the transcript that scores of economic historians were not aware of: the version at the Treasury Department; one in the National Archives; and the third in the International Monetary Fund archives.
In his spare time, Mr. Schuler set about turning the yellowed transcript into a book, with a co-editor, Andrew Rosenberg. It took a tremendous amount of work, Mr. Schuler said. They read the transcript aloud into transcription software. They added hyperlinks to documents referenced at the conference, and wrote summaries, annotations and historical notes.
This week, the polished transcript was published as an 800-page e-book by the Center for Financial Stability, a nonprofit group based in New York that researches financial markets, where Mr. Schuler is a senior fellow and Mr. Rosenberg a research associate.
''Everyone thinks they know what happened at Bretton Woods, but what they know has been filtered by generations of historical accounts,'' Barry Eichengreen, a professor or economics and political science at the University of California, Berkeley, said in a statement. ''International monetary history will never be the same.''
The transcript provides ''insight in how it was that they were able to maintain a pace of work which allowed them to reach two really big agreements, on the I.M.F. and the World Bank, within a space of three weeks,'' Mr. Schuler said. ''Keynes was something of a task master,'' he added.
Benn Steil, a senior fellow and director of international economics at the Council on Foreign Relations, said readers can see the British Empire ''disintegrating before your eyes,'' in the transcript. ''The Indians are so vociferous that the British are ripping them off. The British are both furious and mortified that their colony would do this to them,'' he said, describing a dispute over debts with the colonies.
''Bretton Woods was itself 95 percent Kabuki theater,'' he said. ''But it's interesting Kabuki theater.''

HEADLINE: What Moderation Means

BYLINE: By DAVID BROOKS

 BODY:
Over the past month, Mitt Romney has aggressively appealed to moderate voters. President Obama, for some reason, hasn't. But, in what he thought was an off-the-record interview with The Des Moines Register, Obama laid out a pretty moderate agenda for his second term.
It occurred to me that this might be a good time to describe what being a moderate means. 
First, let me describe what moderation is not. It is not just finding the midpoint between two opposing poles and opportunistically planting yourself there. Only people who know nothing about moderation think it means that.
Moderates start with a political vision, but they get it from history books, not philosophy books. That is, a moderate isn't ultimately committed to an abstract idea. Instead, she has a deep reverence for the way people live in her country and the animating principle behind that way of life. In America, moderates revere the fact that we are a nation of immigrants dedicated to the American dream -- committed to the idea that each person should be able to work hard and rise.
This animating principle doesn't mean that all Americans think alike. It means that we have a tradition of conflict. Over the centuries, we have engaged in a series of long arguments around how to promote the American dream -- arguments that pit equality against achievement, centralization against decentralization, order and community against liberty and individualism.
The moderate doesn't try to solve those arguments. There are no ultimate solutions. The moderate tries to preserve the tradition of conflict, keeping the opposing sides balanced. She understands that most public issues involve trade-offs. In most great arguments, there are two partially true points of view, which sit in tension. The moderate tries to maintain a rough proportion between them, to keep her country along its historic trajectory.
Americans have prospered over the centuries because we've kept a rough balance between things like individual opportunity and social cohesion, local rights and federal power. At any moment, new historical circumstances, like industrialization or globalization, might upset the balance. But the political system gradually finds a new equilibrium.
The moderate creates her policy agenda by looking to her specific circumstances and seeing which things are being driven out of proportion at the current moment. This idea -- that you base your agenda on your specific situation -- may seem obvious, but immoderate people often know what their solutions are before they define the problems.
For a certain sort of conservative, tax cuts and smaller government are always the answer, no matter what the situation. For a certain sort of liberal, tax increases for the rich and more government programs are always the answer.
The moderate does not believe that there are policies that are permanently right. Situations matter most. Tax cuts might be right one decade but wrong the next. Tighter regulations might be right one decade, but if sclerosis sets in then deregulation might be in order.
Today, we face our own set of imbalances. Inequality is clearly out of whack. The information age, family breakdown and globalization have widened income gaps. Government spending and government debt are also out of whack. The aging population and runaway health care costs have pushed budgets to the breaking point. There's also been a hardening of the economic arteries, slowing growth.
The moderate sees three big needs that are in tension with one another: inequality, debt and low growth. She's probably going to have a pretty eclectic mix of policies: some policies from the Democratic column to reduce inequality, some policies from the Republican column to reduce debt.
Just as the founding fathers tried a mixed form of government, moderates like pluralistic agendas, mixing and matching from columns A, B and C. They try to create harmonious blends of policies that don't, at first glance, go together.
Being moderate does not mean being tepid. It will likely take some pretty energetic policies to reduce inequality or control debt. The best moderates can smash partisan categories and be hard-charging in two directions simultaneously.
Moderation is also a distinct ethical disposition. Just as the moderate suspects imbalance in the country, so she suspects it in herself. She distrusts passionate intensity and bold simplicity and admires self-restraint, intellectual openness and equipoise.
There are many moderates in this country, but they have done a terrible job of organizing themselves, building institutions or even organizing around common causes. There are some good history books that describe political moderation, like ''A Virtue for Courageous Minds'' by Aurelian Craiutu, a political scientist at Indiana University. But there are few good manifestoes.
Therefore, there's a lot of ignorance about what it means to be moderate. If politicians are going to try to pander to the moderate mind-set, they should do it right. I hope this column has helped.

HEADLINE: On a Frenetic Day, Obama Votes and Romney Is for Change

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO and PETER BAKER; Michael Barbaro reported from Worthington, and Peter Baker from Chicago.

 BODY:
WORTHINGTON, Ohio -- Mitt Romney adopted the mantra that fueled his opponent's victory four year ago, casting himself as the candidate of ''big change'' on Thursday in Ohio as he began to outline a closing argument in the state that could decide the race.
On the same day, President Obama wrapped up a sleep-deprived two-day, eight-state jaunt by pressing supporters to exploit early voting in swing states as a bulwark against the possibility of a surge by Mr. Romney, traveling to Illinois to cast his own ballot 12 days before Election Day.
It was a day of deeply contrasting messages that hinted at the moods and strategies inside both campaigns: Mr. Romney sought to keep projecting the air of a winner, focused on an ambitious agenda of reform, while Mr. Obama emphasized the gritty mechanics of shoring up his electoral turnout. 
Mr. Romney, who is essentially deadlocked with Obama in many national polls and has narrowed the president's advantage in some swing-state polls, started a three-city bus tour here by borrowing a message of change long identified with Mr. Obama's 2008 campaign. The Republican candidate promised to ''tackle the problems politicians have spoken about for years but haven't been willing to deal with.''
''It's time for a big change, and Paul Ryan and I represent a big change for America,'' Mr. Romney said after rolling into an afternoon rally here.
For Mr. Obama, reclaiming the change mantle as an incumbent has been one of his singular challenges. It is hard to run against Washington while traveling with an armed entourage and a big blue and white government plane. So the president has alternated between blaming Republicans in Congress for blocking change and arguing that the change Mr. Romney represents is actually more of the same policies from the Bush era.
At an Obama rally in Richmond, Va., on Thursday, Senator Mark R. Warner, a Democrat, summarized the argument in pithy form.
''In 2008, we changed the guard,'' he told a crowd of 15,000 who turned out to see the president. ''In 2012, we guard the change.''
Mr. Obama made the case, as he does most days, that change has been slower than anyone might wish but that it is under way.
''Unemployment is falling,'' he said at a morning rally in Tampa, Fla. ''Manufacturing is coming back. Our assembly lines are humming again.''
''We've got a long way to go, but, Florida, we've come too far to turn back now,'' he continued. ''We can't afford to go back to the same policies that got us into the mess. We've got to stick with the policies that are getting us out of the mess.''
Mr. Romney's new message of change highlights how significantly his pitch to voters has evolved since he entered the race in 2011. Back then, he devoted most of his time to attacking the president's economic stewardship, even mocking the idea of big change: a standard line back then criticized Mr. Obama as trying to ''transform America'' away from an opportunity society.
On Thursday, it was Mr. Romney who called for transformation, of the small-government variety, saying that Mr. Obama stood for ''the status quo path.''
''The path we're on -- the status quo path -- is a path that doesn't have an answer about how to get the economy going,'' he said. ''The president has the same old answers as in the past: he wants another stimulus, he wants more government workers, and he wants to raise taxes.''
Mr. Romney appeared to be testing new language as he prepared for a major speech on the economy, which he is to deliver in Iowa on Friday, seeking to build on the energy he generated from a series of animated debate performances.
In a rare moment of political self-analysis, Mr. Romney said that ''the president's campaign is slipping'' and attributed it to the debates.
''They have helped propel my campaign, and they have slowed the president's,'' he said.
Mr. Obama wrapped up his two-day round-the-clock swing through the battleground states of Florida, Virginia and Ohio with his quick visit to his hometown, Chicago, to vote. In doing so, he became the first president to vote early in person as he sought to encourage others to do the same. Obama campaign officials argued that he is winning among those already voting.
''All across the country we're seeing a lot of early voting,'' Mr. Obama said. ''It means you don't have to figure out whether you need to take time off work, figure out how to pick up the kids and still cast a ballot. If something happens on Election Day, you will have already taken care of it. If it's bad weather you won't get wet. Or in Chicago, snowy.''
He joked, ''I can't tell you who I voted for.''
When Mr. Obama arrived at the polling place, he signed paperwork as instructed by the election workers and then seemed momentarily surprised when asked for his driver's license.
''Oh, you're right,'' he said, reaching into his pocket. ''I've got my driver's license. Now ignore the fact that there's no gray hair in that picture.''
The Romney campaign made its own pitch for early voting. In Worthington, Senator Rob Portman, a Republican, acknowledged that ''some Republicans don't like to vote early'' but told the audience that it ''frees you up on Election Day to be sure you can help others vote.''
The president planned to return to the White House after 39 straight hours of campaigning, including a red-eye flight from a late-night rally in Las Vegas on Wednesday to an early-morning rally in Tampa on Thursday. Along the way, he began to lose his voice.
''You may notice my voice sounds just a little hoarse,'' he told supporters in Richmond later Thursday. ''We are right in the middle of our 48-hour, fly-around campaign extravaganza. We pulled an all-nighter last night. We just came from Florida. We were in Iowa and Nevada and Colorado before that. We're heading up to Ohio later today.''
It was a wearying trip intended to show resilience and a determination to win. And the president's staff did not seem to mind all that much if the physical strains of his schedule showed, since it suggested he was working overtime for the country's support.
Republicans argued it was a sign of desperation that he was already beginning the round-the-clock trips usually reserved for the final days of a campaign.
Despite the grueling schedule, aides said Mr. Obama was pumped up by rallies that drew thousands of people even as Mr. Romney has closed the gap in some national polls.
''He knows this is his last campaign, but he's having a good time out here,'' said Jen Psaki, a campaign spokeswoman traveling with him on Air Force One.

HEADLINE: Rethinking Paterno's Statue

BYLINE: By TIM ROHAN

 BODY:
STATE COLLEGE, Pa. -- On the first day of class, a Monday near the end of August, about 90 Penn State students filed into another lonely lecture hall for Philosophy 119: Ethical Leadership.
Groggy and a bit cranky at 9 in the morning, some slouched in chairs near the back. A few gossiped. Some doodled. Others brought coffee and browsed Facebook. But everyone expected the professor, a thin man with glasses and peppered gray hair, to go easy. Summer lingered.
Above the murmuring, the professor, Jonathan Marks, asked, ''Should Joe Paterno's statue have been taken down or left up?'' 
Chaos ensued. Nearly every hand shot up.
''It felt like a bomb had exploded in the middle of the room,'' said Nick Kmetz, a student in the class.
For months, the subject -- the sexual abuse scandal involving Jerry Sandusky, and Paterno's role in it -- had been a constant for the students, among friends, at home and in class. It had indelibly marked their college careers. After the July release of the report done by the former F.B.I. director Louis J. Freeh, Susan Welch, the dean of Penn State's college of the liberal arts, encouraged professors to address the matter in class.
''I believe I have a responsibility,'' Marks said.
He is the director of the university's bioethics program, but this semester, in an effort to reach a broader range of students, he was assigned to teach this entry-level course. It was, at once, an opportunity and a challenge.
''In the wake of the discussion about Sandusky, in criticism of the institution, criticism of the Freeh report, everybody has a criticism of somebody else,'' Marks said. ''For me, the important question is, here am I, as an ethicist at this institution, somebody that is also a faculty senator, what are my responsibilities? As a scholar and a teacher, as a member of the community?''
Marks first came to the United States in 2001; that year, according to accusations, Paterno and other Penn State officials failed to act when told Sandusky had assaulted a young boy in the shower of the football building. Marks was from Glasgow, Scotland, had studied law at Oxford, and had no idea what pass interference was. A little over a decade later, football would be, in a way he could never have foreseen, at the center of one of his courses.
The Freeh report would be required reading. He would encourage debate. And, as is the course's purpose, students would learn to identify and evaluate ethical issues.
On the first day, everyone had an opinion about Paterno's statue, which had been taken down in July.
''There were people like, 'He's a great man, no matter what,' '' Kmetz said. ''There were people like, 'This is unacceptable.' I remember sitting in the back thinking, I don't even want to put my hand up. Just because it got real tense.''
He added: ''No matter the side you're on, people are impassioned about it. You either somehow support child abuse or you hate Penn State. A lot of people seem to have a hard time finding the middle ground.''
On the second day of class, Marks again asked about the statue. But this time he proposed that the students assume the role of the university's president, Rodney Erickson, and that their solutions could be multifaceted. They were to consider various people, from the sculptor to Sandusky's victims, and how they would be affected. More than a dozen ideas were put forth, including changing the wording near the statue; relocating it; and melting it down to form something to honor the victims.
The students' personalities had emerged. Some were like Kmetz, a junior majoring in economics, a thinker, sure, but one for whom the class was a requirement. Others were like James Rowley, an outspoken freshman who chose the course as an elective so he could intelligently discuss the case.
As the weeks went on, the grind of the semester took hold. Philosophy 119 was held for 50 minutes every Monday and Wednesday, and the students gathered in smaller groups for Friday discussions. There was a midterm to prepare for, and a 10-page final research paper to write. Marks lectured on ethical frameworks and theories.
The Sandusky scandal was relevant to nearly every topic, and Marks used it as a point of reference about once per week. Any more would result in fatigue for the students, he thought.
''But it was something we'd come back to,'' Marks said, ''as we expanded our body of knowledge, and probe our understanding of what happened here.''
On a recent Wednesday, the students slouched, gossiped and browsed Facebook, and Marks lectured on Herbert Simon's theory of bounded rationality, how one's decision-making rationale is limited by circumstances -- how much information is perceived -- and one's own mind. When Marks asked about the assigned readings, about three students stirred.
Near the end of class, Marks read an essay he had written about a hypothetical friend of Sandusky's who had seen warning signs but had not acted and now wondered why. The students came alive. The day before, Sandusky had been sentenced, essentially, to life in prison. A dozen students wanted to respond.
Marks looked pleased. This was his role: to encourage, and promote, discussion. He never offers his opinion on the scandal, allowing the students to cultivate their own ideas. Kmetz is planning to write his research paper on David Luban's theory of contrived ignorance, how one chooses to ignore wrongdoing to feel less responsible.
For Marks, without continuous discussion there would be no solution. One moment from the scandal still gnaws at him. When the university's board of trustees first commissioned the Freeh report, Kenneth C. Frazier, a prominent trustee, said, ''The entire board of trustees is intent on taking all steps necessary to ensure that our institution never again has to ask whether it did the right thing, or whether or not it could have done more.''
In a rare, excited moment, Marks raised his voice, saying, ''That's the question you should always be asking yourself!''

&#x2605; Kyle Abraham (Thursday through Nov. 3) While working on his first commission for Alvin Ailey American Dance Theater (coming next month), this fast-rising choreographer has also been creating a new piece for his own company, Abraham.In.Motion. In ''Pavement,'' he once again draws inspiration from his hometown of Pittsburgh, delving into the history of racial tensions there. Two works from opposite ends of the 20th century inform the dance: W.E.B. Du Bois's ''Souls of Black Folk'' (1903) and John Singleton's film ''Boyz N the Hood'' (1991). If Mr. Abraham's previous pieces are any indication, we can expect a poetic balance: dark, unsettling moments and the joy inherent in viewing his smart, supple choreography. At 7:30 p.m., Harlem Stage Gatehouse, 150 Convent Avenue, at West 135th Street, Hamilton Heights, (212) 281-9240, harlemstage.org; $30; sold out on Thursday. (Siobhan Burke) 
Ballet Next (Friday through Sunday) This company, founded by Michele Wiles and Charles Askegard, former principal dancers with American Ballet Theater and New York City Ballet, concludes its first weeklong run at the Joyce. The choreography -- by Margo Sappington, Mauro Bigonzetti, Alison Cook Beatty, Brian Reeder and Mr. Askegard, presented on two programs -- might prove less interesting than the stellar guest artists dancing it, like Karina Gonzalez of Houston Ballet and Jason Reilly of Stuttgart Ballet. Ms. Wiles, Mr. Askegard and the City Ballet dancer Georgina Pazcoguin will also perform. Friday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 2 and 8 p.m., Sunday at 2 and 7:30 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $69. (Burke)
Les Ballets Jazz de Montréal (Tuesday through Thursday; through Nov. 4) This sleek troupe of accomplished technicians brings a sampling of international fare to the Joyce. ''Night Box,'' by the Chinese choreographer Wen Wei Wang, blends contemporary ballet with street dance into a portrait of nocturnal urban life; Israel's Barak Marshall, known for his invigorating brand of dance-theater, offers ''Harry,'' a piece about overcoming inner conflict; and two strong, pliant dancers are at the center of ''Zero in On,'' a pas de deux by the Spanish dance maker Cayetano Soto. Tuesday and Wednesday at 7:30 p.m., Thursday at 8 p.m., Joyce Theater, 175 Eighth Avenue, at 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-0800, joyce.org; $10 to $69. (Burke)
&#x2605; Big Dance Theater (Friday and Saturday, Wednesday and Thursday; through Nov. 10) This company's loyal following, combined with the intimate setup of ''Ich, Kürbisgeist'' -- performed in the Chocolate Factory's basement for just 30 people a show -- means that tickets will be hard to come by. But try to get one anyway. The directors, Paul Lazar and Annie-B Parson, never fail to fascinate with their seamless integrations of movement, text, video, song and scenic design. In this new project, co-presented with Performance Space 122, they join forces with the writer Sibyl Kempson, whose ''old tyme agricultural revenge play for Hallowe'en,'' as the new release describes it, is delivered in an entirely invented language. At 8 p.m., Chocolate Factory, 5-49 49th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (212) 352-3101, chocolatefactorytheater.org; sold out. (Burke)
&#x2605; 'Cage on Vinyl on Marley' (Saturday) Dancers randomly select and perform to records of John Cage's music in this daylong event at the National Academy Museum. These aren't just any dancers but quiet luminaries like Douglas Dunn, Pat Catterson and Sara Rudner, who can't help but be fascinating to watch. The durational performance is presented with the Brooklyn art collaborative Norte Maar as part of the museum's celebration of Cage's centenary. From 11 a.m. to 6 p.m., National Academy Museum, 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org/art-museum/public-programs; $15, or $10 for students and 65+. (Burke)
Commons Choir / Daria Faïn and Robert Kocik (Wednesday and Thursday; through Nov. 3) It's not the ''people's mike,'' but ''E-v-e-r-y-o-n-e,'' by the choreographer Daria Faïn and the poet Robert Kocik, is related to that kind of collective call for change. In this ambitious project, Commons Choir -- a group of 27 dancers, actors and singers -- harness the power of language, the body and the voice to advocate for a more equitable economy. Billed as an ''epic, town hall musical,'' the work also draws on the talents of the composer Katherine Young and the vocalist Samita Sinha. At 7:30 p.m., New York Live Arts, 219 West 19th Street, Chelsea, (212) 924-0077, newyorklivearts.org; $20, or $16 for students and 65+. (Burke)
&#x2605; David Gordon (Friday and Saturday) In 1972 Mr. Gordon created ''The Matter,'' based on a scrambled series of Eadweard Muybridge photographs, which translated choreographically into an enigmatic sequence of incongruent poses. As part of Danspace Project's Judson Now series, honoring the 50th anniversary of Judson Dance Theater, Mr. Gordon, one of its founding members, revisits the classic work in a new production, ''The Matter/2012: Art and Archive.'' The cast of more than 30 dancers includes students from New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, members of Mr. Gordon's Pick Up Performance Company, and his inimitable muse and life partner, Valda Setterfield. At 7 and 9 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
Grupo Corpo (Thursday through Nov. 3) This popular Brazilian troupe combines ballet, Afro-Brazilian movement and various forms of urban dance into a buoyant, athletic language very much its own. That inimitable style will be on display in two works at the Brooklyn Academy of Music: ''Ímã,'' which borrows jittering footwork from the Lindy Hop, and, harking back to a more ancient time, ''Sem Mim,'' set to Martín Codax's 13th-century song cycle ''Sea of Vigo.'' At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; $20 to $65. (Burke)
L.A. Dance Project (Friday through Sunday) Benjamin Millepied, of ''Black Swan'' fame, has turned his focus away from the silver screen and toward this smaller but nevertheless ambitious project. His new six-member company makes its East Coast debut at Peak Performances with ''Moving Parts,'' Mr. Millepied's latest collaboration with the composer Nico Muhly, and pieces by two giants of 20th-century contemporary dance: Merce Cunningham's turbulent ''Winterbranch,'' a rarely seen work from 1964, and William Forsythe's ''Quintett'' (1993), danced to the looping, melancholic refrain of Gavin Bryers's score. Friday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m., Sunday at 3 p.m., Alexander Kasser Theater, Montclair State University, 1 Normal Avenue, Montclair, (973) 655-5112, peakperfs.org; $15. (Burke)
LeeSaar the Company (Thursday through Nov. 3) Posing for the mirror, for the camera, for each other, for the audience: variations on attention-seeking, by turns sinister and funny, intertwine in ''Fame,'' created by Lee Sher and Saar Harari for seven intrepid performers. This choreographer-playwright couple, now based in New York, founded their company in Israel 12 years ago; their elastic, off-kilter vocabulary owes much to the improvisational form known as Gaga, pioneered by the Israeli dance maker Ohad Naharin. At 8 p.m., Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, at Pitt Street, Lower East Side, (866) 811-4111, abronsartscenter.org; $20. (Burke)
&#x2605; 'A Pluralistic View of the Judson Dance Theater Legacy' (Sunday) Judson Dance Theater is frequently remembered for its radical embrace of the ordinary -- the ''no to spectacle'' mentality affirmed by Yvonne Rainer in her ''No Manifesto.'' But there were also members of the 1960s collective, like Aileen Passloff, who relished a more full-bodied, less pedestrian kind of dancing. As part of ''Movement Research in Residence'' at the New Museum -- one of this season's many programs honoring Judson's 50th anniversary -- Wendy Perron will moderate a discussion in which Ms. Rainer and Ms. Passloff will talk about their divergent practices and the multifaceted legacy of Judson. At 3 p.m., New Museum, 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org; $8. (Burke)
&#x2605; Yvonne Rainer (Thursday through Nov. 3) The simple act of running takes on mysterious depth in ''We Shall Run,'' which Ms. Rainer, one of Judson Dance Theater's most outspoken iconoclasts, created in the heyday of that cultural movement. Performed by 12 students from Sarah Lawrence College, the 1963 work shares a program with two of her newer, more theatrical dances: ''Assisted Living: Good Sports 2'' and the premiere of ''Assisted Living: Do You Have Any Money?'' danced by her witty, sophisticated group, the Raindears. At 8 p.m., Danspace Project, St. Mark's Church, 131 East 10th Street, East Village, (866) 811-4111, danspaceproject.org; $18. (Burke)
&#x2605; Malavika Sarukkai (Thursday through Nov. 3) Otherworldly, transcendent, divine: such are the words routinely used to describe Ms. Sarukkai, a preeminent dancer in the classical Indian style of Bharatanatyam. Writing in The New York Times about her Kennedy Center concert last year, Alastair Macaulay observed, ''You feel that far larger things are passing through her, and that you are in communion with them, too.'' The Baryshnikov Arts Center and Lincoln Center's White Light Festival co-present her ''Spirit of the Body: Yatra -- Seeking,'' a solo performance accompanied by live music. At 8:30 p.m., Baryshnikov Arts Center, 450 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212) 721-6500, bacnyc.org; $25. (Burke)
&#x2605; 'Some Sweet Day' (Friday through Thursday; through Nov. 4) The guest curator Ralph Lemon has brought together three pairs of influential contemporary choreographers for this series at the Museum of Modern Art, revealing how their works converse across generational and geographical distances. (It also challenges them to make use of that museum's sprawling atrium.) Those artists are Steve Paxton and Jérôme Bel; Dean Moss and Faustin Linyekula; and Sarah Michelson and Deborah Hay. They will participate in discussions of their work on Saturdays. (Mr. Moss and Mr. Linyekula will be featured this week, at 4 p.m.) A full schedule is at moma.org. Donald B. and Catherine C. Marron Atrium, Museum of Modern Art, moma.org, (212) 708-9400; $25, $18 for 65+ or $14 for students. (Burke)
&#x2605; Tanztheater Wuppertal (Friday and Saturday) What is there to say about Pina Bausch's final, beautiful work, ''Como el musguito en la piedra, ay si, si, si...'' except, go and see it? (The unwieldy title, which means ''like moss on a stone, ah yes, yes, yes,'' is taken from a song by the Chilean singer Violeta Parra.) Full of beautiful, winding solos, it celebrates the exceptional dancing of some of the younger members of the Wuppertal ensemble, as well as the gifts of some of its older dancers, like the 62-year-old Dominique Mercy. But then Bausch's work has never ignored the full spectrum of humanity, even -- or particularly -- its less agreeable aspects. ''Como el musguito,'' which was inspired by a residency in Chile, is, like much of her later work, markedly cheerful, even optimistic. In the light of her sudden death less than three weeks after its premiere, it seems all the more moving for that. At 7:30 p.m., Howard Gilman Opera House, Brooklyn Academy of Music, 30 Lafayette Avenue, at Ashland Place, Fort Greene, (718) 636-4100, bam.org; sold out. (Roslyn Sulcas)
Wave Rising Series (Friday through Sunday, Wednesday and Thursday; through Nov. 4) This three-week festival, presented by the choreographer Young Soon Kim at her company's theater in Dumbo, features 21 emerging artists from the United States, Canada and Korea. For a sense of the variety that Ms. Kim has assembled, attend Wednesday's ''Preview Night,'' which provides 10-minute snapshots of the works that will be shown during the final weekend of the series. Friday, Wednesday and Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Saturday and Sunday at 4 and 7:30 p.m., White Wave John Ryan Theater, 25 Jay Street, Dumbo, Brooklyn, (718) 855-8822, brownpapertickets.com; $25 on Wednesday, $18 otherwise.

HEADLINE: Dispossessed Progeny Of Ma and Pa Joad

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
A brief history of American dispossession is conjured with a blend of inquisitive compassion and technical sophistication in ''House/Divided,'' a resonant new multimedia theater piece from the Builders Association that can be seen at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey Theater through Saturday. This moving, inventive production splices together vignettes of the fictional suffering of the Joad family from John Steinbeck's ''Grapes of Wrath'' with a panoramic view of the current mortgage crisis, tracing a sharp line between today's increasingly harsh economic disparities and those of the not-too-distant past.
Directed by Marianne Weems and written by Moe Angelos and James Gibbs, the production weaves together its fictional and nonfictional components seamlessly, using documentary footage and live performers. An abstracted house that sits at center stage is both a symbol and the central component of the set. The walls are mostly scrims onto which streams of filmed images are projected.
We see haunting, spare black-and-white footage of the farmland that the Joads are forced to abandon after years of drought leave the soil barren. This alternates with film of a dilapidated, graffiti-begrimed house in Columbus, Ohio, one of the millions in foreclosure, decaying detritus in the wake of the man-made disaster of the mortgage crisis. 
''House/Divided'' was co-produced by the Wexner Center for the Arts in Columbus, where it was first presented this month, and draws on interviews with men and women on various sides of the housing crisis in the area. An M.B.A. student at Ohio State University speaks with dignified eloquence of her surprise -- and shame -- at falling behind on her mortgage payments and finding herself in foreclosure. Suddenly the stories in the newspapers, and in the textbooks, are no longer remote. ''You are that person,'' she says.
From what might wryly be called the upside of the calamity, we watch interviews with a young man who is in the business of snapping up foreclosed houses as investments (he is interviewed before what he calls his ''ladder of distress,'' photos of houses in various states of economic jeopardy) and another enterprising fellow who has established a profitable business cleaning up homes that have been abandoned to squatters so the banks can sell them again. (To its credit the production doesn't present either of these young men in an accusatory light; neither comes across as a heartless vulture.)
These interviews are projected onto screens that hang above and behind the house, which is where dramatized scenes from ''The Grapes of Wrath'' are acted out: the sorrowful preparations to move, the rough living on the road alongside hundreds of other desperate families, the scraping-by existence the family manages to establish in California picking peaches, the death of Rose of Sharon's baby. Narration from the novel, played on a hand-cranked reel-to-reel tape player that wittily points up the way the company combines old-fashioned manual labor and highly sophisticated technology, reminds us that it wasn't just bad luck and bad weather that forced the Joads into desperate poverty: Steinbeck made it clear that the banks had a hand in it too.
''House/Divided'' finds some surprising nuggets of dark humor in its exploration of the indignities of the foreclosure crisis. At one point one of the performers mimics the automated voice from a call center: ''Hello!'' it chirps like a metallic bird. ''Are you having problems meeting your payments?'' Another segment, both funny and chilling, depicts a man whose possessions are being tossed out onto the road calling his bank, only to find that nobody quite knows who owns his house anymore.
Mordant too is the scene in which a female banker calls a sheriff, preparing to ask him to clear a house of squatters; before she can pose the question, he nervously blurts out, ''I sent it!'' -- assuming the call was an inquiry into a late payment. He also tells her, with no small satisfaction, that he and his deputies have better things to do than harass desperate people on behalf of a bank.
The evening's seven performers -- Ms. Angelos, Jess Barbagallo, Sean Donovan, Matthew Karges, LaToya Lewis, David Pence and Mabel Pence -- play several roles each. I mean no disrespect in saying that no one makes a particularly strong impression: this is ensemble work so cleanly executed that the focus always remains on the larger story being told, not any particular individual within it. By the same token, while the contributions of the designers are all terrific -- Jennifer Tipton's ever-elegant, ever-unobtrusive lighting; the complex video by Austin Switser; the sets by John Cleater and Neal Wilkinson; the haunting music and sound by Dan Dobson -- at no point does one component of the show upstage another. As sophisticated as their contributions are individually, they are so artfully interlaced that they are hard to separate.
Ms. Angelos and Mr. Gibbs mostly refrain from obtrusive finger pointing, but they do depict headset-wearing stockbrokers alternately griping and wisecracking about the gloom that has settled over the market. The production also draws on public statements from various banking titans and regulators to give a top-down perspective on the crisis.
As stock numbers stream across the screens, making pretty streams of color, we hear from actors portraying Richard Fuld, the chairman of Lehman Brothers, striking a reassuring note just as the company was about to implode; from Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the Federal Reserve, testifying before a Congressional panel, testily refusing to admit that his policies were responsible for the meltdown; and from the Goldman Sachs chief financial officer, David Viniar, more or less apologizing to investors for the mere $6.6 billion in revenue the firm logged in the second quarter of this year.
These voices naturally strike tinny, inhuman notes in contrast to the pitiful desperation of the Joads and the matter-of-fact testimony from the people caught up in the tumult of the foreclosure disaster. But the production's most starkly moving image is a silent one: the gradual disassembling of the house sitting at center stage.
I almost didn't notice it when the process began, so caught was I in the sweep of the story, or rather the many stories. Then suddenly the eaves were gone, the stairs were gone, the walls were being carted off. Where there had once been a solid-looking symbol of shelter, there was a barren space. There was nothing at all.

HEADLINE: Presidential Candidates Are on Track For $2 Billion

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and JO CRAVEN McGINTY; Michael Luo and Derek Willis contributed reporting.

 BODY:
President Obama and Mitt Romney are both on pace to raise more than $1 billion with their parties by Election Day, according to financial disclosures filed by the campaigns on Thursday.
From the beginning of 2011 through Oct. 17, Mr. Obama and the Democrats raised about $1.06 billion, and Mr. Romney and the Republicans collected $954 million, including some money for the party's Congressional efforts, setting up 2012 to be the most expensive presidential campaign in history.
But the sources of that money, raised over the course of a deeply polarizing campaign, echo the sharp divisions between the two men and their parties over issues like abortion rights, the role of government in regulating industry and the country's economic future. 
Wall Street has invested more heavily in Mr. Romney, a former financier who has pledged to repeal Mr. Obama's new financial regulations, than in any presidential candidate in memory. Employees of financial firms had given more than $18 million dollars to Mr. Romney's campaign through the end of September and tens of millions more to the ''super PACs'' supporting him.
Insurance companies, doctors and law, accounting and real estate firms are giving less to Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee than they did four years ago, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics.
Yet donors in other industries have stepped in. With Mr. Obama making repeated trips to Silicon Valley and holding round tables with executives there, the technology industry has donated about $14 million to the president and the Democrats, substantially more than in 2008.
Retirees, the biggest single source of money for both sides, have given the Democrats much more than they did four years ago, as have employees of women's groups, retailers and hospitals and nursing homes.
To make up for the loss of business money that flowed to his campaign four years ago, Mr. Obama has also turned to the very smallest donors, building an army of millions of supporters who have given as little as a few dollars each. About 4.2 million people sent donations to Mr. Obama and the D.N.C., his campaign said on Thursday, roughly one million more than in 2008.
Over all, 55 percent of the Obama campaign's money through the end of September came in donations of less than $200, including from many people who have repeatedly sent in small checks over the course of the campaign. Just 13 percent of his checks were for $2,500, the maximum that donors are allowed to contribute for either the primary or general election.
Mr. Romney, by contrast, has cultivated business leaders and benefited from a Republican donor establishment that is eager to defeat Mr. Obama, raising an unprecedented amount of money from wealthy donors who gave the maximum allowed. Just 22 percent of his cash has come from donations of less than $200. Through the end of September, 45 percent of checks to Mr. Romney's campaign were for the maximum $2,500 contribution.
Neither candidate is likely to raise as much money directly for his own presidential committee as Mr. Obama did in 2008. A flood of online donations that year, and support from many traditionally Republican donors, helped Mr. Obama raise $748 million for his presidential committee. The D.N.C. raised another $244 million, bringing the combined total to a little under $1 billion.
This time around, Mr. Obama, as an incumbent, has raised more of his total through the D.N.C., which can accept five-figure checks from each of Mr. Obama's wealthiest supporters. By raising more money from his very biggest and very smallest donors, Mr. Obama has been able to offset his losses from the business world and from previous contributors who gave less or not at all this time, whether because of the recession or fading enthusiasm.
Mr. Romney, after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee in the spring, almost immediately began a fund-raising effort with the Republican National Committee, several state parties and the two Congressional campaign committees. Mr. Romney's total through September included about $13.6 million that was raised for and transferred to the National Republican Senatorial Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee.
The overall totals do not include hundreds of millions of dollars being raised and spent by ''super PACs'' and other outside groups, mostly to benefit Mr. Romney and other Republicans. Groups aligned with Mr. Romney have spent $302 million on campaign advertising that they are required to disclose to the F.E.C., compared with about $120 million for groups aligned with Mr. Obama. Tens of millions of dollars more has been spent on issue advertisements whose precise costs are difficult to measure.
''As the Romney campaign and their 'super PAC' allies continue to outspend us on the air, we're making every effort to expand our donor base heading into the final stretch,'' said Adam Fetcher, an Obama spokesman.
Mr. Romney and the Republicans raised about $21.3 million more than Mr. Obama and the Democrats during the first 17 days of October, according to the disclosures filed on Thursday, as Mr. Romney rose in the polls and performed well in debates, emboldening his supporters.
Mr. Obama and the Democratic National Committee took in $92.4 million during that period, after surpassing Mr. Romney in August and September.
Mr. Romney and the R.N.C. raised $113.7 million over the same period, the final days for which the campaigns are required to report their fund-raising before the election on Nov. 6. Mr. Romney and his party also spent about $146.2 million during the first 17 days in October, slightly less than the $149.7 million spent by Mr. Obama and the Democrats.
While Mr. Obama's team invested tens of millions of dollars early in the campaign to identify, contact and raise money from grass-roots voters, those expenditures have left the Republicans with more cash in the final weeks of the election that could finance a late surge of advertising. Mr. Romney and the G.O.P. ended the final filing period with $169 million in cash on hand, significantly more than the $123.8 million held by Mr. Obama and the Democrats.

HEADLINE: Business Confidence Remains Weak

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies are holding off on purchases of computers, industrial equipment and other long-lasting manufactured goods, a trend that is slowing the American economy. 
A fourth straight month of lackluster corporate spending led some economists on Thursday to trim their forecasts for growth in the July-September quarter. The government will issue its first estimate of third-quarter growth on Friday, the last snapshot of overall economic activity before the presidential election.
The report on business confidence overshadowed a drop in applications for unemployment aid and a slight increase in the number of people who signed contracts to buy homes.
Orders for durable goods, products expected to last at least three years, rose 9.9 percent in September, the Commerce Department said. But most of the increase was driven by a spike in aircraft orders, which are volatile and plummeted in the previous month.
Economists pay closer attention to core capital goods, which include machinery and computers but exclude aircraft. Those orders were unchanged in September after only a slight gain in August and steep declines in July and June.
And shipments of those goods fell for the third straight month. That means business spending on equipment and software probably declined 4.9 percent in the July-September quarter, economists said. It would represent the first drop in that category since the recession.
Corporate investment helped the American economy emerge from the recession three years ago. But businesses have grown more cautious since spring, seeing tepid growth in consumer spending and declines in exports.
The disappointing report on durable goods led several economists to downgrade their forecasts for third-quarter economic growth. Michael Feroli, an economist at JPMorgan Chase, lowered his forecast to an annual rate of 1.6 percent, down from 1.8 percent. Peter Newland, an economist at Barclays Capital, reduced his forecast to a rate of 1.8 percent from 2 percent.
Either figure would reflect little improvement from the April-June growth rate of 1.3 percent.
Sluggish business investment has burdened job creation at American factories. Manufacturers slashed 20,000 jobs in the third quarter. Factories added 194,000 jobs in the previous three quarters.
A separate report Thursday suggested hiring remains modest, at best. Weekly applications for unemployment benefits fell last week to a seasonally adjusted 369,000, stabilizing after two weeks in which seasonal factors distorted the data. The four-week average, a less volatile measure, rose to 368,000, the Labor Department said.
Applications are a proxy for layoffs. A number below 375,000 suggests hiring is strong enough to lower the unemployment rate.
Applications have fluctuated between 360,000 and 390,000 since January. At the same time, employers have added an average of nearly 150,000 jobs a month. That is barely enough to lower the unemployment rate, which declined to 7.8 percent in September from 8.3 percent earlier this year.
A third report on Thursday showed the housing recovery may be cooling off. The National Association of Realtors's index of sales agreements showed that the number of Americans who signed contracts to buy homes rose slightly in September from August. That suggests sales may level off in the coming months after solid gains in the past year.

HEADLINE: College Endowment Returns Fall Steeply

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
The average return on college and university endowments dropped sharply in the last fiscal year, according to a preliminary study released on Thursday.
The endowments, on average, lost money in the fiscal year ending in June, declining by 0.3 percent. 
The result is a steep reversal from the previous fiscal year when the average return was 19.2 percent.
The preliminary study found that colleges with the largest endowments, more than $1 billion, did the best, up 1.2 percent in fiscal 2012. The worst performing endowments were those institutions with assets of $51 million to $100 million, which declined by 1 percent.
The results included data from 463 colleges and universities; more than 800 are expected to participate in the final study, which is being conducted by the Commonfund Institute and the National Association of College and University Business Officers, known as Nacubo. The final study is expected to be released in late January.
The findings come at a difficult time for higher education, as the traditional sources of revenue for colleges and universities -- tuition, state financing and fund-raising -- have been squeezed by the financial crisis, even as costs have increased.
Enrollments are dropping in some states too, because of such factors as fewer college-age students and the rising costs of attending colleges and universities.
The preliminary study does not identify individual colleges. Some institutions, however, have released their returns for fiscal 2012, and the results are mixed. For instance, the endowment of Harvard, by far the largest, posted an investment loss of .05 percent. Yale's endowment posted a 4.7 percent investment gain, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's, 8 percent.
Historically, the largest endowments have posted the best investment returns. But that reversed itself during the first years of the financial crisis. One explanation is that during the last decade those with large endowments invested heavily in alternative investments like private equity funds and hedge funds. Alternative investments represent 59 percent of the portfolio at endowments of more than $1 billion; by contrast, they account for 14 percent of endowments valued at under $25 million.
Smaller endowments have a larger allocation of fixed-income and short-term securities, and they performed relatively well from 2007 to 2009.
But their success was short-lived. Starting in fiscal 2010, the largest funds have outperformed the others, the preliminary study found, and they have performed best over a 10-year period. The highest return in fiscal 2012, which ended in June, was 15.8 percent, and the worst was a decline of 9.5 percent.

HEADLINE: The Sprint to Election Day

 BODY:
The final weeks of a presidential race are supposed to give the candidates a chance to choose their biggest ideas and strongest pitches to win wavering voters and drive supporters to the polls. So how does Mitt Romney choose to address one of the biggest challenges facing the nation -- its faltering education system?
''We're going to finally fix our schools,'' he said on Wednesday in Reno. And that's all he said about his education policy. Not even a hint of how he proposes to do that, especially given his hope to make the Department of Education ''a heck of a lot smaller.'' (He did give the usual verbal shove to teachers' unions for resisting charter schools, which have hardly proved to be a panacea.) 
By contrast, President Obama talked about the subject in detail on his whirlwind tour of swing states this week. In Tampa, Richmond and Cleveland on Thursday, he said he wants to recruit 100,000 math and science teachers, train two million workers at community colleges in the skills needed for employment, and pressure colleges to restrain tuition growth. He made it clear that he will spend money on a national priority that Mr. Romney apparently feels can be left to the whims of individual states.
That's only one example of how the campaigns are approaching the finish line, but it illustrates the contrast in their conceptions of what voters want to hear.
Mr. Romney is providing nostrums instead of policies. ''I'll balance the budget,'' he promised, though his plans to cut taxes and raise military spending would do the opposite. By comparison, Mr. Obama, though he waited too long to begin providing specifics on his second-term agenda, has decided to spend the last two weeks describing them. In his speeches and in a new publication, he is talking about using tax breaks to prod American manufacturing; spending money on repairs of roads, bridges and schools; investing more in renewable energy; and raising taxes on the rich to help pay for all of this. In an interview with The Des Moines Register, he said (after agreeing to go on the record) that he intends to renegotiate the sequester and focus on immigration reform if re-elected.
Mr. Romney, who has moved up in the national polls, has apparently decided to play it safe in the final stretch, as wary of explaining how his tax or jobs plans would actually work as he has been through the campaign. The latest swing-state poll numbers suggest that he will have to do better. In the crucial state of Ohio, Mr. Romney hasn't been ahead in any poll for the last two weeks, and on Wednesday, a Time magazine poll showed Mr. Obama ahead there by five points.
For Mr. Romney, Mr. Obama's decision to bail out the auto industry and his own rejection of it is proving to be an Electoral College challenge. Several states are also feeling the benefits of an improved economy. Obama campaign officials say that to win, Mr. Romney would have to pick off voters already committed to the president in states where Mr. Romney has never been ahead. ''We think we maintain a lot more plausible pathways to 270 than Governor Romney, who we think has to essentially pull an inside straight,'' said David Plouffe, the president's chief strategist.
Those pathways exist because millions of voters still harbor doubts about Mitt Romney. He has apparently decided that in the final days of the campaign, he will do little to dispel them.

HEADLINE: Tokyo Governor Quits to Form New Party

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI; Makiko Inoue contributed reporting.

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Shintaro Ishihara, the firebrand governor of Tokyo whose vocal campaign to secure a set of disputed islands provoked a damaging dispute with China, declared Thursday that he was quitting local politics to start a national party, a move that could win him some say in shaping policy and escalate the territorial dispute.
Mr. Ishihara, a nationalist politician who has said that Japan should develop nuclear weapons and abandon its pacifist Constitution, is considered too far right of the populace to build a party big enough to form a government. But with polls suggesting no clear winner in elections that must be called by August, Mr. Ishihara could potentially become an influential player in a coalition government and push its leaders to take a more nationalistic stance. 
Some analysts acknowledged Mr. Ishihara's potential to become a kingmaker, but said the electoral politics remain very fluid.
''If elections are called before the end of the year, he could become the eye of the storm,'' Hirotada Asakawa, an independent political analyst, told the daily Kanagawa Shimbun. But he said that if the election were delayed, Mr. Ishihara could be exposed to more criticism of his record, like his gaffes and Tokyo's failed bid to land the 2016 Olympics.
At a news conference, Mr. Ishihara said that he intended to cooperate with two other small conservative parties -- including one recently formed by the populist mayor of Osaka, Toru Hashimoto -- to challenge what he characterized as feckless politicking by the governing Democratic Party and its main opposition, the Liberal Democratic Party.
The announcement comes at a politically fraught time, when China's rise and assertiveness in the region is unnerving Japan's leaders and many Japanese, who have supported their country's refusal to back down in the territorial war of words.
Mr. Ishihara wasted no time on Thursday in hurling insults at China and South Korea, referring to them with the names that Japan used during its colonization of much of East Asia in the early 20th century. He said Japan should do more to develop its natural resources so it can ''stop bowing to the will of'' its giant neighbor.
He also said Japan should do away with its Constitution, which renounces the country's right to wage war, as quickly as possible. He said it was ridiculous that Japan had kept a charter that was drafted by the United States after World War II.
''I'm 80 years old, and I ask myself: Why does it have to be me? Why can't the young get their act together?'' Mr. Ishihara said. ''But if Japan keeps going like this, it will sink into a pit and die.''
Tokyo's three vice governors will run the city until new elections are held within two months, according to news reports.
Mr. Ishihara, a Liberal Democratic lawmaker until he ran as an independent in 1999, had already made a return to the national stage by prompting the most recent flare-up over the islands that Japan calls the Senkaku and China calls the Diaoyu.
Last spring, he said he wanted Tokyo to buy several of the islands from their owner, a Japanese citizen, to better defend them from China. Under pressure not to look weak, Prime Minister Yoshihiko Noda decided the central government would buy the islands instead, a move that apparently was meant to calm the situation but instead created protests across China and led to unofficial boycotts of Japanese goods.
The dispute has seemed to wane a bit recently, although Chinese surveillance ships were spotted near the islands on Thursday for the first time in three weeks, leading Japan's Foreign Ministry to lodge a protest with Beijing's ambassador in Tokyo.
Mr. Ishihara, once a novelist, achieved notoriety in the United States with his 1989 book, ''The Japan That Can Say No,'' which urged a more assertive policy toward America.
Despite his high profile, he made few real inroads in national politics, prompting him to retire in 1995 after a quarter-century in office. He made a political comeback in 1999, however, as mayor of Tokyo, and has won four consecutive terms.
More than once, Mr. Ishihara has landed in trouble for gaffes, notably after last year's tsunami, when he called it ''divine punishment'' for what he saw as the country's general decline amid economic stagnation. He was eventually forced to retract the statement.
Mr. Ishihara's ability to affect policy will be determined by his party's performance in national elections for Parliament's powerful lower house, which chooses the prime minister. With the governing Democrats' popularity sagging, the opposition Liberal Democrats, under their new hawkish leader, Shinzo Abe, are expected to make big gains -- but neither party appears likely to win a majority and will therefore need to join forces with smaller parties to form a government.
Mr. Ishihara did not give details on Thursday of how closely he expected to work with Mr. Hashimoto, whose popularity has made him one of Japan's most feared politicians. Though Mr. Hashimoto has made some nationalistic statements, the men differ on major issues like nuclear policy. Mr. Ishihara is a staunch supporter of nuclear power, while Mr. Hashimoto has pushed for stronger regulation after last year's nuclear disaster.

HEADLINE: Pointing Toward Prosperity?

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Mitt Romney has been barnstorming the country, telling voters that he has a five-point plan to restore prosperity. And some voters, alas, seem to believe what he's saying. So President Obama has now responded with his own plan, a little blue booklet containing 27 policy proposals. How do these two plans stack up?
Well, as I've said before, Mr. Romney's ''plan'' is a sham. It's a list of things he claims will happen, with no description of the policies he would follow to make those things happen. ''We will cut the deficit and put America on track to a balanced budget,'' he declares, but he refuses to specify which tax loopholes he would close to offset his $5 trillion in tax cuts. 
Actually, if describing what you want to see happen without providing any specific policies to get us there constitutes a ''plan,'' I can easily come up with a one-point plan that trumps Mr. Romney any day. Here it is: Every American will have a good job with good wages. Also, a blissfully happy marriage. And a pony.
So Mr. Romney is faking it. His real plan seems to be to foster economic recovery through magic, inspiring business confidence through his personal awesomeness. But what about the man he wants to kick out of the White House?
Well, Mr. Obama's booklet comes a lot closer to being an actual plan. Where Mr. Romney says he'll achieve energy independence, never mind how, Mr. Obama calls for concrete steps like raising fuel efficiency standards. Mr. Romney says, ''We will give our fellow citizens the skills they need,'' but says nothing about how he'll make that happen, pivoting instead to a veiled endorsement of school vouchers; Mr. Obama calls for specific things like a program to recruit math and science teachers and partnerships between businesses and community colleges.
So, is Mr. Obama offering an inspiring vision for economic recovery? No, he isn't. His economic agenda is relatively small-bore -- a bunch of modest if sensible proposals rather than a big push. More important, it's aimed at the medium term, the economy of 2020, rather than at the clear and pressing problems of the present.
Put it this way: If you didn't know what was actually going on in the U.S. economy, you'd think from reading the Obama plan that America was a place where workers with the right skills were in high demand, so that our big problem was that not enough people have those skills. And five or 10 years from now, America might actually look like that. Right now, however, we're still living in a depressed economy offering poor prospects for almost everyone, including the highly educated.
Indeed, these have been really bad years for recent college graduates, who all too often can't find anyone willing to make use of their hard-won skills that were expensive to attain. Unemployment and underemployment among recent graduates surged between 2007 and 2010, while far too many highly trained young people found themselves working in low-skill jobs. The job market for skilled workers, like that for Americans in general, is now gradually improving. But it's still far from normal.
The point is that America is still suffering from an overall lack of demand, the result of the severe debt and financial crisis that broke out before Mr. Obama took office. In a better world, the president would be proposing bold short-term moves to move us rapidly back to full employment. But he isn't.
O.K., we all understand why. Voters have been told over and over again that the 2009 stimulus didn't work (actually it did, but it wasn't big enough), and a few days before a national election is no time to try to change that big a false belief. So all that the administration feels able to offer are measures that would, one hopes, modestly accelerate the recovery already under way.
It's disappointing, to be sure. But a slow job is better than a snow job. Mr. Obama may not be as bold as we'd like, but he isn't actively misleading voters the way Mr. Romney is. Furthermore, if we ask what Mr. Romney would probably do in practice, including sharp cuts in programs that aid the less well-off and the imposition of hard-money orthodoxy on the Federal Reserve, it looks like a program that might well derail the recovery and send us back into recession.
And you should never forget the broader policy context. Mr. Obama may not have an exciting economic plan, but, if he is re-elected, he will get to implement a health reform that is the biggest improvement in America's safety net since Medicare. Mr. Romney doesn't have an economic plan at all, but he is determined not just to repeal Obamacare but to impose savage cuts in Medicaid. So never mind all those bullet points. Think instead about the 45 million Americans who either will or won't receive essential health care, depending on who wins on Nov. 6.

HEADLINE: More Disappointment, And Modest Gains

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks ended with small gains on Thursday as worries about weak business spending kept investors wary.
After the close of trading, Apple, the most valuable public company in the United States, posted quarterly earnings that fell short of expectations. Apple said it earned $8.67 a share, which compared with Wall Street's estimate for $8.75 a share. Trading of Apple's stock was halted after the close and ahead of the earnings, but trading resumed at about 4:50 p.m. Apple's stock fell 1.4 percent to $600.71 in extended hours after its results, though it was down 4 percent when trading resumed. 
Equity futures fell on the news, with Standard & Poor 500 futures dropping 3 points to 1,405.20, signaling a possible fall in stocks on Friday.
The S. & P. 500-stock index had declined 3.6 percent over the previous five sessions before a modest rebound Thursday. A string of prominent earnings disappointments pointed to weak global demand and sapped buying enthusiasm after what had been a strong run in 2012.
There were a few bright spots, like Procter & Gamble, which rose 2.9 percent to end at $70.07 after reporting stronger-than-expected results. But that was not enough to motivate investors reeling from a sharp decline in recent days.
With about 244 companies in the S. & P. 500 reporting results so far, 62.3 percent have beaten expectations, a slight improvement on the 62 percent average, Thomson Reuters data showed.
Revenue this quarter has been less than stellar, with just 36.3 percent of companies reporting higher-than-expected revenue -- compared with a historic improvement rate of 62 percent.
''It's all a continuation of companies beating on earnings, but coming in lower on revenue,'' said Terry Morris, senior vice president of National Penn Investors Trust Company in Reading, Pa.
Big-picture uncertainty has also had a damping effect on stock prices as the countdown to the presidential election and the impending tax changes near.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 26.34 points, or 0.20 percent, to 13,103.68. The S. & P. 500 gained 4.22 points, or 0.30 percent, to finish at 1,412.97. The Nasdaq composite index advanced 4.42 points, or 0.15 percent, to end at 2,986.12.
Interest rates were higher. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note fell 11/32, to 98 11/32, and the yield rose to 1.81 percent from 1.79 percent late Wednesday.
Crude oil and gasoline prices rose in response to a growing threat that Hurricane Sandy might disrupt supplies on the East Coast.

Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases: nytimes.com/movies.
&#x2605; 'Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry' (R, 1:31, in English and Mandarin) In December 2008 a 24-year-old American, Alison Klayman, as a favor to a friend, started videotaping the Chinese artist Ai Weiwei. Her timing was dazzling as was her perseverance, as becomes clear in this galvanizing portrait of the artist, his work and his times. (Manohla Dargis)
'Alex Cross' (PG-13, 1:41) Tyler Perry stars in this grim, maladroit attempt to kick start a new franchise pegged to the James Patterson character played in two earlier movies by Morgan Freeman. This flick was directed, badly, by Rob Cohen. (Dargis)
'All Together' (No rating, 1:36, in French) This shallow, agreeably chipper French comedy (starring Jane Fonda) about five friends in their 70s who decide to live together steers a careful middle ground between sentimentality and farce. (Stephen Holden) 
'Arbitrage' (R, 1:40) Richard Gere plays a New York hedge-fund magnate whose glittering world may be coming undone in Nicholas Jarecki's sleek entertainment about how very good greed can be. A fairy tale masquerading as a tragedy, the film features Susan Sarandon as the wife and Brit Marling as the doting daughter. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'Argo' (R, 2:00) A bearded Ben Affleck directed, and stars in, this smart, jittery thriller about a real if stranger-than-fiction chapter of the Iranian hostage crisis that brought together a smart American intelligence officer, some plucky Canadians and two jaundiced Hollywood veterans (the funny tag team of John Goodman and Alan Arkin) to save the day. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Big Picture' (No rating, 1:54, in French, Serbian, Montenegrin and English) The adage, ''It's never too late to be who you might have been,'' ascribed to George Eliot, is given a cruel twist in this terrific French thriller. A loose adaptation of Douglas Kennedy's 1997 novel, it might be described as ''The Talented Mr. Ripley'' for the age of Google. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'Brooklyn Castle' (No rating, 1:41) The director Katie Dellamaggiore's irresistible documentary offers an up close, personal and political look at the wee chess champs at Intermediate School 318 in Williamsburg whose winning streak continues on screen. (Dargis)
'Detropia' (No rating, 1:33) A visual caress of postindustrial blight, Heidi Ewing and Rachel Grady's dreamy documentary about a slowly crumbling Detroit places information and analysis distant seconds to mood and impression. (Jeannette Catsoulis)
'Diana Vreeland: The Eye Has to Travel' (PG-13, 1:26) A dizzily enjoyable documentary from Lisa Immordino Vreeland about Diana Vreeland, the famous fashion editor and paradigmatic self-made woman who had a genius for the inspirational, the gnomic and the quotable. (Dargis)
'End of Watch' (R, 1:49) David Ayer's ode to beat cops and the expansive literature on them is a muscular, maddening exploitation movie embellished with art-house style and anchored by solid performances from Jake Gyllenhaal and Michael Peña. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Flat' (No rating, 1:37) Tirelessly prodding the scab of denial and the bruises of Holocaust memories, Arnon Goldfinger's true-life detective story begins as a family quest but evolves into a gripping study of know-don't-tell reticence and the umbilical tie of a lost homeland. (Catsoulis)
'Frankenweenie' (PG, 1:27) This cute and creepy animated update of the Frankenstein story, from the imagination of Tim Burton, pays tribute to monster movies of the past while honoring the commercial family-movie imperatives of the present. (A. O. Scott)
'Here Comes the Boom' (PG, 1:44) This is a pleasant enough comedy if you can buy the premise that Kevin James would make a credible mixed martial arts fighter. Here he's a teacher determined to raise money to save the music program, and he takes up the sport for the purses it offers. Mr. James and Henry Winkler, playing a fellow teacher, pair surprisingly well in the predictable tale. (Neil Genzlinger)
&#x2605; 'Holy Motors' (No rating, 1:56, in English and French) The French filmmaker Leos Carax opens the door to a world full of laughter, horror and rapture, reminding you of just how drearily conventional many movies are. A mystery man (Denis Lavant) moves, walks, leaps and rides through Paris in a series of strange adventures in a dream of the movies that looks like a movie of dreams. (Dargis)
'Hotel Transylvania' (PG, 1:31) This animated film, essentially ''The Little Mermaid'' with monsters, looks great, though the story grows less interesting as the movie progresses. Dracula keeps his teenage (well, she's 118) daughter in a hotel that's exclusively for monsters to protect her from those nasty humans, but she wants to experience the world. A wayward hiker dude only reinforces that determination. Some good monster-related humor early on before the predictable plot takes over. (Genzlinger)
'The House I Live In' (No rating, 1:48) In his latest documentary, Eugene Jarecki, inspired by an African-American family employee, digs deep into the drug war and its racial and class implications. The result is a call to national conscience, and persuasively urgent. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'How to Survive a Plague' (No rating, 1:50) The currents of rage, fear, fiery determination and, finally, triumph that crackle through David France's inspiring documentary lend this history of the AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power, or Act Up, a scorching electrical charge. (Holden)
'The Intouchables' (R, 1:52, in French) In this buddy movie from France, a rich white guy (François Cluzet), paralyzed from the neck down, is cared for by an African immigrant (Omar Sy) who teaches his boss to loosen up and appreciate life. The film's unabashed embrace of racial stereotypes may startle American audiences -- the movie was a huge hit in France -- but there is appealing warmth to the performances and an overall mood of friendly tolerance. It's embarrassing, but not as bad as it might have been. (Scott)
'The Iran Job' (No rating, 1:30) Iran in 2008 isn't a place where every American would feel comfortable. But the effusive basketball player Kevin Sheppard takes to it with informal ease in this documentary, observational and authentic if not always artful. Sports fans are fed, but so are the culturally curious: most interesting and revealing are three lively Iranian women he befriends. (David DeWitt)
'Just 45 Minutes From Broadway' (No rating, 1:46) This reverent sendup, from the prolific Henry Jaglom, borders on farce (but not enough) when dropping in on a family of actors who can't turn off their performing in life, for better or worse -- though the better is sometimes hard to imagine with this crew of hams. Most of the performers do fine work, given the muddy genre, but the film's crop of cliché_s is dispiriting, in result if not intent. (DeWitt)
'Looper' (R, 1:58) Joseph Gordon-Levitt plays a killer and Bruce Willis plays an older version of the same in Rian Johnson's obstreperously entertaining science-fiction pastiche set in a futuristic world that sometimes looks and sounds paradoxically out of the past. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Master' (R, 2:17) Confounding and amazing, Paul Thomas Anderson's latest film explores the relationship between a cult leader (Philip Seymour Hoffman) and a shellshocked veteran of World War II (Joaquin Phoenix). Must be seen to be believed, and wrestled with for a long time after. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Middle of Nowhere' (R, 1:39) Ava DuVernay wrote and directed this plaintive, slow-boiling, quietly soul-stirring drama about a young woman (Emayatzy Corinealdi) who, with her husband (Omari Hardwick) serving time, has lost touch with her own self and needs. Her journey is hard, as well as politically freighted, but also more complex than it might initially seem. (Dargis)
'Nobody Walks' (R, 1:23) It would be tempting to dismiss Ry Russo-Young's portrait of a casual seducer (Olivia Thirlby) wreaking havoc as a trivial erotic divertissement. But it picks at every scab you may have left over from wounds suffered during the mating games of your youth. (Holden)
'The Paperboy' (R, 1:46) In the hands of Lee Daniels (''Precious''), Pete Dexter's Southern potboiler becomes a hot mess of pulpy passion, utterly incoherent but crazily alive. With Nicole Kidman, Matthew McConaughey and Zac Efron in his underpants. (Scott)
'Paranormal Activity 4' (R, 1:35) The consistency of the ''Paranormal Activity'' franchise, and its determination not to overreach, keeps humming with this latest entry, which should please the fans. The latest technological accessories to appear in the series include Skype and an Xbox, and for once a teenager (played by a wonderful Kathryn Newton) is the protagonist. But after four installments, it's high time the filmmakers started providing some answers as to where the overall narrative is going. (Andy Webster)
'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' (PG-13, 1:43) Stephen Chbosky directs this adaptation of his 1999 young adult novel about the ups, downs and playlists of an introverted high school freshman, Charlie (Logan Lerman), who's rescued by the friendships he makes. (Dargis)
'Pitch Perfect' (PG-13, 1:52) This comedy about a female collegiate a cappella group feels as if it's aimed at tweeners, which is too bad because that saddles it with dopey plot elements -- daddy issues, boyfriend issues -- that prevent a more substantive look at this rich genre of music. A few of the songs, though, rock. (Genzlinger)
'Samsara' (PG-13, 1:39) Ron Fricke's new film, like its predecessor, ''Baraka,'' is a free-associative tour of the world, a series of striking, sometimes surreal images of nature, work, life and death in the global economy. (Scott)
&#x2605; 'Searching for Sugar Man' (PG-13, 1:26) There are several entrancing mysteries circulating in Malik Bendjelloul's hugely appealing documentary about fans, faith and an enigmatic Age of Aquarius musician known as Rodriguez, who burned bright and hopeful before disappearing. Don't wait for the DVD. (Dargis)
&#x2605; 'The Sessions' (R, 1:35) The movie couple of the year, John Hawkes and Helen Hunt, re-enacting the true story of a disabled, virginal 38-year-old writer and his sexual surrogate infuse the movie, directed and written by Ben Lewin, with a piercing depth of humanity and no small amount of humor. (Holden)
'Seven Psychopaths' (R, 1:49) A sporadically funny, blood-splattered comedy from the playwright turned movie director Martin McDonagh about a Los Angeles screenwriter (Colin Farrell), his writer's block and his circle of dangerous acquaintances (Christopher Walken, Sam Rockwell, Woody Harrelson). (Dargis)
'Sinister'' (R, 1:50) Ethan Hawke tries to class up this movie, directed by Scott Derrickson, about a true-crime writer who moves his family into the house once occupied by the same slaughtered family he's writing about. Bad things happen. (Dargis)
'Sleepwalk With Me' (No rating, 1:30) The surreal dream sequences in this screen adaptation of Mike Birbiglia's 2008 one-man show -- about a commitment-phobic stand-up comedian with a sleep disorder -- help make this likable movie more than a glorified stand-up act. (Holden)
&#x2605; 'Smashed' (R, 1:20) The degree to which this story of alcoholism and recovery refuses to indulge a voyeuristic taste for the kind of sordid details exploited by reality television amounts to an unspoken declaration of principle. In lieu of self-pity, ''Smashed'' substitutes tough love. (Holden)
'Taken 2' (PG-13, 1:31) If your teenage daughter were abducted by sex traffickers during a European vacation, you might think twice about making another trip overseas, but not the former C.I.A. operator played by Liam Neeson in ''Taken 2.'' He takes the daughter and his ex-wife to Istanbul for some bonding, and kidnapping once again ensues. So do gunfire and bloodshed in this action-packed but uninvolving sequel to the 2009 hit ''Taken.'' (Genzlinger)
Film Series
'To Save and Project' (Friday through Thursday) The Museum of Modern Art's annual festival of newly preserved and restored films continues, as the animator Sally Cruikshank makes an appearance on Friday at 7:15 p.m. to introduce a selection of her delightful work, which puts a surreal spin on the already odd theatrical cartoons of the 1930s. Sunday is Presidents' Day, beginning with a 1 p.m. double bill of two early evocations of Lincoln: ''When Lincoln Paid,'' a 1913 three-reeler directed by and starring (as Lincoln) Francis Ford, John Ford's older brother and mentor, and ''Abraham Lincoln,'' a 1930 D. W. Griffith film, starring Walter Huston as Lincoln, that takes a far more nuanced view of slavery than Griffith's 1915 ''Birth of a Nation.'' Also on Sunday, at 3:45 p.m.: the British release version of Gregory La Cava's ''Gabriel Over the White House,'' a 1933 quasi-fascist fantasy in which a political hack (Huston, again) becomes a divinely inspired leader. At 6:30 p.m. a selection of the Super-8 home movies filmed by members of Richard M. Nixon's staff will be followed by a panel discussion led by the critic J. Hoberman and featuring one of the filmmakers, Dwight Chapin, and the documentarists Brian Frye and Penny Lane. On Monday, Saul Levine, the eminent experimental filmmaker, will be present for a screening of some of his highly volatile montage films, including the New York premiere of ''Light Licks: By the Waters of Babylon: This May Be the Last Time'' (2011), a study of the Charles River in Boston. Museum of Modern Art, Roy and Niuta Titus Theaters, (212) 708-9400, moma.org; $12. (Dave Kehr)
Edgar G. Ulmer (Wednesday and Thursday; through Nov. 6) A seven-film sampling from the work of this most profoundly noir of low-budget directors is being screened appropriately on Halloween with a double bill of ''Detour,'' Ulmer's grim 1945 evocation of roadside America (Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.) and ''The Black Cat'' (1934), his sole major studio production (at 9:15 p.m.), with Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi in an Expressionist-influenced tale of cruelty and revenge. On Thursday, at 7 p.m., one of the true rarities of the Ulmer canon, the 1946 melodrama ''Her Sister's Secret,'' shares the bill with a 35-millimeter print of his (relatively) lavish 1948 ''Ruthless,'' with Zachary Scott as a self-made millionaire who has let nothing stand in his way. Anthology Film Archives, 32-34 Second Avenue, at Second Street, East Village, (212) 505-5181, anthologyfilmarchives.org; $10. (Kehr)

HEADLINE: Iran Said to Nearly Finish Nuclear Enrichment Plant

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER and WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Intelligence officials from several countries say Iran in recent weeks has virtually completed an underground nuclear enrichment plant, racing ahead despite international pressure and heavy economic sanctions in what experts say may be an effort to give it leverage in any negotiations with the United States and its allies.
The installation of the last of nearly 3,000 centrifuges at a site called Fordo, deep under a mountain inside a military base near the holy city of Qum, puts Iran closer to being able to build a nuclear weapon, or come up to the edge, if its leaders ultimately decide to proceed. 
The United States, Israel and the United Nations have all vowed to prevent that from happening, imposing increasingly tough sanctions on the country and using cyberwarfare to slow its progress in obtaining a weapon. President Obama said last week that the time for a negotiated settlement was ''running out.''
Talks this year between Iran and the so-called P5-plus-1 -- the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council plus Germany -- have made little progress. The New York Times reported Sunday that the United States and Iran had reached an agreement in principle to hold direct talks after the American presidential election. Mr. Obama denied the report but said in Monday's debate with Mitt Romney that he was open to such talks.
Iran's progress at Fordo was disclosed by officials familiar with the findings of inspectors from the International Atomic Energy Agency who have been to the site recently as part of their regular visits. The officials included some from European governments who have opposed taking military action to slow the Iranian program, arguing that sanctions -- with a mix of covert action -- are far preferable.
The report comes at a moment when Iran has emerged as a point of contention in the foreign policy debates surrounding the approaching election. Mr. Romney has charged that the president has been ''weak'' on Iran, and said that Iran's production of nuclear material had expanded greatly during Mr. Obama's tenure. But he also embraced diplomacy in the debate on Monday.
Asked about the intelligence reports, Tommy Vietor, the spokesman for the National Security Council, said, ''While we can't comment on a report that has yet to be released, we remain concerned about Iran's defiance of its international obligations.'' He noted that ''the president is determined to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon and continues to believe there is time and space for diplomacy.''
Until just two months ago, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel suggested he would not allow the Fordo plant to go into operation, warning that once it did Iran would have begun to enter a ''zone of immunity'' where it could produce nuclear fuel without fear of an Israeli strike. Israel does not possess the bunker-busting bombs that would be needed to destroy the facility, though the United States does have one weapon that can do the job: the ''massive ordnance penetrator'' that just entered the American arsenal.
In September, however, Israeli officials suddenly stopped using the ''zone of immunity'' phrase, and Mr. Netanyanu told the United Nations that he could wait until late spring before any taking military action, saying that was when Iran would be on the cusp of the ability to produce a bomb. European and American officials interpreted that announcement as evidence that Mr. Netanyahu concluded that Israel could not get through the more than 200 feet of rock over the Fordo plant without American help.
The prospect of a renewed round of diplomacy may explain the pace of activity at the underground site. The fact that the Fordo plant is approaching full operation, shortening the amount of time it would need to build a weapon, gives Iran added ability to exert pressure on the United States and its allies. ''When slapped with new sanctions,'' said Mark Fitzpatrick, a former State Department official who now studies the Iranian program at the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, ''Iran typically likes to pick up the pace of its enrichment work to try to show that it can't be pressured into submission.''
The installation of the last centrifuges at Fordo represents a milestone for the Iranians that the Obama administration hoped to avoid. In September 2009, Mr. Obama, along with the leaders of Britain and France, revealed the existence of the site, in an effort to galvanize international efforts to stop Iran's program. His top national security aides predicted that the public exposure would force Iran to abandon the plant.
While that did not happen, a senior administration official said Thursday that the exposure of the plant's existence three years ago ''eliminated its use as a 'sneak out' venue,'' because it forced Iran to allow inspectors inside the facility. ''Sneak out'' is a phrase that connotes covert production of bomb fuel, while ''break out'' is used to describe a race for a bomb. Mr. Obama, in the Monday debate, insisted that ''we have a sense of when they would get breakout capacity,'' a phrase that left many thinking that was the line he would not let Iran cross.
While the plant is not yet fully running -- fewer than half of all its centrifuges are spinning out enriched uranium -- Iran could have it doing so within months, officials say. Fordo is designed to make ''medium enriched'' fuel that is relatively close to bomb grade, and American officials worry that, in a relatively short amount of time, that fuel could be converted to a type suitable for weapons. But as Mr. Vietor noted, with inspectors visiting, ''We are in a position to closely observe Iran's program and detect any effort by Iran to begin production of weapons-grade uranium.''
In August, the International Atomic Energy Agency said Fordo was roughly three-quarters complete, and that Iran had installed 2,140 centrifuges there, a doubling since a previous report three months before.

HEADLINE: D.J. Spins Museum's Attitude

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
SOON after the Metropolitan Museum of Art hired Limor Tomer last year to oversee its concerts and lectures department, she invited her old friend Paul D. Miller, the hip-hop turntablist, composer and author, on a private tour of the galleries.
The two had known each other since the 1990s, when Ms. Tomer was overseeing the programming at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's BAMcafé, and Mr. Miller was starting his career as ''D J Spooky, That Subliminal Kid.'' By the end of their walkabout, which hadn't begun with an agenda, Ms. Tomer and Mr. Miller were sketching out ideas that he will explore in a yearlong artist residency at the Met that begins Friday with a screening of the 1956 South Korean film ''Madame Freedom.'' Mr. Miller has composed a new soundtrack score for the film that he and a string quartet will perform live. 
''What I tend to do,'' Ms. Tomer said, ''is walk around the museum with artists and try to see the galleries from their perspective -- to see what they see and to understand what speaks to them and how they would animate these spaces. With Paul every gallery we visited he'd say, 'Oh, yeah, I have this project.' In the Asian gallery he was talking about early Korean film and postwar Korean theater, art and culture. When we went to the Oceanic gallery it turned out he's building an artist retreat on a small Pacific island and has been studying the musical instruments there.'' The tour led Ms. Tomer to reconsider what residencies at the Met -- previously long-term affairs -- should be and to see Mr. Miller as exactly the game changer she was looking for.
''To me the Met is like a huge record collection,'' Mr. Miller said. ''You have everything from Napoleon's sword to Thomas Edison's first cylinder recordings. They have an incredible archive -- not just the paintings and sculptures, but technological artifacts, armor. And I thought that would be incredible to do a megamix, responding to the collection. So Limor and I began to talk about that, and I said: 'I don't want it to just be music. I want it to be conceptual. I want it to be a rigorous engagement with contemporary art.' ''
Mr. Miller, at 42, is a self-contained industry. He makes CDs -- the latest is ''The Secret Song'' (Thirsty Ear) -- in which he revels in the art of the remix, a magpielike approach to juxtaposing newly composed music with snippets of existing recordings that become a kind of running commentary, and he has been engaged to remix tracks for other artists, including Yoko Ono, Meredith Monk, Stewart Copeland and Steve Reich. He has ruminated on what he calls ''remix culture'' in a book, ''Rhythm Science,'' and compiled ''Sound Unbound,'' a collection of essays on the subject by musicians, novelists, lawyers and filmmakers. (Both are published by MIT Press and come with CDs.)
Then there's his D J Spooky iPhone and iPad app (an Android version is in the works), which lets users do D.J. moves -- mixing, scratching, beat-matching and adding electronic effects -- on tracks from their iTunes libraries using a twin-turntable interface. And he edits a magazine, Origin, which describes its mission as reporting on ''yoga, art, music, conscious lifestyle, humanitarianism and sustainability.''
Mr. Miller allowed that he does not do yoga -- his preferred form of exercise is jogging -- but calls himself ''kind of a workaholic.''
Echoes of most of these projects will find their way into Mr. Miller's Met residency, which will include not only concerts and talks but also a gallery tour and the publication of three books based on his planned multimedia performances.
Mr. Miller seems perpetually onstage, but comfortably so. Raised in Washington and now based in New York, he is the son of two academics. His father, Paul E. Miller, was the dean of Howard University Law School; his mother, Rosemary Eloise Reed Miller, is a historian of design. The younger Mr. Miller attended Bowdoin College in Maine, and though he studied composition with Elliott Schwartz, he expected to pursue a career in diplomacy.
''I wasn't planning to do music,'' he said. ''It still blows my mind that I'm 42 and being called D J Spooky.''
Speaking about his projects on a rainy morning recently he settled into a plush chair backstage at the Met's Grace Rainey Rogers auditorium and set out a handful of gadgets, including an iPad and a Samsung tablet -- he believes in giving the recent litigants equal time -- on a coffee table.
The devices were in constant use as he spoke. Discussing ''Madame Freedom,'' for example, he pulled up the film's original Korean poster on his iPad. A passing mention of the Renaissance mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler was followed quickly by a portrait, which he displayed on the Samsung. Visual and musical examples, as well as film clips, punctuated the discussion of his Met projects.
In ''Madame Freedom,'' a morality tale about the collision of Korean and Western culture, Mr. Miller's 2011 score replaces the original jazz-tinged soundtrack music by Kim Yong-hwan. Mr. Miller's contribution will be performed live by the Korean Film Ensemble, a string group, with Mr. Miller adding electronic sound and using his iPad app to manipulate the ensemble's performance electronically.
''The reason I'm interested in this film,'' Mr. Miller said, pulling up a copy of his carefully notated score on his iPad, ''is that after the Korean War we saw the rise of Korean cinema, which is now really dominant in Asia. And at the time of 'Madame Freedom,' jazz, rock and a lot of the Korean musical scene was what was coming out of American soldiers' radios.
''What's happening, at the time, is that the social process of hanging out, in Korea, is being updated, with jazz as a kind of cafe culture. And this film became an emblem of a generation. It wasn't just a film. The story had been serialized in the newspaper, and everyone knew it. And it shows people moving slowly into a Western consumer lifestyle.
''But a lot of the conflict at the core of the film is based on a family's relationship with its neighbors, and one of the neighbors is a D.J., or at least someone who's always playing records. I found it really charming to think about the impact of jazz and the African-American vernacular on Asia. I'm interested in seeing how global hybrid cultures work.''
The second and third installments of Mr. Miller's series -- ''The Nauru Elegies'' (Jan. 18, with a related tour of the museum's Oceanic galleries on Jan. 19 and a panel discussion on Jan. 23) and ''Of Water and Ice'' (March 23, with a discussion on March 24) -- grew out of trips he made to the South Pacific and Antarctica.
During his Pacific trip Mr. Miller studied the native percussion instruments and rhythmic traditions -- which he typically describes, D.J.-style, as ''beats'' -- of several tribes in the archipelago nation of Vanuatu. He had some of the instruments reproduced by craftsmen in Brooklyn. He was made an honorary member of one of the tribes; on the iPad a photo shows Mr. Miller in tribal garb and makeup.
The piece he will perform sounds mysterious, even a bit arcane. Like ''Madame Freedom'' it will involve video and music for live strings and electronics. But the electronic component will be based on a combination of geographical information (expressed as GPS coordinates) and economic information.
''It's a competition based on economic theories,'' Mr. Miller said. ''We'll be taking economic data and turning it into sound.''
''Of Water and Ice'' is similarly technical. Mr. Miller pulls up a chart on his Samsung tablet and explains: ''Those are weather and temperature patterns, and I'm using the data to generate the composition. If there's one consistent theme here, it's that information is my palette. And the research I do on any project -- it's reasonably technical but pretty easy to digest.''
''I mean look,'' he said, tapping an icon and raising a picture of Kepler, ''some of this is based on Johannes Kepler's essay 'The Six-Cornered Snowflake.' He was the first mathematician to look at the complexity of nature in a fundamental way. He used math to analyze how ice forms, and the equations he wrote -- I took those and made them into music as well.''
What Mr. Miller is most looking forward to is bringing beat-heavy hip-hop into the museum by way of his works -- to be, as he put it, ''D.J. in residence.''
''I think a lot of time the art world will let in hybrid experimental composers like Christian Marclayor John Zorn,'' he said. ''But they won't let beats in. It's as if you can't have beats in an art context. I don't know why. Fear of rhythm.
''So I represent a kind of insurgency, and proudly so.''

HEADLINE: A Little Bit Extra For Lawmakers And Lobbyists

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a column for The Tribune.
Membership really does have its privileges. When Lt. Gov. David Dewhurst sped up the legislative schedule -- naming Senate committee chairmen now instead of waiting until after the session starts in January -- he gave the new leaders a little something extra.
Mr. Dewhurst did the same for people with business before the Legislature. Those two camps can get a head start on building their relationships. 
In three months, you might even be able to put a number on it.
In the normal order of things, Texas voters elect their legislators in November during even-numbered years, then those legislators convene in January of every odd-numbered year following the elections for a 20-week regular session.
Several weeks into those sessions -- often, in February -- the leaders of the two legislative bodies -- the House speaker and the lieutenant governor -- organize members into the committees that will handle various subjects, like budgets, public schools, prisons and economic development.
Mr. Dewhurst, fresh off a stinging and personally expensive loss in the race for the Republican nomination for United States Senate, is getting his political résumé back together -- mainly by putting his nose to the grindstone and returning to State Senate business.
He will be working in front of a different Senate this time, one with at least six new members, a number of whom are more conservative than the people they are replacing. Among his moves, he put Dan Patrick, Republican of Houston -- an advocate of taxpayer-backed vouchers for private schools -- in charge of the Public Education Committee. He named Tommy Williams, Republican of The Woodlands, to fill the empty chairmanship of the budget-writing Finance Committee. He removed Judith Zaffirini, Democrat of Laredo, from her post as chairwoman of the Higher Education Committee, installing her on the less prestigious Government Organization Committee.
The thing to note here is the timing.
To keep up appearances and to avoid the impression of any direct pay-for-play governing, lawmakers aren't allowed to raise money while they're in regular session, and for the 30 days leading up to a legislative session or during the 20 days that follow one.
As a practical matter, that means lawmakers, donors, lobbyists and their various ilk don't exactly know before the contribution blackout who will be doing what. They often have a fair idea, but without certainty. If, say, somebody has been the head of the Senate State Affairs Committee for a while, like Robert Duncan, Republican of Lubbock, has, there is a good chance he will be in that spot or in an even better one in the future. (In fact, that happened: he will remain in that post.) Experts and reliable allies tend to stay in place.
But this is a year of heavy legislative turnover. At least half a dozen senators aren't coming back, leaving some big positions open. Mr. Dewhurst's shuffle put almost a dozen senators in chairmanships they did not hold before. He can always fiddle with it later, and he hasn't announced which senators will populate those committees, but the leadership appears to be set.
That blackout on campaign contributions doesn't happen until December. And only one Senate seat is truly in play in the November elections. Even if they wait until after the elections, the lobby, the interests, the fund-raising and campaign consultants, and the candidates all have time to get together, to build their relationships, to talk about the issues. And to raise money.
Not to pick on Ms. Zaffirini, but she provides an easy example of what to expect. Her new committee will oversee ''sunset bills'' that have to pass for various agencies to stay in business. The policy idea is that those agencies won't survive without continued legislative approval, which is given in 12-year doses. One of the agencies on this year's list is the Texas Railroad Commission which, in spite of its name, regulates the oil and gas business. That industry is booming right now, with hydraulic fracturing hot spots like the one in the Eagle Ford Shale, a formation that significantly overlaps Ms. Zaffirini's Senate district.
More important, it overlaps the business of the committee she has just been named to lead. What appeared to be a slight from the lieutenant governor could be a boon instead. She's got a bunch of new friends, and time to build relationships and raise money.

HEADLINE: Venice Biennale Expects New National Pavilions

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
The Venice Biennale tries to chronicle the development of contemporary art around the world, partly by the way its national pavilions divide and showcase the work. Next summer the Biennale plans to add pavilions of countries that have never participated before.
Paolo Baratta, president of the Biennale, and Massimiliano Gioni, director of the 2013 exhibition, said at a news conference on Thursday at the Biennale's headquarters, a 15th-century Gothic palazzo overlooking the Grand Canal in Venice, that at least eight additional countries will be represented beyond the 89 that participated in 2011. The newcomers will include the Bahamas, Bahrain, Ivory Coast, Kosovo, Kuwait, the Maldives, Nigeria and Paraguay. ''It's too early to say exactly how many countries in all will be participating,'' Mr. Gioni said in a telephone interview. 
The theme of the 2013 Biennale, from June 1 to Nov. 24, will be ''The Encyclopedic Palace,'' a phrase drawn from the title of a symbol of 1950s-era Futurism, an 11-foot-tall architectural model of a 136-story cylindrical skyscraper intended by its creator for the National Mall in Washington. The model, by the self-taught Italian-American artist Marino Auriti, now belongs to the American Folk Art Museum in New York. ''It's the crazy dream, bordering between knowledge and madness, image and imagination,'' Mr. Gioni said, and appropriate for the Biennale because it reflects the grand ambition of this international exhibition. Mr. Gioni added that he hoped the spirit of Auriti's work would encourage contemporary self-taught artists to join the international mix at the Biennale.
A KLINE WORK IS FOR SALE
A year ago collectors jumped when four paintings by Clyfford Still went to auction at Sotheby's on behalf of the City of Denver to raise money for an endowment at the new Clyfford Still Museum, which was poised to open there. Still's work has not been an auction house staple, and his work tends to sell for far less than paintings by better known Abstract Expressionists like Jackson Pollock or Mark Rothko. So it was a surprise to even the experts when ''1949-A-No. 1,'' a canvas of thick, jagged brush strokes in deep reds and black, sold for $61.7 million, a record for a Still sold at auction.
Next month a painting by another less popular Abstract Expressionist is expected to fetch a record price at auction. On Nov. 14 an untitled painting by Franz Kline from 1957 will go on the block at Christie's and is expected to bring $20 million to $30 million. That estimate is more than three times the current record auction price for a Kline, set in 2005 when Christie's sold ''Crow Dancer,'' a 1958 painting, for $6.4 million. But recently, experts say, four Klines have sold privately for over $20 million apiece.
The canvas at Christie's is from Kline's series of signature black-and-white abstractions composed of colliding brush strokes sweeping across the canvas. While Christie's will not say who is selling the painting -- the catalog designation reads ''Property From a Notable Private Collection'' -- contemporary art dealers believe it is being consigned by George Roberts, the San Francisco financier, who has owned the painting for nearly a decade.
Its provenance is noteworthy: it belonged to Robert Mnuchin, of L&M Arts, the New York gallery, who bought it for his private collection when he was a partner at Goldman Sachs. The painting was also owned by David Geffen, the entertainment mogul with a world-class art collection.
A tiny circle next to the lot number in the catalog is Christie's symbol that the painting has been guaranteed, meaning that the seller has been promised an undisclosed sum regardless of the outcome of the sale.
That Christie's is putting the company's money behind the painting is a vote of confidence in an uncertain economy. ''Kline is an artist's artist,'' Brett Gorvy, chairman of Christie's postwar and contemporary art department, said. ''His work has been undervalued for years, and this painting is one of only a handful of paintings of this caliber by Kline still left in private hands.''
NEW SCHOOL'S NEW NEON
The New School has commissioned its first site-specific artwork for its new University Center building, designed by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill, on the corner of 14th Street and Fifth Avenue in Greenwich Village. The work, scheduled to be on view in 2014, will feature text from Walt Whitman's ''Leaves of Grass'' rendered in neon lights. It is the creation of Glenn Ligon, an artist known for work that uses phrases written or uttered by personalities or writers he admires, including Mary Shelley, James Baldwin and Malcolm X.
When Mr. Ligon, who is African-American, had a midcareer retrospective at the Whitney Museum of American Art last year, the words ''negro sunshine'' appeared on the Whitney's facade. The phrase, taken from ''Melanctha,'' a 1909 novella by Gertrude Stein, seemed startling when viewed out of context. A solo show of his neon sculptures opens on Friday at the Luhring Augustine Gallery in Chelsea.
Tim Marshall, the New School's provost, said Mr. Ligon's work was chosen from proposals solicited from artists selected by the faculty.
Mr. Ligon's piece will be pink neon running around the top of a wall in the center's first-floor cafe. ''It's two rows of quotes, or about 400 feet of text,'' Mr. Ligon said in an e-mail message. When he decided on that text, he said, he was mostly thinking about ''encountering strangers, the life of the street, desiring bodies -- something for students to think about when they are tired of thinking of their G.P.A. or tuition.''

HEADLINE: A Spotlight on Student Aid and College Tuition

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''Rising College Costs Pose Test for Obama on Education Policies'' (news article, Oct. 18): 
The myth that federal student aid drives up college tuition has been refuted by empirical evidence and by the real-world actions of colleges and universities. Studies conducted under the Clinton, Bush and Obama presidencies, as well as leading higher education economists, have found no causal relationship between increases in federal student aid and tuition.
Furthermore, over the past four years, while Pell Grant appropriations have grown substantially, private, nonprofit colleges have slowed annual tuition increases to the lowest rates seen in at least four decades, while continuing to increase their own student aid budgets.
This year, according to our annual survey, published tuition and fees at independent institutions grew 3.9 percent -- the first time on record the rate has been below 4 percent -- while institutional student aid increased 6.2 percent.
A growing number of private colleges are actually cutting or freezing tuition, guaranteeing that tuition won't increase while a student is enrolled, offering three-year bachelor's degrees or introducing other innovative affordability measures.
The number of college students who come from low- and middle-income families is growing, state higher education funding is being squeezed and college budgets are increasingly strained. Without the federal investment in student aid, the dream of a college degree would end for millions of hard-working Americans.

HEADLINE: New Leaders Of Military In China Announced

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ; Bree Feng contributed research.

 BODY:
BEIJING -- China announced the promotions of five generals this week, shaping the top leadership of the rapidly modernizing military as it becomes a more dominant player in Asia and challenges American dominance in the region.
And on Friday, China's state news agency, Xinhua, announced that Parliament had expelled the disgraced former politician Bo Xilai. The expulsion of Mr. Bo, who has been accused by the government of corruption and failure to disclose the murder by his wife of a British business executive, removes his immunity from prosecution.
China's military is likely to remain well financed, even as the Chinese economy slows, analysts say. The new leaders are expected to push ahead with developing naval and air power that can rival the United States and with cyberwarfare capabilities, which the Chinese see as a new and effective way to project power. 
The new appointees will almost certainly become members of the Central Military Commission, a 12-member body that oversees the Chinese military and that is undergoing major changes as members reach mandatory retirement age.
The jockeying for vacant positions has by all accounts been fierce, with much of it riding on personal allegiances to President Hu Jintao or Vice President Xi Jinping. Mr. Xi is expected to succeed Mr. Hu as Communist Party leader at the 18th Party Congress, scheduled to open on Nov. 8, and as president next year. The full slate of commission members will be unveiled at the Party Congress.
Mr. Hu is chairman of the commission, and one of the big questions hovering over the Party Congress is whether he will yield this post to Mr. Xi, or hold onto it for two more years.
Based on family connections and his own professional experience, Mr. Xi has stronger ties to the military than Mr. Hu, and analysts say that in many respects the military considers him one of their own. Whether that means Mr. Xi will rein in the military or give it greater scope as China asserts what it calls its territorial rights in the South China Sea and East China Sea over the next decade will be one of the most important strategic questions facing the country as it enters its new leadership phase, they say.
Among those promoted was Gen. Ma Xiaotian, a former fighter pilot who will become head of the air force, a service that is now coming to the fore after long being relegated to a back seat.
''General Ma is unusually outspoken,'' said Chas W. Freeman Jr., former assistant secretary of defense, who has met with Chinese military figures. ''He does not yield easily to those with whom he disagrees, though he is willing to do so if an argument of sufficient logical force is presented. He is self-confident enough to really enjoy the rough-and-tumble of policy argument.''
In May, General Ma told a TV station based in Hong Kong that the South China Sea, where China is making increasing territorial claims, was ''none of the United States' business.'' The Chinese Air Force is now ''seeking to create the kind of air power that can rival the U.S., and to create similar stealth, precision strike and long-range strike capabilities,'' said Anthony H. Cordesman, the senior military analyst at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. ''It is developing similar enablers in terms of refueling, electronic warfare systems, airborne command and control, and satellites.'' Earlier this year, General Ma accompanied China's defense minister, Liang Guanglie, on a visit to Washington.
Gen. Zhang Youxia, who has publicly criticized the military for its lack of combat experience, was promoted to be director of the General Armament Department, which oversees procurement and research.
General Zhang, one of the few senior commanders who does have battlefield experience, is said by Chinese military scholars to have been wounded during China's 1979 conflict with Vietnam. In 2009, he was quoted in People's Daily, the Communist Party mouthpiece, as saying: ''The fires of war are burning throughout the world. In this area, the gap between the Chinese military and foreign militaries is growing by the day. This is a real problem.'' Before his promotion, he was commander of the Shenyang Military Region.
The commander of the Beijing Military Region, Gen. Fang Fenghui, was promoted on Thursday to chief of the general staff, the Defense Ministry said. The former political commissar of the Guangzhou Military Region, Zhang Yang, was named director of the political department, and the former commander of the Nanjing Military Region, Gen. Zhao Keshi, was promoted to lead the logistics department.
The new commission will almost certainly be overseeing China's development of cyberwarfare, an area that China views as particularly advantageous, and relatively inexpensive, said Kevin Pollpeter, China Project Manager for Defense Group Inc., a firm based in Washington that specializes in China's national security issues. ''Cyber allows China projection ability it can't get with other weapons,'' Mr. Pollpeter said at a recent conference in Washington on China's military.
So far, the Defense Ministry has not announced who will command the all-important Second Artillery Corps, home to the land-based ballistic and cruise missile units opposite Taiwan. Also yet to be announced is the new commander of the navy, another rapidly expanding branch of the military. The commanders of the Second Artillery Corps and the navy sit on the Central Military Commission.
Two other posts -- the commission's vice chairmen -- also remain to be announced. These positions are filled by senior generals who run the day-to-day operations of the military under the civilian party leadership.

HEADLINE: Business Leaders, Open to Tax Increase, Push for a Deficit Deal

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
The partisan rift over taxes has blocked a deficit reduction deal for two years and has spilled into the 2012 campaigns. Yet as Republicans and Democrats continue to brawl, business leaders are increasing pressure on Washington to reach a deal on taxes and spending, even if it raises their own tax bills.
On Thursday morning, more than 80 executives of leading American corporations signed a statement calling for a deficit reduction compromise that would ''include comprehensive and pro-growth tax reform, which broadens the base, lowers rates, raises revenues and reduces the deficit.''
Several members of the group, which includes highly paid chief executives of financial and industrial corporations who will stand to pay more if President Obama succeeds in his effort to raise taxes on the wealthy, then helped ring the opening bell at the New York Stock Exchange to draw attention to their coalition, Fix the Debt. The group has raised $37 million for a nationwide education and lobbying effort. 
Alarmed last year by Washington's brinkmanship over raising the nation's debt ceiling, these executives are now mobilizing to avert another such crisis at the turn of the year. After the November elections, they plan to press the two parties to compromise on a long-term substitute for the ''fiscal cliff'' -- the immediate across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases that would affect nearly all Americans on Jan. 1, potentially sending the economy back into recession.
The business leaders' goal contrasts with the campaign messages of both parties. While the executives seem to answer Mr. Obama's call for ''economic patriotism'' by their tentative embrace of higher personal taxes, in interviews many of them have rejected his ''pay your fair share'' talk as class warfare, and a good number oppose his re-election.
But the business leaders' position also contradicts the stand of Mitt Romney and other Republicans, who say that all tax increases are ''job killers,'' that the federal budget can be balanced with spending cuts alone and that any overhaul of the tax code should be ''revenue neutral,'' neither raising nor lowering the government's total tax collection.
''To say that you can solve this without increases in taxes is ludicrous,'' said David M. Cote, the chief executive of Honeywell, a Republican and a member of Mr. Obama's Bowles-Simpson fiscal commission in 2010. ''Most wealthy people get it. They just don't want to be put in the position, though, where you pay more in the taxes and the profligate spending continues.''
The Wall Street event on Thursday was just the latest, if the highest profile, of near daily developments in recent weeks in which prominent figures have stepped out of corporate suites to back a deal that would generate more revenue and, by implication, raise taxes on themselves. They support those moves if they are part of a bipartisan compromise that also reduces the long-term costs of entitlement programs, chiefly Medicare and Medicaid, that are the biggest factors driving projections of unsustainable federal debt.
Lloyd C. Blankfein, the chief executive of Goldman Sachs, who is a Democrat, said, ''The people, including myself, who are willing to give more revenue don't want to take on the moral hazard'' of sending more money to Washington unless the White House and Congress ''deal with the pressing need to cut the budget.''
On Monday, Jamie Dimon of JPMorgan Chase hosted a Wall Street lunch for about 75 other chief executives to hear from budget experts, including Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, a Democrat, and Senator Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, a Republican, about what the business leaders could do to promote a bipartisan deal. How, for example, could they persuade Republicans to drop their antitax position?
Business leaders ''think it's just really important that we fix this,'' said Mr. Dimon, an early backer of Mr. Obama whose relationship with him later frayed. ''They're not into whether the tax rate for higher-paid individuals is 35 percent or 39.6 percent.'' He was referring first to the top Bush-era tax rate, which high-income taxpayers now pay, and then to the Clinton-era rate, which they face after Dec. 31 if the Bush tax cuts expire as scheduled. Mr. Obama supports ending the cuts for high incomes, and Republicans oppose it.
On Tuesday, attendees at the national conference of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association met in New York with Mr. Warner and Senator Saxby Chambliss, Republican of Georgia. The two belong to the Senate's bipartisan ''Gang of Eight,'' which has struggled for nearly two years to draft a spending and taxes deal.
''I'm talking to everybody in this room,'' Mr. Chambliss told his audience. ''If you like the package that we ultimately come up with, then we haven't done our job -- because everybody is going to have to ultimately pay a price in this.''
Like others who have privately lobbied lawmakers, Mr. Blankfein and Mr. Cote reject suggestions that the philosophical chasm between the parties is unbridgeable.
''There are very conservative Republicans in the House who sit there and say, 'I would agree to a revenue increase if there was significant entitlement reform,' '' Mr. Cote said. ''And then you'll run into Democrats who say there won't be any entitlement reform unless there's revenue increases. For most of us in the business community, we say: 'It sounds to us like you've got a deal. You just need to sit down and flesh out the details.' ''
That, as members of the Simpson-Bowles commission can attest, is easier said than done.
The panel's dissenters, who opposed the majority's recommendations of a $4 trillion, 10-year package to reduce annual deficits with a combination of spending cuts and new revenue, included all three House Republicans. Among them was Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman, who is now Mr. Romney's vice-presidential running mate.
The Fix the Debt campaign's inspiration is the dormant Simpson-Bowles framework, and the group's formation is due in large measure to nonstop proselytizing of business leaders by the commission's chairmen, Erskine B. Bowles, a businessman who was a White House chief of staff to President Bill Clinton, and Alan K. Simpson, a former Senate Republican leader from Wyoming.
According to the group's president, Maya MacGuineas, the money raised is financing a growing staff of about 35 at a Washington ''war room,'' chapters in up to 35 states and ultimately, perhaps, television ads and other help for politicians -- members of Congress or even the president -- who would need support in taking unpopular positions on tax increases or spending cuts.
Mr. Dimon, speaking for JPMorgan Chase, said: ''You know, we're in 1,900 hamlets in America. I'd -- we'd -- be calling them all up, literally we'd start flying people in. It would be a whole different ballgame, I think, if we had something to support, and with the president supporting it.''

HEADLINE: Campaigns Find That for Many Latinas, Issues Are Personal, and Financial

BYLINE: By FERNANDA SANTOS

 BODY:
DENVER -- Fixing the economy ought to be a priority for the nation's next president: Alejandro Gonzalez and Cynthia Gallegos agree on that much. Yet they speak about the issue in very different ways. He is pragmatic, she is more emotional and personal.
And that, experts say, is the challenge campaigns face in appealing to Latinos, whose votes are crucial to President Obama and Mitt Romney. In dozens of interviews -- here and in several suburbs, where the Hispanic population logged some of the steepest increases in the country over the past decade -- Latino men and women spoke of the nuances behind their votes, which could be decisive for the election in Colorado and other swing states. 
The pocketbook may be driving many decisions this election, but the different ways men and women talk about the issues is forcing campaigns to tailor their messages.
Compared with other voters, Latinos tend to live in more traditional family settings, experts say, harking back to eras of the male breadwinner and the female homemaker. Robert R. Preuhs, a political science professor at Metropolitan State University of Denver, called it the ''economy-versus-family divide.''
''Men are expected to be providers from a financial standpoint, while women have a much broader set of responsibilities at home,'' he said. ''To them, discussions about health care or education are taken very personally. They're very much about, how does it affect my children or my elderly parents?''
What this has meant for the campaigns is that quite often, conversations with Hispanic women about the candidates' positions on social issues are held in volunteers' homes, around a dinner table or at a kitchen counter as a meal cooks on the stove. If the topic veers toward the economy, campaign officials say, the focus is always on the potential impact on the family's interests, like education or immigration.
In appeals to Hispanic men, economic discussions tend to be held in more formal, businesslike settings and generally are focused on the family's finances.
A poll by the Pew Research Center conducted Sept. 7 to Oct. 4 found that most Latino men and women are not so far apart on the issues: They give nearly equal importance to health care, jobs and education, and nearly half say the country is headed in the right direction. Both sexes tend to vote Democratic.
Mr. Gonzalez, 79, hewed to that pragmatic view. An Obama volunteer in Aurora, a Denver suburb, he said government must offer the same types of benefits that were available to him -- a Korean War veteran, he became a court reporter and went to law school on the G.I. Bill of Rights -- to foster economic stability.
''Nobody can do it by themselves,'' Mr. Gonzalez said.
To Latinas, though, who are likely to have more caregiving responsibilities and less income than most other female voters, policy discussions are played closer to the heart.
''I am who I am because a public school teacher helped me along the way, because I got grants to go to college,'' said Ms. Gallegos, 41, the executive director of Focus Points Family Resource Center, a Latino outreach organization in Denver.
A meet-and-greet on a recent Saturday in Ridgway, a rural outpost in southwestern Colorado where 5 percent of the population is Latino, attracted mostly women, many of whom carried their children. Rick Palacio, the chairman of the Colorado Democratic Party, which organized the event, said they were not there ''to hear our positions on quote-unquote women's issues.''
They were there, instead, ''to hear about stuff that affected the long-term growth and success of their families, whether that be college affordability or the sustainability of Social Security or the survival of health care,'' he said. ''That's what's driving their interest in this election.''
Sylvia Manzano, a senior analyst at Latino Decisions, which studies Latino voting trends, said the ''personal element'' gave immigration, particularly efforts to give immigrants smuggled across the border as children a path to legalization, a prominent role in their political discussions, even if it was not their top priority for the next president.
''To them, immigration, health care, jobs, education, they're all part of the same nexus of ideas that defines the economic viability of their families, or of the people close to them,'' Ms. Manzano said.
''Hispanics know that we're not the only community of illegal immigrants,'' said Pauline Olvera, 46, a member of a grass-roots group called Colorado Hispanic Republicans, a Romney volunteer and a self-described ''third-generation American.''
For Maria S. Young, who is from Mexico, it is the tough-on-illegal-immigrants laws of recent years -- in places like Arizona, where 30 percent of residents are Latino, and Alabama, which had the second-highest Latino growth rate in the nation between 2000 and 2010 -- that have driven the partisan wedge.
''It has forced immigrants to pick a side, and it has made it a much easier decision,'' said Ms. Young, an Obama supporter who is the president of a company that helps high-skilled immigrants get professional accreditation in the United States.
Polly Baca, the first Hispanic woman elected to Colorado's State Senate, has organized a group called Catholic Women for Obama to drive religious Latinas to base their vote on what she described as the church's social-justice teachings -- ''Compassion,'' Ms. Baca said, ''for the poor, for immigrants.''
At the same time, the treasurer of the state's Republican Committee, Christine C. Mastin, whose mother is from Chile, said priests in some heavily Hispanic enclaves have been encouraging congregants to ''vote your values,'' which she celebrated as a veiled message against the mandate for employers to cover birth control under Mr. Obama's health care law.
Ms. Gallegos said she hoped this would be ''the last election where people are going to try to squeeze us into ideological boxes,'' adding, ''It does nothing to give us the type of civic education we need.''
She went on, ''It's about jobs, it's about schools, it's about the economy, yes, but in the end, it's about making life better for all people, including people like me.''

HEADLINE: Europe and the 'Asia Pivot'

BYLINE: By TOMAS VALASEK

 BODY:
Bratislava, Slovakia -- THE third U.S. presidential debate did not shed much more light on future relations with Europe than the first two. One popular misconception in parts of Europe is that President Obama's ''pivot'' to Asia is a temporary aberration: that it springs from the president's dislike for the freedom and democratization agenda, and his absence of European roots.
By extension, this theory holds that, as president, Mitt Romney would ''set things right'' by putting Europe back near the center of U.S. attention, halt the decline in U.S. troops on the Continent, renew a push to enlarge NATO eastward, and take keener interest in potential trouble emanating from Russia, the Balkans and North Africa. 
This is not to be: The change in America's priorities will last. Europe will sympathize with U.S. goals in Asia but it will have little to offer in assistance. NATO will either adjust to this new state of affairs or its credibility will shrink further.
Barack Obama has solid reasons to worry about Asia, and those reasons will not go away, even if he does. While Russia remains mercurial and a potential source of trouble, the rise of China presents a far more immediate prospect of conflict, one that would be no less destructive than any in Europe.
The reasonable policy, then, is for the United States to keep just enough troops in Europe to deter Russia from mischief while focusing its spare resources on Asia. A President Romney might have been kinder to Europe than Obama when announcing the policy change, but he would have pivoted all the same.
America's focus on Asia puts NATO in unchartered waters. For most of its existence, the allies had a reasonably clear agreement on who the enemy was and each country fielded enough troops to make itself useful if war came. NATO maintained this outward unity during the wars in Afghanistan and Libya, even though many allies sent only symbolic contributions, or none at all. This was partly because some countries were not convinced of the chosen strategy, and because many had little to contribute.
The U.S. pivot now further widens the gap between America's defense priorities and European capabilities: If war between China and Taiwan or Japan were to break out, the Europeans would make sympathetic noises but leave the United States to do the fighting. This is not for lack of courage, but mainly for lack of weapons -- the right kinds and the right quantities. Never before in NATO's history were America's allies of so little use for the kinds of scenarios that most occupy America's defense analysts.
What is NATO to do? One school of thought in Europe holds that an alliance with such widely different capabilities will not survive. The Europeans must therefore build forces to complement America's, which mostly means expanding their navies. Moreover, the argument goes, Asian security is in European interests, too -- so the allies should be ready to fight in the Pacific regardless of whether the Americans expect their help or not.
But this is pure fantasy: European forces were built for conflicts closer to home. They are wholly unprepared to play a meaningful role in the Pacific, and are not going to acquire the necessary skills and hardware anytime soon -- certainly not in the middle of the worst economic crisis in decades. The only two naval powers that come anywhere near being useful in Asia are France and Britain. And even France, in its present strategic review, is leaning toward keeping only a symbolic presence in the Pacific.
Rather than fake unity of mind and might -- and inevitably disappoint everyone in the event of war in Asia -- the allies should acknowledge their differences and build a new NATO strategy around them.
In Asia, Europe must demonstrate that it shares America's security concerns and will do what it reasonably can. This means assisting partners in the region in strengthening their militaries, supporting U.S. diplomatic efforts, and applying E.U. expertise, where applicable, toward building a regional security architecture that includes China. If those efforts fail, the Europeans will not endeavor to fight in Asia (which few informed American observers expect them to do anyway).
In return, the Europeans will take a greater responsibility for ''discretionary'' missions in and around Europe: those conducted in the name of human rights (such as the one in Libya), or to rebuild war-torn societies (such as those in the Balkans). An expanded European military role on the Continent would free the United States to shift more of its troops and money to the Pacific.
Preparation for wars of self-defense, such as a possible conflict with Russia, would remain a responsibility of all allies alike, including the United States. Without it, NATO's vow to defend its members is simply not credible.
This is the new bargain that the European allies should put to the U.S. president. Whether it be Barack Obama or Mitt Romney, the gaze of the U.S. military will remain on Asia. Europe may never become a real military actor in the region, but it can be useful to the United States in other ways. Given the right policies, NATO can remain strong even if America never thinks of itself as a European power again.
Tomas Valasek is president of the Central European Policy Institute.

HEADLINE: Spending On Medicaid Has Slowed, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By ABBY GOODNOUGH

 BODY:
The annual growth in spending on Medicaid slowed sharply last year as the economy began to improve, a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation found. Enrollment in the program grew only modestly as well, but that may change as millions of people are due to become eligible in 2014 under the new national health care law.
Medicaid provides health and long-term care coverage to more than 60 million poor people, at a combined cost to the states and federal government of more than $400 billion a year. During the recession, as Americans lost jobs and health insurance, enrollment in the program rose sharply, and states struggled under the weight of its costs. 
But in the fiscal year that ended for most states in June, total spending on Medicaid grew by only 2 percent -- much less than the nearly 10 percent increase in 2011 and one of the lowest rates on record. The slowdown is due not only to more measured enrollment growth -- 3.2 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in 2011 and 7.2 percent in 2010 -- but also to continued cost-cutting by states.
''Reining in costs remains the dominant theme,'' said Diane Rowland, executive vice president of the Kaiser Family Foundation, a nonpartisan group that conducts the survey annually with Health Management Associates, a research and consulting firm.
The most typical Medicaid spending cuts were to reimbursement rates for hospitals and doctors and to optional benefits, like dental, vision and drug coverage. Forty-five states cut or froze reimbursement rates last year, according to the report, while 18 scaled back benefits. Many also expanded the use of managed care for their Medicaid populations.
The national health care law has generally prohibited states from tightening eligibility for Medicaid before 2014, when the law envisions expanding the program to cover more low-income people.
So the slowing of enrollment is not because fewer people are qualifying, Ms. Rowland said, but because fewer ''are coming through the door.''
Last year was something of an aberration, because states stopped receiving extra federal Medicaid funds that had flowed for nearly three years as part of the federal stimulus act. Without the additional help, the state share of Medicaid spending rose by 27.5 percent last year, according to the survey.
That put additional pressure on states to limit costs and helps explain the modest increase in spending.
Medicaid has been the subject of heated national debate in recent months, both because the Supreme Court ruled in June that states could opt out of the expansion that is a cornerstone of the health care law and because President Obama and Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, have sharply different visions for the program's future.
Mr. Romney and Republicans in Congress want to repeal the health care law and replace the current Medicaid program with block grants, giving each state a fixed amount of federal money each year and more control over eligibility and benefits. (The federal government currently sets minimum requirements, like covering all children under the poverty level, and provides unlimited matching funds.)
Medicaid spending will grow modestly again this fiscal year, the survey found, with an average increase of 3.8 percent.
Enrollment will continue to increase, but by only 2.7 percent, an even slower rate than last year. More than one-third of states say they could see a Medicaid budget shortfall, but that is an improvement over last year, when more than half of states predicted a shortfall.
States will also step up attempts to better coordinate care for Medicaid enrollees, especially those with expensive chronic conditions. Thirty states started or expanded such programs last year, the survey found, and 45 are doing so this fiscal year.
Many such programs focus on ''dual eligibles'' -- nine million people who qualify for both Medicare and Medicaid, are especially complicated to treat and account for a disproportionate share of spending.
''Those changes are an investment up front and require a longer lead time in terms of seeing savings down the road,'' Ms. Rowland said.

HEADLINE: Euro Survives, But Future Is in Doubt

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
Remember the euro crisis?
Only a few months ago, it was front-page news. Would the euro collapse? Would most of southern Europe go broke, unable to borrow money at any reasonable rate? Would that bring on a new world recession?
But in this week's foreign policy debate between President Obama and Mitt Romney, the euro never came up. Europe was mentioned once, but the reference had nothing to do with economics. Mr. Romney did refer to Greece, but only to say we were in danger of going down the same path if we did not change our ways.
To a surprising extent, the perception seems to be that the European situation is under control. That is true if all you worry about is whether bondholders will get paid. It is false if you have a broader perspective.
The focus of the last couple of years on borrowing costs for peripheral members of the euro zone was, in retrospect, unfortunate. It was always clear that Europe, as a whole, had the ability to solve that issue if it wished to do so. The European Central Bank, like the United States Federal Reserve, has the ability to print money, and that is what it finally did. 
But the real issue was -- and remains -- whether the peripheral countries could turn into successful economies while staying in the euro zone. On that issue, progress is painfully slow.
''The actions of the E.C.B. and other policy makers in Europe have generally had the effect of filling large financial gaps in periphery bank and sovereign funding,'' wrote Bob Prince of Bridgewater Associates this week, ''but have done relatively little to resolve competitive imbalances among these economies.''
Banks are hesitant to lend. On Thursday, the European Central Bank report on loan activity in September showed a record 1.4 percent year-over-year decline in loans outstanding to private sector companies and individuals in the euro zone. ''These numbers are rather consistent with the bleak picture painted by business surveys, showing an ongoing contraction of activity,'' wrote François Cabau and Phillippe Gudin of Barclays Capital in a note to clients.
If peripheral countries simply had fixed exchange rates, rather than a common currency, they could and almost certainly would have devalued their currencies long before now. That is the normal prescription for countries in financial distress. Couple it with austerity and revivals can be surprisingly rapid, as exports surge and imports plunge.
As it is, the process is sure to be long and painful, but not certain to succeed.
As Europe stumbles and slows, there has been a temptation in the United States to turn our attention elsewhere, to Asia for economic reasons and to the Mideast for political ones. Mr. Romney has tried to add South America to that mix. But neither the Romney nor Obama campaign has wanted to talk much about Europe, a fact that has been noted with a little alarm in Europe.
Richard Lambert, the chancellor of Britain's Warwick University -- and a former editor of The Financial Times as well as a former central banker -- was in New York this week trying to convince Americans that they should care, and predicting that the euro will survive.
''The European Union has the capacity to get its affairs into order, if it has the political determination to do so,'' he said in a speech at New York University. ''This is a crisis about economic imbalances within the euro zone, more than it is about fault lines with the rest of the world.''
That is a point worth remembering. The euro zone as a whole is running smaller budget and current account deficits than is the United States. If it were one country, there might be articles about depressed regions, but not talk of collapse.
But it is not one country. It is taking halting steps in that direction, with a move to unified bank supervision, but political union is not going to happen; Angela Merkel's name is never going to be on a ballot outside of Germany. Nor is there going to be easy labor mobility around Europe, even though that is supposedly guaranteed now. Cultural and language differences assure that.
Within the United States, there have long been depressed areas -- sometimes changing, as when Texas went from boom to bust when oil prices collapsed in the early 1980s -- and transfer of payments from one region to another. Europe does not have automatic transfer payments, but its various central bank programs, as well as the bailouts, amount to transfer payments from the rich countries to the poor ones.
It was not easy getting the Germans to agree to those programs, and ambiguity remains regarding future transfers as a way of persuading depressed countries to stick to the austerity programs Europe demands. It was critically important that Ms. Merkel, Germany's chancellor, was willing to approve the newest European Central Bank program despite the objections of Germany's own central bank, the Bundesbank.
Ireland is often painted as the periphery's success story, and in some ways it has been. Unit labor costs are down, and the country seems to be better able to compete in world markets. It did so with deflation, by slashing wages in the private and public sector, reducing unemployment benefits and raising the retirement age. Its exports are rising and -- unusual for the periphery -- its imports are also going up.
Those sacrifices amounted to a very large price to pay for the sin of having a housing bubble that devastated the country's banks, and then its government when it tried to stand behind the banks.
One reason that Americans have been dubious about the prospects for euro survival is that it is hard for us to imagine anyone accepting such a prescription when simply adopting a (quickly devalued) new currency would seem to be much less painful, even considering the financial chaos that might ensue for a brief time.
The wealth of the populace, measured in foreign currency, would decline, but nominal salaries would not. Fixed payments -- such as car payments and mortgage payments -- would not suddenly increase as a percentage of income, as they have with slashes in paychecks.
But the euro never was primarily an economic creation. The political reasons for binding Europe together were -- and are -- more important. ''It is essential to understand the strength of the political glue that is holding the project together,'' Mr. Lambert of Warwick University said in his speech. ''A whole generation of political leaders want this project to survive, and they have the economic resources to make it do so if they choose to use them.''
He pointed out that polls in Greece -- which seems to be in a never-ending depression -- still show strong support for the euro, and so do polls in Finland, which has been upset over the need to support the periphery.
If countries in the periphery cannot devalue their currencies versus the German currency -- that is, if they stay in the euro -- then they must somehow get their labor costs in line with Germany's. There is talk of, and even some action, regarding labor market reforms, but that is a slow process.
In Portugal, the clever idea was something called ''fiscal devaluation,'' in which taxes were to be adjusted to lower labor costs. The government proposed charging lower payroll taxes to companies and higher ones to workers. That would have cut take-home pay, and reduced wage costs for business. The populace was outraged, and the government backed down.
It is not only the troubled countries on the periphery that saw inflation, and unit labor costs, rise much faster than costs in Germany over the past decade, leading to the competitive problem. That is still true in Italy and France. Mr. Lambert argues that the most important issue facing Europe is whether France will get a handle on its competitiveness problem.
German inflation would help greatly, and that could be a side benefit of the central bank running its printing presses full out.
In the long run, the peripheral economies must become competitive with their neighbors, so they can earn their own way, or the result will be, in Mr. Lambert's words, ''the permanent division of Europe into creditor and debtor nations, with the creditors dictating the terms.'' That, he says, ''would not be politically sustainable over time.''
The euro zone is not about to collapse. Whether it can be sustained over the long term is not as clear.

HEADLINE: Obama Campaign Endgame: Grunt Work and Cold Math

BYLINE: By JIM RUTENBERG; Peter Baker contributed reporting from Chicago, and Mark Landler and Jackie Calmes from Washington.

 BODY:
CHICAGO -- This is what ''grinding it out'' looks like at President Obama's election headquarters: scores of young staff members intently clicking away at computer keyboards as they crunch gigabytes of data about which way undecided voters are leaning, where they can be reached, and when; strategists standing at whiteboards busily writing and erasing early voting numbers and turnout possibilities; a lonely Ping-Pong table.
The wave of passion and excitement that coursed through Mr. Obama's headquarters here in 2008 has been replaced with a methodical and workmanlike approach to manufacturing the winning coalition that came together more organically and enthusiastically for him the last time, a more arduous task with no guarantee of success.
As Washington and the cable news commentariat breathlessly discuss whether Mitt Romney's post-debate movement in the polls has peaked, Mr. Obama's campaign technicians -- and that's what many of them are -- are putting as much faith in the multimillion-dollar machine they built for just such a close race as in the president himself. 
''We are exactly where I thought we would be, in a very close election with 12 days left with two things to do and two things only: persuade the undecided and turn our voters out,'' said Jim Messina, 43, the president's technocratic campaign manager, slightly paler and more hunched than he was when the campaign began. Pointing to the rows of personnel outside his office on Thursday, he added, ''Everything in that room has been focused on that.''
Four years ago, Mr. Obama's political team here was preparing one of its trademark showstoppers: a half-hour prime-time program extolling Mr. Obama's character and plans across four networks, culminating in a live feed from a boisterous rally in Florida.
There will be no such razzmatazz this time around. Any extra money in this tight final phase of the election is being wired to Nevada and Florida for more Spanish-language ads, to Iowa and Ohio for more on-the-ground staff members, and to Google and Facebook for more microtargeted messaging to complacent, maybe even demoralized, young supporters.
Mr. Obama emphasized the importance of their task during a stop at a phone bank here in Chicago on Thursday, telling volunteers, ''If we let up and our voters don't turn out, we could lose this election.'' He added quickly, ''The good news is, if our voters do turn out, we will definitely win the election.''
At the White House, it is clear that the action has moved to Chicago, with some staff members, who are legally prohibited from even wearing campaign buttons to work, pining to be on the trail and others whiling away the time preparing for the lame-duck Congressional wrangling on the budget impasse.
For Mr. Obama's campaign staff in a nondescript office tower here, the task now comes down to creating an electorate more favorable to Democrats than most major pollsters have assumed, with percentages of Obama-friendly black, Latino and young voters that rival those of 2008, at least enough to offset the large drop in support among other segments of the population, like independent men.
An ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll on Thursday had Mr. Romney with a 50-to-47-percent edge among likely voters nationwide, the first time the challenger had reached 50 percent in the poll. But Mr. Obama's aides here are at least projecting an air of confidence. They say their system, which they began building long before the Republican primaries, is exceeding expectations. Eleven days will tell whether they are bluffing.
After using their huge database to increase registration among favorable voting groups in crucial states, they are now pinpointing people who ordered absentee ballots and need a nudge to send them, or sporadic voters who indicated they would vote for the president but may need to be pushed to show up at their polling place.
''We made a strategic choice very early on that getting our supporters -- and the right types of supporters -- to the polls before Election Day was a big priority for us,'' said Mitch Stewart, the Obama campaign's battleground state director, who has been helping organize Mr. Obama's supporters since the 2008 election and started at the campaign some 19 months and, in his words, ''20 pounds ago.''
With a box of Tastykakes sitting on his desk in his spartan office, Mr. Stewart added, ''The electorate's going to look much more like 2008 than 2010.''
Some polls in recent weeks have shown Mr. Obama with an advantage among all registered voters, and Mr. Romney with an advantage or tied among likely voters. Mr. Obama's aides are contending that the pollsters are wrongly assuming that Mr. Obama's voters are less enthusiastic and that turnout among his key groups will be down, that is, he has fewer likely voters than he had four years ago.
A new Time magazine poll this week showed Mr. Obama ahead by a two-to-one ratio among those who voted early in Ohio.
His aides pointed to statistics showing that a slightly higher percentage of African-Americans had voted early in North Carolina compared with the percentage at this point four years ago, and that their percentages are up along with those of Hispanics in the early mail-in vote in Florida, which they attributed to their turnout operations.
Officials with Mr. Romney's campaign disagree, and they said that whatever gains Mr. Obama had would be unsustainable through Election Day, contending that he is succeeding only in getting those most likely to support him to show up early, an assessment that Mr. Obama's aides dispute.
''Every cycle, when someone is losing, they claim they are altering the electorate,'' said Rich Beeson, Mr. Romney's political director.
Of course, at this stage of the race, each campaign is engaged in a bit of bravado, aimed at giving supporters and undecided voters alike a sense that it is the winning team to be on.
There is little dispute that for Mr. Obama to at least come close enough to matching his 2008 coalition to win he will need to induce people to vote in a way he did not have to four years ago, before the full impact of the Great Recession was followed by intensive partisan wrangling.
Mr. Obama's aides here said they had prepared for the need to rebuild his coalition all along, and that is why they have kept careful tabs on his former supporters, and worked to identify potential new ones, since he took office, all the while perfecting ways to keep track of them, keep in touch with them, and, ultimately, persuade them to vote.
The campaign is refocusing its advertising to scare less motivated supporters to vote. One new ad presents a reminder of Al Gore's loss to George W. Bush in the Florida recount of 2000, which, the ad says, made ''the difference between what was, and what could have been.''
But ultimately, if Mr. Obama does win, it could come down to the huge room of technicians and data crunchers in a corporate office here, sitting on exercise balls or squeezing stress toys as they dispatch information to volunteers knocking on doors hundreds of miles away.
In interviews, Mr. Obama's aides wistfully recalled when the office had just opened, a vast, mostly empty space with a countdown of the days scrawled in Magic Marker -- then well into the hundreds. Now it is done with a digital clock, ticking off the very last minutes and seconds.

HEADLINE: An Endorsement: Sticking With the President

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY

 BODY:
Watch on Youtube.
12:22 p.m. | Updated Colin L. Powell, the former Republican secretary of state and retired four-star general, said on Thursday that he had decided to endorse President Obama's bid for re-election and was concerned that Mitt Romney was "a moving target" on foreign policy.
In an interview on "CBS This Morning," Mr. Powell said that he was "more comfortable" with the president's views on immigration, education and foreign policy. 
"I do not want to see the new Obamacare plan thrown off the table," Mr. Powell said. "It has issues - you have to fix some things in that plan - but what I see is that 30 million fellow citizens will now be covered."
It is an open question whether his endorsement will carry as much weight as it seemed to four years ago when he threw his support behind Mr. Obama in the final weeks of his campaign with Senator John McCain. But the president's advisers had been waiting with anticipation of an endorsement, which Mr. Powell did not reveal until his television interview Thursday morning.
In the interview, Mr. Powell said that the nation's unemployment rate was still too high, but he added: "I think generally we've come out of the dive and we're starting to gain altitude." He praised the president for his handling of national security."I also saw the president get us out of one war, start to get us out of a second war and did not get us into any new wars," Mr. Powell said. "I think the actions he's taken with respect to protecting us from terrorism have been very, very solid. And so I think we ought to keep on the track that we are on."
On Afghanistan and other foreign policy concerns, Mr. Powell said that he did not believe Mr. Romney "has thought through these issues as thoroughly as he should have." He added, "There are some very, very strong neo-conservative views that are presented by the governor that I have some trouble with."
He said that he still considered himself a Republican, but in "of a more moderate mold." He added, "That's something of a dying breed, I'm sorry to say."
Mr. Powell, a retired Army general who was a chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H.W. Bush and President Bill Clinton and Secretary of State under President George W. Bush, criticized the Republican Party as failing to recognize a need for compromise. He also had sharp words for Congress, which he said had fallen down on the job in dealing with the nation's fiscal burdens.
Four years ago, Mr. Powell announced his endorsement of Mr. Obama in an appearance on "Meet the Press" on NBC. He did not say during his interview Thursday on "CBS This Morning" whether he would campaign on Mr. Obama's behalf.
"I voted for him in 2008," Mr. Powell said, "and I plan to stick with him in 2012."
Update: Mr. Obama had no advance warning of Mr. Powell's endorsement and learned about it while waiting to address a rally in Tampa, Fla. Before taking stage, Mr. Obama called Mr. Powell to thank him. "I was proud and humbled to learn we have Colin Powell's support in this campaign," the president told a crowd of supporters at a later stop in Richmond, Va.
Senator John McCain said Thursday that Mr. Powell had "harmed" his legacy by endorsing Mr. Obama a second time. Appearing on Brian Kilmeade's radio program, Mr. McCain said "General Powell, you disappoint us and you have harmed your legacy even further by defending what is clearly the most feckless foreign policy in my lifetime."
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Toward a Tougher Cap and Trade Program

BYLINE: MIREYA NAVARRO


HIGHLIGHT: Experts debate whether a cap and trade system for nine Eastern states should tighten its emissions limits and link to California's program. 

 BODY:
The multistate carbon trading system known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative is undergoing its first comprehensive review since it was first put into effect in 2009. 
While the nine participating Northeastern and mid-Atlantic states, including New York, have found that RGGI (pronounced reggie) has succeeded in producing almost $1 billion for energy efficiency programs and in encouraging reliance on renewable energy, they are considering making some changes.
On Monday, the Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School held a panel discussion on RGGI's future in which various experts, including officials from the energy industry and New York's Department of Environmental Conservation, took part. They addressed the environmental and economic impact of the program's cap and trade system, in which a ceiling is set on greenhouse gas emissions and electric utilities pay for their carbon dioxide emissions by buying credits or allowances. Utilities with emissions below an allotted cap can sell or trade their unused allowances in online auctions held four times a year. 
The participants discussed whether RGGI should be linked with other trading programs like California's, whether the program should lower its cap on emissions to require further reductions, and whether the RGGI should include other sources of greenhouse gas emissions beyond the electricity sector.
Because of the faltering economy and a switch from coal to natural gas by many utilities, electricity demand and emissions have been lower than expected, so power suppliers have easily met their caps. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie cited this issue when he pulled out his state out of the program last year.
A video of the discussion at Columbia University is here.

HEADLINE: When the Transition Out of the Service Is Less Than Smooth

BYLINE: JAMES MCDONOUGH, JR.


HIGHLIGHT: The Army refers to separation from service as a "transition," implying something akin to moving steadily along a continuum. In reality, the experience is abrupt. 

 BODY:
As a colonel in the Army, I watched hundreds of soldiers and their families make the transition from citizen to soldier. In one unit in Germany during the 1990s, I would board the official Army "replacement bus," a 40-passenger bus with soldiers fresh from their specialty training, to introduce myself, hoping that the personal touch would translate into them selecting my battery when the battalion personnel clerk asked which one they'd like to be assigned to. 
It was a source of pride when a soldier remembered me from that experience. Small gestures like this matter a great deal when you're just 18, newly arrived in a foreign country and serving your own country. Unfortunately, that personal touch isn't afforded to veteran soldiers when they arrive on buses back in their hometowns upon completing their military careers, and that may be when they need it most.
We will soon observe Veterans Day across America, a day to honor the contributions of about 22 million living Americans who served their country. I am one of those Americans. For 26 years, my hands were directly on the Army's tiller as it welcomed and said goodbye, or "in- and out-processed" its soldiers, in Army terms. As a colonel, I didn't focus on my future after service, let alone the futures of my soldiers. Serving selflessly meant our futures were the Army's to determine; that was the deal we signed up for. 
"Do well and you'll be taken care of" was viewed as the glue that bound the Army to its leaders and, in turn, its soldiers. Doing poorly was never an option. As an officer, my primary responsibility was to take care of my soldiers and their families. The Army would take care of the rest.
That construct held up throughout my career until my retirement from active duty. The Army refers to separation from service as a "transition," implying something akin to moving steadily along a continuum. In reality, the experience is abrupt - one day you're in; the next, you're out - and often involves completely starting over. The same is true for the inverse. Becoming a soldier is far from a transitional experience. Just ask any soldier about the first few days of boot camp. 
Far too many of my soldiers had to start over when they became veterans. The Army trained me to prepare soldiers to go to war, to be separated from one another and to understand that their military service was the ultimate form of citizenship in this country. But, despite being a "creator" of veterans for nearly three decades, it wasn't on my radar to prepare them for life after the Army. I also didn't prepare myself to become a veteran. Contrary to common perception, the two terms - soldier and veteran - are not synonymous. 
That lack of preparation is having a disastrous effect. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the national unemployment rate is 7.8 percent, while the unemployment rate for veterans of the Iraq and Afghanistan wars is 9.7 percent - two percentage points above the national average. Even more striking, while veterans represent less than 7 percent of the nation's total population, they account for as much as 20 percent of all suicides, according to some estimates. Over our nation's past 11 years at war, the Department of Defense reports that approximately 2.3 million Americans have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, 800,000 of whom have been deployed multiple times. Now more than ever, we need to provide our veterans with the support they need to transition back into civilian life. 
While some assign blame to Americans at large for not doing enough to embrace their warriors' struggles, the Army also has a responsibility to ensure that soldiers have a firm pathway to success after service, one that is mapped along a continuum and affords soldiers an actual transition from citizen to soldier and then from soldier to citizen. For too long, we've made separating from military service an individual task, one that is supposed to occur over a few days. It needs to be a collective task, even a unit task that transcends a soldier's time in service, to borrow training phrases from the Army. 
Soldiers need individual transition plans that span their entire careers in the military to prepare them and provide the basic training they need to truly become civilians again. The plans should include practical goals, like creating a solid résumé with language that civilian employers can understand; obtaining their hard-earned credentials and certified copies of all health care, education and personnel records; establishing eligibility for federal and state veterans' benefits; and ensuring that they have the tools to understand those benefits and entitlements upon their departure. Soldiers should receive periodic transition counseling to ensure that their individual plans are still viable and that they are performing to standard. Above all else, those who experience trauma, whether invisible or otherwise, need treatment that continues without interruption. 
This past summer, the armed services, including the Army, unveiled a new Transition Assistance Program Goals, Planning and Success program to provide more personalized assistance to help soldiers with their goals as they prepare to exit military service. And, in a related effort, the Army recently announced its Soldier for Life campaign, which is supposed to connect soldiers with opportunities to succeed across their entire lives, starting with their entry into military service. The programs are still being put into effect, and it is too soon to say how effective they will be. Meanwhile, as we push through our 11th year of war in Afghanistan, thousands of soldiers continue to separate from the Army and begin their lives as veterans. 
The way that we treat our veterans is directly tied to the willingness of young people and their families to enter military service, to serve their country. Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, recently said he wanted to "increase the national conversation about war veterans and how they're treated and regarded in society." He said that he wanted to "turn up the volume," and that "after many years of war, it's important for veterans and the nation to talk about the role of those who have served, where they fit in society, and whether they're regarded as heroes, victims, or average citizens." 
I couldn't agree more.

HEADLINE: Home Entertainment Spending Rises, Buoyed by Streaming Subscriptions

BYLINE: MICHAEL CIEPLY


HIGHLIGHT: While DVD sales and rentals were down, there was a sharp increase in the subscription streaming of movies and TV shows, a new study found. 

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES - Consumer spending on movies and television in-home entertainment formats nudged up a quarter of a percent to about $3.94 billion in the third quarter, from about $3.93 billion in the period a year earlier, according to the Digital Entertainment Group. For the year to date, spending was $12.34 billion, up about 1 percent from $12.22 billion for the same period in 2011.
The slight increase came as revenue from the subscription streaming of programming rose sharply, to about $579 million in the third quarter, up from about $255 million in the quarter a year ago, and revenue from both video-on-demand and the electronic sale of digital programming rose. 
Those increases offset continuing declines in the sale of DVDs and the rental of programming in disc format in stores and by subscription.
Revenue from the rental of discs at kiosks rose about 10 percent in the third quarter, to $455 million from $414 million in the period a year earlier.

HEADLINE: Lifesaving CPR Varies by Neighborhood

BYLINE: ANAHAD O'CONNOR


HIGHLIGHT: People who went into cardiac arrest in low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods were far less likely to get CPR than in richer, predominantly white areas, a study has found. 

 BODY:
Whether you survive a heart attack may depend on where you live.
New research shows that people who experience cardiac arrest are half as likely to get lifesaving cardiopulmonary resuscitation from a bystander in low-income, predominantly black neighborhoods than in richer, predominantly white areas. Cardiac arrest, in which the heart stops pumping blood effectively, is typically caused by a heart attack or other cardiovascular problem.
A similar trend was seen in poor white and Latino neighborhoods. In low-income white neighborhoods, for example, cardiac arrest victims were 35 percent less likely to receive CPR than those in higher-income areas.
The study, published in The New England Journal of Medicine, looked at more than 14,000 cases of cardiac arrest in 29 cities around the country over a four-year period. About a quarter of those patients received CPR from a bystander, and for those who did, the odds of making it to a hospital and surviving were double. 
The findings suggest that emergency medical groups looking to increase survival rates from sudden cardiac arrest, a leading killer of Americans, may have the greatest effect by focusing on specific neighborhoods. 
"Hopefully this paper isn't just going to add to the literature about documenting disparities, but will give communities a road map about how to actually address the problem," said Dr. Comilla Sasson, the lead author and an assistant professor in the emergency medicine department at the University of Colorado, Denver. 
She speculated that economic and social factors were at the core of the problem. In poorer neighborhoods, a bystander may be more likely to suspect that a person collapsed on a sidewalk is intoxicated or a potential threat. And CPR classes can be expensive, costing up to $250. 
"If you're making less than $20,000 a year and you have to choose between groceries and a CPR class," Dr. Sasson said, "I think it's pretty obvious what you'd choose."
In some parts of the country, the economic divide was so stark that CPR differences could be mapped out block by block. In Denver, Dr. Sasson and her colleagues found one street where not a single person who had gone into cardiac arrest in the past three years had received CPR. But a block away, where incomes were higher, 40 percent of people who had experienced cardiac arrest in the same time period had been given CPR by a bystander. 
Many emergency medicine experts are now promoting a simpler version of CPR that can replace the old-fashioned CPR taught in many places. The newer version does away with mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and requires only chest compressions, carried out to the beat of the Bee Gees' '70s classic "Stayin' Alive."
"It's simple, it's easy and it's cheap," Dr. Sasson said. "You can learn it in 30 seconds. Push hard, push fast, at about 100 times a minute, to the tune of 'Stayin' Alive.' Basically, I've just trained you how to do hands-only CPR."
An earlier version of this article misstated the period of time in which researchers found that on a particular block in Denver, not a single person who had gone into cardiac arrest had been given CPR by a bystander. That was the case over three years, not the past two decades.

HEADLINE: Auto Rescue and Low Home-State Bonus Keep Michigan Out of Play

BYLINE: MICAH COHEN


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney, who was born and raised in Michigan, does not appear to be contesting the state, and the FiveThirtyEight forecast gives President Obama a 97 percent chance of winning there. 

 BODY:
 We continue our Presidential Geography series, a one-by-one examination of each state's political landscape and how it is changing. Here is Michigan, the Wolverine State. FiveThirtyEight spoke with Bill Ballenger, the editor and publisher of Inside Michigan Politics; and Matt Grossman, an assistant professor of political science at Michigan State University. 
The government's rescue of the American automobile industry appears to have given President Obama a slight boost in Ohio, whose 18 electoral votes may very well decide the nation's next president. Even at times when the presidential race has been a dead heat nationally, Mr. Obama has retained a consistent lead in Ohio, a state that has usually been slightly Republican-leaning relative to the country as a whole.
But in Michigan -- the home of the auto industry -- the political effects of the rescue of General Motors and Chrysler have received less attention. Mr. Obama carried Michigan by 16 percentage points in 2008, suggesting the state's 16 electoral votes were out of reach for Mitt Romney, rescue or no rescue.
There are a few problems with this logic, however. First, Mr. Obama's margin in 2008 was somewhat inflated. Senator John McCain essentially conceded the state, pulling his campaign out of Michigan about a month before the election. Polls showed Mr. Obama's lead quickly ballooning. Had Mr. McCain contested Michigan through the final month, the 2008 margin might have been closer.
Mr. Romney was also born in Detroit and raised in suburban Bloomfield Hills. His father, George Romney, was governor of Michigan from 1963 to 1969. Presidential candidates have historically received an average bonus of roughly seven percentage points in their home state. In fact, the last native Michigander to run for president, Gerald Ford, received that exactly, winning Michigan in 1976 by five percentage points while losing the national popular vote by two.
Nonetheless, the Romney campaign doesn't seem to be seriously contesting Michigan. In the last 30 days, Ann Romney and Representative Paul D. Ryan have each visited the state once, but neither Mr. Romney nor Mr. Obama has campaigned there. 
In a campaign with a native son on the ballot, "Michigan has lost its battleground status," Mr. Ballenger said. 
Can Mr. Obama thank the auto rescue for keeping Michigan out of play? Partly, but Mr. Romney is also unlikely to get a big home-state bonus, local analysts said.
Republicans carried Michigan in five consecutive presidential elections from 1972 through 1988. But Michigan wasn't a truly Republican-leaning state; it was a tipping point state. It was reliably Republican because the nation was reliably Republican. During that period the G.O.P. won the White House every year but 1976, and Michigan went red then anyway because of Ford.
As cultural conservatism gained sway in the Republican Party nationally, however, socially moderate voters in suburban Michigan began favoring Democrats. This realignment was not as pronounced as it was in New England or the rest of the Northeast; Michigan has a strong anti-abortion movement. But the Wolverine State was relatively balanced politically -- "It was the old Ohio," Mr. Ballenger said -- and a small shift toward the Democrats tipped the scales. 
Democrats have carried Michigan in the last five presidential elections. The state's leftward lean increased from two percentage points in 1992, relative to the national popular vote, to nine points in 2008. 
Detroit, though a shadow of its former size, is heavily African-American and overwhelmingly Democrat-leaning. About half of Mr. Obama's margin of victory in the state in 2008 came from Wayne County, where Detroit is. Democrats are also dominant in college towns like Ann Arbor and East Lansing; the state capital, Lansing; and smaller industrial cities like Flint.
The traditional base of Republican support is in the southwest, around Grand Rapids, where many voters are fiercely anti-abortion, influenced by the socially conservative Reformed Church in America (formerly the Dutch Reformed Church). 
North of Grand Rapids and Flint, the state is more sparsely populated. The northern part of the lower peninsula is solidly Republican. The Upper Peninsula is traditionally blue-collar Democratic, but socially conservative and wary of gun control and environmental regulations, according to The Almanac of American Politics.
The two main political battlegrounds in Michigan are just north of Detroit: Oakland and Macomb Counties. 
Macomb County is the birthplace of the "Reagan Democrats," the socially conservative, white, working-class Democrats who voted for Ronald Reagan. Even after Reagan, Macomb County has been willing to vote Republican. George W. Bush carried it in 2004.
Macomb County is not as blue-collar as it once was, but it still has a lot of workers in the auto and related industries. Had there been no auto industry rescue, Macomb County voters -- their connection to the Democratic Party already weak -- might have moved even further to the Republican ticket. In fact, Mr. Romney may still carry the county; Mr. Obama won it with 53 percent in 2008.
 The Bellwether: Oakland County 
The other main swing county in Michigan is Oakland County, where Mr. Romney grew up. Oakland County has gone from a Republican bastion to a battleground as socially moderate voters in bustling suburban towns like Farmington Hills and West Bloomfield have trended Democratic. This area has also grown increasingly diverse, as middle-class African-American families have moved there from Detroit. 
The partisan shift in Oakland County has made it an almost perfect bellwether for the statewide vote. It was one percentage point more Republican than the state in 2008 and roughly two points more Republican-leaning in 2004 and 2000. If Mr. Romney is having a really good night, and the Michigan vote is unexpectedly close, it will be apparent in Oakland County and Macomb County (itself a decent bellwether), which together accounted for almost a quarter of the vote in 2008.
 The Bottom Line 
Mr. Obama is a 97 percent favorite to carry Michigan, according to the current FiveThirtyEight forecast. 
It is impossible to know what would have happened if General Motors and Chrysler had not been rescued, but Michigan's economy might have been in far worse shape than it is now. The state's unemployment rate is relatively high, at 9.3 percent, but it has dropped precipitously from a peak of more than 14 percent.
In addition, Mr. Romney doesn't appear to be getting a substantial home-state benefit, both Mr. Ballenger and Mr. Grossman said.
"I don't think many voters consider Romney a home-state candidate, especially not compared to Ford," Mr. Grossman said.
Ford represented Michigan in Congress for more than two decades. Mr. Romney, a former governor of Massachusetts, spent most of his adult life living outside of Michigan and was never elected to any political office in the state.
Mr. Romney didn't appear to receive much of a home-state bonus in Michigan's 2012 Republican primary. He squeaked by Rick Santorum by just three percentage points. 
The FiveThirtyEight model currently projects Mr. Obama to carry Michigan by seven percentage points and the nation by 1.5 points. That would make Michigan 5.5 percentage points Democratic-leaning relative to the national average, almost exactly where it was from 1996 to 2004.
It is possible the boost to Mr. Obama from the auto rescue and Mr. Romney's home-state bonus are canceling one another out. Or, perhaps neither is having a substantial effect. 
"Michigan has been slightly to the left of center for a while now," Mr. Grossman said, "and it doesn't seem to be moving a whole lot, in my view."

 In Today's Times: 

        
Republican efforts to win a Senate majority have become harder after missteps like Richard E. Mourdock's recent comments in Indiana about rape and abortion. Control of the Senatewill have major implications for the next president's goals, no matter which candidate takes the White House, Jonathan Weisman reports.

        
In the final stretch of the race, Jim Rutenberg reports, President Obama's campaign staff is crunching the numbers, working on a get-out-the-vote strategy and putting their faith in the multimillion-dollar political machine they built for just such a close race.

        
Mitt Romney and President Obama may agree that the world is warming and that humans are at least partly to blame, but both candidates have avoided talking aboutclimate change while they compete over who loves coal, oil and natural gas more, John M. Broder reports.

        
The presidential candidates are on track to raise more than $1 billion dollars each by Election Day. The sources of that money highlight the sharp divisions between the candidates on issues like abortion rights, government regulation and the economy, Nicholas Confessore and Jo Craven McGinty report.

HEADLINE: Coming to a Battleground State Near You: MittZine

BYLINE: JEREMY W. PETERS


HIGHLIGHT: It's called a MittZine. A magazine about, you guessed it, Mitt Romney. And all 12 glossy pages of it will start appearing soon as an insert in newspapers in battleground states. 

 BODY:
It's called a MittZine. A magazine about, you guessed it, Mitt Romney. And all 12 glossy pages of it will start appearing soon as an insert in newspapers in battleground states.
There are heartwarming tales from Mr. Romney's past. In one article titled "How Romney's Leadership Rescued a Missing Girl," he is praised as a "hero" for helping track down the daughter of one of his colleagues at Bain Capital.
Another article, headlined "Romney to the Rescue," chronicles the effort to save a family whose boat was sinking on Lake Winnipesaukee in New Hampshire. Also rescued, as the article notes: the family's Scottish terrier, McKenzie. There is even a picture of the little dog.
The magazine is the work of the Ending Spending Action Fund, a "super PAC" that spent a little more than $1 million printing and distributing the publication on high-stock paper. It is slightly larger than the average newsstand magazine.
The group, which is financed by Joe Ricketts, founder of TD Ameritrade, has primarily focused its efforts on running television commercials. But it opted for something less conventional now because its strategists believe that the airwaves are so cluttered that any television advertising would be wasted.
"You have high-quality content that lasts for much longer than 30 seconds," said Brian Baker, the president and general counsel of the super PAC. "We think there's great effect on the voter who receives it."
If readers are so inclined, they may also fill out the Romney-Ryan themed crossword puzzle. A sampling of the clues: "Mitt Romney can _____ the country out of the economic mess" and "The burger company where Paul Ryan worked as a kid."
Mr. Baker said that major newspapers would include it as a paid insert, including The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, The Cleveland Plain Dealer and The Des Moines Register.

HEADLINE: Obama's Stamina

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: After a disappointing few weeks in the polls, the president is determined to show that he is employing every mental and financial resource he has toward re-election. 

 BODY:
CLEVELAND - At most of his campaign stops, President Obama's backdrop for the TV cameras is a carefully diverse group of cheering supporters. Last night he decided to go for something different.
On the tarmac of Burke Lakefront Airport, Air Force One landed, made a few turns, and pulled right up to the edge of the roaring crowd, some 12,000 strong. A huge floodlight, mounted on a raised platform, illuminated the plane (which was actually the smaller, modified-757 version usually used by the vice president). The door opened, and the president bounded down the stairs and then up to the podium as his supporters went wild. The aircraft remained behind him, glowing against the night sky, throughout the speech.

It was a flashy demonstration of the trappings of power that Mitt Romney can't begin to duplicate. But the stagecraft had a deeper purpose. After a disappointing few weeks in the polls, during which some of his most fervent supporters wondered if his fire was still alight, the president is determined to show that he is employing every mental, rhetorical and financial resource he has toward re-election.
That was the subtext to his exhausting round of six states in two days, an exhibition of ardor and stamina that candidates usually reserve for the final hours of a campaign. If there is any doubt about his resolve, he wants to dispel it with visibly rolled-up shirtsleeves, a few beads of sweat and an increasingly sandpapery voice.
His speech in Cleveland as he concluded the tour was longer and more emotional than the others. Knowing that his successful auto bailout, rejected by Mr. Romney, is the key to winning Ohio, he stressed it in far stronger terms than he did elsewhere. How, he asked, could Mr. Romney sit on the debate stage and say he was for the auto industry when everyone remembers his opposition to the bailout?
"The auto industry supports one in eight Ohio jobs," he said. "It's a source of pride to this state. It's a source of pride for generations of workers. I refused to walk away from those workers. I refused to walk away from those jobs. I wasn't going to let Detroit go bankrupt, or Toledo go bankrupt, or Lordstown go bankrupt. I bet on American workers. I bet on American manufacturing. And I'd do it again, because that bet always pays off."
(GM makes the Chevy Cruze in Lordstown, Ohio, not far from Cleveland, and Chrysler makes Jeeps in Toledo.)
He also went on a little longer than usual about the economic difficulties still facing many people in the state, trying not to alienate struggling families with too much talk of economic recovery.
"Listen, Ohio, I know we've been through tough times," he said. "Every day I think about everybody out there all across the country who wants to work and is still looking for a job, whose homes may be still underwater or at risk of foreclosure. The folks out there who, at the end of the month, are sitting around the kitchen table, trying to figure out, how am I going to make all these bills."
It's not quite Mr. Romney's constant description of a tattered and threadbare country, but it does acknowledge the considerable difficulties that remain .
Then, after a few references to a "distant horizon" and "new frontier," and with Bruce Springsteen's "We Take Care of Our Own" on the speakers, he shook some hands and got back on his gleaming symbol. In a day or two, he'll do it all over again.

HEADLINE: Romney Tries to Take Up the Mantle of 'Change'

BYLINE: MICHAEL BARBARO


HIGHLIGHT: Aides had billed the speech a significant one, though Mitt Romney offered no new policy proposals. 

 BODY:
AMES, Iowa - Mitt Romney intensified a new - and, aides said, final - line of attack against President Obama on Friday, arguing that the incumbent who once stood for historic change has run a re-election campaign built around small ideas and trivial attacks. 
Mr. Romney, speaking from a teleprompter to a crowd of 2,200 at a factory here, offered himself up as a 2008-like alternative to Mr. Obama.
"Four years ago, candidate Obama spoke to the scale of the times," Mr. Romney said. "Today, he shrinks from it, trying instead to distract our attention from the biggest issues to the smallest -- from characters on Sesame Street and silly word games to misdirected personal attacks he knows are false."
"The president's campaign falls far short of the magnitude of these times," he said.
It was the second day that Mr. Romney sought to take up the mantle of change, seeming to delight in borrowing a slogan that Mr. Obama rode to the White House but now finds challenging to embrace.
"We recognize this is a year with a big choice, and the American people want to see big changes," he said. "Together we can bring real change to this country."
Aides had said the speech would be a significant one, though Mr. Romney offered no new policy proposals. Mr. Obama's campaign seized on that omission.
"True to form, Mitt Romney's most recent 'major policy speech' included dishonest attacks and empty promises of change, but no new policy," said Lis Smith, a spokeswoman for the president. 
"That's because all Mitt Romney has is a one-point economic plan that he's been running on for two years: the very wealthy get to play by a very different set of rules than everyone else."
In a bit of wordplay, Mr. Romney mocked Mr. Obama's current campaign slogan, "Forward," as misleading.
"To the 23 million Americans struggling to find a good job, these last four years feel a lot more like 'backward,' " he said.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Pays Fine and Fires Star Technology Analyst

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and RANDALL SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Citigroup paid a $2 million fine and fired two employees after authorities accused the bank of improperly disclosing confidential information to media outlets about YouTube's earnings and Facebook's initial public offering. 

 BODY:
 9:13 p.m. | Updated 
Mark S. Mahaney has been a stock-picking star among a wave of new technology companies, a number-cruncher with Silicon Valley flair.
But his career took a bizarre turn on Friday, as he was swept into a regulatory investigation of Wall Street that stems from Facebook's messy stock debut.
Citigroup fired Mr. Mahaney early Friday morning, after regulators discovered that he answered a reporter's e-mail without the bank's blessing. When confronted by the bank about the brief exchange, which was unrelated to Facebook, he covered up his mistake.
The revelations emerged from a broader inquiry into Wall Street's role in Facebook's initial public offering. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth, William F. Galvin, have subpoenaed Citigroup and others like Morgan Stanley over the $16 billion offering. The authorities are examining whether bank analysts violated a cornerstone of the securities industry when they shared research about Facebook with a limited group of clients and journalists.
In some ways, the investigations echo the crackdown more than a decade ago on the practices of analysts who covered dot-com companies.
"This is an especially sensitive area due to the research scandals of the Internet bubble and the fact that the Facebook I.P.O. was so visible," said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.
Yet regulators did not accuse Mr. Mahaney of improperly leaking information about Facebook. (His disclosure was about YouTube's earnings.) Still, a junior Citigroup analyst does face such claims. In a civil order released on Friday, Mr. Galvin accused the unnamed analyst of sharing nonpublic information about Facebook to TechCrunch, a blog focused on the technology world. Citigroup, which fired the junior analyst in September, paid a $2 million fine on Friday to settle the accusations.
"This penalty should serve as a warning to the industry as a whole," Mr. Galvin said. "If we're going to have a level playing field, you can't selectively give out information."
Favoritism and selective disclosures were among the abuses uncovered by regulators after the Internet bubble burst in 2000. Investigations, often citing internal e-mails, found that analysts hyped the stocks of companies that did business with their banks while investors lost millions and millions of dollars. In some cases, analysts privately sneered at stocks they were publicly praising. In one e-mail, an analyst labeled a security a "piece of junk."
The scandal led to a landmark 2003 settlement with several banks, including Citigroup. The case, led by a former New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, built a Chinese wall between Wall Street research analysts and investment bankers. Under the court settlement, analysts were barred from communicating with bankers unless accompanied by a compliance officer, an effort to curb bankers from influencing research.
Among other practices widely adopted on Wall Street a decade ago, analysts had to obtain in-house permission before commenting publicly to news media about companies they covered. Some Wall Street firms also prevent analysts from expressing a viewpoint on companies unless the information is published in a report.
These procedures, regulators say, tripped up Mr. Mahaney.
Mr. Galvin's order took aim at the longtime analyst for discussing YouTube's earnings with a reporter from a French magazine, Capital, without Citigroup's permission. The reporter approached Mr. Mahaney in April seeking projections about YouTube's revenue and earnings growth, some of which Citigroup had not yet published. Mr. Mahaney sent a terse e-mail reply that answered the essence of the reporter's questions.
But when a bank spokeswoman followed up to remind Mr. Mahaney about seeking approval beforehand, he denied ever e-mailing the reporter. "I won't respond," he said, according to the order.
The reporter later informed Citigroup that Mr. Mahaney did in fact respond. According to Mr. Galvin's order, the analyst then asked bank employees to fudge the timing of the interview, an apparent effort to avoid blame for not seeking approval.
When told that the accurate time was already submitted, he replied in an e-mail cited in the order: "This could get me into trouble. Shoot."
Mr. Mahaney, 46, who was based in the bank's San Francisco office, declined to comment.
In a statement, a Citigroup spokeswoman said the bank was "pleased to have this matter resolved," adding that "we take our internal policies and procedures very seriously and have taken the appropriate actions."
After firing the junior analyst in late September, and moving toward a settlement with Mr. Galvin in recent days, Citigroup summoned Mr. Mahaney to New York on Wednesday, people briefed on the matter said. Lawyers outlined their concerns about his behavior, but they sent him back to the West Coast without deciding his fate.
However, after striking the settlement with Mr. Galvin on Thursday, the bank decided to dismiss Mr. Mahaney. Some Citigroup officials said at issue was the cover-up rather than speaking to the news media without permission, which is fairly common on Wall Street. Mr. Mahaney learned of the decision around 5 a.m. Friday, the people said.
In dismissing Mr. Mahaney, the bank lost a marquee analyst who covered the recent run of technology stock offerings. He came to Citigroup in 2005 after stints in government at the State Department and on Wall Street at Morgan Stanley and the Galleon Group, the hedge fund that was toppled by insider trading accusations. (Mr. Mahaney was not implicated in that case.)
A regular on the business TV circuit, he was named the No. 1 Internet analyst for five consecutive years in an influential poll by Institutional Investor magazine. His presence helped Citi win a few Internet I.P.O. assignments in 2011, including Zillow and Active Network, according to top executives at those companies.
In Silicon Valley, Mr. Mahaney also became known for regular meetings of money managers and venture capitalists called "the Rally in the Valley" at a restaurant in Redwood City. Among his best calls was a recommendation of Priceline.com in 2008 before it tripled and an upgrade of Amazon in 2009 before its stock price more than doubled.
Mr. Mahaney, who took home about $3 million in 2011, covered 31 companies over the last 12 months as a Citigroup analyst, according to Bloomberg data.
The bank said Friday that it would abandon some of the companies he covered and transfer others to another analyst.
Despite the focus on Mr. Mahaney, the main legal violations stemmed from the disclosure of Facebook information.
In May, the unnamed junior Citigroup analyst e-mailed two TechCrunch employees to say "I am ramping up coverage of FB and thought you guys might like to see how the street is thinking about it (and our estimates)."
He attached a "Facebook one-pager," which featured an array of confidential information, including Mr. Mahaney's revenue estimates meant as an internal guide for the bank's analysts. The leak, which came before the company's public shares started trading in May, also included Citigroup's private projections for the company's "Investment Risks" and "Investment Positives."
A TechCrunch employee sought to post the document on the Web, but the junior analyst balked.
"My boss would eat me alive," he said.

HEADLINE: Some Are More Unequal Than Others

BYLINE: JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney has been explicit: inequality should be talked about only in quiet voices behind closed doors. But there is much more to say. 

 BODY:
This election has rightly been characterized as one that will deeply affect the future direction of the country: Americans are being given a choice with potentially large consequences. One arena in which there are profound differences that has not been adequately debated is the future course of inequality. 
Mitt Romney has been explicit: inequality should be talked about only in quiet voices behind closed doors. But with the normally conservative magazine The Economist publishing a special series showing the extremes to which American inequality has grown - joining a growing chorus (of which my book "The Price of Inequality" is an example) arguing that the extremes of American inequality, its nature and origins, are adversely affecting our economy - it is an issue that not even the Republicans can ignore. It is no longer just a moral issue, a question of social justice.
This perhaps provides part of the explanation for why inequality and poverty should suddenly appear as part of the Romney-Ryan makeover, as they attempt to portray themselves (to use a phrase of some 12 years ago) as compassionate conservatives. In Cleveland on Wednesday, Paul Ryan gave a speech that might lead one to conclude that the two Republican candidates were really concerned about poverty. But more revealing than oratory are budget numbers - like those actually contained in the Ryan budget. His budget proposal guts programs that serve those at the bottom, and little could have done more to enrich those at the top than his original tax proposals (like the elimination of capital gains taxes, a position from which he understandably has tried to distance himself). Every other advanced country has recognized the right of everyone to access to health care, and extending access was central to President Obama's health care reform. Romney and Ryan have criticized that reform, but have said nothing about how or whether they would ensure universal access. Most important, the macroeconomic consequences of the Romney-Ryan economic program would be devastating: growth would slow, unemployment would increase, and just as Americans would need the social protection of government more, the safety net would be weakened.
We'd all do well to pay a bit closer attention. That American inequality is at historic highs is undisputed. It's not just that the top 1 percent takes in about a fifth of the income, and controls more than a third of the wealth. America also has become the country (among the advanced industrial countries) with the least equality of opportunity. Meanwhile, those in the middle are faring badly, in every dimension, in security, in income, and in wealth - the wealth of the typical household is back to where it was in the 1990s. While the recession has made all of this worse, even before the recession they weren't faring well: in 2007, the income of the typical family was lower than it was at the end of the last century. While Obama may not have done as much as he should to counteract the steep downturn he inherited from George W. Bush upon taking office - and he underestimated the depth of the problems that had been passed along to him - he did far more than his predecessor. And he could have done far more, as the dimensions of the problem became clearer to everyone, had he not faced such strong opposition in Congress.
There are many forces giving rise to this high and rising inequality. But the fact that America's inequality is greater than other advanced countries' says that it's not just market forces. After all, other advanced countries are subjected to market forces much like those confronting us. Markets don't exist in a vacuum. Government policies - or their lack - have played a critical role in creating and maintaining these inequities. 
Inequality in "market incomes" - what individuals receive apart from any transfers from the government - has increased as a result of ineffective enforcement of competition laws, inadequate financial regulation, deficiency in corporate governance laws, and "corporate welfare" - huge open and hidden subsidies to our corporations that reached new heights in the Bush administration. When, for instance, competition laws are not enforced, monopolies grow, and with them the income of monopolists. Competition, by contrast, drives profits down. What is disturbing about Romney and Ryan is that they have done so little to distance themselves from the economic policies of the Bush administration, which not only led to poor economic performance, but also to so much inequality. Understandably, perhaps, Romney has not explained why those, like him, in the hedge fund and equity fund business should be able to use a loophole in the tax law to pay 15 percent taxes on their earnings, when ordinary workers pay a far higher rate.
Our government does less to correct these inequalities than we did in the past, or than other countries do, and as disparities in "market" incomes have increased, its efforts have diminished. It's not just a matter of redistribution, as some suggest. It's in part a matter of ensuring that those at the top pay a fair share of their taxes. And it's in part a matter of ensuring that those at the bottom and in the middle get a fair start in life, through access to education, adequate nutrition and health, and not being exposed to the environmental hazards that have come to plague many of our poor neighborhoods.
But Romney's campaign likes to play tricks with numbers. When he unleashed a tirade against the bottom 47 percent of supposedly freeloading Americans (for which he has since apologized), he failed to note what should have been obvious and has been pointed out repeatedly since he made that remark: those Americans do pay large amounts in taxes. These include (and I'm hardly the first to point this out) payroll taxes, sales taxes, property taxes, excise taxes, and even part of the corporate income taxes that our major corporations manage to pass on to their customers. He failed to note, too, the many older Americans barely above poverty who receive social security payments, for which they contributed through a lifetime of work. Yes, the rich may pay a high and increasing share of the country's total tax revenue, but that's only because they have a high and increasing share of our national income- not because their rates have gone up. 
Many of the very rich, like Romney, are avoiding taxes because of numerous loopholes that favor the rich, and capital gains taxes that are taxed at less than half the rate of other income. The 14 percent rate Romney reportedly paid on his income last year is well below that of Americans of comparable income who worked for their money doing things like creating a real business. Tax havens like the Cayman Islands (condemned by the Group20 and all economic experts) facilitate another level of tax avoidance. That the practice is legal is not an economic justification - the loopholes that allow it were put in place by the rich and the bankers, lawyers and lobbyists who serve them so well. We can be sure that the money is not in the Cayman Islands just because it grows faster in the bright sunshine there.
Putting all this together isn't the politics of envy, as Romney's camp likes to complain, or even about shaking a finger at the country's real freeloaders. It's about cold, hard economics. Tax avoidance and low rates on capital gains - and the inequality they amplify - are weakening our economy. Were the rich paying their fair share, our deficit would be smaller, and we would be able to invest more in infrastructure, technology and education - investments that would create jobs now and enhance growth in the future. While education is central to restoring America as a land of opportunity, all three of these are crucial for future growth and increases in living standards. Tax havens discourage investment in the United States. Taxing speculators at a lower rate encourages speculation and instability - and draws our most talented young people out of more productive endeavors. The result is a distorted, inefficient economy that grows more slowly than it should.
The Romney campaign, however, has defended inequality or brushed it aside. To do so, it has employed a handful of economic myths. Here are a few of the most important:
(1) America is a land of opportunity. While rags-to-riches stories still grip our imagination, the fact of the matter is that the life chances of a young American are more dependent on the income and wealth of his parents than in any of the other advanced countries for which there is data. There is less upward mobility - and less downward mobility from the top - even than in Europe, and we're not just talking about Scandinavia.
(2) Trickle-down economics works (a k a "a rising tide lifts all boats"). This idea suggests that further enriching the wealthy will make us all better off. America's recent economic history shows the patent falsehood of this notion. The top has done very well. But median American incomes are lower than they were a decade and a half ago. Various groups - men and those without a college education - have fared even worse. Median income of a full-time male worker, for instance, is lower than it was four decades ago.
(3) The rich are the "job creators," so giving them more money leads to more and better jobs. This is really a subset of Myth 2. But Romney's own private sector history gives it the lie. As we all know from the discussion of Bain Capital and other equity firms, many made their money not by creating jobs in America but by "restructuring," "downsizing" and moving jobs abroad, often using debt to bleed the companies of money needed for investment, and using the money to enrich themselves. But more generally, the rich are not the source of transformative innovations. Many, if not most of the crucial innovations in recent decades, from medicine to the Internet, have been based in large measure on government-financed research and development. The rich take their money where the returns are highest, and right now many see those high returns in emerging markets. It's not a surprise that Romney's trust fund invested in China, but it's hard to see how giving the rich more money - through more latitude to escape taxation, either through low taxes in the United States or Cayman Islands hide-aways - leads to a stronger American economy.
(4) The cost of reducing inequality is so great that, as much as idealists would like to do so, we would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. In fact, the engine of our economic growth is the middle class. Inequality weakens aggregate demand, because those at the middle and bottom have to spend all or almost all of what that they get, while those at the top don't. The concentration of wealth in recent decades led to bubbles and instability, as the Fed tried to offset the effects of weak demand arising from our inequality by low interest rates and lax regulation. The irony is that the tax cuts for capital gains and dividends that were supposed to spur investment by the wealthy alleged job creators didn't do so, even with record low interest rates: private sector job creation under Bush was dismal. Mainstream economic institutions like the International Monetary Fund now recognize the connection between inequality and a weak economy. To argue the contrary is a self-serving idea being promoted by the very wealthy.
(5) Markets are self-regulating and efficient, and any governmental interference with markets is a mistake. The 2008 crisis should have cured everyone of this fallacy, but anyone with a sense of history would realize that capitalism has been plagued with booms and busts since its origin. The only period in our history in which financial markets did not suffer from excesses was the period after the Great Depression, in which we put in place strong regulations that worked. It's worth noting that we grew much faster, and more stably, in the decades after World War II than in the period after 1980, when we started stripping away the regulations. And in the former period we grew together, in contrast to the latter, when we grew apart.
As I have explained in detail elsewhere, the cost of these myths goes far beyond the damage to our economy, now and in the future. The fabric of our society and democracy is suffering. The worry is that those at the top are investing their money not in real investments, in real innovations, but in political investments. Their big contributions to the presidential and Congressional campaigns are, too often, not charitable contributions. They expect, and have received, high returns from these political investments. These political investments, exemplified by those the financial institutions made, yielded far higher returns than anything else they did. The investments bought deregulation and a huge bailout - though they also brought the economy to the brink of ruin and are a source of much of our inequality. 
Such political investments undermine and corrupt our democracy. But there are other manifestations: America is fast becoming a country marked not by justice for all, but by justice for those who can afford it. (Just one of many examples is that no banker has been prosecuted, let alone convicted, for banks' systematic lying to the court regarding the fraudulent practices that played so large a role in the 2008 crisis.) And with the increasing influence of money, especially notable in this election, the outcomes of our political process are becoming more like one dollar, one vote than one person, one vote. It's even worse, because political inequality leads to economic inequality, which leads in turn to more political inequality, in a vicious spiral undermining our economy and our democracy.
Recognizing all this is not class warfare. It is simply acknowledging the realities of life in the United States, which Romney has not done. That should be cause for concern: if you don't recognize that there is a problem, and if you don't understand the sources and consequences, you will never work to solve it.
Obama has at least touched on key elements: his education policies, from "the race to the top" to the reforms of student loan programs, will enhance opportunity. His tax proposals will do a little bit about the extremes at the top. His jobs and investment programs will expand growth now, and in the future, and these will be of enormous benefit to those in the middle. Romney and Ryan have tried a hard tack to the center in their rhetoric in recent weeks. But let no one be deceived: their tax policies will lead to even more inequality at the top, the continued hollowing out of the middle, and more poverty at the bottom. Worst of all, they will lead to a more divided society that endangers our future - our economy, our democracy and our sense of identity as a nation.

HEADLINE: With Islanders' Move, Pondering Tailgating on Train

BYLINE: By MATT FLEGENHEIMER

 BODY:
For their most zealous fans, evenings with the New York Islanders have been as unchanging as the seat number on a season ticket: Hop in the car. Enter a fading arena. And in recent years, watch a once-proud hockey team lose more often than it won.
The announcement on Wednesday of the team's move to the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, scheduled for the 2015 season, offers no guarantees of a transformation on the ice. 
But before and after the games, the fans who choose to follow the team from Hempstead Turnpike to Flatbush Avenue appear headed for a substantial change in routine, wrought by a largely suburban fan base and a new home engineered to promote public transportation and discourage driving.
Some Long Islanders say the team's tenure at Nassau Coliseum, where the franchise has played since its inception in 1972, has left its fans uniquely tethered to car culture. During its run of four consecutive Stanley Cup championships in the 1980s, the team held victory parades on the turnpike. ''We have no Broadway on Long Island,'' one fan told The New York Times at the time.
Indeed, some fans have said they would continue to drive, despite the prospect of congestion and meager parking opportunities. Others have schemed already to import car-centric traditions like tailgating to the Long Island Rail Road.
Samuel I. Schwartz, a former city traffic commissioner who developed a transportation plan for the area around the arena, said he expected crowds to shift from car to train travel quickly.
''My advice to investors: Don't invest in any parking lots near the Barclays Center,'' he said.
Mr. Schwartz said his firm had devised a traffic plan when the New Jersey Devils moved in 2007 from East Rutherford, N.J., where few people took public transportation, to the Prudential Center in Newark. More than a third of attendees now travel on mass transit for games, he said.
But Nassau County's Democratic leader, Kevan Abrahams, said many fans would probably try to drive to games initially before realizing ''they're going to get caught in a mountain of traffic.''
Others seemed willing to tolerate a bit of congestion. Jorge Maia, 47, a season-ticket holder from Mineola, said he often brought his 4-year-old son, Miko, to games at the Coliseum, where, by the final buzzer, the boy would grow groggy.
''You put them in your car, and they're passed out,'' he said. ''On the train, what are you going to do?''
Another Coliseum regular, Larry Ziegler, 43, said he and other fans might be deterred from using the railroad because they would have to change trains in Jamaica, Queens.
Mitchell L. Moss, a professor of urban policy and planning at New York University, expressed confidence that hockey fans -- the ''sturdiest'' in sports, he said -- could endure the nuisance of a train transfer.
''They're going to be much more comfortable on Long Island Rail Road than trying to negotiate the Jackie Robinson Parkway,'' Professor Moss said, noting the railroad's popularity with New York Rangers fans traveling to Madison Square Garden.
Indeed, in the Barclays Center's opening weeks, which have featured a mix of concerts, preseason basketball games and other events, forecasts of neighborhood-wide gridlock have thus far been unfounded. Officials have attributed the relatively calm car traffic to an embrace of public transportation.
Helena E. Williams, the president of the Long Island Rail Road, said ridership on the service had increased roughly 260 percent in the evening hours of event nights. Suburban audiences, she said, had already proved they would take the train.
''The Long Island crowd didn't necessarily go to Jay-Z,'' she said, ''but certainly Barbra Streisand was huge.''
Ms. Williams also observed that the railroad, which allows alcohol, with certain restrictions, might be a safer, more appropriate form of transportation for some fans.
Tom LoFaso, 21, a co-founder of a fan club known as the Blue and Orange Army, said its usual tailgating parties would have to be adapted for the railroad. Beer, team flags and European soccer-style chanting are all being contemplated, he said, but the fan club's standard chants, which include ''L.I. till I die,'' would require rewriting.
''We say 'Long Island,' '' Mr. LoFaso said. ''We're going to have to say 'Brooklyn.' ''

HEADLINE: For Asians, School Tests Are Vital Steppingstones

BYLINE: By KYLE SPENCER

 BODY:
Ting Shi said his first two years in the United States were wretched. He slept in a bunk bed in the same room with his grandparents and a cousin in Chinatown, while his parents lived on East 89th Street, near a laundromat where they endured 12-hour shifts. He saw them only on Sundays.
Even after they found an apartment together, his father often talked about taking the family back to China. So, following the advice of friends and relatives from Fuzhou, where he is from, Ting spent more than two years poring over dog-eared test prep books, attending summer and after-school classes, even going over math formulas on the walk home from school.
The afternoon his acceptance letter to Stuyvesant High School arrived in the mail, he and his parents gathered at the laundromat, the smell of detergent and the whirl of the washing machines filling the air. ''Everyone was excited,'' Ting recalled. 
Ting's father said he felt rejuvenated, and now dismissed the idea of returning: ''I thought: the next generation will have a good future,'' he said.
On Saturday, more than 15,000 students are expected to file into classrooms to take a grueling 95-question test for admission to New York City's elite public high schools. (The exam on Sunday, for about 14,000 students, was postponed until Nov. 18 because of Hurricane Sandy.)
No one will be surprised if Asian students, who make up 14 percent of the city's public school students, once again win most of the seats, and if black and Hispanic students win few. Last school year, of the 14,415 students enrolled in the eight specialized high schools that require a test for admissions, 8,549 were Asian.
Because of the disparity, some have begun calling for an end to the policy of using the test as the sole basis of admission to the schools, and last month, civil rights groups filed a complaint with the federal government, contending that the policy discriminated against students, many of whom are black or Hispanic, who cannot afford the score-raising tutoring that other students can. The Shis, like other Asian families who spoke about the exam in interviews in the past month, did not deny engaging in extensive test preparation. To the contrary, they seemed to discuss their efforts with pride.
They also said they were puzzled about having to defend a process they viewed as a vital steppingstone for immigrants. And more than a few saw the criticism of the test as an attack on their cultures, as troubling to them as grumblings about the growing Asian presence in these schools and the prestigious colleges they feed into. ''You know: 'You're Asian, you must be smart,' '' said Jan Michael Vicencio, an immigrant from Manila and a junior at Brooklyn Tech, one of the eight schools that use the test for admission. ''And you're not sure it's a compliment or an insult. We get that a lot.''
Almost universally, the Asian students described themselves on one edge of a deep cultural chasm.
They cited their parents' observance of ancient belief systems like Confucianism, a set of moral principles that emphasizes scholarship and reverence for elders, as well as their rejection of child-rearing philosophies more common in the United States that emphasize confidence and general well-being.
Several students said their parents did not shy away from corporal punishment as a means of motivating them. And they said that rigorous testing was generally an accepted practice in their home countries, with the tests viewed not so much as measures of intelligence, but of industriousness.
''Most of our parents don't believe in 'gifted,' '' said Riyan Iqbal, 15, the son of Bangladeshi immigrants, as he and his friends -- of Bengali, Korean and Indian descent -- meandered toward the subway from the Bronx High School of Science one recent afternoon. ''It's all about hard work.''
No student, they said, was off the hook. Riyan, the son of a taxi driver and a Duane Reade cashier, and his schoolmates said their parents routinely plied them with motivational tales about the trials they endured back home, walking to school barefoot, struggling with hunger, being set back by floods and political unrest. ''You try to make up for their hardships,'' Riyan said.
The summer after sixth grade, Riyan spent most days at a small storefront ''cram school,'' memorizing surface area and volume formulas. In seventh grade, he was back there on Saturday and Sundays, unscrambling paragraphs and plowing through reading passages. The classes cost his parents $200 a month.
''I knew my parents would still love me if I didn't get into Bronx Science,'' he said. ''But they would be very disappointed.''
Jerome Krase, a professor emeritus in sociology at Brooklyn College, and one of the editors of ''Race and Ethnicity in New York City,'' said that a growing number of Asian immigrants in recent years had experienced serious adversity in their home countries. ''The children hold the honor of the family in their hands,'' Professor Krase said. ''If they succeed, the family succeeds.''
Complaints about the test and its effect on the racial makeup of the top schools date back at least to the civil rights era. When school officials began openly discussing changing the admissions policy in the early 1970s, white parents persuaded the State Legislature to pass a law cementing the test as the only basis of admission to the specialized high schools. At the time, according to an article in The New York Times in 1971, Stuyvesant High School was mostly white, 10 percent black, 4 percent Puerto Rican or ''other Spanish surnamed,'' and 6 percent Asian.
This year at Stuyvesant, 72 percent are Asian and less than 4 percent are black or Hispanic.
Melissa Potter, a spokeswoman for the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, one of the groups that filed the complaint with the United States Department of Education in September, said that though some of the city's poorest Asian immigrants had found their way into these schools, many were still being left out, for the same reason that poor blacks and Hispanics were: they do not have access to the grueling, expensive and time-consuming test preparation for the exam. The complaint argued that other factors, like school grades, teacher recommendations and personal experience should also be taken into account.
City education officials, as well as Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, have rejected the idea that the one-test entry system should be rethought. ''You pass the test,'' the mayor said last month, ''you get the highest score, you get into the school -- no matter what your ethnicity, no matter what your economic background is.''
The city began offering a free test-prep program several years ago for black and Hispanic students, but after a legal challenge, other ethnic groups were granted the same access to the course. Today, 43 percent of the students in the program are Asian. Three years ago, Ting Shi was one of them.
The filing of the complaint has led to some uncomfortable discussions about race, aided by the anonymity of the Internet. On the elite schools' alumni Web sites, discussions can veer into ''dangerous territory,'' as one commenter from Brooklyn Tech recently noted during a heated exchange. The discussion included a post about how the N.A.A.C.P. ought to be pushing parents to get ''more involved in their children's education.''
Meanwhile, a parent on a popular education e-mail list referred to the ''Asian-ification'' of the elite schools, and a post on Urban Baby grumbled about ''Asian kids taking all the spots because they prep excessively.''
Criticizing Asians' success on the test is ''like a defense mechanism,'' said Faria Kabir, a sophomore at Brooklyn Tech, who emigrated from Bangladesh when she was 6. ''It's like someone is blaming you for something that isn't actually your fault.''
Beyond issues of race, those who favor a broader admissions policy say the reliance on one test for admission, one that has spawned an industry of tutoring programs, has distorted what it means to be a top student.
Sharon Chambers, the owner of a karate studio in Queens, whose son, Kyle, is was scheduled to take the test on Saturday, said students should be able to demonstrate their abilities in a more well-rounded way, one that might not cost so much. ''A test like this is not a full indicator of a child's potential,'' Ms. Chambers, who is black, said.
Others take issue with the exam on philosophical grounds. ''You shouldn't have to prep Sunday to Sunday, to get into a good high school,'' said Melissa Santana, a legal secretary whose daughter Dejanellie Falette has been prepping this fall for the exam. ''That's extreme.''
But a Bensonhurst resident, Emmie Cheng, who is of Chinese descent but emigrated here as a child from Cambodia, was not sure she agreed.
This fall, her daughter Kassidi has spent every Tuesday afternoon and all of Saturday at the Horizon Program, a tutoring program near her house, reviewing work she has done over the past three years. Kassidi also takes a prep class on Sundays.
Still, Ms. Cheng, a director at a shoe importing company, said guiding her daughter through this process -- which cost her about $2,000 this year alone -- paled in comparison to what she had experienced earlier in her life. Her father and four brothers died of starvation during Cambodia's civil war. And once here, she said, she watched her mother struggle in a garment factory.
''This is the easy part,'' Ms. Cheng said.

HEADLINE: Keeping Cash Just in Case

BYLINE: By ANN CARRNS

 BODY:
Earlier this year, I joked in a post that interest rates were so low on savings accounts that it might make sense to store cash under your mattress -- or at least somewhere safe in your home.
But the recent "denial of service" attacks on big banks in the United States that temporarily blocked some customers from using their online accounts got us at Bucks wondering again: Is having some cash on hand, in case of an extended outage, a good idea? And how much is reasonable?
The attacks, which struck a half-dozen large banks, including Bank of America and Chase, last month and, more recently, additional banks like Capital One, affected the banks' online accounts only. The banks' mobile banking applications and telephone banking systems, as well as their automatic-teller machines, weren't affected. So customers could still get cash from the A.T.M.'s. 
Mark Pipitone, a spokesman for Bank of America, had this to say in an e-mail: "It's important to point out that most of our customers experienced no difficulties on 9/18. Our other channels, including mobile banking, banking centers and A.T.M.'s, were available and unaffected."
Chester Wisniewski, senior security adviser at the electronic security firm Sophos, said the A.T.M. networks that are run by the major banks are less vulnerable to cyberattackers because they are largely private systems that aren't exposed to the Internet. "Is it likely that they could impact those A.T.M. networks? Largely, no," he said.
Some private-label A.T.M.'s, like those in gas stations or convenient stores, might, in theory, be subject to similar, if less high-tech, "denial of service" attacks because they sometimes use telephone lines to reach their networks. So an organized attack could conceivably work by tying up phone lines, just as Internet attacks tie up Web sites by flooding them with traffic and slowing them so much that regular customers can't use them.
So what about hiding some cash at home? I personally don't do it, even though there are now clever gadgets, like fake electrical outlets, that help make hiding places less obvious. I can barely remember to keep cash in my wallet for everyday purchases; never mind hoarding piles of it for some unlikely catastrophe.
But Mr. Wisniewski said that especially since the attacks of 9/11, he is a proponent of having cash on hand, and he often travels with as much as $1,000 in his wallet. He doesn't like to say where he keeps it at his house, for obvious reasons, but he says he wants to have enough available to cover costs like food and transportation for a week or two, if necessary. (He's also a diabetic, so he likes to have two months of his medication on hand, too.) How much you feel safe keeping around is up to you, he said. "It all depends on your personal level of paranoia."
One caveat about keeping it at home, he said, is that "the better you are at hiding it, the more likely you are to forget where it is."
The major banks we contacted dodged the cash-on-hand question. They generally would prefer, after all, that you keep your cash with them.
Wells Fargo and Chase referred me to tips from the Financial Services Roundtable, which largely focused on advice like using antivirus software on your computer and strong online passwords.
Citibank didn't immediately respond to an e-mail seeking comment.
Have the recent denial-of-service attacks caused you to change your banking habits? How so?
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Dow as an Election Indicator

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
WALL STREET does not love Barack Obama, a fact demonstrated by large contributions by bankers to Mitt Romney.
But if all the bankers cared about was stock prices, they might be more sympathetic to the president. The stock market has done better than average during his tenure, not to mention better than during either of the two terms of his predecessor.
In the past, such a healthy stock market performance has usually been followed by a victory for the incumbent party. 
The accompanying chart ranks the 28 presidential terms since 1900 on the performance of the Dow Jones industrial average -- the only major stock index with a history that long -- during each presidential term, and on what happened in the election that followed it. It focuses on the performance over each four-year period beginning at the end of October in each election year, giving each president credit for the performance after investors learn of his election.
By that measure, the Obama term has been well above average, with a compound annual gain through Oct. 24 of nearly 9 percent.
When the Dow has risen more than 5 percent a year, the incumbent party has retained the White House in 11 elections and lost it in only three elections. When the market fell, or rose at a rate slower than 5 percent, the incumbent party has lost the White House in eight of 13 elections.
In 18 of the previous 27 elections, the incumbent president was on the ballot, winning in 13 of the elections. Of the five losers, only George H. W. Bush in 1992 was defeated despite a good stock market performance over his term.
Both he and Taft, who lost to Wilson in 1912, might have prevailed had not third-party candidates -- Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 and Ross Perot in 1992 -- drained votes from the incumbent. Hoover was blamed for the Depression in 1932, and had no chance of winning re-election.
The other two presidents defeated were Gerald Ford in 1976 and Jimmy Carter four years later. Each had presided over a difficult economy and a lagging stock market during a period when the ability of the United States to be competitive internationally was widely questioned. There are echoes of that attitude now, although it is China, rather than Japan, that is deemed to be the principal competitor.
It is not uncommon for Wall Street to campaign aggressively against a president who presided over a rising market. In 1936, Franklin D. Roosevelt was denounced as a socialist, much as Mr. Obama has been this year, by Wall Streeters whose banks had been saved largely by government actions. In 1948, the stock market sold off sharply after Truman scored a stunning upset in his bid for a full term.
As can be seen from the charts, the best stock market sector over the last four years has been consumer discretionary companies -- those that sell things that consumers do not absolutely need. Their success is a testament to how much the economy has recovered. Financial stocks as a group are about where they were when Mr. Obama won in 2008, but some of them remain depressed.
Among the 30 stocks now in the Dow Jones industrial average, Bank of America has been among the worst performers while United Healthcare, a health insurance company, is one of the best performers. While the health insurance bill pushed through Congress by President Obama has been denounced as a government takeover of health care, private insurance companies seem likely to be among the major beneficiaries if it is allowed to go into effect.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: U.S. Presidential Stock Markets: Mitt Romney has forecast that the optimism resulting from his election to the presidency will give a lift to the economy. In keeping with the claim that he will deserve credit for good things that happen after he wins, the following charts measure performance of the Dow Jones industrial average over four-year periods beginning at the end of October in each presidential election year, a few days before the actual election.
In general, voters have tended to throw out the incumbent party after four-year periods when the Dow rose at a compound rate of less than 5 percent a year, and to keep the incumbents if the market gain exceeded that figure. If that pattern continues, Barack Obama will win re-election.

HEADLINE: Citigroup Pays Fine And Fires Star Analyst

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and RANDALL SMITH

 BODY:
9:13 p.m. | Updated
Mark S. Mahaney has been a stock-picking star among a wave of new technology companies, a number-cruncher with Silicon Valley flair.
But his career took a bizarre turn on Friday, as he was swept into a regulatory investigation of Wall Street that stems from Facebook's messy stock debut.
Citigroup fired Mr. Mahaney early Friday morning, after regulators discovered that he answered a reporter's e-mail without the bank's blessing. When confronted by the bank about the brief exchange, which was unrelated to Facebook, he covered up his mistake.
The revelations emerged from a broader inquiry into Wall Street's role in Facebook's initial public offering. The Securities and Exchange Commission and the Massachusetts secretary of the commonwealth, William F. Galvin, have subpoenaed Citigroup and others like Morgan Stanley over the $16 billion offering. The authorities are examining whether bank analysts violated a cornerstone of the securities industry when they shared research about Facebook with a limited group of clients and journalists. 
In some ways, the investigations echo the crackdown more than a decade ago on the practices of analysts who covered dot-com companies.
"This is an especially sensitive area due to the research scandals of the Internet bubble and the fact that the Facebook I.P.O. was so visible," said Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida.
Yet regulators did not accuse Mr. Mahaney of improperly leaking information about Facebook. (His disclosure was about YouTube's earnings.) Still, a junior Citigroup analyst does face such claims. In a civil order released on Friday, Mr. Galvin accused the unnamed analyst of sharing nonpublic information about Facebook to TechCrunch, a blog focused on the technology world. Citigroup, which fired the junior analyst in September, paid a $2 million fine on Friday to settle the accusations.
"This penalty should serve as a warning to the industry as a whole," Mr. Galvin said. "If we're going to have a level playing field, you can't selectively give out information."
Favoritism and selective disclosures were among the abuses uncovered by regulators after the Internet bubble burst in 2000. Investigations, often citing internal e-mails, found that analysts hyped the stocks of companies that did business with their banks while investors lost millions and millions of dollars. In some cases, analysts privately sneered at stocks they were publicly praising. In one e-mail, an analyst labeled a security a "piece of junk."
The scandal led to a landmark 2003 settlement with several banks, including Citigroup. The case, led by a former New York attorney general, Eliot Spitzer, built a Chinese wall between Wall Street research analysts and investment bankers. Under the court settlement, analysts were barred from communicating with bankers unless accompanied by a compliance officer, an effort to curb bankers from influencing research.
Among other practices widely adopted on Wall Street a decade ago, analysts had to obtain in-house permission before commenting publicly to news media about companies they covered. Some Wall Street firms also prevent analysts from expressing a viewpoint on companies unless the information is published in a report.
These procedures, regulators say, tripped up Mr. Mahaney.
Mr. Galvin's order took aim at the longtime analyst for discussing YouTube's earnings with a reporter from a French magazine, Capital, without Citigroup's permission. The reporter approached Mr. Mahaney in April seeking projections about YouTube's revenue and earnings growth, some of which Citigroup had not yet published. Mr. Mahaney sent a terse e-mail reply that answered the essence of the reporter's questions.
But when a bank spokeswoman followed up to remind Mr. Mahaney about seeking approval beforehand, he denied ever e-mailing the reporter. "I won't respond," he said, according to the order.
The reporter later informed Citigroup that Mr. Mahaney did in fact respond. According to Mr. Galvin's order, the analyst then asked bank employees to fudge the timing of the interview, an apparent effort to avoid blame for not seeking approval.
When told that the accurate time was already submitted, he replied in an e-mail cited in the order: "This could get me into trouble. Shoot."
Mr. Mahaney, 46, who was based in the bank's San Francisco office, declined to comment.
In a statement, a Citigroup spokeswoman said the bank was "pleased to have this matter resolved," adding that "we take our internal policies and procedures very seriously and have taken the appropriate actions."
After firing the junior analyst in late September, and moving toward a settlement with Mr. Galvin in recent days, Citigroup summoned Mr. Mahaney to New York on Wednesday, people briefed on the matter said. Lawyers outlined their concerns about his behavior, but they sent him back to the West Coast without deciding his fate.
However, after striking the settlement with Mr. Galvin on Thursday, the bank decided to dismiss Mr. Mahaney. Some Citigroup officials said at issue was the cover-up rather than speaking to the news media without permission, which is fairly common on Wall Street. Mr. Mahaney learned of the decision around 5 a.m. Friday, the people said.
In dismissing Mr. Mahaney, the bank lost a marquee analyst who covered the recent run of technology stock offerings. He came to Citigroup in 2005 after stints in government at the State Department and on Wall Street at Morgan Stanley and the Galleon Group, the hedge fund that was toppled by insider trading accusations. (Mr. Mahaney was not implicated in that case.)
A regular on the business TV circuit, he was named the No. 1 Internet analyst for five consecutive years in an influential poll by Institutional Investor magazine. His presence helped Citi win a few Internet I.P.O. assignments in 2011, including Zillow and Active Network, according to top executives at those companies.
In Silicon Valley, Mr. Mahaney also became known for regular meetings of money managers and venture capitalists called "the Rally in the Valley" at a restaurant in Redwood City. Among his best calls was a recommendation of Priceline.com in 2008 before it tripled and an upgrade of Amazon in 2009 before its stock price more than doubled.
Mr. Mahaney, who took home about $3 million in 2011, covered 31 companies over the last 12 months as a Citigroup analyst, according to Bloomberg data.
The bank said Friday that it would abandon some of the companies he covered and transfer others to another analyst.
Despite the focus on Mr. Mahaney, the main legal violations stemmed from the disclosure of Facebook information.
In May, the unnamed junior Citigroup analyst e-mailed two TechCrunch employees to say "I am ramping up coverage of FB and thought you guys might like to see how the street is thinking about it (and our estimates)."
He attached a "Facebook one-pager," which featured an array of confidential information, including Mr. Mahaney's revenue estimates meant as an internal guide for the bank's analysts. The leak, which came before the company's public shares started trading in May, also included Citigroup's private projections for the company's "Investment Risks" and "Investment Positives."
A TechCrunch employee sought to post the document on the Web, but the junior analyst balked.
"My boss would eat me alive," he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Art That Irked Energy Executives Is Gone, but Wyoming Dispute Whirls On

BYLINE: By DAN FROSCH

 BODY:
LARAMIE, Wyo. -- The idea behind the sculpture that appeared on the University of Wyoming campus about 16 months ago was simple but provocative: a swirl of dead wood and lumps of coal, intended to show the link between global warming and the pine beetle infestation that has ravaged forests across the Rockies.
But in a place like Wyoming, where the oil, gas and mining industries are the soul of the economy, some view such symbolism as a declaration of war. 
And ever since the British artist Chris Drury installed the 36-foot-diameter sculpture, called ''Carbon Sink,'' the university has been embroiled in a bitter controversy, which eventually led to the quiet removal of the artwork last spring after energy officials and their political allies complained to administrators.
The dispute over the sculpture -- part of a series of campus installations commissioned by the university's art museum -- has continued to dog the university after it released e-mails discussing the artwork.
The e-mails, first obtained by Wyoming Public Radio, showed that the university's president, Tom Buchanan, privately asked that the sculpture be dismantled a year ahead of schedule because of the uproar surrounding it.
In a note on April 13 to the director of the university's art museum, Dr. Buchanan wrote that it would be best to remove the sculpture, ''given the controversy that it has generated.''
His note followed objections raised by local lawmakers and officials in Wyoming's energy industry, which helps support the university through state taxes and felt betrayed.
What is this? Marion Loomis, the executive director of the Wyoming Mining Association, said to a university official in an e-mail, using a mild profanity for emphasis. ''I am all for freedom of expression, but putting a permanent piece blasting the coal industry while taking millions in royalties, A.M.L. fees and severance taxes strikes me as a stab in the back.'' A.M.L., short for abandoned mine lands, refers to a reclamation fee.
In another e-mail, to Dr. Buchanan, State Representative Thomas E. Lubnau II threatened to introduce legislation that would ensure that ''no fossil-fuel-derived tax dollars find their way in the University of Wyoming funding stream.''
Mr. Lubnau, a Republican from energy-rich Campbell County, said he subsequently told the university that he was not serious about cutting financing, and emphasized that he never called for the sculpture's removal.
''I don't think the university planned for the consequences of its actions very well,'' he said. ''But I have never commented publicly on the artist or the merit of the art. I've always maintained that tensions in ideas make us stronger.''
Mr. Lubnau added, ''I'm not afraid of any idea.''
Mr. Loomis, of the mining association, said that the group was not trying to tell the university what art to display, but that it had a right to complain about something it deemed offensive.
''We felt like it was a slap,'' he said. ''So we reacted. We may have overreacted. We're over it.''
But if the controversy is finished for the energy industry, it is not for the university.
E-mails show that one university official told an alumnus that the sculpture was removed early from its perch on an expanse of grass because of water damage -- an irrigation line had broken in the area.
An editorial on Monday in The Casper Star-Tribune criticized the university for misleading the public over the reason the artwork was taken down.
Dr. Buchanan declined to comment on the matter. Chris Boswell, a vice president at the university, said that the explanation given to the alumnus was a mistake, and that no official reason had ever been released.
Mr. Boswell also pointed out that the sculpture remained intact for nearly a year -- evidence, he said, that the university had not acquiesced to pressure.
''There are scholarly efforts, research efforts that occur on campus which I'm sure industry is not thrilled about, but occur on a daily basis,'' he said. ''At the same time, the university is very well dialed into the industries of this state.''
''Any institution is smart to be mindful of controversy,'' Mr. Boswell added. ''Does that translate into the muddling of opinions? No, I don't believe so.''
Amid the fallout from the controversy, lawmakers passed a measure that requires artwork for a newly renovated campus recreation center to reflect Wyoming's history of transportation, agriculture and minerals.
The measure also gives Gov. Matt Mead, along with the university's Energy Resources Council -- composed primarily of energy industry representatives -- final say on the art selected.
Mr. Mead, a Republican, said at a recent news conference that he did not feel it was appropriate for him to review the art.
Jeff Lockwood, a professor of natural sciences and humanities who has been outspoken in his frustration over the university's handling of the sculpture, said outrage had grown among students and faculty members.
''I'm disappointed that the university caved in to that sort of extortion and that sort of implied threat,'' Dr. Lockwood said. ''And I'm angry that this sort of behavior on the part of private industry, as well as their effectiveness in lobbying our elected officials, would lead to an act of artistic censorship on a university campus.''

HEADLINE: Rise in Household Debt Might Be Sign of a Strengthening Recovery

BYLINE: By ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- For the first time since the Great Recession hit, American households are taking on more debt than they are shedding, an epochal shift that might augur a more resilient recovery.
For two of the last three quarters, American households' total outstanding borrowing on things like credit cards, mortgages and auto loans has increased after falling for 14 consecutive quarters before then. Some economists even see an end to the long, hard process of deleveraging -- as they refer to the cutting of debt relative to income or the nation's economic output. That process, they say, has been a central reason for the extraordinary sluggishness of the recovery.
''We're at an inflection point,'' said Kevin Logan, the chief United States economist for HSBC. ''Debt is less of a burden'' for households, he said. 
Closely watched economic figures released Friday underscore households' nascent sense of strength. Despite tepid growth and still-high unemployment, consumer confidence has soared to a five-year high, according to a survey by Thomson Reuters and the University of Michigan. And economic growth numbers for the third quarter showed household spending picking up pace as well.
The drop in overall debt is in no small part because of foreclosures, delinquencies and write-offs by lenders which are slowing but not stopping. But the struggle to pay down old debts might not prove such a drag on economic growth in the future.
''We're not getting a tail wind. We're losing a head wind,'' said Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, who said of the deleveraging process for households and businesses, ''It's basically over.''
Experts estimated that the overall level of debt, compared with income or economic output, would continue to fall for the next one to three years -- with the earliest prediction for the end of deleveraging coming in mid-2013 and the latest at the end of 2015.
''By just about any metric, we've made a huge dent in a significant problem, but I don't think we're finished yet,'' said Liz Ann Sonders, the chief investment strategist for Charles Schwab & Company. ''The distinction is that deleveraging will no longer be a big drag on the economy, like in the first couple years after the crisis.''
In the run-up to the recession, American households took on trillions of dollars of debt that they could not easily afford, given tepid rates of wage growth. The collapse of the real-estate bubble and ravages of the recession have forced them to pay down or prompted lenders to write off more than $1 trillion of it, according to Federal Reserve data.
Still saddled with heavy debt burdens during the weak recovery, millions of American households cut back spending on food, cars and other goods. On top of that, relatively few families have been willing or able to take out loans or lines of credit. Thus, the proportion of household debt to personal income has fallen to its lowest level since the mid-2000s from its recessionary-era peak.
Now, with the economy more stable and interest rates at generational lows, Americans might finally feel more comfortable taking out a loan on a new car or putting money down on a mortgaged home. With their finances more in balance, workers might start spending less of their paychecks paying off old loans and more on leisure or household goods.
Given the importance of consumer spending to the American economy, those changes might translate into a more resilient economy, analysts said.
''Consumer spending still drives 65 to 70 percent of G.D.P. growth,'' Susan Lund, the director of research at the McKinsey Global Institute, said. ''When deleveraging is over and housing picks up a bit, those two factors are going to be strong engines for the United States economy.''
American households' biggest debt burden is in mortgages, given that a home is far and away the largest purchase the average family ever makes. As the foreclosure crisis grinds on, the total amount of outstanding mortgage debt continues to fall, Federal Reserve data shows, though more slowly than earlier in the recession.
A broader turnaround in the housing market, which seems to be in its early stages, might be helping to buoy consumers' confidence, economists said, as the combination of low interest rates, thawing credit conditions and an aggressive effort by the Federal Reserve has helped to put a floor under falling home prices.
''The Fed is redoubling its efforts to ease financial conditions right when the economy is getting into a better position, a position where it's more likely to respond to that easing of financial conditions,'' Paul Sheard, chief global economist at Standard & Poor's, said. ''Those two things are dovetailing'' and will help households in the future, he said.
Other parts of the household debt and spending picture are looking brighter as well, economists said. A September report by Equifax, a consumer credit reporting agency, showed that the total value of auto lending jumped nearly 14 percent year over last year, with sales of new cars and light trucks climbing sharply. In the first half of 2012, Americans took out more car loans than they had since 2007, before the financial crisis hit.
The trends look likely to continue, Equifax said. ''The average age of cars on the road today in the U.S. is the highest ever recorded and consumers are ready to replace these older vehicles,'' Amy Crews Cutts, Equifax's chief economist, said in a statement. ''The financial picture has improved sufficiently that we are seeing auto lending markets become facilitators rather than obstacles.''
Americans have also improved their personal balance sheets by slashing their outstanding credit card debt to $855 billion today from more than $1 trillion in 2008, according to Federal Reserve data. But student debt has continued its inexorable march higher, a ''worrisome'' trend that economists say could stop young workers from starting new households or could eat into their spending on other goods and services.
How Americans feel about debt and credit in after the recession might determine how much debt they ultimately shed, Ms. Lund of McKinsey said. ''The Great Depression scarred an entire generation,'' affecting how households borrowed and spent for decades, she said. ''We don't yet know whether consumer behavior has been fundamentally changed by this crisis or not.''

HEADLINE: Consumers Push Economic Output To a Gain of 2%

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
More optimistic consumers are propelling the economy forward, even as businesses pull back.
The pickup in spending by consumers, along with a burst of defense orders and a stronger housing market, helped the economy expand at an annual rate of 2 percent in the third quarter, a slightly better pace than had been anticipated, according to government data released Friday. In the previous quarter, economic growth had dipped to a rate of just 1.3 percent.
While growing more confident that the housing market has stabilized, households have been buoyed by lower energy prices, until recently a rising stock market and a slight improvement in employment. After years of shedding debt, there are also signs that consumers are starting to borrow again. 
''Consumers are feeling wealthier so they are still out there spending,'' said Joshua Dennerlein, an economist with Bank of America Merrill Lynch.
Still, the pace of economic activity is short of what's needed to substantially reduce the unemployment rate, now at 7.8 percent and also well below the level of growth typical in this stage of a recovery after a sharp downturn.
What's more, fears are growing that the economy could slow again in the fourth quarter. Companies are preparing for the possibility of steep tax increases and sharp spending cuts if Congress cannot agree on a deal to reduce the deficit after the election, a combination of factors frequently referred to as the fiscal cliff.
In fact, a series of disappointing earnings reports from the nation's biggest companies this week, along with a handful of layoff announcements from corporate bellwethers, suggest businesses have already begun to retrench.
With the presidential campaign entering the final, desperate dash to Election Day, there was plenty of fodder in Friday's report for both candidates to cite as they spar over the direction of the economy.
For President Obama, the best news was that consumer spending grew at an annual rate of 2 percent last quarter, up from 1.5 percent in the second quarter, while residential investment increased at an annual rate of 14.4 percent, compared with 8.5 percent in the second quarter.
The business snapshot was much dimmer. The report showed that business investment fell 1.3 percent, a reversal from the 3.6 percent increase recorded in the second quarter, and a sign businesses are indeed clamping down on spending ahead of the fiscal cliff.
Inventories also were a notable factor with the summer drought in the Midwest shaving overall growth 0.4 percentage point as farm inventories dropped.
In addition to the uncertainty about government policy, corporate performance has been hurt by a recession in parts of Europe and weaker demand from China. Some economists fear that all these factors will keep a lid on growth in the final quarter of 2012 and the first quarter of next year.
The Commerce Department data showed exports decreased by 1.6 percent in the latest quarter, compared with a 5.3 percent increase in the second quarter. It was the first time exports had fallen since the first quarter of 2009, when the global economy was reeling from the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the ensuing financial crisis in the United States.
At a campaign appearance in Iowa, Mitt Romney, the Republican presidential candidate, termed Friday's report ''discouraging,'' adding, ''slow economic growth means slow job growth and declining take-home pay.''
The new figure, released by the Commerce Department, is the government's first estimate of growth in the third quarter. Slightly better than the 1.8 percent increase economists had been forecasting, it showed the nation rebounding to the growth it had in the first quarter of the year after a spring slump.
''The report highlights the fact that businesses have already begun to react to the looming fiscal cliff while consumers march steadily ahead,'' said Mr. Dennerlein. Noting the jump in residential spending, he added that the slowly recovering housing sector is a bright spot.
Housing values and stock values certainly contribute to consumers' sense of financial well-being. And despite the hesitancy among businesses, optimism among consumers continues to rise. A separate survey released Friday showed consumer sentiment at its highest level in more than five years, with the Thomson Reuters/University of Michigan index rising to 82.6 in October from 78.3 in September, though it was lower than a preliminary October reading of 83.1 that had been previously reported.
To be sure, the latest growth in consumer spending was still well below the rate of increase in the first half of the last decade, when easy credit and a boom in home prices fueled growth in the 3 percent range.
But it was a crucial antidote to gloom pervading the business sector, experts said. ''We'd really be in trouble if consumer attitudes were deteriorating like business attitudes,'' said Nigel Gault, chief United States economist for IHS Global Insight.
Mr. Gault warned, however, that the outlook among consumers could erode if political leaders in Washington cannot break the deadlock over tax and budget policy. ''Consumers are not so forward-looking as businesses,'' Mr. Gault said. ''So there are two ways this can go. Either we clear up the uncertainty, or consumers start focusing on the fiscal cliff and we see consumer spending hurt as well.''
In recent days, government data and a steady drumbeat of disappointing earnings reports from corporate bellwethers have underscored the threat to the job market posed by softness in sectors more dependent on exports, like manufacturing and chemicals.
Dow Chemical and DuPont announced job cuts earlier in the week, and that list grew Friday with Newell Rubbermaid, which makes commercial and consumer products like Calphalon and Paper Mate pens, announcing plans to cut more than 1,900 workers, or just over 10 percent of its work force. And Rockwell Collins, an aviation and defense giant, said it was considering eliminating up to 1,250 positions, equivalent to roughly 6 percent of its employees.
The latest data suggest a tug-of-war between countervailing economic forces that could shift at any time. For example, growth last quarter was unexpectedly bolstered by a 13 percent jump in military spending that few economists expect to be repeated in the fourth quarter.
Without the increase from military spending, the economy would have grown at an annual rate of 1.4 percent, said Steve Blitz, chief economist at ITG Investment Research.
''Going forward, consumers might be able to continue at the current pace of spending but they're not going to be able to drive the growth rate higher,'' said Mr. Blitz. ''And 2 percent isn't enough to get unemployment down.''

HEADLINE: In Oslo's Tjuvholmen Neighborhood, Art Is a Feather in Its Cap

BYLINE: By GINANNE BROWNELL

 BODY:
The Oslo neighborhood of Tjuvholmen is a noisy place these days. Construction trucks rumble past large moving vans while sparks fly from welders soldering metal onto several skeletal structures soon to be loft apartments, office buildings and cafes.
Situated on a peninsula that sticks out into the Oslofjord, Tjuvholmen was historically a shipyard, and while there are still parts that are littered with shipping crates and large boats, the area has been transformed by a multimillion-dollar urban renewal investment.
The openings of art galleries like Peder Lund, Galleri Riis and Stolper and Friends (one of the partners is the A-ha guitarist and artist Magne Furuholmen), have helped the neighborhood gain the reputation of being a ''small Chelsea,'' said Gunnar B. Kvaran, director of the Astrup Fearnley Museum of Modern Art.
But the real feather in Tjuvholmen's cap was the opening on Sept. 29 of the Astrup Fearnley -- as it is known on the Oslo contemporary art scene -- designed by Renzo Piano. The private museum had existed in another locale in central Oslo since 1993, financed by foundations set up by descendants of the Fearnley shipping family. 
The museum has focused much of its collection on international and American contemporary art. This new location is four times the size of the old site and cost £70 million to build, about $110 million. Despite its modern look -- it is made of wood and curved glass that covers two buildings separated by a small canal -- it fits in the surroundings.
''The growing consensus is that this building is quite an achievement that works well with the nature and as part of the fjord,'' Mr. Kvaran said. ''This museum now becomes our identity. We now have the possibility to expose the collection, giving us a totally new profile in the city and in the art life of Oslo.''
Contemporary art in Oslo is thriving. Norway's economy is booming -- its rich North Sea oil reserves have helped isolate it from the global recession -- and several of its largest companies have been investing in contemporary art collections. Some are focused mainly on Norwegian contemporary art while others also are buying up some of the big names on the international art scene.
Several of the city's most important art institutions, meanwhile -- the Munch Museum, the Stenersen Museum, the Henie Onstad Art Center (HOK) and the Astrup Fearnley -- were private collections that have been opened to the public.
Considering that Oslo has a population of less than 600,000 people means that per capita a significant chunk of the city's modern and contemporary art holdings came through donations by philanthropists and company collections.
''There has been a tradition for donating and giving large collections to the public,'' said Oystein Ustvedt, an art historian and author of ''New Norwegian Art Since 1990.'' ''I think it has to do with this building up of national identity. Norway for so long was very poor so it was important for a few rich people to build up a collection of art.''
That idea of building up a national identity through culture -- Norway only became a nation in 1905 -- has played an integral role in Oslo over the past century. Edvard Munch (1863-1944) bequeathed 25,000 of his works to the city when he died, though the Munch Museum did not open until 1963. His friend Rolf E. Stenersen, a stockbroker and art collector, donated a large part of his collection, which consisted of more than 400 prints by Munch and work by such artists as Reidar Aulie, Erling Enger and Sigurd Winge.
The Stenersen Museum -- though housed separately, it is part of the Munch Museum -- opened in 1994 in a small space in central Oslo. The museum is home to the philanthropist's collection and puts on several exhibitions a year. The current show, ''The Storytellers: Narratives in Contemporary Art,'' includes works by Tracey Snelling, Georges Adeagbo and Eder Santos and is on until Nov. 4.
While HOK has no plans to move from its location in suburban Oslo, the center's new director, Tone Hansen, wants to update the building, which opened in 1968 to exhibit the modern and contemporary art collection of the Olympic figure skater and actress Sonja Henie and her husband, the art collector Niels Onstad.
''We want to take the building back to its former glory,'' Ms. Hansen said. ''It has a certain 'Mad Men' style to it, so we have to work with the architecture, not against it. I want to bring life back, to make it breathe again.''
The center, which has a collection of pieces from the Fluxus and CoBrA movements, has built up a strong multi-disciplinary platform with music and performance archives, including pieces by John Cage and Laurie Anderson, that Ms. Hansen plans to integrate into the center's exhibitions. For example, the HOK show that opens on Oct. 28, ''I Want the Beatles to Play at My Art Center,'' will focus on documentation of dance, theater and music produced at the center in the past four decades.
''Very early on, instead of acquiring new works, they started commissioning works from composers and artists,'' Ms. Hansen said. ''So we are thinking now that documentation should be looked upon as part of the collection, not just for the archives.''
Many companies here have made collecting part of their corporate code. ''I think it is unique,'' said Peder Lund, who, while running his contemporary art gallery in Tjuvholmen, advises companies on their collections. ''The first company was Norsk Hydro, which started collecting in 1905 just as the company formed. They were always extremely generous with their collection, loaning to several museums. So I think other key Norwegian companies saw that this endeavor was one that was appreciated.''
The technology company Telenor has been collecting contemporary art since moving its headquarters to Fornebu on Rolfsbukta Bay in 1998. The company has amassed a significant photographic collection and has several integrated art pieces, including 90 columns scattered across the large front courtyard done by Daniel Buren.
There is also a striking LED display by Jenny Holzer that scrolls across the top of one of the buildings. At first glance the display looks like stock market numbers or news headlines, but it is actually a series of short texts.
Nordea, a bank that set up a committee to collect art in 1999, has decorated its Oslo offices with several contemporary pieces and has a small exhibition space in the lobby that is open to the public during the week. In 2007, the company organized an exhibition titled ''Clusters'' to present a portion of the collection to the public.
''We want to show that we are a modern institution,'' said Sigurd Carlsen, who looks after Nordea's collection. ''When you come into this bank you want to visually meet a company that is up to date, that follows the here and now rather than a bank with heavy oak furniture and an oil painting of the old C.E.O.''

HEADLINE: Weak Earnings Hold the Markets Back

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks finished flat on Friday, recovering from moderate declines as bargain hunters rushed in to buy Apple stock, lifting it off its lows, and acquire other stocks battered recently by disappointing results. 
For the week, though, stocks slid after a series of weak results, especially from multinational companies.
The stock of Apple, the world's largest publicly traded company, pulled up sharply from its session low, although it still ended down 0.9 percent at $604. The company surprised analysts late Thursday with a weak margin outlook, as well as with quarterly earnings and iPad sales figures that fell short of forecasts. The stock fell as low as $591 in Friday's session.
The PHLX semiconductor index rose 0.5 percent as a number of companies bounced back from losses last week, including Intel, the dominant chip maker. Intel had reported net earnings and revenue that missed estimates, but in Friday's session, its stock gained 1.2 percent to close at $21.95.
''As people chose to buy the dips in Apple, I think that gave people a little bit more conviction to buy other names,'' said Michael James, senior trader at Wedbush Morgan in Los Angeles.
''You've also had a continued theme of buying semiconductor stocks after disappointing earnings. That's frustrating those that are short and has led to continued covering.''
Investors had a muted reaction to data showing a 2 percent increase in gross domestic product for the third quarter, which was slightly better than expected. The report confirmed analysts' views that the economic recovery will be slow.
The Dow Jones industrial average edged up 3.53 points, or 0.03 percent, to close at 13,107.21. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index dipped 1.03 points, or 0.07 percent, to finish at 1,411.94. The Nasdaq composite index gained 1.83 points, or 0.06 percent, to end at 2,987.95.
For the week, the Dow fell 1.8 percent, the S.&P. 500 lost 1.5 percent and the Nasdaq dropped 0.6 percent.
Lighter revenues have been a concern this earnings season. Just 36.9 percent of S.&P. 500 companies so far have reported revenue that beat forecasts, compared with the 62 percent that typically exceed expectations, according to Thomson Reuters data. Earnings have fared better, with 62.5 percent above expectations.
Adding to uncertainty was the presidential election on Nov. 6 -- a little over a week away.
Amazon escaped the market's malaise, climbing 6.9 percent to $238.24, as analysts said the online retailer's spending would hurt margins but increase profit in the long run.
Interest rates were lower. The Treasury's benchmark 10-year note rose 23/32, to 98 29/32, and the yield fell to 1.75 percent from 1.81 percent late Thursday.
Among other stocks that finished Friday's session with a gain, the diversified manufacturer Honeywell International edged up 0.1 percent to $61.49. Honeywell said on Friday that it would raise its quarterly dividend by 10 percent to 41 cents a share, starting with the fourth-quarter dividend payment on Dec. 10.

HEADLINE: Nation's Sweet Tooth Shrinks

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
It was repeated so often it was accepted as true: the typical American consumed 95 to 100 pounds of sugar each year. Health experts said that consumption was surely contributing to a nationwide crisis of obesity.
But in a move that has largely gone unnoticed, the Agriculture Department, keeper of the statistics on America's sweet tooth, has employed new methodology that overnight shaved 20 pounds off its estimate and brought the number down to a precise 76.7 pounds. The decision raises questions about the entire notion of per-capita consumption just as the battles over sugar and sweeteners reach a peak.
''There's such an implication of precision and accuracy in that decimal point -- boy, we've got this nailed now,'' said Michael F. Jacobson, executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ''But when you take a good look, it's built on a foundation of sand.''
Jean C. Buzby, the agricultural economist who headed the department's team responsible for the data that led to the revision in sugar consumption, agreed that it was far from perfect but said it was better than what was used in the past. 
She pointed to the note on each page of the government's data that labeled them ''first estimates'' that ''are intended to serve as a starting point for additional research and discussion.''
Few people are aware of the change, which quietly occurred two months ago. Dr. Jacobson stumbled across it recently while working on a project on sugar consumption. He takes issue with the new methodology and contends it could be a setback in the push for healthy eating. Suggestions that sugar consumption is down, or dropping, could take some pressure off companies that make sugary foods, for example.
In e-mails the center obtained through a Freedom of Information request, officials at sugar industry trade groups discussed the benefits of the lower estimate and how they might persuade the U.S.D.A. to make a change that would reduce it even more.
''We perceive it to be in our interest to see as low a per-capita sweetener consumption estimate as possible,'' Jack Roney, director of economics and policy analysis at the American Sugar Alliance, wrote in an e-mail on March 30, 2011.
Mr. Roney said in a telephone interview that he was pleased to have ''more accurate'' information about sugar consumption available. ''The extent to which caloric sweeteners are in the public's eye as a possible source or cause of increasing obesity in this country is huge,'' he said. ''If folks are assuming there is much greater consumption than there really is, then we are misleading the public unnecessarily.''
Estimating sugar consumption is a tricky proposition, fraught with potential for misjudgments. It is based loosely on an educated guess at how much of various sweetener-laden foods that consumers buy is actually eaten, versus how much is thrown away. ''It is difficult to obtain nationally representative estimates of consumer-level food loss,'' Dr. Buzby wrote in an e-mail.
There had long been a sense that the estimates the department was using failed to capture all of the loss that was occurring, Dr. Buzby said. Five years ago, just as debate over sugar use was heating up, the U.S.D.A. began an overhaul of what it called ''consumer-level food-loss estimates.'' It hired RTI International, a nonprofit consulting firm, to help it come up with new loss estimates more firmly anchored in data.
Mary K. Muth, director of food and nutrition policy research at RTI, said she had used data from the Nielsen Company's Homescan surveys of consumer food purchases and interviews done for the Centers for Disease Control's National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey to come up with the new loss estimates for sugar and sweeteners.
''It's an improvement over how it was done before but an incremental one, and surely more work can be done,'' Dr. Muth said.
In all, RTI's revisions called for higher loss estimates for 84 foods and lower losses of 54, while leaving a handful unchanged.
In some cases, the change in loss estimates was drastic. RTI estimated, for example that 69 percent of fresh pumpkins are lost at the consumer level compared with the old estimate of 20 percent.
A report on the changes written by Dr. Muth, Dr. Buzby and others concluded more pumpkins were being used for decorations and subsequently discarded.
Conversely, RTI estimated that 15 percent of meat and poultry is lost today because so many of those products are sold boneless, trimmed lean and stored in conditions that preserve them longer. The previous estimate was 40 percent.
The firm's new estimated loss for cane and beet sugar is 34 percent, compared with the old estimate of 20 percent -- although Dr. Muth and Dr. Buzby said it was improper to make such comparisons because of changes in methodology.
The new estimate includes the amount of sugar consumers reported in the C.D.C.'s survey that they had eaten, by, say, stirring it into coffee or sprinkling it on oatmeal and experts' estimates of how much sugar was used in food products -- and subsequently discarded.
''The new estimate is still relying heavily on experts making what seem to me to be largely guesses,'' Dr. Jacobson said. ''Other than the 4 percent they're getting'' from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, ''what do they really know for certain?''
The experts themselves have trouble remembering what they suggested. Park Wilde, associate professor at the Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy at Tufts University, served on the RTI panel, which met in 2008. He said by e-mail that he recalled little of what happened; too much time had passed. ''I can't recall ever estimating or offering an expert opinion on loss rates for sweetener categories,'' Dr. Wilde wrote.
Similarly, Helen H. Jensen, a professor of economics at Iowa State University, said her memory of the panel's discussions was dim. She said she did not recall whether the panel had addressed estimates of sugar and sweetener use.
''I don't remember that we (as the external group) addressed the sugar/sweetener estimates separately on that project,'' she wrote in an e-mail. ''It is a difficult sector to track. There are a lot of sweeteners that go into baked goods and pastries,'' for example, that are thrown out as stale, discarded from food service, etc.).''
Dr. Muth and Dr. Buzby said they had hoped more people would offer suggestions on the report, which was open for comment from January to April 2011. ''We were relying on archaeological methods, which are pretty challenging,'' Dr. Muth said. ''I wish there had been more feedback because that perhaps would have given us some ideas about how to make improvements.''
Although the report was viewed more than a thousand times, only two comments came in, Dr. Buzby said. One pointed out a misplaced decimal point -- ''We corrected this,'' Dr. Buzby wrote -- and the other comment was from ''some people in the sugar industry.''
The industry wanted to see the loss estimates increased for high fructose corn syrup, glucose and dextrose, which are sweeteners used in processed foods. ''If they surrender to our reasoning,'' Mr. Roney wrote, it was possible high fructose corn syrup consumption estimates ''could dip and the total sweeteners estimate would drop even further.''
The sugar industry argued that the loss estimates for high fructose corn syrup, glucose and dextrose should match those of sugar since they are used in much the same way as an ingredient. The U.S.D.A. agreed with that, the industry's reasoning, Dr. Buzby wrote.
The effect was to increase the amount of sweeteners lost, further reducing the amount eaten, from 88 pounds to 76.7 pounds, according to Mr. Roney's e-mail.
''I don't disagree that high fructose corn syrup and the rest shouldn't be looked at the same way as conventional sugar,'' Dr. Jacobson said. ''My objection is more fundamental -- that they are just picking numbers, 20 percent, 17 percent, 34 percent, and giving them an authority that they don't really have.''

HEADLINE: Following in a Father's Footsteps, But Probably Not Into Politics

BYLINE: By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG and ASHLEY PARKER

 BODY:
CAMBRIDGE, Ohio -- When Tagg Romney, the eldest of Mitt and Ann Romney's five sons, was a newly married student at Brigham Young University, he and his wife lived in a tiny basement apartment -- the same one where his newlywed parents lived two decades earlier, when he was an infant.
When Mr. Romney went on a Mormon mission, he wound up in France, just as his father had. When he decided to go to business school, he settled on Harvard, same as his dad. When he and his wife, Jennifer, bought a house, they picked one in Belmont, Mass., down the street from his parents.
And when Tagg Romney went into business on his own -- with his father's finance chairman as a partner and $10 million in seed money from his family -- he entered the same field, private equity, that made Mitt Romney a very wealthy man. 
In the tight-knit Romney clan, values and life choices are passed from generation to generation the way some families pass down heirloom silver. Yet the younger Mr. Romney, 42, insists he is not reliving his father's life.
After raising money and working as a surrogate for his father, he says he has no interest in working in a Romney administration -- ''I will be running my business from Boston'' -- and no intention of carrying on the political tradition that began with his grandfather, George. His wife, Jennifer, has little appetite for politics, and even relatives say Tagg is not the most natural politician in the family. (That distinction goes to Josh, the middle son.)
''I don't want to say I'd absolutely never run,'' Mr. Romney said in an interview during a campaign trip last week in Ohio, ''but I'd be really surprised if I did. It's a really horrible process, and honestly I just don't want to go through it, and I don't want to put my family through it.''
For now, though, he is all in, on the road six days out of seven, selling Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee, to the American public. ''It means a lot to him, more than anything else, what people think about his father, do they know he's a man of character and integrity,'' said one friend, Kirk Jowers. ''Tagg will do anything his father needs and anything he thinks will advance or protect his dad.''
Here in the small city of Cambridge, several dozen Romney supporters were gathered in front of the local Republican headquarters, where a sign in the window proclaimed ''Coal Country for Romney.'' The campaign bus pulled up, and the younger Mr. Romney emerged with the local Congressional candidate in an effort to encourage early voting in this critical swing state.
''He'll make a great president for two reasons,'' Mr. Romney told the crowd, speaking of his father. ''The first is, he's really good at what he does, he's smart, he knows how to get things done.'' And second, Tagg Romney said, is that Mitt Romney is ''a really good man.''
Like another son of a presidential candidate (think George W. Bush) the younger Mr. Romney occupies a unique niche in Romneyland. After working in 2002 as the campaign manager for Kerry Healey, his father's lieutenant governor pick, and in 2007 and 2008 as a full-time campaign aide for his father, he has the trust of campaign advisers and the power to act as a liaison between them and the Romney family. Only this time, he has used it sparingly -- in part because his father's strategists ignored his early advice.
Tagg Romney made a case more than a year ago that the campaign should let Americans get to know his father on a more personal level, according to one person involved in the campaign, who spoke anonymously to discuss internal deliberations. Top Romney strategists disagreed, instead emphasizing the candidate's selling points as an economic leader. The younger Mr. Romney quit attending strategy sessions and settled into the role of surrogate and fund-raiser.
''Tagg is not a Bobby Kennedy or even a George W. Bush figure running around telling people what his dad wants or doesn't want,'' said Robert O'Brien, a close friend of Tagg Romney and a foreign policy adviser to the campaign. ''His role is to go out -- and this is how Tagg views his role -- and tell people about his dad's character and what his dad has done throughout his life and why he believes that his dad is uniquely suited to turn the country around.''
Yet in recent weeks, the campaign has embraced Mr. Romney's view that his father needed a more personal connection with voters, and its ''Let Mitt be Mitt'' strategy appears, along with his debate performances, to be helping the cause. Mr. Romney is now running neck and neck in the polls with President Obama, and closing the gap in several swing states.
Tagg Romney insists he played no role in the shift, but campaign insiders say he has more influence than he lets on. ''Tagg definitely played a role in talking to people about it,'' one top adviser said. Another said the younger Mr. Romney has been pushing the campaign's communications shop for more openness and outreach to reporters.
Friends say Mr. Romney -- who made headlines last week by saying he felt like ''taking a swing'' at Mr. Obama -- does not live and breathe politics. He is much more interested in sports (he is a die-hard Boston Red Sox fan) and business. When his father first contemplated running for president, a friend gave Tagg two books -- Richard Ben Cramer's ''What It Takes,'' and Theodore H. White's ''The Making of the President 1960'' -- so he could educate himself on presidential politics.
Just as Mitt Romney idolized his father, George, Tagg Romney openly admires Mitt Romney, which is why, in 2007, he quit his dream job as the Los Angeles Dodgers' marketing director to move back to Boston as a strategist on his father's first presidential campaign. (He says he had an ''overwhelming feeling'' that he ''had to go back and help.'') And it is why he is jumped in again this time.
One recent duty has been to relax his father on debate days. Before each face-off with Mr. Obama, he and his brothers would show up with their families to distract the candidate.
''We talk sports, we watch funny YouTube clips, 'Saturday Night Live' clips,'' said Mr. Romney, who is a father of six children, including 5-month-old twins.
Tagg Romney's friends say that despite the parallels with his father, his personality is more like that of his mother, who can be more emotional. Of the five brothers, Tagg was the softhearted son, family members say, the one who got pummeled by a schoolyard bully after saying that he did not swear because he was Mormon. When he was a missionary, his friends poked fun at him for tearing up at sad stories.
But politics has also thickened his skin. The 2012 race has brought unflattering coverage of his firm, Solamere Capital, which got started with investments from some Romney donors, as well as $10 million from Ann Romney's blind trust. Asked about a recent article in The New Republic that suggested that Tagg Romney could not have succeeded without his last name, he responded forcefully.
''I am sure it does not hurt that Mitt Romney is my dad,'' he said. ''I'm sure it's opened a lot of doors for me. But I think I've been pretty effective once I've gotten through the door at doing a pretty good job.''
Those who know him say he is sincere when he says he intends to go back to his business in Boston. But they also say that if his father won the presidency and asked him to move to Washington, he would. Senior Romney advisers are barred from speculating on what a Romney administration might look like.
But, one said of Tagg: ''If his father said to him -- if the president said to him -- here's a role I think you can uniquely play, would he do it? Absolutely.''

HEADLINE: In Virginia, Romney Scours Coal Country for Edge Over Obama

BYLINE: By MICHAEL D. SHEAR

 BODY:
When Jay Swiney emerges from the night shift in the coal mines to assume his duties as mayor of Appalachia, Va., it is hard for him to miss the partisan forces rocking the heavily unionized Democratic hamlets in the mountains along the Tennessee border.
Billboards proclaim ''America or Obama -- You Can't Have Them Both!'' and ''Yes, Coal; No-bama.'' Out-of-work miners are sporting baseball caps that say ''Coal=Jobs'' and T-shirts with the sarcastic message: ''Make Coal Legal.'' Yard signs and TV ads for Mitt Romney are everywhere.
Mr. Romney's campaign is aggressively tapping into anger at President Obama's environmental policies throughout the Appalachian counties where the state's coal miners live, hoping that huge margins there will offset Mr. Obama's equally aggressive campaign to woo female voters in the suburbs of Northern Virginia, just outside Washington. 
The battle playing out in Virginia has echoes across the battleground states, where the final days of the presidential campaign have become a test of geographical strategies and an all-important focus on motivation, intensity and turnout. Republicans are pushing hard in suburban Denver and central Florida to appeal to Hispanic small business owners. Mr. Obama's campaign is probing for white male voters around Toledo, where there are major auto plants that benefited from the auto bailout.
In Virginia, Republicans hope to keep the race razor-close in other parts of the state. If they do, aides believe Mr. Romney's appeal in the sparsely populated coal country could tip Virginia's 13 electoral votes into his column, a victory vital to his White House bid. With just 10 days left, few self-described hillbillies in southwest Virginia are undecided.
''I definitely will vote for Romney this time,'' Mr. Swiney, 43, who considered backing Mr. Obama four years ago before deciding on Senator John McCain, said in a telephone interview this week. ''Not just because of the devastation that's going on with coal now. I'm a firm believer in giving somebody a chance. We've given Obama a chance for the last four years.''
The mayor, whose post is nonpartisan, points to the men in the coal camps on the outskirts of the 2,800-person town, some of whom are losing their jobs as tougher environmental regulations make coal more expensive to mine. Plummeting natural gas prices are discouraging the use of coal to generate electricity. The region feels under siege and at war, he says, a sentiment that is also common in coal-mining regions of Ohio, another battleground.
''I personally blame him for it,'' Mr. Swiney said of the president.
Mr. Obama argues that he has been supportive of coal by pumping government money into clean-coal technologies. He regularly mocks Mr. Romney for presenting himself as a champion of the coal industry while conveniently forgetting his criticism of coal mines when he was governor of Massachusetts.
''If you say that you're a champion of the coal industry when, while you were governor, you stood in front of a coal plant and said, this plant will kill you, that's some Romnesia,'' Mr. Obama said at a rally in Fairfax, Va.
But the president, who lost much of that part of the state in 2008, seems at risk this time of losing by even larger margins. State Senator Phillip Puckett, the longtime Democrat from the region, says he will not support Mr. Obama's re-election because, telling a local television station last year, ''It's very clear to me that the administration does not support the coal industry.''
Strategists for Mr. Obama say coal miners and their families -- many of whom are elderly -- should be attracted to the president's position on Social Security and Medicare. The president's campaign is running ads in the region accusing Mr. Romney of wanting to turn Medicare into a voucher system. And surrogates are pressing the case.
''Romney is a political chameleon,'' says Richard L. Trumka, the president of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., and a former head of the United Mine Workers. ''He will say anything that he thinks people want to hear. For him to say he's a friend of coal is absolutely ridiculous.''
But even longtime Democrats in the state concede that Mr. Romney is making a forceful push for votes in the Ninth Congressional District, which encompasses the state's half-dozen coal counties. One of Mr. Romney's ads, appearing frequently on television, begins with a coal miner saying, ''Obama is ruining the coal industry.'' Mr. Romney held a rally in Abingdon, Va., this month. His son Matt spoke to 7,500 people last week in Grundy, a town of just 996 people.
Dave Saunders, a veteran Democratic strategist who lives in the region, said: ''Three things are sacred in Southwest Virginia -- the Holy Bible, moonshine and coal. That's all I got to say. They will get big numbers in the Ninth. No question at all.''
The Republican effort to gather votes for Mr. Romney has been supplemented by an aggressive and mostly negative campaign by third-party groups backed by conservatives and energy interests. The American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity has a television ad blasting ''heavy-handed E.P.A. regulations.'' A radio ad by the American Energy Alliance says the ''president and his Washington cronies have declared war on affordable energy.'' A TV ad by the same group urges miners to ''Vote no on Obama's failing energy policy.''
The president has cited reports that the coal miners in Mr. Romney's ad were coerced by their employers to be there, an accusation that some of the miners have denied. But even if some of the outrage at Mr. Obama is being exaggerated by outside groups, locals say that much of it is a genuine expression of the frustration at seeing jobs die in the region.
In September, several hundred coal miners were furloughed for at least two months because of rising costs and shrinking demand. The company, Consol, announced on Wednesday that some workers will remain idled even after mining resumes the first week of November.
Other plants have shut down for good, citing in part foreign competition. Larry Lambert, 61, is one of the unlucky miners who spent a day this week at a résumé-writing seminar, which was a requirement for picking up his unemployment check.
''The E.P.A. has put so many strangleholds on the power companies they can't burn the coal we are mining,'' Mr. Lambert said. He added that Mr. Obama seemed appealing four years ago, but has betrayed coal miners.
And yet, it is not clear that there are enough voters like Mr. Lambert to offset the president's strength in Northern Virginia. About 750,000 people live in southwest Virginia, less than a third of the number in the suburban counties near Washington.
Democratic strategists working on Mr. Obama's behalf said Mr. Romney would probably win 60 percent of the vote in the region. But they say the shift in the state's population means that the huge margins will not be worth as much for Mr. Romney's campaign.
''In the 12 years I've been in elected office, we continue to see pretty dramatic population shift,'' said Mark Warner, one of the state's two Democratic senators. ''The numbers just aren't there.''

HEADLINE: ...While Romney's Grows

BYLINE: By MICHAEL BARBARO

 BODY:
2:39 p.m. | Updated AMES, Iowa - Mitt Romney is going big.
Over the past 24 hours, Mr. Romney has called for "big change," described a "big choice," warned of "big challenges," foreseen "big opportunities" and hailed "big moments." 
The strategy, in a word, is big.
Closing arguments in presidential campaign tend toward the grandiose, but Mr. Romney's reliance on the word is mostly a way to construct a stark contrast. To argue, as he now does, that President Obama's campaign is becoming "smaller and smaller" in its ambitions and focus, his vision and rhetoric needs to become bigger and bigger. Thus, the big motif. His aides do not appear to have reached for a thesaurus. He used the word a dozen times on Thursday alone.
On Friday, Mr. Romney attached the adjective to problems, challenges, opportunities and change during a speech on the economy here in Iowa. In all, he used the word 13 times.
Aides had said that the address would be - wait for it - big.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Blocks And Criticizes Investigation Into Premier

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry on Friday criticized a decision by The New York Times to publish a lengthy investigation into assets accumulated by the family of Prime Minister Wen Jiabao, saying that the article ''smears China and has ulterior motives.''
Speaking at a regularly scheduled daily briefing in Beijing, the spokesman, Hong Lei, also said that the Chinese government's decision to immediately block access to the English- and Chinese-language Web sites of The Times on Friday morning was taken ''in accordance with laws and rules.'' 
China's censors also moved with unusual swiftness on Friday to delete any social media postings alluding even tangentially to the article, which cited publicly available corporate documents in reporting that Mr. Wen's family has controlled assets worth at least $2.7 billion.
Sina Weibo, a very popular microblogging service similar to Twitter and traded on the Nasdaq in New York, on Friday morning immediately deleted the unofficial account that had been used to promote the culture and arts coverage on the Chinese-language site of The Times and that had nearly 60,000 followers. The site's official account had been blocked since the site began operations in late June.
Even the term ''$2.7 billion'' was blocked on Friday on Weibo. But users were still discussing the article by using deliberate mistakes like ''2.7b.''
Despite the censorship, there were signs that the article was attracting attention. According to the company's statistics, the number of page views and unique users of the Chinese-language site fell by only a third on Friday compared with the previous Friday, even though 85 percent of users are typically located in mainland China.
The investigative article was the site's most popular, drawing nearly a third of page views, while the home page drew another third.
The continued strength of traffic to the site was a sign that many users were using virtual private networks, or V.P.N.'s, to effectively bypass servers in China and circumvent the country's censors.
''We are incredibly proud of the story, which is an example of the quality investigative journalism The Times is known for,'' Eileen Murphy, a company spokeswoman, said in an e-mail, later adding that the company remains very focused on global expansion and that ''we see great opportunity in China as we do in other countries around the world with growing economies and a citizenship interested in quality journalism about global affairs.''
There were many comments about the article on social media sites outside China, including some suggesting that such a detailed and comprehensive look at a leading family's finances in a secretive country like China could have been possible only as a result of a deliberate leak by one of Mr. Wen's rivals in the country's factional power struggles.
Those struggles appear to have become more fierce in recent months ahead of the Communist Party Congress, which is scheduled to start on Nov. 8 and is expected to produce a new slate of leaders to run China for the next 10 years.
But the reporter who wrote the article, David Barboza, said that he had begun gathering corporate records for the investigation late last year. ''Thirty years of economic reform -- and government policies aimed at attracting foreign investment -- have created a set of government agencies that keep records on private corporations and their major shareholders, including copies of résumés and government-issued identity cards,'' he said.
While China has started restricting access this year to some of these documents in Beijing, they were previously publicly available, and Mr. Barboza said that he had gathered many of them before the restrictions were put in place. He also found that documents still remained available in Tianjin -- Mr. Wen's hometown -- as well as in Shanghai, Shenzhen and other cities.

HEADLINE: U.S. Court Rules Against Argentina Over Payments

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
A federal appeals court in New York said on Friday that Argentina improperly discriminated against bondholders who refused to take part in two large debt restructurings, setting back the country's efforts to recover from a roughly $100 billion default a decade ago. 
The Second United States Circuit Court of Appeals in New York said that Argentina's decision to pay holdout bondholders later than bondholders who agreed to participate in the 2005 and 2010 debt swaps violated provisions that required the country to treat bondholders equally.
Argentina vowed to fight the court's decision. The finance secretary, Adrian Cosentino, was quoted by the state news agency Télam as saying ''today's ruling is not in any way the end of litigation'' on the relative treatment of bondholders, and that it had no immediate impact on debt payments.
Prices of Argentine government debt nevertheless fell, and the cost of protecting the debt against default surged higher.
''It complicates debt restructurings generally and could impede them outright because no restructuring gets 100 percent acceptance,'' said the former Argentine finance secretary Guillermo Nielsen, who helped oversee the 2005 swap. ''It appears to be cornering Argentina into a new default,'' potentially forcing the country to pay holdouts while it services restructured debt.
Friday's decision largely upheld injunctions issued in February by Judge Thomas Griesa of United States District Court in Manhattan in favor of holdout bondholders, including NML Capital and the Aurelius Capital Management funds, which owned $1.4 billion of defaulted debt.
NML has been particularly aggressive, having won a court order this month to detain the Argentine naval ship ARA Libertad in a Ghana port, demanding that it be paid some of what it is owed.
Writing for a unanimous three-judge panel of the Second Circuit, Judge Barrington Parker said he had ''little difficulty'' in finding that Argentina breached its bond obligations, citing efforts by the country's officials and legislators to ensure that holders of restructured debt had priority.
Judge Parker also rejected the contention that an adverse decision would wreak havoc.
''Nothing in the record supports Argentina's blanket assertion that the injunctions will plunge the republic into a new financial and economic crisis,'' he said. ''Argentina makes no real argument that, to avoid defaulting on its other debt, it cannot afford to service the defaulted debt.''
Judge Griesa was asked to clarify how the injunctions' payment formula was intended to work, and how the injunctions applied to third parties like intermediary banks. The Second Circuit returned the case to his court to address those issues.
Friday's decision could make it harder for other countries to extricate themselves from sovereign debt crises and fend off angry creditors that may sue in United States courts.
In oral arguments in July, Argentina said such a decision could threaten the ability of countries like Greece, Ireland, Italy and Spain to undergo debt restructurings.

HEADLINE: Here's a Memo From the Boss: Vote This Way

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE

 BODY:
Imagine getting a letter from the boss, telling you how to vote.
Until 2010, federal law barred companies from using corporate money to endorse and campaign for political candidates -- and that included urging employees to support specific politicians.
But the Supreme Court's Citizens United decision has freed companies from those restrictions, and now several major companies, including Georgia-Pacific and Cintas, have sent letters or information packets to their employees suggesting -- and sometimes explicitly recommending -- how they should vote this fall.
In these letters, the executives complain about the costs of overregulation, the health care overhaul and possible tax increases. Some letters warn that if President Obama is re-elected, the company could be harmed, potentially jeopardizing jobs.
David A. Siegel, 77, chief executive of Westgate Resorts, a major time-share company, wrote to his 7,000 employees, saying that if Mr. Obama won, the prospect of higher taxes could hurt the company's future. 
''The economy doesn't currently pose a threat to your job. What does threaten your job, however, is another four years of the same presidential administration,'' Mr. Siegel wrote. ''If any new taxes are levied on me, or my company, as our current president plans, I will have no choice but to reduce the size of this company.''
In an interview, Mr. Siegel said he was not ordering his employees to vote his way. ''There's no way I can pressure anybody,'' he said. ''I'm not in the voting booth with them.''
Mr. Siegel added: ''I really wanted them to know how I felt four more years under President Obama was going to affect them. It would be no different from telling your children: 'Eat your spinach. It's good for you.' ''
Dave Robertson, the president of Koch Industries, sent an information packet and letter this month to more than 30,000 employees of a subsidiary, Georgia-Pacific, a paper and pulp company. The letter attacked government subsidies for ''a few favored cronies'' as well as ''unprecedented regulatory burdens on businesses.''
The letter added, ''Many of our more than 50,000 U.S. employees and contractors may suffer the consequences, including higher gasoline prices, runaway inflation and other ills.''
The Georgia-Pacific letter, first reported by In These Times, included a flier listing several candidates endorsed by the Koch brothers, the conservative billionaires, beginning with Mitt Romney, as well as opinion articles that the brothers had written.
Travis McKinney, a forklift driver for Georgia-Pacific in Portland, Ore., said the company's political packet had spurred widespread discussion. ''It leaves a bad taste,'' Mr. McKinney said. ''I won't even wear my Obama pin to work because of the mailer.''
In a statement, Koch Industries said its mailing contained pieces of information ''we believe are important for our employees to know about.'' The company said the letter was in no way intimidation: ''We make it clear that any decision about which candidates to support belongs solely to our employees.''
Other companies whose top executives have sent out anti-Obama letters include Rite-Hite, a manufacturer of industrial equipment based in Milwaukee, and ASG Software Solutions, based in Naples, Fla.
Many corporate executives say they have stepped up their political activities to counter organized labor's efforts on behalf of Mr. Obama and other Democrats. Even before Citizens United, unions were allowed to promote candidates to their members. Democrats and Republicans alike acknowledged the effectiveness of labor's political efforts.
Mr. Romney has himself urged business owners to appeal to their employees. In a conference call in June organized by the National Federation of Independent Business, he said, ''I hope you make it very clear to your employees what you believe is in the best interest of your enterprise and therefore their job and their future in the upcoming elections.''
Larry Gold, associate general counsel of the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said some of the recent employer letters, by hinting at the possible loss of employees' jobs, appeared to cross the line into improper coercion. Federal law and the laws of several states bar anyone from coercing or intimidating voters into voting a certain way.
But Bradley A. Smith, a Republican former member of the Federal Election Commission and a professor at Capital University Law School, disagreed, saying letters like those sent by the companies were not firm threats to fire anyone if Mr. Obama won.
According to the Citizens United ruling, companies may recommend candidates to employees, said Eugene Volokh, a law professor at University of California, Los Angeles.
''If the employer wants to say, 'This candidate is good or bad for our business and therefore good or bad for you, the employee, that's permissible -- that's protected by the First Amendment,'' Professor Volokh said. ''But if the employer threatens to fire you based on how you vote, that's not protected.''
But many liberal legal experts fear that employees could be discouraged from exercising their rights to free speech.
''The concern here is there is an unavoidable power disparity between management and employees,'' said Adam Skaggs, senior counsel at the liberal Brennan Center for Justice. ''Put yourself in the shoes of an employee at any of those companies. Are you going to be comfortable putting an Obama bumper sticker on your car and driving into the company parking lot? If you're in a small community with a big employer, will you feel uncomfortable about putting up a yard sign for a candidate your boss doesn't favor?''
Richard Lacks, chief executive of Lacks Enterprises, an auto parts company based in Grand Rapids, Mich., wrote to his 2,300 employees this month warning that an Obama victory would mean higher health care costs and higher taxes that would eat into their paychecks. ''It is important that in November you vote to improve your standard of living and that will be through smaller government and less government,'' he wrote.
Scott D. Farmer, chief executive of Cintas, the uniform supply company, sent a letter to his company's 30,000 employees on Oct. 19, denouncing the Affordable Care Act and saying it ''amounts to the single largest tax on Americans and business in history.'' He warned employees that ''the overregulation that business is facing today from the various administrative agencies such as the Environmental Protection Agency'' and the National Labor Relations Board ''is suffocating many companies.''
Mr. Farmer added, ''This uncertainty felt by many of our customers about their ability to run and grow their businesses prevents them from adding jobs which hurts our ability to grow and add jobs.''
Asked about Mr. Farmer's letter, Greg Hart, Cintas's vice president for government affairs, responded, ''The communication was not an attempt to suggest to employees how to vote, but rather it was sent to help partners make an informed decision.''
Election law experts did not point to any corporate efforts this year to urge employees to back Mr. Obama, although corporations have at times politicked for Democratic candidates. In 2010, Harrah's, the casino company, urged its employees to go to the polls to re-elect Nevada's senior senator, contending that ''waking up to the defeat of Harry Reid Nov. 3 will be devastating.''

HEADLINE: Slow but Steady Improvement

 BODY:
The slow pace of the nation's economic recovery has picked up a bit lately. In the third quarter, the economy grew at an annual rate of 2 percent, beating expectations and the dismal 1.3 percent growth in the second quarter. Over the past year, the growth rate has been 2.3 percent. At that pace, there's enough momentum to keep unemployment, currently 7.8 percent, from getting much worse, but not enough to spur big job gains.
The growth figures, released on Friday by the Commerce Department, played right into the candidates' competing themes on the campaign trail, where President Obama has pointed to slow but steady economic recovery relative to the severe recession he inherited, while Mitt Romney has criticized growth of the past few years as unacceptably slow because of Mr. Obama's policies. 
Mr. Obama has the stronger argument. The economy would have been much worse off without Obama administration policies like the stimulus and the auto industry rescue. And it would be much better off today if congressional Republicans had not obstructed subsequent stimulus proposals, most notably the administration's jobs bill introduced last year, which could have added an estimated 1.9 million jobs -- and at least a percentage point to growth, according to many private-sector economic analyses.
And yet, even without that boost, there is some cause for optimism. Much of the improvement in the latest economic data is attributable to more consumer spending and a healthier housing market, two mainstays of a sustainable recovery. More domestic production of oil and gas helped, too, by reducing the need to spend on imports.
Growth was also bolstered by larger-than-expected outlays for defense spending, much of which simply represents a rebound from weaker-than-expected spending in previous quarters. More defense spending by itself is not a sign of a healthier economy, but its effect on growth is an important reminder that federal spending is vital to the economy, especially in times of slow growth.
As for drags on growth, there was a slowdown in exports last quarter, reflecting recession in Europe and slowing growth in China. That is a worry, but there is not much that American policy makers can do about that. Another drag on growth -- a decrease in business investment -- is more baffling. One popular interpretation is that businesses are beset by uncertainty over the year-end fiscal cliff, when huge federal spending cuts and tax increases are due to kick in unless Congress takes action to prevent them.
A more fundamental cause is that businesses are not sure that the economy's current growth can be sustained or accelerated. That goes beyond the fiscal cliff, to the role that government will play, if any, in the recovery next year and beyond. And that depends on who wins the election.
Mr. Obama has supported federal spending for more jobs. And he has done so while presenting a reasonable compromise for making progress on deficit reduction. That compromise would allow the Bush tax cuts to expire for the top 2 percent of households, while it would extend them for everyone else. This would raise needed revenues without imperiling the recovery, and could even provide resources for spending to create jobs. Mr. Romney, by contrast, wants more tax cuts that would worsen the deficit coupled with severe spending reductions.
With growth hanging in there around 2 percent, the economy clearly needs a push. Whether it gets one awaits the election.

HEADLINE: Missouri Senate Poll Shows McCaskill's Lead Narrowing

BYLINE: JOHN ELIGON


HIGHLIGHT: The Missouri Senate race has narrowed to a dead heat, according to a new poll released on Saturday, a drastic turnaround since Representative Todd Akin, the Republican challenging incumbent Senator Claire McCaskill, upended the race with controversial comments about rape two months ago. 

 BODY:
KANSAS CITY, Mo. - The Missouri Senate race has narrowed to a dead heat, according to a new poll released on Saturday, a drastic turnaround since Representative Todd Akin, the Republican challenging incumbent Senator Claire McCaskill, upended the race with controversial comments about rape two months ago.
Ms. McCaskill, a first-term Democrat, holds a 45 percent to 43 percent edge, which is within the 4 percent margin of sampling error of the Mason-Dixon Poll, which was commissioned by the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, News 4 and the Kansas City Star. The same poll showed Ms. McCaskill with a nine-point edge (50-41) in the immediate aftermath of Mr. Akin's remark in August that in cases of "legitimate rape," women's bodies had a natural way of fighting off pregnancy.
Mr. Akin's campaign touted the poll in a press release sent out on Saturday morning.
"We were very excited to see the poll," said Rick Tyler, a spokesman for the Akin campaign, noting Ms. McCaskill's large fundraising advantage in the race. "It just tells me that no amount of advertising and distraction is going to convince the voters to send Claire McCaskill back to Washington."
The new poll also appeared to grab the attention of the McCaskill campaign, which quickly released the results of its own internal poll on Saturday morning, showing the incumbent senator with a much wider lead.
"While polls in this race have varied, the clear pattern to emerge over the last few weeks is that Claire is consistently leading Akin by a much wider margin," Caitlin Legacki, a spokeswoman for Ms. McCaskill, said in a statement. "Keep in mind that Mason-Dixon badly missed the mark 10 days before the Senate primary."
In that poll, Mr. Akin was third among the Republican primary candidates, with just 17 percent of the vote, 16 points behind the frontrunner, John Brunner. Mr. Mr. Akin ended up winning by 6 points with 36 percent of the vote.
Still, the tightened poll presents a dilemma for the national Republican establishment, which quickly abandoned Mr. Akin after his rape comments and urged him to drop out of the race. When he refused to give up his candidacy in favor of another candidate, several deep-pocketed Republican groups said they still would not support him with the millions of dollars they had previously promised because they did not believe he could win the race.
But this race, like all of the other close Senate battles around the country, is seen as critical in Republican efforts to win control of the chamber. The Akin campaign has said it believed the party would have to return to its corner because of the importance of the race. The challenge for Mr. Akin has been to show that he presented a realistic chance of winning. Polling data over the past couple of months has been all over the map, which may cause Republican donors to continue to balk on spending in Missouri as they invest in several other competitive races in other states.
The nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report on Friday moved the Missouri Senate race more comfortably in Ms. McCaskill's direction to favored Democrat.
"We hope that Congressman Akin wins next month and we continue to closely monitor the race," said Brian Walsh, a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee, which withdrew a pledge to spend $3 million on the race after Mr. Akin's rape remark.
Spokesmen for American Crossroads, a ''super PAC'' founded by Karl Rove that had planned to spend $2.3 million, did not respond to requests for comment on Saturday morning.
Ms. McCaskill raised more than three and a half times as much money ($5.8 million to $1.6 million) as Mr. Akin during the third quarter and spent more than four and a half times as much.
The new poll of 625 likely voters, interviewed on Tuesday through Thursday, showed that Mr. Akin cut his deficit among female voters in half, to 9 points from 18. It shows Mr. Akin with comfortable leads in all parts of the state except the two major metropolitan hubs, Kansas City and St. Louis.
Ms. McCaskill's favorability rating continued to be a nagging concern, with 47 percent of those polled viewing her unfavorably, compared with 42 percent for Mr. Akin. Ms. McCaskill does, however have a wide lead over Mr. Akin on the favorable side, 40 percent to 28 percent.
The economy, jobs, healthcare and Medicare were the most important issues for 63 percent of voters who had made up their minds, according to the poll. Mr. Akin's rape remarks were either somewhat important or very important to 53 percent of decided voters, the poll said.
The poll also showed Mitt Romney increasing his lead over President Obama in the state to 13 percentage points, 54 percent to 41 percent.

HEADLINE: Des Moines Register Endorses Romney

BYLINE: JEFF ZELENY


HIGHLIGHT: Mitt Romney is the first Republican presidential candidate to capture the newspaper's recommendation to Iowa voters since Richard Nixon in 1972. 

 BODY:
Mitt Romney won the endorsement of The Des Moines Register on Saturday evening, becoming the first Republican presidential candidate to capture the newspaper's recommendation to Iowa voters since Richard Nixon in 1972.
Four years ago, the newspaper's editorial pages supported Barack Obama. But Mr. Romney secured the endorsement this year, with the editorial saying that he offered a "fresh economic vision."
"Voters should give Mitt Romney a chance to correct the nation's fiscal course and to implode the partisan gridlock that has shackled Washington and the rest of America -- with the understanding that he would face the same assessment in four years if he does not succeed," the editorial said. 
The value of newspaper endorsements-like all endorsements-is an open question. But the fight for Iowa's six electoral votes is intense in the closing stage of the campaign and it could provide a boost for Mr. Romney's efforts to win over a sliver of undecided suburban voters.
The president fought for the endorsement, calling the paper's editor and publisher earlier this week. But the message of the call was overshadowed by a White House request that the conversation be off the record. The administration reversed course a day later.
Mr. Obama has an advantage among those who have voted early over the last month, but the state remains highly competitive. Mr. Romney is scheduled to campaign there on Monday. 
The Obama campaign, responding to the endorsement, questioned the newspaper's backing of Mr. Romney.
"It's surprising that the Register would endorse Mitt Romney given that he wants to kill the wind energy tax credit so critical to Iowa's economy, increase our deficit, and cut education funding important to creating jobs" a message to Iowa supporters said. "His embrace of the G.O.P.'s extreme wing throughout this campaign will certainly make it hard to work across aisle."

HEADLINE: The Enchanted Island Of Centenarians

BYLINE: By DAN BUETTNER

 BODY:
In 1943, a Greek war veteran named Stamatis Moraitis came to the United States for treatment of a combat-mangled arm. He'd survived a gunshot wound, escaped to Turkey and eventually talked his way onto the Queen Elizabeth, then serving as a troopship, to cross the Atlantic. Moraitis settled in Port Jefferson, N.Y., an enclave of countrymen from his native island, Ikaria. He quickly landed a job doing manual labor. Later, he moved to Boynton Beach, Fla. Along the way, Moraitis married a Greek-American woman, had three children and bought a three-bedroom house and a 1951 Chevrolet.
One day in 1976, Moraitis felt short of breath. Climbing stairs was a chore; he had to quit working midday. After X-rays, his doctor concluded that Moraitis had lung cancer. As he recalls, nine other doctors confirmed the diagnosis. They gave him nine months to live. He was in his mid-60s. 
Moraitis considered staying in America and seeking aggressive cancer treatment at a local hospital. That way, he could also be close to his adult children. But he decided instead to return to Ikaria, where he could be buried with his ancestors in a cemetery shaded by oak trees that overlooked the Aegean Sea. He figured a funeral in the United States would cost thousands, a traditional Ikarian one only $200, leaving more of his retirement savings for his wife, Elpiniki. Moraitis and Elpiniki moved in with his elderly parents, into a tiny, whitewashed house on two acres of stepped vineyards near Evdilos, on the north side of Ikaria. At first, he spent his days in bed, as his mother and wife tended to him. He reconnected with his faith. On Sunday mornings, he hobbled up the hill to a tiny Greek Orthodox chapel where his grandfather once served as a priest. When his childhood friends discovered that he had moved back, they started showing up every afternoon. They'd talk for hours, an activity that invariably involved a bottle or two of locally produced wine. I might as well die happy, he thought.
In the ensuing months, something strange happened. He says he started to feel stronger. One day, feeling ambitious, he planted some vegetables in the garden. He didn't expect to live to harvest them, but he enjoyed being in the sunshine, breathing the ocean air. Elpiniki could enjoy the fresh vegetables after he was gone.
Six months came and went. Moraitis didn't die. Instead, he reaped his garden and, feeling emboldened, cleaned up the family vineyard as well. Easing himself into the island routine, he woke up when he felt like it, worked in the vineyards until midafternoon, made himself lunch and then took a long nap. In the evenings, he often walked to the local tavern, where he played dominoes past midnight. The years passed. His health continued to improve. He added a couple of rooms to his parents' home so his children could visit. He built up the vineyard until it produced 400 gallons of wine a year. Today, three and a half decades later, he's 97 years old -- according to an official document he disputes; he says he's 102 -- and cancer-free. He never went through chemotherapy, took drugs or sought therapy of any sort. All he did was move home to Ikaria.
I met Moraitis on Ikaria this past July during one of my visits to explore the extraordinary longevity of the island's residents. For a decade, with support from the National Geographic Society, I've been organizing a study of the places where people live longest. The project grew out of studies by my partners, Dr. Gianni Pes of the University of Sassari in Italy and Dr. Michel Poulain, a Belgian demographer. In 2000, they identified a region of Sardinia's Nuoro province as the place with the highest concentration of male centenarians in the world. As they zeroed in on a cluster of villages high in Nuoro's mountains, they drew a boundary in blue ink on a map and began referring to the area inside as the ''blue zone.'' Starting in 2002, we identified three other populations around the world where people live measurably longer lives than everyone else. The world's longest-lived women are found on the island of Okinawa. On Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, we discovered a population of 100,000 mestizos with a lower-than-normal rate of middle-age mortality. And in Loma Linda, Calif., we identified a population of Seventh-day Adventists in which most of the adherents' life expectancy exceeded the American average by about a decade.
In 2003, I started a consulting firm to see if it was possible to take what we were learning in the field and apply it to American communities. We also continued to do research and look for other pockets of longevity, and in 2008, following a lead from a Greek researcher, we began investigating Ikaria. Poulain's plan there was to track down survivors born between 1900 and 1920 and determine when and where individuals died. The approach was complicated by the fact that people often moved around. That meant that not only were birth and death records required, but also information on immigration and emigration.
The data collection had to be rigorous. Earlier claims about long-lived people in places like Ecuador's Vilcabamba Valley, Pakistan's Hunza Valley or the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia had all been debunked after researchers discovered that many residents didn't actually know their ages. For villagers born without birth certificates, it was easy to lose track. One year they were 80; a few months later they were 82. Pretty soon they claimed to be 100. And when a town discovers that a reputation for centenarians draws tourists, who's going to question it? Even in Ikaria, the truth has been sometimes difficult to nail down. Stories like the one about Moraitis's miraculous recovery become instant folklore, told and retold and changed and misattributed. (Stories about Moraitis have appeared on Greek TV.) In fact, when I was doing research there in 2009, I met a different man who told me virtually the exact same story about himself.
The study would try to cut through the stories and establish the facts about Ikaria's longevity. Before including subjects, Poulain cross-referenced birth records against baptism or military documentation. After gathering all the data, he and his colleagues at the University of Athens concluded that people on Ikaria were, in fact, reaching the age of 90 at two and a half times the rate Americans do. (Ikarian men in particular are nearly four times as likely as their American counterparts to reach 90, often in better health.) But more than that, they were also living about 8 to 10 years longer before succumbing to cancers and cardiovascular disease, and they suffered less depression and about a quarter the rate of dementia. Almost half of Americans 85 and older show signs of Alzheimer's. (The Alzheimer's Association estimates that dementia cost Americans some $200 billion in 2012.) On Ikaria, however, people have been managing to stay sharp to the end.
Ikaria, an island of 99 square miles and home to almost 10,000 Greek nationals, lies about 30 miles off the western coast of Turkey. Its jagged ridge of scrub-covered mountains rises steeply out of the Aegean Sea. Before the Christian era, the island was home to thick oak forests and productive vineyards. Its reputation as a health destination dates back 25 centuries, when Greeks traveled to the island to soak in the hot springs near Therma. In the 17th century, Joseph Georgirenes, the bishop of Ikaria, described its residents as proud people who slept on the ground. ''The most commendable thing on this island,'' he wrote, ''is their air and water, both so healthful that people are very long-lived, it being an ordinary thing to see persons in it of 100 years of age.''
Seeking to learn more about the island's reputation for long-lived residents, I called on Dr. Ilias Leriadis, one of Ikaria's few physicians, in 2009. On an outdoor patio at his weekend house, he set a table with Kalamata olives, hummus, heavy Ikarian bread and wine. ''People stay up late here,'' Leriadis said. ''We wake up late and always take naps. I don't even open my office until 11 a.m. because no one comes before then.'' He took a sip of his wine. ''Have you noticed that no one wears a watch here? No clock is working correctly. When you invite someone to lunch, they might come at 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. We simply don't care about the clock here.''
Pointing across the Aegean toward the neighboring island of Samos, he said: ''Just 15 kilometers over there is a completely different world. There they are much more developed. There are high-rises and resorts and homes worth a million euros. In Samos, they care about money. Here, we don't. For the many religious and cultural holidays, people pool their money and buy food and wine. If there is money left over, they give it to the poor. It's not a 'me' place. It's an 'us' place.''
Ikaria's unusual past may explain its communal inclinations. The strong winds that buffet the island -- mentioned in the ''Iliad'' -- and the lack of natural harbors kept it outside the main shipping lanes for most of its history. This forced Ikaria to be self-sufficient. Then in the late 1940s, after the Greek Civil War, the government exiled thousands of Communists and radicals to the island. Nearly 40 percent of adults, many of them disillusioned with the high unemployment rate and the dwindling trickle of resources from Athens, still vote for the local Communist Party. About 75 percent of the population on Ikaria is under 65. The youngest adults, many of whom come home after college, often live in their parents' home. They typically have to cobble together a living through small jobs and family support.
Leriadis also talked about local ''mountain tea,'' made from dried herbs endemic to the island, which is enjoyed as an end-of-the-day cocktail. He mentioned wild marjoram, sage (flaskomilia), a type of mint tea (fliskouni), rosemary and a drink made from boiling dandelion leaves and adding a little lemon. ''People here think they're drinking a comforting beverage, but they all double as medicine,'' Leriadis said. Honey, too, is treated as a panacea. ''They have types of honey here you won't see anyplace else in the world,'' he said. ''They use it for everything from treating wounds to curing hangovers, or for treating influenza. Old people here will start their day with a spoonful of honey. They take it like medicine.''
Over the span of the next three days, I met some of Leriadis's patients. In the area known as Raches, I met 20 people over 90 and one who claimed to be 104. I spoke to a 95-year-old man who still played the violin and a 98-year-old woman who ran a small hotel and played poker for money on the weekend.
On a trip the year before, I visited a slate-roofed house built into the slope at the top of a hill. I had come here after hearing of a couple who had been married for more than 75 years. Thanasis and Eirini Karimalis both came to the door, clapped their hands at the thrill of having a visitor and waved me in. They each stood maybe five feet tall. He wore a shapeless cotton shirt and a battered baseball cap, and she wore a housedress with her hair in a bun. Inside, there was a table, a medieval-looking fireplace heating a blackened pot, a nook of a closet that held one woolen suit coat, and fading black-and-white photographs of forebears on a soot-stained wall. The place was warm and cozy. ''Sit down,'' Eirini commanded. She hadn't even asked my name or business but was already setting out teacups and a plate of cookies. Meanwhile, Thanasis scooted back and forth across the house with nervous energy, tidying up.
The couple were born in a nearby village, they told me. They married in their early 20s and raised five children on Thanasis's pay as a lumberjack. Like that of almost all of Ikaria's traditional folk, their daily routine unfolded much the way Leriadis had described it: Wake naturally, work in the garden, have a late lunch, take a nap. At sunset, they either visited neighbors or neighbors visited them. Their diet was also typical: a breakfast of goat's milk, wine, sage tea or coffee, honey and bread. Lunch was almost always beans (lentils, garbanzos), potatoes, greens (fennel, dandelion or a spinachlike green called horta) and whatever seasonal vegetables their garden produced; dinner was bread and goat's milk. At Christmas and Easter, they would slaughter the family pig and enjoy small portions of larded pork for the next several months.
During a tour of their property, Thanasis and Eirini introduced their pigs to me by name. Just after sunset, after we returned to their home to have some tea, another old couple walked in, carrying a glass amphora of homemade wine. The four nonagenarians cheek-kissed one another heartily and settled in around the table. They gossiped, drank wine and occasionally erupted into laughter.
Dr. Ioanna Chinou, a professor at the University of Athens School of Pharmacy, is one of Europe's top experts on the bioactive properties of herbs and natural products. When I consulted her about Ikarians' longevity, she told me that many of the teas they consume are traditional Greek remedies. Wild mint fights gingivitis and gastrointestinal disorders; rosemary is used as a remedy for gout; artemisia is thought to improve blood circulation. She invited me to give her samples and later tested seven of the most commonly used herbs on Ikaria. As rich sources of polyphenols, they showed strong antioxidant properties, she reported. Most of these herbs also contained mild diuretics. Doctors often use diuretics to treat hypertension -- perhaps by drinking tea nightly, Ikarians have gently lowered their blood pressure throughout their lives.
Meanwhile, my colleagues Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain set out to track down the island's 164 residents who were over 90 as of 1999, starting in the municipality of Raches. They found that 75 nonagenarians were still alive. Then, along with additional researchers, they fanned out across the island and asked 35 elderly subjects a battery of lifestyle questions to assess physical and cognitive functioning: How much do you sleep? Did you ever smoke? They asked them to get up and down from a chair five times and recorded how long it took them to walk 13 feet. To test mental agility, the researchers had subjects recall a series of items and reproduce geometric shapes.
Pes and Poulain were joined in the field by Dr. Antonia Trichopoulou of the University of Athens, an expert on the Mediterranean diet. She helped administer surveys, often sitting in village kitchens to ask subjects to reconstruct their childhood eating habits. She noted that the Ikarians' diet, like that of others around the Mediterranean, was rich in olive oil and vegetables, low in dairy (except goat's milk) and meat products, and also included moderate amounts of alcohol. It emphasized homegrown potatoes, beans (garbanzo, black-eyed peas and lentils), wild greens and locally produced goat milk and honey.
As I knew from my studies in other places with high numbers of very old people, every one of the Ikarians' dietary tendencies had been linked to increased life spans: low intake of saturated fats from meat and dairy was associated with lower risk of heart disease; olive oil -- especially unheated -- reduced bad cholesterol and raised good cholesterol. Goat's milk contained serotonin-boosting tryptophan and was easily digestible for older people. Some wild greens had 10 times as many antioxidants as red wine. Wine -- in moderation -- had been shown to be good for you if consumed as part of a Mediterranean diet, because it prompts the body to absorb more flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. And coffee, once said to stunt growth, was now associated with lower rates of diabetes, heart disease and, for some, Parkinson's. Local sourdough bread might actually reduce a meal's glycemic load. You could even argue that potatoes contributed heart-healthy potassium, vitamin B6 and fiber to the Ikarian diet. Another health factor at work might be the unprocessed nature of the food they consume: as Trichopoulou observed, because islanders eat greens from their gardens and fields, they consume fewer pesticides and more nutrients. She estimated that the Ikarian diet, compared with the standard American diet, might yield up to four additional years of life expectancy.
Of course, it may not be only what they're eating; it may also be what they're not eating. ''Are they doing something positive, or is it the absence of something negative?'' Gary Taubes asked when I described to him the Ikarians' longevity and their diet. Taubes is a founder of the nonprofit Nutrition Science Initiative and the author of ''Why We Get Fat'' (and has written several articles for this magazine). ''One explanation why they live so long is they eat a plant-based diet. Or it could be the absence of sugar and white flour. From what I know of the Greek diet, they eat very little refined sugar, and their breads have been traditionally made with stone-ground wheat.''
Following the report by Pes and Poulain, Dr. Christina Chrysohoou, a cardiologist at the University of Athens School of Medicine, teamed up with half a dozen scientists to organize the Ikaria Study, which includes a survey of the diet of 673 Ikarians. She found that her subjects consumed about six times as many beans a day as Americans, ate fish twice a week and meat five times a month, drank on average two to three cups of coffee a day and took in about a quarter as much refined sugar -- the elderly did not like soda. She also discovered they were consuming high levels of olive oil along with two to four glasses of wine a day.
Chrysohoou also suspected that Ikarians' sleep and sex habits might have something to do with their long life. She cited a 2008 paper by the University of Athens Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health that studied more than 23,000 Greek adults. The researchers followed subjects for an average of six years, measuring their diets, physical activity and how much they napped. They found that occasional napping was associated with a 12 percent reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease, but that regular napping -- at least three days weekly -- was associated with a 37 percent reduction. She also pointed out a preliminary study of Ikarian men between 65 and 100 that included the fact that 80 percent of them claimed to have sex regularly, and a quarter of that self-reported group said they were doing so with ''good duration'' and ''achievement.''
During our time on Ikaria, my colleagues and I stayed at Thea Parikos's guesthouse, the social hub of western Ikaria. Local women gathered in the dining room at midmorning to gossip over tea. Late at night, after the dinner rush, tables were pushed aside and the dining room became a dance floor, with people locking arms and kick-dancing to Greek music.
Parikos cooked the way her ancestors had for centuries, giving us a chance to consume the diet we were studying. For breakfast, she served local yogurt and honey from the 90-year-old beekeeper next door. For dinner, she walked out into the fields and returned with handfuls of weedlike greens, combined them with pumpkin and baked them into savory pies. My favorite was a dish made with black-eyed peas, tomatoes, fennel tops and garlic and finished with olive oil that we dubbed Ikarian stew.
Despite her consummately Ikarian air, Parikos was actually born in Detroit to an American father and an Ikarian mother. She had attended high school, worked as a real estate agent and married in the United States. After she and her husband had their first child, she felt a ''genetic craving'' for Ikaria. ''I was not unhappy in America,'' she said. ''We had good friends, we went out to dinner on the weekends, I drove a Chevrolet. But I was always in a hurry.''
When she and her family moved to Ikaria and opened the guesthouse, everything changed. She stopped shopping for most groceries, instead planting a huge garden that provided most of their fruits and vegetables. She lost weight without trying to. I asked her if she thought her simple diet was going to make her family live longer. ''Yes,'' she said. ''But we don't think about it that way. It's bigger than that.''
Although unemployment is high -- perhaps as high as 40 percent -- most everyone has access to a family garden and livestock, Parikos told me. People who work might have several jobs. Someone involved in tourism, for example, might also be a painter or an electrician or have a store. ''People are fine here because we are very self-sufficient,'' she said. ''We may not have money for luxuries, but we will have food on the table and still have fun with family and friends. We may not be in a hurry to get work done during the day, so we work into the night. At the end of the day, we don't go home to sit on the couch.''
Parikos was nursing a mug of coffee. Sunlight sifted in through the window shades; the waves of the nearby Aegean could be barely heard over the din of breakfast. ''Do you know there's no word in Greek for privacy?'' she declared. ''When everyone knows everyone else's business, you get a feeling of connection and security. The lack of privacy is actually good, because it puts a check on people who don't want to be caught or who do something to embarrass their family. If your kids misbehave, your neighbor has no problem disciplining them. There is less crime, not because of good policing, but because of the risk of shaming the family. You asked me about food, and yes, we do eat better here than in America. But it's more about how we eat. Even if it's your lunch break from work, you relax and enjoy your meal. You enjoy the company of whoever you are with. Food here is always enjoyed in combination with conversation.''
In the United States, when it comes to improving health, people tend to focus on exercise and what we put into our mouths -- organic foods, omega-3's, micronutrients. We spend nearly $30 billion a year on vitamins and supplements alone. Yet in Ikaria and the other places like it, diet only partly explained higher life expectancy. Exercise -- at least the way we think of it, as willful, dutiful, physical activity -- played a small role at best.
Social structure might turn out to be more important. In Sardinia, a cultural attitude that celebrated the elderly kept them engaged in the community and in extended-family homes until they were in their 100s. Studies have linked early retirement among some workers in industrialized economies to reduced life expectancy. In Okinawa, there's none of this artificial punctuation of life. Instead, the notion of ikigai -- ''the reason for which you wake up in the morning'' -- suffuses people's entire adult lives. It gets centenarians out of bed and out of the easy chair to teach karate, or to guide the village spiritually, or to pass down traditions to children. The Nicoyans in Costa Rica use the term plan de vida to describe a lifelong sense of purpose. As Dr. Robert Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, once told me, being able to define your life meaning adds to your life expectancy.
The healthful plant-based diet that Seventh-day Adventists eat has been associated with an extra decade of life expectancy. It has also been linked to reduced rates of diabetes and heart disease. Adventists' diet is inspired by the Bible -- Genesis 1:29. (''And God said: 'Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed . . . and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.' '') But again, the key insight might be more about social structure than about the diet itself. While for most people, diets eventually fail, the Adventists eat the way they do for decades. How? Adventists hang out with other Adventists. When you go to an Adventist picnic, there's no steak grilling on the barbecue; it's a vegetarian potluck. No one is drinking alcohol or smoking. As Nicholas Christakis, a physician and social scientist at Harvard, found when examining data from a long-term study of the residents of Framingham, Mass., health habits can be as contagious as a cold virus. By his calculation, a Framingham individual's chances of becoming obese shot up by 57 percent if a friend became obese. Among the Adventists we looked at, it was mostly positive social contagions that were in circulation.
Ask the very old on Ikaria how they managed to live past 90, and they'll usually talk about the clean air and the wine. Or, as one 101-year-old woman put it to me with a shrug, ''We just forget to die.'' The reality is they have no idea how they got to be so old. And neither do we. To answer that question would require carefully tracking the lifestyles of a study group and a control group for an entire human lifetime (and then some). We do know from reliable data that people on Ikaria are outliving those on surrounding islands (a control group, of sorts). Samos, for instance, is just eight miles away. People there with the same genetic background eat yogurt, drink wine, breathe the same air, fish from the same sea as their neighbors on Ikaria. But people on Samos tend to live no longer than average Greeks. This is what makes the Ikarian formula so tantalizing.
If you pay careful attention to the way Ikarians have lived their lives, it appears that a dozen subtly powerful, mutually enhancing and pervasive factors are at work. It's easy to get enough rest if no one else wakes up early and the village goes dead during afternoon naptime. It helps that the cheapest, most accessible foods are also the most healthful -- and that your ancestors have spent centuries developing ways to make them taste good. It's hard to get through the day in Ikaria without walking up 20 hills. You're not likely to ever feel the existential pain of not belonging or even the simple stress of arriving late. Your community makes sure you'll always have something to eat, but peer pressure will get you to contribute something too. You're going to grow a garden, because that's what your parents did, and that's what your neighbors are doing. You're less likely to be a victim of crime because everyone at once is a busybody and feels as if he's being watched. At day's end, you'll share a cup of the seasonal herbal tea with your neighbor because that's what he's serving. Several glasses of wine may follow the tea, but you'll drink them in the company of good friends. On Sunday, you'll attend church, and you'll fast before Orthodox feast days. Even if you're antisocial, you'll never be entirely alone. Your neighbors will cajole you out of your house for the village festival to eat your portion of goat meat.
Every one of these factors can be tied to longevity. That's what the $70 billion diet industry and $20 billion health-club industry do in their efforts to persuade us that if we eat the right food or do the right workout, we'll be healthier, lose weight and live longer. But these strategies rarely work. Not because they're wrong-minded: it's a good idea for people to do any of these healthful activities. The problem is, it's difficult to change individual behaviors when community behaviors stay the same. In the United States, you can't go to a movie, walk through the airport or buy cough medicine without being routed through a gantlet of candy bars, salty snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages. The processed-food industry spends more than $4 billion a year tempting us to eat. How do you combat that? Discipline is a good thing, but discipline is a muscle that fatigues. Sooner or later, most people cave in to relentless temptation.
As our access to calories has increased, we've decreased the amount of physical activity in our lives. In 1970, about 40 percent of all children in the U.S. walked to school; now fewer than 12 percent do. Our grandparents, without exercising, burned up about five times as many calories a day in physical activity as we do. At the same time, access to food has exploded.
Despite the island's relative isolation, its tortuous roads and the fierce independence of its inhabitants, the American food culture, among other forces, is beginning to take root in Ikaria. Village markets are now selling potato chips and soda, which in my experience is replacing tea as the drink of choice among younger Ikarians. As the island's ancient traditions give way before globalization, the gap between Ikarian life spans and those of the rest of the world seems to be gradually disappearing, as the next generations of old people become less likely to live quite so long.
The big aha for me, having studied populations of the long-lived for nearly a decade, is how the factors that encourage longevity reinforce one another over the long term. For people to adopt a healthful lifestyle, I have become convinced, they need to live in an ecosystem, so to speak, that makes it possible. As soon as you take culture, belonging, purpose or religion out of the picture, the foundation for long healthy lives collapses. The power of such an environment lies in the mutually reinforcing relationships among lots of small nudges and default choices. There's no silver bullet to keep death and the diseases of old age at bay. If there's anything close to a secret, it's silver buckshot.
I called Moraitis a few weeks ago from my home in Minneapolis. Elpiniki died in the spring at age 85, and now he lives alone. He picked up the phone in the same whitewashed house that he'd moved into 35 years ago. It was late afternoon in Ikaria. He had worked in his vineyard that morning and just awakened from a nap. We chatted for a few minutes, but then he warned me that some of his neighbors were coming over for a drink in a few minutes and he'd have to go. I had one last question for him. How does he think he recovered from lung cancer?
''It just went away,'' he said. ''I actually went back to America about 25 years after moving here to see if the doctors could explain it to me.''
I had heard this part of the story before. It had become a piece of the folklore of Ikaria, proof of its exceptional way of life. Still, I asked him, ''What happened?''
''My doctors were all dead.''

HEADLINE: A Taste of the Next Corvette: G.M. Offers Peek at New V-8

BYLINE: By PAUL STENQUIST

 BODY:
PONTIAC, Mich.
THE 2014 Chevrolet Corvette -- the seventh generation of General Motors' red, white and blue sports car -- will be unveiled at the Detroit auto show on Jan. 13. To whet the appetites of enthusiasts, Chevy introduced the new car's engine on Thursday.
Called the LT1, in homage to two earlier Chevy engines, the 6.2-liter V-8 is expected to be rated at 450 horsepower, making it the most powerful standard engine ever offered in a Corvette. 
The feisty personality of the Detroit-bred sports car stems largely from the small-block V-8 that has served as its primary power plant since 1955. While it's a stretch to say the new engine is a direct descendant of the original Chevy V-8, the power plants do have a common philosophy: minimal mass and maximum power. And they share a basic architecture, a camshaft-in-block configuration.
This type of engine design, once common but now rare, relies on pushrods and rocker arms to open and close valves. Pushrod engines tend to be lighter, lower and somewhat less complex than overhead-cam designs.
General Motors could develop an engine that would conform to current high-performance norms: smaller displacement, overhead camshafts and turbocharged induction. But such a radical change would appall many tradition-minded Corvette enthusiasts. In a media presentation at G.M.'s Powertrain Engineering Center here, Tadge Juechter, the new Corvette's chief engineer, said that when meeting with enthusiasts he would ask how many wanted a twin-turbo V-6 in the new car. No hands were raised.
As before, the Corvette is a front-engine, rear-drive car, and its fans want it to remain that way. Jordan Lee, the program manager for the small-block engine, said a V-8 with overhead cams would have to be four inches taller than the LT1. That means the hood would have to be raised and the car's signature wedge shape would be lost. Relocating the engine to the middle of the car would allow a higher engine and a sleek shape, but to many traditionalists such a design wouldn't be a Corvette.
While the LT1 has a pushrod design that some may call archaic, the rest of its technology is contemporary. The new engine, like the current Corvette's 6.2-liter LS3 V-8, has an aluminum engine block and aluminum heads, but both are new designs.
Direct fuel injection, the most significant refinement, delivers fuel in precise amounts to the combustion chambers rather than to intake ports. That cools the combustion area, enabling higher cylinder pressure, which increases power and efficiency.
With many other engines, high cylinder pressure is achieved with a turbocharger or supercharger. But with the LT1, an 11.5:1 compression ratio -- a tight squeeze of the air-fuel mix -- generates the high pressure.
To further enhance power and efficiency, the engine has variable camshaft timing, which alters the opening and closing of the intake and exhaust valves for better flow control, and G.M.'s active fuel management system, which shuts down four cylinders when the engine is loafing, for better fuel economy. Mr. Juechter said that in moderate driving, the 6.2-liter engine -- large by today's standards -- functions like a 3.1-liter 4-cylinder.
Fuel economy numbers aren't in yet, but gains are expected; the current LS3 engine is rated at 26 m.p.g. on the highway with a manual transmission.

HEADLINE: The Price Of a Black President

BYLINE: By FREDRICK C. HARRIS. 
A professor of political science and the director of the Institute for Research in African-American Studies at Columbia University, and the author of ''The Price of the Ticket: , Barack Obama and the Rise and Decline of Black Politics.''

 BODY:
WHEN African-Americans go to the polls next week, they are likely to support Barack Obama at a level approaching the 95 percent share of the black vote he received in 2008. As well they should, given the symbolic exceptionalism of his presidency and the modern Republican Party's utter disregard for economic justice, civil rights and the social safety net.
But for those who had seen in President Obama's election the culmination of four centuries of black hopes and aspirations and the realization of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s vision of a ''beloved community,'' the last four years must be reckoned a disappointment. Whether it ends in 2013 or 2017, the Obama presidency has already marked the decline, rather than the pinnacle, of a political vision centered on challenging racial inequality. The tragedy is that black elites -- from intellectuals and civil rights leaders to politicians and clergy members -- have acquiesced to this decline, seeing it as the necessary price for the pride and satisfaction of having a black family in the White House. 
These are not easy words to write. Mr. Obama's expansion of health insurance coverage was the most significant social legislation since the Great Society, his stimulus package blunted much of the devastation of the Great Recession, and the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul added major new protections for consumers. His politics would seem to vindicate the position of civil rights-era leaders like Bayard Rustin, who argued that blacks should form coalitions with other Democratic constituencies in support of universal, race-neutral policies -- in opposition to activists like Malcolm X, who distrusted party politics and believed that blacks would be better positioned to advance their interests as an independent voting bloc, beholden to neither party.
But the triumph of ''post-racial'' Democratic politics has not been a triumph for African-Americans in the aggregate. It has failed to arrest the growing chasm of income and wealth inequality; to improve prospects for social and economic mobility; to halt the re-segregation of public schools and narrow the black-white achievement gap; and to prevent the Supreme Court from eroding the last vestiges of affirmative action. The once unimaginable successes of black diplomats like Colin L. Powell, Condoleezza Rice and Susan E. Rice and of black chief executives like Ursula M. Burns, Kenneth I. Chenault and Roger W. Ferguson Jr. cannot distract us from facts like these: 28 percent of African-Americans, and 37 percent of black children, are poor (compared with 10 percent of whites and 13 percent of white children); 13 percent of blacks are unemployed (compared with 7 percent of whites); more than 900,000 black men are in prison; blacks experienced a sharper drop in income since 2007 than any other racial group; black household wealth, which had been disproportionately concentrated in housing, has hit its lowest level in decades; blacks accounted, in 2009, for 44 percent of new H.I.V. infections.
Mr. Obama cannot, of course, be blamed for any of these facts. It's no secret that Republican obstruction has limited his options at every turn. But it's disturbing that so few black elites have aggressively advocated for those whom the legal scholar Derrick A. Bell called the ''faces at the bottom of the well.''
The prophetic tradition of speaking truth to power, regardless of political winds or social pressures, has a long history. Ida B. Wells risked her life to publicize the atrocity of lynching; W. E. B. Du Bois linked the struggle against racial injustice to anticolonial movements around the world; Cornel West continues to warn of the ''giant triplets of racism, materialism and militarism'' that King identified a year before his death.
But that prophetic tradition is on the wane. Changes in black religious practice have played a role. Great preachers of social justice and liberation theology, like Gardner C. Taylor, Samuel DeWitt Proctor, John Hurst Adams, Wyatt Tee Walker and Joseph E. Lowery, have retired or passed away. Taking their place are megachurch preachers of a ''gospel of prosperity'' -- like Creflo A. Dollar Jr., T. D. Jakes, Eddie L. Long and Frederick K. C. Price -- who emphasize individual enrichment rather than collective uplift. ''There's more facing us than social justice,'' Bishop Jakes has said. ''There's personal responsibility.''
Mr. Obama hasn't embraced this new gospel, but as a candidate he did invoke the politics of respectability once associated with Booker T. Washington. He urged blacks to exhibit the ''discipline and fortitude'' of their forebears. He lamented that ''too many fathers are M.I.A.'' He chided some parents for ''feeding our children junk all day long, giving them no exercise.'' He distanced himself from his former pastor, the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr., whose incendiary remarks about racism's legacy caused a maelstrom.
But as president, Mr. Obama has had little to say on concerns specific to blacks. His State of the Union address in 2011 was the first by any president since 1948 to not mention poverty or the poor. The political scientist Daniel Q. Gillion found that Mr. Obama, in his first two years in office, talked about race less than any Democratic president had since 1961. From racial profiling to mass incarceration to affirmative action, his comments have been sparse and halting.
Early in his presidency, Mr. Obama weighed in after the prominent black Harvard professor Henry Louis Gates Jr. was arrested at his home in Cambridge, Mass. The president said the police had ''acted stupidly,'' was criticized for rushing to judgment, and was mocked when he invited Dr. Gates and the arresting officer to chat over beers at the White House. It wasn't until earlier this year that Mr. Obama spoke as forcefully on a civil rights matter -- the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager, Trayvon Martin, in Florida -- saying, ''If I had a son, he'd look like Trayvon.''
INSTEAD of urging Mr. Obama to be more outspoken on black issues, black elites parrot campaign talking points. They dutifully praise important but minor accomplishments -- the settlement of a longstanding class-action lawsuit by black farmers; increased funds for black colleges; the reduction (but not elimination) of the disparities in sentences for possession of crack and powder cocaine -- while setting aside their critical acumen.
For some, criticism of Mr. Obama is disloyal. ''Stick together, black people,'' the radio host Tom Joyner has warned. (Another talk show host, Tavis Smiley, joined Dr. West on a ''poverty tour'' last year, but has been less critical of the president than Dr. West has.)
It wasn't always so. Though Bill Clinton was wildly popular among blacks, black intellectuals fiercely debated affirmative action, mass incarceration, welfare reform and racial reconciliation during his presidency. In 2001, the Harvard law professor Charles J. Ogletree called the surge in the inmate population ''shocking and regrettable'' and found it ''shameful'' that Mr. Clinton ''didn't come out and take a more positive and symbolic approach to the issue of reparations for slavery.'' But Mr. Ogletree, a mentor of Mr. Obama's, now finds ''puzzling the idea that a president who happens to be black has to focus on black issues.''
Melissa V. Harris-Perry, a political scientist at Tulane who hosts a talk show for MSNBC, warned in 2005 that African-Americans ''who felt most warmly toward Clinton and most trusting of his party's commitment to African-Americans'' were in danger of underestimating ''the continued economic inequality of African-Americans relative to whites.'' But she has become all but an apologist for Mr. Obama. ''No matter what policies he pursues, the president's racialized embodiment stands as a symbol of triumphant black achievement,'' she wrote in The Nation this month.
Black politicians, too, have held their fire. ''With 14 percent unemployment if we had a white president we'd be marching around the White House,'' Representative Emanuel Cleaver II of Missouri, the chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, told The Root last month. ''The president knows we are going to act in deference to him in a way we wouldn't to someone white.''
Some of the reticence stems from fear. ''If we go after the president too hard, you're going after us,'' Representative Maxine Waters, a California Democrat, told a largely black audience in Detroit last year.
But caution explains only so much. Representative John Lewis of Georgia, one of King's last living disciples, has not used his moral stature to criticize the president's silence about the poor. Neither have leaders of the biggest civil rights organizations, like Benjamin Todd Jealous of the N.A.A.C.P., Marc H. Morial of the National Urban League or Wade Henderson of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, whether because of emotional allegiance or pragmatic accommodation.
The two black governors elected since Reconstruction -- L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia and Deval L. Patrick of Massachusetts -- have also de-emphasized race. So, too, have the new cadre of black politicians who serve largely black constituencies, like Mayor Cory A. Booker of Newark, Mayor Michael A. Nutter of Philadelphia and Representative Terri Sewell of Alabama -- all of whom, like Mr. Obama, have Ivy League degrees and rarely discuss the impact of racism on contemporary black life.
Some argue that de-emphasizing race -- and moving to a ''colorblind'' politics -- is an inevitable and beneficial byproduct of societal change. But this ideal is a myth, even if it's nice to hear. As Frederick Douglass observed, ''Power concedes nothing without a demand.'' The political scientist E. E. Schattschneider noted that conflict was essential to agenda-setting. Other interest groups -- Tea Party activists, environmentalists, advocates for gay and lesbian rights, supporters of Israel and, most of all, rich and large corporations -- grasp this insight. Have African-Americans forgotten it?
IN making this case, I have avoided speculation about Mr. Obama's psychology and background -- his biracial heritage, his transnational childhood, his community organizing, his aversion to being seen as ''angry,'' his canny ability to navigate multiple worlds, his talent at engaging with politics while appearing detached from it. As a social scientist I keep returning to the question: What is the best strategy for black communities to pursue their political interests as a whole?
Were Harold Cruse, the author of the unsparing 1967 book ''The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual,'' still alive, he would despair at the state of black intellectual life. Eddie S. Glaude Jr., a professor of religion and African-American studies at Princeton, told me: ''Too many black intellectuals have given up the hard work of thinking carefully in public about the crisis facing black America. We have either become cheerleaders for President Obama or self-serving pundits.''
There are exceptions. Writing in the journal Daedalus last year, the Harvard philosopher Tommie Shelby called Mr. Obama's approach ''a pragmatic strategy for navigating hazardous racial waters'' that might improve lives for poor minorities. But he added: ''Judged alongside King's transformative vision of racial equality and integration, Obama's philosophy is morally deficient and uninspiring.''
Mr. Obama deserves the electoral support -- but not the uncritical adulation -- of African-Americans. If re-elected he might surprise us by explicitly emphasizing economic and racial justice and advocating ''targeted universalism'' -- job-training and housing programs that are open to all, but are concentrated in low-income, minority communities. He would have to do this in the face of fiscal crisis and poisonous partisanship.
Amid such rancor, African-Americans might come to realize that the idea of having any politician as a role model is incompatible with accountability, the central tenet of representative democracy. By definition, role models are placed on pedestals and emulated, not criticized or held accountable.
To place policy above rhetoric is not to ask what the first black president is doing for blacks; rather, it is to ask what a Democratic president is doing for the most loyal Democratic constituency -- who happen to be African-Americans, and who happen to be in dire need of help. Sadly, when it comes to the Obama presidency and black America, symbols and substance have too often been assumed to be one and the same.

HEADLINE: Obama's Squandered Advantages

BYLINE: By FRANK BRUNI

 BODY:
AFTER ''a couple of Cadillacs,'' a summer belly-flop abroad, a dismissive swipe at 47 percent of the population and a convention best remembered for Clint Eastwood's chat with a chair, Mitt Romney is seemingly tied with President Obama. He has a real chance. It's a remarkable turn of events, given how many errors he's made and how ill suited he is to this particular juncture in the American story. And to size up the situation honestly is to consider one conclusion as seriously as any other:
Obama isn't quite the candidate, or politician, he's cracked up to be. The One is a fraction of his reputed self.
Yes, I know: the economy. It's supposedly the source of most of his woes, the great weight he lugs around, a nearly fatal handicap. And the fact that he's doing as well as he is affirms the sway of his personality and sense of his policies, at least according to his most fervent admirers. 
I don't buy it. For starters, a great many Americans understand that he doesn't bear primary responsibility for the high rate of unemployment and the drops in home prices and incomes. A CNN/ORC poll last month showed that 54 percent of likely voters placed the blame chiefly on George W. Bush and Republicans.
Additionally, 68 percent indicated some optimism about economic conditions, which they said would be ''somewhat good'' or ''very good'' in a year. There's room in those numbers for Obama to pull well ahead of a rival as profoundly flawed as Romney. Yet he hasn't.
Race isn't a sufficient explanation. It has flared in subtle and unsubtle ways during this campaign, but if a majority of Americans were too biased to vote for a black man, Obama wouldn't have beaten John McCain by nearly 200 electoral votes last time around. In fact Obama's 52.9 percent of the popular vote was a bigger number than all but three other Democrats in American history have reached.
And ''super PACs'' aren't doing Obama in. Things could change in this final stretch, but until now, he hasn't been buried under the avalanche of Republican ads that, six months ago, Democrats were terrified about. Obama and his supporters have in fact run more commercials, which seem to have reached a larger audience in some key battlegrounds, than Romney & Co. have.
Obama has enjoyed other advantages as well. He didn't go through a contested primary, and as Matt Bai recently observed in The Times's Sunday magazine, all three of the incumbent presidents who lost their re-election bids over the last 36 years were weakened by primary challengers. Romney, meanwhile, endured an ugly primary that tugged him to the right of most swing voters and teed him up for the shape-shifting he has attempted -- and been justly dinged for -- over the last month.
Romney is further tarnished by association with a Republican Party that seems to be accommodating more and clumsier extremists, whose statements -- like the one that Richard Mourdock, a Senate candidate from Indiana, made about abortion and rape -- cause him recurring grief. That's not to mention the party's grandstanding windbags, two of whom -- Donald Trump and John Sununu, a co-chairman of Romney's campaign -- were in full and demented flower over the last few days.
The country's changing demographics favor Obama, as he acknowledged to The Des Moines Register last week, saying that the Latino vote could seal his victory. Incumbency has its benefits, too. Earlier this year, he sidestepped a bickering, paralyzed Congress and pleased many Latino voters with an executive order that will probably spare hundreds of thousands of young immigrants deportation for at least two years.
But Obama's greatest gift has been Romney himself, whose wealth, his tin-eared allusions to it, his offshore accounts and his unreleased tax returns are an especially awkward fit for a moment of increased anxiety about income inequality.
A ''Saturday Night Live'' skit from before the debates summarized this archly.
''Our campaign has a secret weapon,'' says Obama.
The camera cuts to Romney at a rally. ''I understand the hardships facing ordinary Americans,'' he says. ''One of my horses failed to medal at the Olympics.''
Back to Obama, who croons ''Let's Stay Together.''
And then to Romney, who warbles ''Old MacDonald Had a Farm,'' declaring the song ''pretty groovy.''
Obama smiles: ''The man is a Christmas miracle.''
THE miracle ended at the first debate, in Denver, and the problem with that face-off went beyond Obama's sleepwalking to the kinds of subsequent debates it forced on him. To shake off what happened, he had to turn truculent, and while that technically ''won'' him his second and third meetings with Romney, he lost something in the bargain. He undercut his high-minded, big-vision brand, whole stanzas of doggerel intruding on the poetry.
His ''bayonets'' line was clever all right, and plenty fair in its way, but it had a schoolyard nastiness to it, the same nastiness in one of his campaign's most prominent ads, which showcases Romney's off-key rendition of ''America the Beautiful.'' I wonder how that line, that ad and the overall atmospherics register with voters in the middle, some of whom are no doubt asking themselves where ''hope and change'' went and hid.
The main cause for this contest's closeness is arguably Obama -- and the ways in which he has disappointed, confused and alienated some of the voters who warmed and even thrilled to him four years ago. During his first term, he at times misjudged and mishandled his Republican opposition. As a communicator, he repeatedly failed to sell his policies clearly and forcefully enough.
His tone is markedly changed from 2008, a tactical decision that may not be the right one. And his moments of genuine oratorical transcendence are interspersed, as they've always been, with spells of detachment, defensiveness, disgruntlement. Denver wasn't the first or only time that he seemed put out by the madness of the political merry-go-round, even though it's a whirl he himself elected.
I still think he'll win this thing, and I think he'll win it because he's a seriously intelligent, thoughtful leader more in tune and in touch with Americans' lives than his sheltered opponent is. He still has poetry in him, and he still has fight. But this campaign has illuminated nothing so brightly as the limits of his magic, along with shortcomings that he would carry with him into a second term (should he get one) and would be wise to address.

HEADLINE: In Final Days of the Race, Fighting County by County

BYLINE: By JEFF ZELENY and JIM RUTENBERG; Jeff Zeleny reported from Westerville, Ohio, and Jim Rutenberg from Chicago.

 BODY:
WESTERVILLE, Ohio -- President Obama and Mitt Romney are plunging into the final nine days of a multibillion-dollar presidential race focused not only on the seven most competitive states, but also on battleground counties within them that could tip the balance of an exceedingly close contest.
They include the suburbs here in Franklin County, Ohio, where many young married women turned to Mr. Obama in 2008 out of frustration with the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan but could turn against him now for perceived failures on his campaign promises and a slow-to-recover economy.
In Colorado, the contested territory is Arapahoe County, where Mr. Romney's campaign is courting Hispanic business owners who are frustrated with the national health care law. It is Hillsborough County in Florida, where both sides agree that whoever wins the independent voters is likely to be president.
At this late stage of the race, the fight for the White House is being waged on intensely local terrain, in places whose voting histories and demographics have been studied in minute detail by both sides. Mr. Obama is intent on replicating an electorate that swept him into office four years ago and is heavily dependent on younger, female and minority voters. Mr. Romney is relying on an older, whiter and more conservative voting group, along the lines of the ones that turned out in 2004 and 2010. 
The Romney campaign, worried about its options in the seven top battleground states, opened a fund-raising drive on Saturday to try to expand the playing field into Pennsylvania and Minnesota, two states that Mr. Obama has considered safe. Mr. Romney is also making a deeper push this week into Wisconsin, which he will visit for the first time in two months.
''The switch that went on after that first debate is still on,'' said Gov. Scott Walker of Wisconsin, a Republican. ''I still think people are undecided, they are still listening.''
Obama loyalists are wondering whether the campaign organization, with its focus on the mechanics of getting its voters to the polls, was built to withstand late decisions by voters to give Mr. Romney another look. The president flew to New Hampshire on Saturday -- the last day to register to vote by mail -- to protect the state's four electoral votes in hopes of avoiding a narrow loss or an Electoral College tie.
The biggest fear for Mr. Obama's team is that a large number of voters suddenly will get so fed up with the back-and-forth of the campaign, the economic outlook and the partisan rancor that they break for Mr. Romney, if only to try something new in Washington.
The biggest fear for Mr. Romney's campaign is that he is coasting on a wave of enthusiasm rather than building upon it. Or in the words of one top campaign adviser: ''Did we peak too soon?''
Mr. Obama now has a solid lead in states that account for 185 electoral votes, and he is well positioned in states representing 58 more, for a total of 243, according to a ranking of states by The New York Times, based on polls and interviews with strategists in both campaigns.
Mr. Romney has solid leads in states with 180 electoral votes and is well positioned in states with 26 more, according to the Times rating, for a total of 206. It takes 270 electoral votes to win the presidency.
In the closing days of the race, seven states representing 89 electoral votes -- Colorado, Florida, Iowa, New Hampshire, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin -- are now considered tossups. Here is a look at their dynamics and the potential path for each candidate.
Florida
Mr. Romney's swing through Florida on Saturday -- the first day of in-person early voting there -- included a visit to a Republican county in the Panhandle where he wants to pump up his vote count (Escambia) and where a huge crowd met him with chants of ''10 more days,'' a Democratic county where he wants to cut into Mr. Obama's expected lead (Osceola), and a swing county (Pasco).
For good reason.
Mr. Romney cannot afford to leave any base untouched. If he loses Florida, his chances of winning the presidency depend on sweeping nine other states, including Ohio and Nevada.
Florida has been considered challenging territory for Mr. Obama all year. Even when polls have shown him ahead, both campaigns have expressed skepticism that the edge would hold.
But at Mr. Obama's headquarters in Chicago, his aides said in interviews last week that they believed they had at least a 50 percent shot in Florida, based on mail-in ballots, voter registrations and polling. A new wave of Puerto Rican voters in Central Florida is highly influential, Democrats say, along with younger Cuban-Americans in South Florida.
Republicans, still bullish about victory, say Mr. Obama's aides are overestimating his support among Puerto Ricans. And, they said, Mr. Romney can rely on a very strong showing in Polk County, a Republican stronghold, and push for an edge in the swing county of Hillsborough as well as in Volusia County, home to Daytona.
New Hampshire
On Mr. Obama's trip on Saturday to Nashua, N.H., with the singer James Taylor in tow, he wooed a state that revels in its reputation for unpredictability. In a stop at a union hall, he said, ''We don't know how this thing is going to play out.''
Mr. Obama won every county there in 2008, a feat that even Bill Clinton did not pull off in 1992 and 1996. But Mr. Obama's sometimes comfortable lead in polls has dwindled.
Mr. Romney's aides have been somewhat optimistic about his chances in the state. He was the governor in Massachusetts next door, and he vacations there. His lakeside home in Wolfeboro is in Carroll County, which he will need to win.
He and his campaign have plied the state's two traditionally Republican-leaning counties in southern New Hampshire -- Rockingham and Hillsborough -- with attention since he announced his run for the presidency (in the Rockingham town of Stratham). His assertions that Mr. Obama has allowed the budget deficit and national debt to get out of control speaks to the state's long tradition of thrift.
New Hampshire has only four Electoral College votes. But they would make all the difference if Mr. Romney also wins Florida, North Carolina, Virginia and Ohio and Mr. Obama takes Nevada, Colorado, Iowa and Wisconsin.
The state has extra resonance for Democrats: if Al Gore had won there, he would have been president.
Colorado
There is a potential outcome that has tantalized political addicts everywhere: that Colorado will become the new Florida, the state that decides it all.
For it to come to that, Mr. Romney must win four of the most competitive states -- New Hampshire, Virginia, Florida and Wisconsin -- leaving Mr. Obama with Ohio and Iowa. That would give Mr. Romney 262 Electoral College votes to Mr. Obama's 267, leaving both in need of Colorado's 9. In 2008, Mr. Obama became the first Democrat to win the state in 16 years by stealing the counties north and south of Boulder -- Jefferson and Larimer -- and Arapahoe County near Denver and by shaving down the Republican margin in conservative areas like Colorado Springs.
A Wall Street Journal/NBC News/Marist College poll released on Thursday showed Mr. Obama and Mr. Romney to be tied among likely voters.
Democrats are counting on Hispanic and young voters and what they say is a superior organization. ''The closer and closer we get to the election, the more the organizing matters,'' said Senator Michael Bennet, a Colorado Democrat.
Mr. Romney is trying to cut into Mr. Obama's advantage with Hispanics and hoping for support from military and evangelical voters. His political director, Rich Beeson, has an added incentive to secure victory there: It is his home state.
Iowa
No state among the battlegrounds is more sentimental and symbolic to Mr. Obama. Iowa christened his presidential candidacy in 2008; his victory in the caucuses there helped pave the way to his winning the Democratic nomination.
Iowa's unemployment rate is significantly lower than the national average, but Mr. Obama has campaigned in the state as if his candidacy depended upon it. And perhaps it does.
Mr. Romney is looking for backup options if the battleground map does not tilt his way. And the six electoral votes in Iowa could be a critical piece to that puzzle.
The suburban areas around Des Moines (Polk County) and Davenport (Scott County) are crucial for both candidates. The Des Moines Register, whose editorial pages supported Mr. Obama in 2008, announced its endorsement of Mr. Romney on Saturday evening, saying he ''offers a fresh economic vision.''
Social conservatives are working to deliver a record turnout in northwestern Iowa. Democrats are taking steps to keep outpacing Republicans in early voting, which means Mr. Romney will have to deliver a strong performance on Election Day to win. Four years ago, Mr. Obama received fewer votes on Election Day than Senator John McCain, but still carried the state because of the ones he banked early.
Ohio
Mr. Romney spent four of the last five days in the state trying to break through with middle-class voters, making the case that the recovery under Mr. Obama has been inadequate. With 18 electoral votes at stake, both candidates are treating the state as if they were running for governor.
To win, Mr. Romney needs added strength in rural and suburban areas, where Mr. Obama drew more support in 2008 than did previous Democratic candidates. On Sunday night, Mr. Romney will hold a rally at the fairgrounds in Marion, Ohio, a Republican-leaning county, where he needs the margin of victory to return to the levels seen in 2004.
The results in Cincinnati, in Hamilton County, will be among the closest watched in the country. The county supported Mr. Obama in 2008 -- the first time a Democrat won in four decades -- and is one of the most highly-competitive this year.
''You want to peak at the right time, and we are peaking at the right time,'' said Scott Jennings, the Ohio campaign manager for Mr. Romney.
Before Election Day, officials estimate that at least one-third of registered voters will have already cast their ballots.
Virginia
Virginia is vital to almost every one of Mr. Romney's paths to the White House if he does not win Ohio, which explains why he has spent so much time visiting the state, including what were to be three rallies on Sunday before they were canceled because of Hurricane Sandy.
Mr. Obama was the first Democrat to win the state since 1964. The tide he rode among black voters in places like Hampton, on the coast, is likely to roll again. And the northern part of the state, in the Washington area, is still considered Obama country.
Mr. Romney has focused much of his effort in areas like those around Norfolk, heavily populated with military personnel, where he asserts that Mr. Obama has allowed the Navy to wither, and in coal-mining country in the south, where he portrays Mr. Obama as hostile to the industry and quick to impose costly regulations on business.
A run of polls in the late summer showed Mr. Obama to be on his way to establishing a real advantage, but in recent weeks the race has fallen into an effective tie. Mr. Romney's improving standing among undecided women after the debates -- which he stoked with an advertisement that sought to soften his stance against abortion -- made Mr. Obama's aides especially nervous.
The president's campaign has been buoyed by recent indications that those wavering women in the north seem to be returning to his column, especially as Democrats remind them of the anti-abortion measures that state Republicans pursued this year.
Wisconsin
The 2008 presidential election, when Mr. Obama carried the state by 14 percentage points, is a distant memory. The electorate is far more polarized this year, particularly after the contentious recall attempt of Mr. Walker in June, which failed.
The organization that Mr. Walker put together to fend off the recall effort by labor unions is the muscle behind Mr. Romney's on-the-ground operation. In an interview last week, he said, ''We set the stage for the Romney campaign before the Romney campaign was fully engaged.''
Another factor is the pride that comes from a native son, Representative Paul D. Ryan, on the ticket. His hometown, Janesville, is a strong Democratic-leaning city, so any votes he wins from there could help the Republican margins in a race that both sides agree seems more like 2000 and 2004, when George W. Bush lost by only a sliver.
Mr. Romney is set to campaign in the state on Monday, focusing on Milwaukee and the suburbs of Waukesha County that offer the biggest Republican margins in the state.
A day later, Mr. Obama is scheduled to visit Green Bay. In 2008, he turned many counties in the Fox River Valley from red to blue. Consider the results of Brown County: Mr. Bush defeated Senator John Kerry by 10 percentage points, while four years later Mr. Obama defeated Mr. McCain by nearly the same margin.
The Romney campaign does not consider Wisconsin one of its best prospects, but a victory would break the Midwestern firewall that Mr. Obama is trying to build. And if Mr. Romney could win the state's 10 electoral votes -- coupled with Colorado's 9 -- it would counterbalance a potential loss in Ohio.

HEADLINE: The Upstairs, Downstairs, Sideways Move

BYLINE: By ROBIN FINN

 BODY:
RATHER than surrendering their weekends to endless tours of the open-house circuit, or scrolling at all hours through infinite online listings, some shelter-seekers intent on altering or upgrading their living space are buying local, very local. They are sticking with the building they already live in.
Marjorie Kessler, an insurance broker, is on her third apartment at 315 East 70th Street, a white-brick co-op where she started out in a rented 400-square-foot studio in 1995.
The following year, despite fears of outgrowing it, she bought the studio for the insider price of $65,000; she couldn't pass up the opportunity to own in a building that was beginning to feel like home. 
''The financials are strong,'' she said. ''I love my doorman, never have to wait for the elevator, and having a garage right downstairs is important.'' (She has offices on Long Island and in New Jersey.) She also loves the insider price on her indoor parking spot, $330 per month.
In 2002, when Ms. Kessler found out that a neighbor down the hall was selling a 950-square-foot one-bedroom, she bought it for $325,000, after selling the studio for $175,000.
''Part of the staying is because I work a lot,'' she said, ''and having to go through the whole drawn-out process of looking for an apartment and dealing with the garage issue just doesn't make sense to me.''
This year, as a 50th birthday present to herself, she sold the one-bedroom and upgraded to a spacious $930,000 two-bedroom two-bath unit on the 10th floor, with the help of Victoria Matus of Brown Harris Stevens. A gut renovation is in progress.
''No more moves,'' Ms. Kessler vowed. ''This is it for me until I hit the nursing home.''
For whatever reason -- they adore the doorman, the garage, the neighbors, the school district, the modest maintenance fees -- some residents are demonstrating the ultimate in brand loyalty: they are true to their buildings.
But the proliferation of homebodies is also traceable to a mercurial economic climate in which risk-taking can backfire, a diminishing inventory of attractive apartments, and finicky co-op boards seemingly bent on putting a crimp in people's wanderlust and wallets. For sellers, there is the incentive of a potentially streamlined approval process if buyers are already residents.
''A lot of people see moving as a psychological disruption,'' said Tracie Hamersley, a senior vice president of Citi Habitats, ''and to me this is a way of moving that minimizes the disruption as much as possible.
''It speaks to someone's comfort level with a building when they make the decision to move within it.''
At the Sovereign, a high-rise at 425 East 58th Street, 7 of 11 sales recorded last year were to shareholders who traded up or down, or expanded their homes, according to Leslie Axman, a sales director there for Prudential Douglas Elliman.
Two of them, a married couple in their 80s who were longtime Sovereign residents, divorced last year.
But neither wanted to leave, so Ms. Axman stepped in. ''I found the husband a fantastic bachelor pad right in the building,'' she said.
Jonathan J. Miller, the president of Miller Samuel, a property appraiser, says the trend of moving up rather than out has gained traction. ''I'm seeing more in-house sales activity,'' he noted. ''As buyers have fewer choices, they are more aware and more aggressive about finding apartments closer to home.
''One advantage is there is less of a challenge to pass the co-op board if they're already a shareholder and understand how the building is run.''
But there's a footnote: a resident seeking to trade up in a building can run into problems if he or she is perceived as a troublemaker.
''The only potential caveat with trade-ups,'' said Pamela D'Arc, an executive vice president of Stribling & Associates, is whether the building is amenable to that troublesome buyer's ''having a bigger financial stake.''
230 Riverside Drive
Jacob Zimlichman, a global marketing director for Merck Pharmaceutical, traversed the Upper West Side for a decade, moving from 73rd Street to 79th Street to 83rd Street to 95th Street.
But after he and Richie Tran, a physician, were married in 2006, they went on the hunt for a prewar condominium on a residential block. In 2007, they paid around $1 million for a renovated two-bedroom one-bath sixth-floor unit in peerless shape at 230 Riverside Drive.
That same year Dr. Tran's cousin bought a studio on the 11th floor.
The next year, a mutual friend moved to the building, and Mr. Zimlichman bought a one-bedroom unit on the 19th floor ''as an investment just because we liked the building so much,'' he said.
''In the back of my mind I was thinking it could be an option if my mother ever decides to move to the States from Tel Aviv.'' (That unit is currently rented out through his broker, Cord J. Stahl of Town Residential.)
''Living here started to remind us of Jerry and Kramer from 'Seinfeld,' '' Mr. Zimlichman said. ''It was like a family.'' It felt even more like family when they decided to add a baby boy, Aiden, now
2 1/2, to the mix. It also became cramped.
''We realized our apartment was not ideal for two men and a baby,'' he said, ''so we looked for a bigger unit here, but there was nothing available at the time. I had not exhibited building loyalty before, but with a family, location and routines mattered a lot more.''
Mr. Zimlichman was returning from work one Friday when he ran into his next-door neighbor, who informed him he was moving out.
Mr. Zimlichman took a quick look at his place, No. 6N, an unrenovated sponsor unit. The asking price was $520,000, and there were already offers. He put in a pre-emptive bid.
''Bidding more than asking price was not something frequently done in 2010,'' Mr. Zimlichman said. ''But from the standpoint of buying and combining, it was ideal.''
Last year the family moved into the finished product, a three-bedroom two-bath exercise in total customization.
''We really had a preference for staying in our building,'' Mr. Zimlichman said, ''and if we hadn't come across this, we might have compromised and left.
''How often do you get an opportunity to design your own space? We got to create our own dream apartment in a building we trust.''
568 Grand Street
Michael Kelly, an actor whose role in the 2008 Clint Eastwood film ''The Changeling'' upgraded both his career and his residential buying power, and his wife, Karyn Mendel, a personal trainer, were committed to their first purchase, a one-bedroom unit with a balcony at 570 Grand Street for $332,000.
But soon after they moved in, he was smitten by a terrace at the adjacent tower, 568 Grand.
''I looked up and saw this great terrace and thought, 'I want that one,' '' said Mr. Kelly, whose latest project is a Netflix series, ''House of Cards.''
Through Neal Young of Halstead Property, Mr. Kelly sold the first apartment for $545,000 and bought the spectacular 270-square-foot-terrace and its adjoining 18th-floor unit for $600,000. With the assistance of Gregory Colston, an architect who himself upgraded there, he transformed the 800-square-foot place into a two-bedroom apartment for his family, which now included a daughter.
''Where else can you go in the city,'' Mr. Kelly said, ''and have what we have -- great views, affordable parking, a playground, East River Park and enormous square footage for the money?''
He and his wife liked the 18th floor so much that, with a second child anticipated, they spoke to a neighbor about annexing his unit: no luck. Then, when Mr. Kelly learned from a friend on the co-op board that someone in a top-floor two-bedroom without a terrace was interested in selling, he arranged to buy it directly from the owner for $460,000.
He listed what he calls the ''superterrace'' with Mr. Young (it's now in contract; the asking price was $699,000), and commissioned Mr. Colston to reimagine the 1,150-square-foot top-floor space as a three-bedroom two-bath castle in the sky.
''The walls are going up now,'' Mr. Kelly said. ''We really didn't want to leave the 18th floor, but the more we talked about it, did we really want to worry about chasing two kids around the terrace?''
The vertical move solved the problem without leaving them vista-deprived.
''Word of mouth can be golden around here,'' Mr. Young said of the intramural deal-making.
515 West End Avenue
Bill Rosenblatt and Jessica Lustig found nirvana on West End Avenue in the two-bedroom two-bath move-in-condition apartment that they bought for $440,000 in 1998: a quiet block, a solid building, and, since both consider themselves ''serious'' cooks, a quick traipse to Zabar's and Fairway.
Over time, they renovated the kitchen and one bathroom, had a daughter, Margot, now 11, and settled in for the long haul. When Ms. Lustig, who represents classical musicians, became pregnant again, they didn't panic. Not until they found out their second child was a boy, Alex, now 9.
''It was like the sword of Damocles hanging over our heads,'' said Mr. Rosenblatt, a media technology consultant, ''and for several years, avoidance and denial worked well for us.'' So did bunk beds. They hated the prospect of leaving 515 West End. ''When I carried each kid home from the hospital,'' he said, ''the first person they met was Bobby, our morning doorman.''
They were saved by an internal intervention: an unsolicited postcard from Ms. D'Arc of Stribling & Associates, who had an exclusive listing on a Classic 5 just downstairs. ''They weren't actively looking,'' she said, ''but we were able to accomplish that fragile balance of buying and selling in tandem.''
Mr. Rosenblatt and Ms. Lustig moved in last year after a gut renovation. ''We never actively dreamed that we could stay in our building,'' she said.
''Anytime you move and have kids,'' he added, ''it's going to uproot them. But this was the least painful change you could possibly imagine.''
50 Park Avenue
Barbara Wilson of Halstead Property, the agent for a $995,000 one-bedroom penthouse at 50 Park Avenue near East 37th Street, was not exactly encouraging when she heard from Geoffrey Black, an interior designer who lived downstairs in No. 6C.
''She told me there was already a contract out and something like 17 backup bids,'' Mr. Black said, ''and I said, 'Show it to me anyway.' ''
She did. ''He was very persistent,'' Ms. Wilson said. ''I could sense he really wanted it.''
Mr. Black had lived in the building since 2001. He had come very close to buying somewhere else, on Lexington Avenue, when his broker called and told him about a board turndown on another buyer for 6C. ''It had everything on my must-have list,'' he said, ''and for the same $500,000 I'd been going to spend on the other place, the cachet of a Park Avenue address.''
Mr. Black bought 6C, redid the kitchen and bathroom, and was content until 2008, when his terrace fixation led him across the street to 35 Park Avenue. There he giddily agreed to pay $1.35 million for an apartment with a large terrace. His elation was short-lived: the board at 50 Park turned down his buyer and his deal fell through.
This spring, while perusing a Streeteasy listing for a client's apartment, on a whim he punched in his dream apartment criteria: large one-bedroom, gigantic terrace. ''And bingo, there it was, right in my own building!''
He issued a mandate to Ms. Wilson. ''I told her I was offering 10 percent above the asking price, that it was my final offer, and I wanted an answer, yes or no, within 24 hours.'' Mr. Black also told her that he would list 6C with her if she could put him in the penthouse.
This time his deal held up on both sides. He and his buyers received board approval on Sept. 25.
''It is magnificent,'' he said.
128 Willow, Brooklyn Heights
After five years renting an apartment in Park Slope with a roommate, Allison Page began canvassing her neighborhood for a place to buy in 2002.
Her budget was $300,000 for a one-bedroom, and she had a helper, her father, who flew up several times from Tennessee to accompany her to open houses.
On one of those weekends, he made an appointment to check out a one-bedroom in Brooklyn Heights.
Ms. Page was doubtful about leaving the Slope, and the $325,000 asking price was out of her league, but off they went, she figured, to window-shop.
Not so.
''When we walked down the street and arrived at 128 Willow,'' Ms. Page recalled, ''he announced that this was the most beautiful building on the most beautiful block in the most beautiful neighborhood in all of New York City.''
Then they went inside and saw No. 4E: renovated, sun-splashed, a view of Lower Manhattan from the windowed kitchen.
With financial assistance from her parents, she was able to buy it. Not long afterward, she fell in love with the neighbor in 4D, Connor Coffey, an assistant vice president of AXA Equitable.
They married, he sold 4D, and a few years later they bought 5C, a two-bedroom, but held onto 4E for her parents to use on visits.
In 2009, their first child was born and they needed more space, so they sold 5C and bought a three-bedroom that faces the building's courtyard.
They lived in 4E while renovating the new unit, and later sold 4E to finance the renovation. They moved in this spring, and a month later had their second child.
''I already loved the building,'' said Ms. Page, a senior vice president of the Food Network and Cooking Channel, ''but falling in love with my neighbor made me even more committed to staying here.
''We didn't stay because it made great financial sense -- we made money on one sale, but lost just as much on the other. The parking here is terrible, there are no great restaurants, and we'd have more room if we moved to Ditmas Park or Windsor Terrace or 10 other beautiful Brooklyn neighborhoods.''
But home being where the heart is, four apartments later, Willow Street is more home than ever.

HEADLINE: When It Works In New York, They Take It On the Road

BYLINE: By ALEXEI BARRIONUEVO

 BODY:
WANDER around any number of cities, and you can see on signs and awnings just how much people want to bask in the reflective glow of New York. Far from Manhattan, there are countless New York-style delis selling New York-style cheesecake, of course. And now a lot of cities appear to want to brag that they have New York-style architecture.
The recession may have slowed the development of luxury towers in Manhattan, but it didn't stop some brand-name architects from signing up overseas clients -- particularly in the developing world -- who are eager to stamp their distinctive styles on new buildings.
Consider Richard Meier, the master of the color white, who of late has been designing the tallest residential tower in Tel Aviv, a hotel in South Korea and two dozen homes in the seaside town of Bodrum in Turkey. 
Or Robert A. M. Stern, who was commissioned to design a whole neighborhood on an island in China, with eight towers that will look strikingly similar to his limestone monument to Old New York, 15 Central Park West.
''Why do they come to us? Because of 15 Central Park West,'' Mr. Stern, 73, said earlier this month from his office on the West Side of Manhattan. The Chinese ''don't want to go home at night to their three-bedroom shelf on the 44th floor,'' he added. ''They want to live in a place. That's what we do: we're place-makers.''
That seems true of Mr. Stern's most ambitious overseas project to date, a two-million-square-foot residential development in Xiamen, a coastal city in southeastern China.
Robert A. M. Stern Architects designed a mix of high- and midrise apartments, as well as town houses and single-family villas, on the 25-acre site.
The pictures and renderings of the project, dubbed ''Heart of Lake,'' suggest a more appropriate name for the development might be ''Sternville.'' Rising above the lower-rise structures will be eight towers -- the tallest will have 56 stories -- that look like mini-15 Central Park Wests. The style of windows and use of courtyards, even the look of the stone exterior, all seem very familiar (though I was told they are using a Chinese granite in place of the limestone Mr. Stern favored in New York).
''We didn't request that style, but it turned out that way,'' said Shu Wen, the manager of the design department for Vanke in Xiamen. China's largest residential developer, Vanke is building Heart of Lake and says it is pleased with the design.
Still, the look and ''lifestyle'' offered at 15 Central Park West and another luxury high-rise Mr. Stern designed in Toronto, at One St. Thomas Street, clearly were factors in awarding the job to Stern Architects over two other firms, Vanke executives said.
Heart of Lake is selling fast. Already three towers have sold out, and the first phase of the project, which estimates suggest will eventually cost up to 5 billion yuan (about $800 million), is to open at the end of this year, Mr. Shu said. Residences range from $464 a square foot, for tower apartments, to $1,636 a square foot for town houses. Each tower will have two penthouses with terraces; one penthouse of about 4,000 square feet recently sold for $3.5 million.
The neighborhood will be the highest-end development in Xiamen, with prices about double what residences typically cost there, Mr. Shu said. Heart of Lake's streets will be pedestrian-only -- all parking will be underground -- and a stately clubhouse for the 3,000 people expected to live there will house the kind of recreational facilities found at 15 Central Park West.
Mr. Stern's work on the Midtown tower is paying dividends in other ways. The Win Sing Development Company from Taiwan toured 15 Central Park West and soon afterward hired Stern Architects to design a smaller building in Taipei, Mr. Stern said.
Even as sales continue on the Manhattan condo makeover at 18 Gramercy Park -- which has brought Mr. Stern together again with the developers of 15 Central Park West -- Stern Architects is working in a handful of countries it had never worked in before, including India and Singapore. In 2011, about 25 percent of Stern Architects' work was overseas, up from 15 percent in 2007, the company said.
And aside from Xiamen, Stern Architects has been working on eight projects in China, including a residential complex in Shanghai and a mixed-use development in Dalian.
For the 78-year-old Mr. Meier, the spike in foreign work has been more pronounced. About 80 percent of Richard Meier & Partners Architects' projects today are overseas and 20 percent in the United States, up from about 50-50 before the recession. The firm is developing its first projects in 11 countries, including China, Israel, Turkey, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. The projects run the gamut, from office buildings to residential towers, from hotels to single-family homes.
Mr. Meier, who in his early days was one of the ''New York 5'' -- a group of architects all thought to hew to a pure form of architectural modernism -- is perhaps most famous for designing the Getty Center in Los Angeles. He is no stranger to overseas work, having designed the Barcelona Museum of Contemporary Art and the Ara Pacis Museum in Rome.
Some global fans of his modern architecture have sought to market his brand in places where Mr. Meier hasn't had a presence before. The billionaire German-American investor Nicolas Berggruen has backed Mr. Meier's involvement in designing a 39-story residential tower in Tel Aviv and 21 single-family homes in Bodrum.
For the wealthy, ''architecture is a different form of art,'' said Ali Pamir, the Turkish developer of the Bodrum project. ''And architecture is becoming collectible.''
The homes, which will range from 5,000 to 6,000 square feet on lots of a little over an acre, are being built on a hillside overlooking the Aegean Sea. So far one has gone up and is on the market for $5 million.
Mr. Pamir said he was marketing the houses to wealthy Turks in Istanbul and foreigners in London. Part of the pitch is the chance for buyers to ''sit down and share an experience with a master architect like Meier.''
He is now on the hunt for a development in Istanbul that would interest Mr. Meier.
''Architects like Richard Meier have accomplished so much in their own countries that they are looking for a different challenge,'' Mr. Pamir said. ''There is a lot of satisfaction to transport your vision to other cultures and other countries. They are seeing what they can do on a global scale.''
Mr. Meier, while grateful for the work abroad, still laments the lack of projects in the town where he has worked in the same office, at 10th Avenue and 36th Street, for over 40 years.
''You used to look out that window and somewhere you would see a crane,'' he said a few days ago. ''You go around New York City today and you don't see that many cranes. It is just not happening at this moment.''
''Obviously,'' he added, ''if the economy in this country stays the way it's been, we are happy to be working all over the world. I wish we had a project in New York City, but we don't.''

HEADLINE: The Perils of Feeding A Bloated Industry

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
THEY say the wheels of justice grind slowly, but should it really have taken more than five years for the Justice Department to discover that Countrywide Financial, the mortgage mania's top creator of risky loans, dumped a load of that junk on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac?
Last week, the Justice Department filed a civil suit against Countrywide and its acquirer, Bank of America, seeking to recover $1 billion in losses suffered by Fannie and Freddie, now taxpayer-owned, from 2007 to 2009. Preet Bharara, the United States attorney in Manhattan who brought the case, said Countrywide was accused of conduct ''spectacularly brazen in scope.'' 
In case you've been away from Planet Earth these past five years, Countrywide was legendary for its toxic loans and aggressive sales tactics. And its close ties to Fannie Mae have long been detailed in public documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. For example, Countrywide was Fannie Mae's biggest supplier of mortgages, many of which were Countrywide's famous ''Fast and Easy'' loans. As for subprime loans, in 2005 alone, Countrywide sold $12.5 billion worth of risky mortgages to Fannie Mae.
Still, if the Justice Department's lawsuit keeps taxpayers focused on the high societal costs that financial institutions like Countrywide have inflicted, that is all to the good. This is especially true given the immensity of the financial services industry and the power it continues to wield.
It is worth remembering that the credit crisis and ensuing economic downturn followed a spectacular expansion in the financial business, compared with other industries. Assessing the nature of that growth and whether it has benefited society is the subject of powerful new research by David Scharfstein and Robin Greenwood, professors at Harvard Business School.
In their study, ''The Growth of Modern Finance,'' the professors delve into figures showing that the financial industry accounted for 7.9 percent of the nation's gross domestic product in 2007, up from 2.8 percent in 1950 and 4.9 percent in 1980. Finance's share of G.D.P. grew faster since 1980, they found, than it did in the previous three decades.
Other academics have tracked this meteoric rise and questioned its benefits. But Mr. Scharfstein and Mr. Greenwood go further, identifying specific corners of finance that contributed most to the growth. This lets them dig deeper into the broader impact of this trend -- like who wins and who loses in the race.
One part of the industry that has contributed greatly to the rise, they found, is money management. Fees generated by asset managers, like those for mutual funds, hedge funds and private equity concerns, account for 36 percent of the growth in the financial sector's share of the economy, the study concluded.
Driving that increase is the puzzling fact that asset management fees over all, typically charged as a percentage of the money overseen, have not fallen substantially. Much of the increase here, therefore, has to do with the rise in asset values, which generate higher fees for money managers even though the cost of providing their services does not increase. A soaring Dow Jones industrial average is very lucrative for these folks.
Yes, investors can cut expenses by buying low-cost mutual funds, like those mirroring stock indexes. But most active managers continue to levy the same percentage fee on assets that have risen in value significantly, generating big gains for themselves, the professors note.
Another factor has kept asset management fees aloft: the rise of alternative investments, like hedge funds and private equity funds. Their costs -- around 2 percent a year, plus a percentage of profits -- skew the average fees higher.
Professional money management has many societal benefits, Mr. Scharfstein is quick to note. It's brought more liquidity to markets, financed more entrepreneurial ventures and cut costs of capital for many companies.
But the stubbornly high fees charged by these managers are a troubling transfer of wealth from savers to finance workers, Mr. Scharfstein added. Over time, these costs have huge impact on how well an investor will live in retirement. In other words, the few benefit at the expense of the many.
''Normally you would think that competition should drive down prices,'' Mr. Scharfstein said in an interview. ''But that doesn't seem to be working except for index funds. Part of the answer must be a lack of sophistication on the part of individual investors. But many public pension funds and other large institutions, which are supposed to be sophisticated investors, pay high fees -- in many cases for pretty lackluster performance.''
THE second major contributor to the ever-growing finance sector is the cost of household credit, mostly those costs associated with mortgages. Household credit costs, the professors reckon, have accounted for almost 40 percent of the increase in finance's share of G.D.P. in recent years.
This is not surprising, given that household credit, mainly mortgages, ballooned from 48 percent of gross domestic product in 1980 to 99 percent in the credit boom, the study notes. This was largely a result of an expanded securitization market that enabled lenders to originate home loans and bundle them into securities for sale to Wall Street and then to investors.
But this process, while highly profitable to the sector, undermined financial stability, the professors argue. Participants failed to understand the risks, amplifying the panic when the market turned sour. And making household credit more available let borrowers pile on dangerous amounts of leverage, introducing more volatility into the system.
These are the social costs of the vast increase in this type of credit: The financial system became more complex and borrowers were imperiled. Over the last five years, we have witnessed millions of foreclosures, trillions in investment losses and an economic downturn we are still struggling to overcome.
''It's probably good to be in a place where households can get access to credit,'' Mr. Scharfstein said, ''but the question is, at what cost?''
Fact is, we are still tallying it.

HEADLINE: Kings of a Small-Batch Empire

BYLINE: By LIZ ROBBINS

 BODY:
IN between bites of broccoli pecorino and sweet corn jalapeño fritters, Jonathan Butler and Eric Demby considered the candidate standing over the sizzling griddle in a conference room in Dumbo this month. They mulled her sauces and her sources.
''Where does the recipe go back to?'' Mr. Butler asked. ''Is this like something ----''
''Your mother used to make?'' Mr. Demby said.
''It's an Australian thing,'' said Megan Griffey, 38, her piquant Melbourne accent coating her nerves. ''But it is something I grew up with. My mother's from the South.'' 
Ten fritters later, Mr. Butler and Mr. Demby made their decision with a subtle nod. Ms. Griffey would become the newest vendor at Smorgasburg, the fashionable food fair in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, that the two men spun out of their market, Brooklyn Flea, two years ago.
Perhaps more than any other entrepreneurs in a borough chock-full of kale and crafts, Mr. Butler and Mr. Demby have helped create, curate and nurture the booming Brooklyn artisanal complex. In just five years, the 40-something fathers have turned the Flea and Smorgasburg into a small-batch empire. They operate four markets in Brooklyn each weekend from early April to late November. Smorgasburg also runs concessions at Central Park's Summerstage concerts. After Thanksgiving, the Flea moves indoors to the former Williamsburgh Savings Bank building.
On a sunny weekend when the stalls are filled to capacity and thousands of tourists, hipsters and chowhounds come to graze, the business can gross as much as $60,000, based on the fees the vendors pay.
Mr. Butler and Mr. Demby -- whose friends jokingly call him Artisanal Eric -- maintain a modest profile when observing their weekend markets with their children in tow. But during the week, the two are doggedly focused on moving beyond their borough's over-the-top identity as the home of white truffle mayonnaise.
Now they are wading into Manhattan and into the corporate world, at a time when small-scale food makers belong to one of the fastest-growing industries in New York.
Last week, coolness made the reverse commute. The two men began a partnership with the upscale food retailer Whole Foods Market that will bring one vendor a month to the second floor of Whole Foods' Bowery store in Manhattan. In February, a retail stand, also on the floor, will begin selling packaged items from other Smorgasburg vendors. The plan is for the relationship to continue in Brooklyn when Whole Foods opens in Gowanus and Williamsburg in the next two years.
A more complex deal illustrates the synergy of Brooklyn's food scene with the city's economic development, and underlines the way in which Mr. Butler's business interests interlock and promote one another.
The founder of the Brooklyn real estate Web site Brownstoner, Mr. Butler is now jumping off-line into development. His first project is a 150,000-square-foot commercial renovation of the former Studebaker Service Station in Crown Heights, which he and another development company bought for $11 million in April. Goldman Sachs has invested approximately $25 million in the project.
On its ground floor there will be a ''food incubator,'' providing kitchen and educational space for emerging food businesses, that has $1.5 million in support from the office of the Brooklyn borough president, Marty Markowitz. Separately, in an adjacent warehouse, Mr. Butler plans to open a beer hall with Mr. Demby, featuring Smorgasburg vendors and a shared kitchen.
Do these ventures mean they are growing too big for their local-food roots?
Mr. Butler and Mr. Demby, who roll their eyes at the term ''foodie,'' say they do not believe they have gone corporate. They generally eschew labels that are not affixed to jars of grapefruit- and-smoked-salt marmalade.
Besides, Mr. Butler said, it's not as if every vendor at Smorgasburg dreamed of staying under a tent forever.
''I don't think people begrudge you trying to make a buck,'' Mr. Butler said. ''Luckily, everything we've done is a win-win thing.''
THE two men did not set out to be kings of the Brooklyn small-purveyor scene.
Mr. Butler, 42 and the son and grandson of architects, had a conventionally privileged Upper East Side upbringing: St. Bernard's, Groton, Princeton. Out of college, he worked at Fiduciary Trust and then as a reporter for Worth, a wealth management magazine for high-earning individuals, before winning a merit scholarship to New York University's Stern School of Business, where he received an M.B.A. At the time he also took furniture-making classes at the Fashion Institute of Technology; the left and right sides of his brain often argued about which path to take.
As a vice president for hedge fund development at Merrill Lynch, Mr. Butler was so bored at work that he started a blog in 2004 to chronicle the renovation of his $1 million brownstone in Clinton Hill, writing anonymously. The blog took on cult status, and Mr. Butler revealed his identity in 2007, shortly after he left Wall Street (with his bonus) to make Brownstoner a full-time business.
''I am ambitious about making a lot of money, but none of that stuff passed the obituary test,'' Mr. Butler said. ''I didn't want it to read that I had been a vice president of Merrill Lynch for 40 years.''
Brownstoner began when there were few such blogs and built its following by focusing on the housing market in Brooklyn, offering paid listings along with articles on featured properties. The site, infused with advertising, now draws more than one million page views a month, according to Quantcast, a company that tracks Web traffic.
Mr. Butler's renovations on his home also led to the first of Brownstoner's offshoots. Mr. Butler became interested in salvaged materials, and after holding a ''salvage festival'' in fall 2007, decided that there was a need for a full-scale flea market, the first in Brooklyn that would also provide a showcase for design and food merchants.
Mr. Butler advertised for vendors and a director; he got nearly 100 applications for vendors in the first 48 hours and a response from Mr. Demby, who had spent the previous four years as a speechwriter for Mr. Markowitz.
It was a job he took in 2003, Mr. Demby said, when he was working as a freelance writer and needed a root canal (and dental insurance).
Now with a 3-month-old and a 3-year-old, Mr. Demby sounds almost wistful when he describes himself as a former club kid. Once a fact-checker for Rolling Stone, a journalist for MTV.com and a music activist working to reform the cabaret laws, Mr. Demby adjusted to civic life by writing two or three speeches a day (with jokes) for Mr. Markowitz and visiting every corner of the borough.
He first met Mr. Butler in 2006 at a ''Dine in Brooklyn'' news conference, and a year later he became his business partner as the co-founder of the Brooklyn Flea.
In seeking a location for the market, Mr. Demby and Mr. Butler worked with Councilwoman Letitia James, who sought to energize Fort Greene and financially support Bishop Loughlin Memorial High School by putting the Flea on its aging track. (The Flea pays $60,000 annually to Bishop Loughlin, which the school's president, Brother Dennis Cronin, said finances scholarships.) Thanks in part to promotion on Brownstoner, the Flea drew about 20,000 people its first day and garnered enthusiastic reviews.
In the ensuing weeks, though, the crowds were fickle along with the weather, and so were the vendors. Mr. Demby would send out a pep-talk e-mail every Monday encouraging vendors and telling them, ''We're all in this together.'' He would always ask the vendors to confirm they would be at the next weekend's market to establish consistency.
Residents, for their part, complained angrily about the loss of parking and the disruption to churchgoers on Sundays. Mr. Demby and Mr. Butler shifted the Flea to Saturdays in 2009.
Food vendors have always represented about a quarter of the 160 or so merchants at the Flea. When the owners of the Edge condominium at East River Park in Williamsburg asked the partners to start a market in their empty lot, they decided to focus on food. Smorgasburg draws roughly 5,000 people on Saturdays, and a second location opened last month in Dumbo.
The partners employ on-site managers and security guards, pay insurance, and rent portable toilets; the vendors pay a weekly fee for their spots and keep any proceeds. Mr. Demby curates the rotating crew of about 150 Smorgasburg vendors. He receives 5 to 10 applications a week. Winning an in-office audition is rare; even restaurants need to pitch their concept.
While vendors who already own brick-and-mortar stores or go on to start them can come in, Smorgasburg has an unwritten rule that vendors cannot sell at similar markets, like the Hester Street Fair on the Lower East Side. Mr. Demby said he wanted to preserve the uniqueness of Smorgasburg; to offset the restriction, he promotes and protects his vendors by declining competing merchants.
''We have joked around that it's kind of like Mafia-style,'' Mr. Demby said. ''We do everything possible to help them. By selling at other markets, you could argue that it does hurt us, them and everyone who sells at the market.''
The expectation of exclusivity did not bother Allison Kave of First Prize Pies, even though she said she loved selling at the smaller Hester Street Fair. At Smorgasburg, she said, the greater foot traffic and brand exposure led to nearly three times as much in profits.
Sara Jenkins, owner of the East Village restaurants Porchetta and Porsena, first came to the Flea to expand her brand to Brooklyn. Last weekend, as the sun-dappled crowds streamed by Porchetta's efficient pork sandwich booth, Ms. Jenkins marveled at the phenomenon. ''This is like a food rave,'' she said.
Mr. Demby and Mr. Butler, she added, have ''given people a platform, a stage.''
As a D.J. who threw parties with a social cause, Mr. Demby acknowledged the music parallel: ''We're the A-and-R guys,'' he said, referring to the artists-and-repertory specialists in music. ''What's your hit?''
FOR Hugh Mangum, a 40-year-old drummer and a barbecue pit master, it was smoked brisket. After 10 years of cooking, he introduced Mighty Quinn's barbecue stand last year at Smorgasburg, and it still commands the longest lines.
Mr. Mangum is opening a restaurant in the East Village in November. Were it not for Smorgasburg, he said, ''it would have taken five times as long and I would have had a quarter of the exposure.'' He will get another bump in January, when Mighty Quinn's takes a turn at Whole Foods' specially renovated kitchen. Cemita's, a Mexican sandwich stand and Smorgasburg stalwart, opened in the space on Monday. Milk Truck grilled cheese will follow in December.
Mr. Demby is selecting the vendors for the kitchen space, too. Whole Foods is renting it to Smorgasburg, which receives a modest monthly fee from the vendors.
With its gourmet clientele and its ''more organic than thou'' ethos, Whole Foods is probably the most sympathetic corporate partner the Smorgasburg team could have, even if the deal took eight months to complete.
''We share similar shoppers and similar ideals in the way we want to promote local brands,'' said Michael Sinatra, who sat at a cafe table on Monday with Mr. Demby, looking up at the Smorgasburg logo adorning the top of the kitchen bar. ''It was a partnership that makes sense.''
Such is the holistic nature of doing business with the new Brooklyn, and Mr. Butler.
Although he is no longer involved in the daily blogging on Brownstoner, he acknowledges that the site is a promotional tool for the markets it spawned, and that the markets, in turn, have helped define the Brooklyn brand.
Likewise, Brownstoner's focus on high-end properties (with its House of the Day) and its identifying of emerging neighborhoods (with its history posts) have helped to drive up property values in the borough and draw new residents. The Flea gave shoppers places to buy farmhouse end tables, ''beater bikes'' and cupcakes for their dinner parties.
Mr. Butler has been itching to branch out into bricks and mortar. He first blogged in 2010 about the building in Crown Heights on Dean Street, near where new restaurants were starting to open on Franklin Avenue. Mr. Butler thought it could be an ideal annex for Dumbo's creative and technological businesses that had outgrown the space available in that neighborhood.
At the time, the $14 million asking price for the Studebaker Service Station, then being used for storing legal records, discouraged Mr. Butler. But he sought creative ways to finance it. His brother-in-law at Goldman Sachs gave him an e-mail address for someone at the bank's Urban Investment Group, which seeks to invigorate underserved neighborhoods with reasonably priced housing and mixed-use properties.
''It was clear to us that he had a really great idea to transform the work he had been doing in the Brooklyn Flea, and he needed a way to take that way to the next level,'' said Alicia Glen, the managing director of the group.
To offset Mr. Butler's construction inexperience and to provide capital, Goldman Sachs connected Mr. Butler with BFC Partners, which built the striking Toren apartment building in Downtown Brooklyn.
In 2011, Mr. Markowitz committed $1.5 million to the construction of a kitchen incubator, provided the location was in central Brooklyn. The city's Economic Development Corporation, which chose Third Ward, a creative center for freelance artists in Bushwick, to run the incubator, is managing the project alongside similar ones in Long Island City, Queens, and East Harlem. Construction is to begin in several weeks.
Jason Goodman, the director of Third Ward, sees a kinship with his group and the Brooklyn Flea brand. ''It's a very authentic and a grass-roots organization, but also well organized and well curated,'' Mr. Goodman said. ''Those are the two forces that are hard to get right, but they do so well.''
In addition to the ground-floor kitchen and classroom space, the second floor will house office space for the administrative, creative and production needs of emerging food businesses. On the third and fourth floors, Mr. Butler is seeking Dumbo-overflow technology and design tenants, hoping to stimulate a changing neighborhood.
Because the young professionals in Crown Heights will need a place to unwind, Mr. Butler and Mr. Demby, with separate investors, plan to create their Smorgasburg-branded beer hall in the adjacent 9,000-square-foot space, which will also house a kitchen for food vendors they select from the market. From the inside, it will link to the incubator, to become -- pardon the expression, says Mr. Butler -- ''a real foodie hub.''
Will the building and the Whole Foods deal allow the partners to achieve total world domination with crispy pumpkin sage fritters and bacon-infused maple syrup? Hard to tell. But for now, Mr. Butler said, ''we very much trust our guts in these things.''

A selection of their comments is below.

Black kid from Brooklyn . . . poor family . . . etc. While it was an initial shock being brought into that world, and there were constant reminders of the fact that the kids with whom I studied had privileges I couldn't imagine . . . it REALLY wasn't that big of a deal. Sure, it was simply impossible for me to be a part of a lot of what these kids had going on outside of school . . . but I was a kid commuting from Brooklyn. Dalton, Mon-Fri, Crown Heights for the weekend, and that was perfect for me. I was very grounded for a teenager, though. I think that's all that's really going on here. Teenage years are hard for a lot of kids. I hope the kids there now are able to see the value in the dichotomy of their lives. My life's perspective came from living among people from all walks of life, valuing the exposure to everyone, but most of all, valuing myself. I'm not sure what these schools really can, or should, do to that end. Brandon T New York
I'm an African-American male from a low-income background who attends one of these elite NYC schools (I'm a senior). Yes the stories mentioned in this article are accurate, but the point isn't to feel bad for us because we don't fit in with our rich classmates. Receiving a quality education isn't just about what you learn from reading textbooks. A wellrounded citizen is one who has these book smarts as well as multiple perspectives on life. For a school that costs over 30K a year, how ''educated'' are its students? Sure they can do calculus, but how do they interact with the rest of the world outside of their fancy private school doors? I think the point is that these schools should make use of having students from different backgrounds so that we could actually learn something from our peers and not feel like we're just here to fill a quota. Ant New York
As a black woman who attended one of the schools in the article and went on to graduate from Stuyvesant H.S., I feel for these kids. Kids, you may not realize it now but these experiences are preparing you for the real world. I assume that many of you will go into top fields. Trust me, you will not find many black/brown people there either. I hope that all of you strive to someday send your children to these prestigious schools without financial aid. Make money and pay it forward (please do not major in ethnic studies). The situation will never change if black/brown people are always at the bottom. As you get older, you will be able to look back at your experiences with a more objective eye. Your wealthy classmates are human beings with problems too (why do you think they do so many drugs?). They cannot help their privileged background just as you cannot help your humble one. AD New York, NY
The article seems to conflate racial diversity with class difference. As a poor white scholarship student at a rich private school, I shared many of the same feelings described in the article. My pain was invisible because everyone assumed I was also wealthy; I had quickly managed to assimilate, but I always carried a core of pain, made worse by its invisibility. Conversely, there were many minority students whose bank accounts were far larger than my family's, but outsiders presumed they were poor, which I'm sure carried its own terrible weight. I'm not trying to diminish in any way the difficult experiences of racial minorities, I just wish we could acknowledge the complexities of economic class and social visibility in American education. erika connecticut
Nightmare on Park Ave.
I have no issue with any homeowner decorating his or her house for Halloween. But the problem is that money tends to choke off inventiveness and the fun of being creative! Inflatable Dracula dolls? How much did that set you back? And how scary is an inflatable doll? Less ostentation, more innovation! Laura L. New York, New York
I can't tell you how delighted I was to read that other people have noticed that Halloween has become yet another occasion on which the rich can knock us all out with their shameless acquisitiveness. There is something particularly yucky about their pretense that this is ''all about the kids.'' Here's what kids like on Halloween: a dark room and peeled grapes passed off as eyeballs, a scary story, chocolate not apples, choosing their own costume and having a parent go to some trouble making it. rdd NYC
Come on. This is the essence of sour grapes. You are complaining about people decorating their houses? Complaining about this makes The NYT laughable. It is one day a year and it is nice to see something that shows a sense of humanity. cat nyc

HEADLINE: How Prisoners Make Us Look Good

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS. 
The urban affairs correspondent for The New York Times.

 BODY:
A FEW years ago, the sociologists Becky Pettit and Bryan Sykes tried to quantify a worrisome phenomenon: the growing proportion of black men imprisoned by age 20. Focusing on those born between 1975 and 1979 who later dropped out of high school, they noticed an anomaly. ''Our initial efforts,'' Dr. Pettit recalls, ''implied that more young, black, low-skill men had been to prison than were alive.''
It took her no time to resolve the inconsistency: corrections officials count actual prisoners, a captive audience; sociologists and census-takers typically undercount prisoners and former inmates living on the edge of society. 
The real problem, as Dr. Pettit sees it, is that imprisoned black men aren't figured into statistics about the standing of African-Americans. The consequence, she says, is an overstatement of black progress in education, employment, wages and voting participation.
Dr. Pettit, of the University of Washington, has now presented her research in ''Invisible Men: Mass Incarceration and the Myth of Black Progress,'' published by the Russell Sage Foundation. Among her conclusions:
¶ Among male high school dropouts born between 1975 and 1979, 68 percent of blacks (compared with 28 percent of whites) had been imprisoned at some point by 2009, and 37 percent of blacks (compared with 12 percent of whites) were incarcerated that year.
¶ By the time they turn 18, one in four black children will have experienced the imprisonment of a parent.
¶ More young black dropouts are in prison or jail than have paying jobs. Black men are more likely to go to prison than to graduate with a four-year college degree or complete military service.
Black dropouts are more likely to spend at least a year in prison than to get married.
''Among low-skill black men, spending time in prison has become a normative life event, furthering their segregation from mainstream society,'' Dr. Pettit writes.
If inmates were counted, she estimates, the black high school dropout rate would soar to 19 percent and the share of dropouts who are employed would plunge to 26 percent -- far more dire than the statistics usually cited. The celebrated voter turnout among young blacks in the 2008 election would drop to roughly 20 percent, about where it was in 1980.
Blacks account for nearly half of the more than 2.3 million Americans in prison or jail. Failure to include them in measures of black progress, she argues, is akin to leaving states out of national counts. Former inmates, too, tend to be undercounted because they are typically poor, mobile and living precariously.
''We collect data to evaluate public policy and allocate resources,'' Dr. Pettit says. ''One could argue that we already provide social service to inmates, but leaving them out of the data distorts measures of progress.''
Heather Mac Donald, of the conservative Manhattan Institute, said Dr. Pettit's premise was plausible but cautioned that because the prison population is usually in flux, the effect of not counting prisoners at any given moment might not be statistically very large.
According to federal data, 3.1 percent of black men were in state or federal prison at the end of 2010, compared with 0.5 percent of non-Hispanic whites and 1.3 percent of Hispanics. Among black men 30 to 34, 7.3 percent were serving a sentence of more than a year. (A total of 748,000 adults were in local jails, 1.5 million were in state or federal prisons, 840,000 were on parole and 4 million were under supervised probation.)
Orlando Patterson, a Harvard sociologist, said Dr. Pettit ''deserves credit for specifying in sharp demographic detail the extent of the problem of incarceration, which is an American national scandal, and some of its consequences.''
While ''black progress is not a myth,'' he said, ''the simple, tragic truth is that a large number of young black men do engage in violent acts and other forms of criminal behavior.''
''Over 80 percent of black children have been abandoned emotionally and, usually, economically by their fathers,'' he continued. ''It is not the case that black children are deprived of paternal emotional and economic support because their fathers are in prison; rather, their fathers are in prison in good part because their own fathers had abandoned them emotionally and economically.''
The nuances can be debated, but Dr. Pettit stands by her premise: ''Decades of penal expansion coupled with the concentration of incarceration among men, blacks and those with low levels of education have generated a statistical portrait that overstates the educational and economic progress and political engagement of African-Americans.''

HEADLINE: Built With the Ladies in Mind

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
THE architecture of St. Nicholas Avenue north of 145th Street is an oddball but distinctive collection, obscured by its tumbledown state.
The 10 ''boudoir houses'' built by William Broadbelt in 1895 on the west side of the avenue, from 148th to 149th Street, are a case in point, with four remarkable bronze Ionic capitals on top of granite columns, two perfectly intact and two drowning in a long-ago slather of concrete.
The broad, open boulevard of St. Nicholas Avenue was a splendid route for carriage excursions, and after the Civil War, its country estates began to give way to more urban development. Among the builders who saw value there was Broadbelt, who hired Frederick P. Dinkelberg to design his 10 unusual houses. 
Broadbelt had already demonstrated architectural ambition: in 1889 he built the President, a small apartment house at 101 Lexington Avenue, which was covered with the busts of American presidents.
On St. Nicholas Avenue he produced a dramatic row, the central eight with large full-height bays and prominent striping in the masonry on the top floor.
The end houses, on 148th and 149th Streets, are more sedate, notwithstanding the bronze-capped columns on their porticoes, an unusual detail. There are also two large copper-clad oriel windows. ''Very stylish,'' said The Real Estate Record and Guide, which published a long article on the row.
The ground floor on each of the end houses had a billiard room and a footman's station; the entertaining rooms were on the floor above. Next to the principal bedroom in all 10 houses Broadbelt installed what he felt was his signature innovation, an octagonal dressing room or boudoir with full-height plate-glass mirrors.
The Record and Guide called it a ''crystal chamber,'' by which ''the charms of the occupants will be many times repeated.''
The bathrooms adjoining the boudoirs had fireplaces with colored tiles in ''a quaint Dutch pattern,'' as the journal put it.
Alice Dear, the United States executive director of the African Development Bank during the Clinton administration, now owns the northernmost house, and says a prior owner stripped the interior.
''I have to imagine my own charms,'' she said.
The houses were finished in ash, quartered oak, hazel, mahogany and cherry. Buyers were provided with two furnaces and even gas logs, for use ''in emergencies when quick heating is required.'' In the rear the developer replaced the usual board fences with wrought iron to carry climbing plants. Narrow slats ensured that there were ''no places for the feline disturbers of the night.''
In 1895 one house sold for $30,000. Broadbelt built at least one other set of boudoir houses, on West 113th Street.
The row is numbered 757 to 775. A picture of the agreeable life in these dwellings may be gleaned from an 1899 article in The New York Herald. It announced that a ''Saturday Afternoon Euchre Club'' had met at the home of Mrs. William E. Callendar at 769 St. Nicholas Avenue. There were eight prizes, including a silver nut dish and six bouillon cups; Mrs. Callendar won a set of gold buttons.
The census of 1900 listed no footmen at No. 769, but the householders were served by cooks, waitresses, chambermaids, a laundress, a coachman and a butler. That was William Grover, 21, born in South Carolina. Unlike everyone else in the row, possibly the block, he was black.
The population changed in the 1920s, as African-Americans and other blacks moved to Harlem and Hamilton Heights. The 1930 census shows the row approximately one-third black, including Charles N. Ford, a dentist from Trinidad who arrived in 1919, and had a laundress and a chauffeur living in. The census valued his house as $45,000.
At the other end of the domestic spectrum was Crompton Stewart, a porter in a pajama factory. He was from Virginia, and rented rooms at 759 St. Nicholas Avenue -- crowded in with 25 others.
In 1945 Rose Morgan, who operated the Rose Meta House of Beauty, took over the southernmost house to create what The New York Age described as ''a modernistic beauty salon'' offering massages, hairdressing, facials, manicures, body building and even health-food lunches.
The following year Ebony Magazine called her salon the ''Biggest Negro Beauty Parlor in the World.'' Miss Morgan told Ebony that she aimed to overturn the prejudice against ''Negro hair.''
Michael Adams, the author of the 2001 book ''Harlem: Lost and Found,'' said her business was to black women what Elizabeth Arden's was to white women. He also says Dr. Ford was Miss Morgan's landlord; the new Harlem was a rich network for African-Americans.
Clients who had no taste for Miss Morgan's health food perhaps sneaked out to Jimmy's Famous Chicken Shack at 763 St. Nicholas, ''Where Celebrities Meet,'' as an ad in The Age put it in 1950.
Today none of Broadbelt's row houses are single-family dwellings. The buildings have been de-stooped, had stores inserted, become plastered with commercial signs.
The worst is Rose Morgan's house. The copper oriels are bashed in or stripped of their original windows, and the ground-floor portico is encased in concrete. The bronze column capitals are submerged, barely protruding from the surface, waiting for a resurrection that may never come.

HEADLINE: Barack Obama for Re-Election

 BODY:
The economy is slowly recovering from the 2008 meltdown, and the country could suffer another recession if the wrong policies take hold. The United States is embroiled in unstable regions that could easily explode into full-blown disaster. An ideological assault from the right has started to undermine the vital health reform law passed in 2010. Those forces are eroding women's access to health care, and their right to control their lives. Nearly 50 years after passage of the Civil Rights Act, all Americans' rights are cheapened by the right wing's determination to deny marriage benefits to a selected group of us. Astonishingly, even the very right to vote is being challenged.
That is the context for the Nov. 6 election, and as stark as it is, the choice is just as clear.
President Obama has shown a firm commitment to using government to help foster growth. He has formed sensible budget policies that are not dedicated to protecting the powerful, and has worked to save the social safety net to protect the powerless. Mr. Obama has impressive achievements despite the implacable wall of refusal erected by Congressional Republicans so intent on stopping him that they risked pushing the nation into depression, held its credit rating hostage, and hobbled economic recovery. 
Mitt Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, has gotten this far with a guile that allows him to say whatever he thinks an audience wants to hear. But he has tied himself to the ultraconservative forces that control the Republican Party and embraced their policies, including reckless budget cuts and 30-year-old, discredited trickle-down ideas. Voters may still be confused about Mr. Romney's true identity, but they know the Republican Party, and a Romney administration would reflect its agenda. Mr. Romney's choice of Representative Paul Ryan as his running mate says volumes about that.
We have criticized individual policy choices that Mr. Obama has made over the last four years, and have been impatient with his unwillingness to throw himself into the political fight. But he has shaken off the hesitancy that cost him the first debate, and he approaches the election clearly ready for the partisan battles that would follow his victory.
We are confident he would challenge the Republicans in the ''fiscal cliff'' battle even if it meant calling their bluff, letting the Bush tax cuts expire and forcing them to confront the budget sequester they created. Electing Mr. Romney would eliminate any hope of deficit reduction that included increased revenues.
In the poisonous atmosphere of this campaign, it may be easy to overlook Mr. Obama's many important achievements, including carrying out the economic stimulus, saving the auto industry, improving fuel efficiency standards, and making two very fine Supreme Court appointments.
Health Care
Mr. Obama has achieved the most sweeping health care reforms since the passage of Medicare and Medicaid in 1965. The reform law takes a big step toward universal health coverage, a final piece in the social contract.
It was astonishing that Mr. Obama and the Democrats in Congress were able to get a bill past the Republican opposition. But the Republicans' propagandistic distortions of the new law helped them wrest back control of the House, and they are determined now to repeal the law.
That would eliminate the many benefits the reform has already brought: allowing children under 26 to stay on their parents' policies; lower drug costs for people on Medicare who are heavy users of prescription drugs; free immunizations, mammograms and contraceptives; a ban on lifetime limits on insurance payments. Insurance companies cannot deny coverage to children with pre-existing conditions. Starting in 2014, insurers must accept all applicants. Once fully in effect, the new law would start to control health care costs.
Mr. Romney has no plan for covering the uninsured beyond his callous assumption that they will use emergency rooms. He wants to use voucher programs to shift more Medicare costs to beneficiaries and block grants to shift more Medicaid costs to the states.
The Economy
Mr. Obama prevented another Great Depression. The economy was cratering when he took office in January 2009. By that June it was growing, and it has been ever since (although at a rate that disappoints everyone), thanks in large part to interventions Mr. Obama championed, like the $840 billion stimulus bill. Republicans say it failed, but it created and preserved 2.5 million jobs and prevented unemployment from reaching 12 percent. Poverty would have been much worse without the billions spent on Medicaid, food stamps and jobless benefits.
Last year, Mr. Obama introduced a jobs plan that included spending on school renovations, repair projects for roads and bridges, aid to states, and more. It was stymied by Republicans. Contrary to Mr. Romney's claims, Mr. Obama has done good things for small businesses -- like pushing through more tax write-offs for new equipment and temporary tax cuts for hiring the unemployed.
The Dodd-Frank financial regulation was an important milestone. It is still a work in progress, but it established the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, initiated reform of the derivatives market, and imposed higher capital requirements for banks. Mr. Romney wants to repeal it.
If re-elected, Mr. Obama would be in position to shape the ''grand bargain'' that could finally combine stimulus like the jobs bill with long-term deficit reduction that includes letting the high-end Bush-era tax cuts expire. Stimulus should come first, and deficit reduction as the economy strengthens. Mr. Obama has not been as aggressive as we would have liked in addressing the housing crisis, but he has increased efforts in refinancing and loan modifications.
Mr. Romney's economic plan, as much as we know about it, is regressive, relying on big tax cuts and deregulation. That kind of plan was not the answer after the financial crisis, and it will not create broad prosperity.
Foreign Affairs
Mr. Obama and his administration have been resolute in attacking Al Qaeda's leadership, including the killing of Osama bin Laden. He has ended the war in Iraq. Mr. Romney, however, has said he would have insisted on leaving thousands of American soldiers there. He has surrounded himself with Bush administration neocons who helped to engineer the Iraq war, and adopted their militaristic talk in a way that makes a Romney administration's foreign policies a frightening prospect.
Mr. Obama negotiated a much tougher regime of multilateral economic sanctions on Iran. Mr. Romney likes to say the president was ineffective on Iran, but at the final debate he agreed with Mr. Obama's policies. Mr. Obama deserves credit for his handling of the Arab Spring. The killing goes on in Syria, but the administration is working to identify and support moderate insurgent forces there. At the last debate, Mr. Romney talked about funneling arms through Saudi Arabia and Qatar, which are funneling arms to jihadist groups.
Mr. Obama gathered international backing for airstrikes during the Libyan uprising, and kept American military forces in a background role. It was smart policy.
In the broadest terms, he introduced a measure of military restraint after the Bush years and helped repair America's badly damaged reputation in many countries from the low levels to which it had sunk by 2008.
The Supreme Court
The future of the nation's highest court hangs in the balance in this election -- and along with it, reproductive freedom for American women and voting rights for all, to name just two issues. Whoever is president after the election will make at least one appointment to the court, and many more to federal appeals courts and district courts.
Mr. Obama, who appointed the impressive Justices Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor, understands how severely damaging conservative activism has been in areas like campaign spending. He would appoint justices and judges who understand that landmarks of equality like the Voting Rights Act must be defended against the steady attack from the right.
Mr. Romney's campaign Web site says he will ''nominate judges in the mold of Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Scalia, Thomas and Alito,'' among the most conservative justices in the past 75 years. There is no doubt that he would appoint justices who would seek to overturn Roe v. Wade.
Civil Rights
The extraordinary fact of Mr. Obama's 2008 election did not usher in a new post-racial era. In fact, the steady undercurrent of racism in national politics is truly disturbing. Mr. Obama, however, has reversed Bush administration policies that chipped away at minorities' voting rights and has fought laws, like the ones in Arizona, that seek to turn undocumented immigrants into a class of criminals.
The military's odious ''don't ask, don't tell'' rule was finally legislated out of existence, under the Obama administration's leadership. There are still big hurdles to equality to be brought down, including the Defense of Marriage Act, the outrageous federal law that undermines the rights of gay men and lesbians, even in states that recognize those rights.
Though it took Mr. Obama some time to do it, he overcame his hesitation about same-sex marriage and declared his support. That support has helped spur marriage-equality movements around the country. His Justice Department has also stopped defending the Defense of Marriage Act against constitutional challenges.
Mr. Romney opposes same-sex marriage and supports the federal act, which not only denies federal benefits and recognition to same-sex couples but allows states to ignore marriages made in other states. His campaign declared that Mr. Romney would not object if states also banned adoption by same-sex couples and restricted their rights to hospital visitation and other privileges.
Mr. Romney has been careful to avoid the efforts of some Republicans to criminalize abortion even in the case of women who had been raped, including by family members. He says he is not opposed to contraception, but he has promised to deny federal money to Planned Parenthood, on which millions of women depend for family planning.
For these and many other reasons, we enthusiastically endorse President Barack Obama for a second term, and express the hope that his victory will be accompanied by a new Congress willing to work for policies that Americans need.

HEADLINE: When Low Taxes Don't Help the Rich

BYLINE: By ROBERT H. FRANK. 
Robert H. Frank is an economics professor at the Johnson Graduate School of Management at Cornell University.

 BODY:
AT first glance, money's growing influence in politics appears impossible to challenge because of a powerful positive-feedback loop. Yet hope remains.
Although big-money donors are a diverse group, many of them want lower tax rates for themselves and less stringent regulations for their businesses -- and they've been brilliantly effective in getting them. Their success has increased their incomes still further, allowing them to make even larger contributions and to demand even bigger favors. This vicious circle was strengthened considerably by the Supreme Court's decision in the Citizens United case. And so, each year, the possibility of any new laws to curb money's influence appears to recede.
But as the economist Herbert Stein once joked, ''If something cannot go on forever, it will stop.'' Eventually, the social and economic consequences of further growth in income inequality may become so severe that even the most generously financed candidates won't prevail against reform-minded opponents. 
Alternatively, extreme inequality might one day spawn a violent revolution, as has happened in many other countries. Such routes to change still seem distant, however, and are hardly something to hope for.
There is a more encouraging possibility: in time, wealthy political donors may become convinced that their contributions poorly serve even their own narrow interests.
Lower tax rates have affected these donors in two opposing ways. On the positive side, they have supported higher consumption in the private sector. But on the downside, the resulting budget deficits have reduced the quantity and quality of public services. Compelling evidence suggests that the negatives have been much larger, and the positives considerably smaller, than many donors have expected.
Through private schools, gated communities, personal aircraft and other adaptations, the wealthy have been insulated from many costs of a decaying public sphere. But ill effects remain. Declining quality of public schools, for example, makes it harder for businesses to recruit productive workers, and a shrinking middle class makes it harder to sell their products in volume.
Many other effects of budget deficits also cut across the income divide. First, consider two extreme examples: When a poorly maintained bridge collapses, rich drivers are no less likely to die than poor ones. And if cutbacks in the Energy Department's program for locking down loosely guarded nuclear materials in the former Soviet Union one day enable terrorists to detonate a dirty bomb in Manhattan, hedge fund managers and their families will suffer along with everyone else.
But important, if less dramatic, losses occur often in real life, because the process of social framing often exaggerates the gains from private spending. When all families stage more elaborate celebrations for special occasions -- weddings, for example -- the main effect is simply to raise the bar that qualifies an event as special.
A RELATED distortion is easily seen in a thought experiment:
Let's say that two societies differ only in their mixes of public and private spending. In one society, lower taxes on the wealthy allow them to drive very fine cars -- say, $180,000 Bentleys. The streets and highways in this society, however, are riddled with foot-deep potholes.
In the other society, the wealthy pay higher taxes that support well-maintained roads, but drive $120,000 BMWs. Some car buffs will grumble, but for argument's sake, let's assume that all view the Bentley as the better car.
In which society would the wealthy be happier? Because product-quality improvements cost much more to achieve beyond some point, the absolute quality of a $180,000 car may be only slightly higher than one costing $120,000. And because not even the most sophisticated automotive suspensions can neutralize deep potholes, it's little wonder that most people think the BMW drivers would be happier, not to mention safer.
That conclusion is reinforced by evidence that consumption standards are highly local. The BMW drivers in the second society don't often mingle with the Bentley drivers in the first, and are thus unlikely to feel deprived for having less-expensive cars.
If the wealthy often overestimate the attractions of higher private spending, they're also likely to overestimate the regulatory burden on their businesses. Compliance with regulations, of course, can be costly. And if only one company has to comply, its profits may indeed decline sharply. But regulation applies to all companies in an industry, which typically allows them to cover their costs by raising prices. So if regulation promotes a safer, cleaner environment whose benefits exceed those broadly shared costs, everyone -- even a business owner -- is ahead in the long run.
Because the market forces causing greater inequality are still playing out, the wealthy will continue to have more power to influence politics. So if donors stick to their strategy of supporting candidates who favor lower taxes and fewer regulations, they're likely to prevail indefinitely.
REFORMERS castigate wealthy donors for supporting self-serving policies. But, instead, the reformers could call attention to evidence that the donors themselves would fare better, in purely practical terms, without the tax cuts and deregulation they've been promoting.
You needn't be a cynical
economist to believe that this second strategy has brighter prospects.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Rethinking Marriage

 BODY:
Readers debate the roles of the state and religion in weddings.
To the Editor:
Frank Schubert wants to crush gay marriage in every state (''In the Fight Against Same-Sex Marriage, a Strategist Casts the Issue Anew,'' news article, Oct. 10). He is working diligently against same-sex marriage in referendums in Maryland, Minnesota, Maine and Washington. His pitch: Voting against gay marriage doesn't mean you're homophobic. It just means you don't believe in gay marriage. What could be wrong with that?
Though the anti-gay-marriage ballot was passed in my state, Michigan, eight years ago, part of me remains suspended in disbelief. I simply can't adjust to the idea that whether I can marry was put to a vote.
As a result of that vote, my partner will never benefit from my pension or Social Security. She had to turn down a career opportunity in Australia because I was unable to obtain the equivalent of a marriage visa. Worst of all, I cannot legally adopt my son, who is her biological child. I have to carry a document with me at all times, signed by my partner, allowing me to make medical decisions for him in an emergency. 
Ask my son, ''Who are your parents?'' He will run to both his moms. We are a family. The state's failure to accept this truth is a mockery of justice and flies in the face of rationality.
Some people think that equality can be achieved by offering gays civil unions in lieu of marriage. Civil unions are not a substitute for marriage. Separate rights are never equal rights.
There is an obvious solution to the marriage debate. ''Marriage'' should be returned to its original state as a religious sacrament. If marriage were conferred solely by religious institutions, each church, synagogue, mosque or other house of worship could decide, based on its doctrine, whom to marry, without government interference. Some would undoubtedly recognize gay marriage while others would not.
The government would offer civil unions of equal legal status to all couples, regardless of sexual orientation, and it would do so without intrusion from religion.
ANNE DOHRENWEND Ann Arbor, Mich., Oct. 22, 2012
The writer is the author of ''Coming Around: Parenting Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual and Transgender Kids.''
Readers React
Ms. Dohrenwend decries the anti-gay-marriage vote in Michigan, yet seems willing to settle for half a loaf: ''marriage'' to be solely the province of religion, with civil unions, offered by the states, for all. This solution is both impractical and retrograde.
Language has meaning. ''Marriage'' conveys love, commitment, fortitude. To expunge the term and replace it with ''civil union'' is to attempt a feint around the real issue -- the equality of all unions.
The arc of history is clearly (and astoundingly rapidly) moving toward acceptance of gay marriage. Those who oppose it do so out of unsubstantiated fear that recognizing same-sex unions as marriages will, somehow, undermine and debase their own lives, and, by extension, our society. But they cannot point to any evidence that this would be so. Indeed, in those states, my own (Massachusetts) among them, that have permitted same-sex marriage, there has been no rending of society as we know it.
The issue has been joined. The better part of valor is to stay the course, to support full and equal marriage for all, and not to offer a dual-track compromise. E pluribus unum.
NICHOLAS W. PUNER West Tisbury, Mass., Oct. 23, 2012
Voting to reject same-sex marriage doesn't mean that you are antigay. Ms. Dohrenwend derides the idea, but many states provide same-sex couples all of the legal benefits that married couples enjoy without redefining marriage.
Ms. Dohrenwend says her lesbian partner will not benefit from her pension or from Social Security. However, they are matters for the national government, not rights that can be given by states.
As to state law, Washington's ''everything but marriage'' domestic partnerships not only afford same-sex couples official state recognition of their relationships, but also provide the same legal rights as married couples have. Same-sex couples have the right to live as they please, but not to redefine marriage for all of society.
CHIP WHITE Communications Director Preserve Marriage Washington Mill Creek, Wash., Oct. 23, 2012
In a country that calls for separation of church and state, it is ridiculous that churches have so much input over the legality of who is allowed to enter into a social contract. Marriage is a social contract governing property, support, custody of children, inheritance and many other subjects of family law.
Many European countries have it right. You go to a civil office and sign a piece of paper. That is the ceremony that legally binds one person of any gender to another person of any gender.
If you want a ''blessing,'' you call in religious leaders. That ceremony is not legally binding. And each religion can decide -- for its congregation and not the public at large -- who is entitled to that ''blessing.'' The government does not get involved in personal spirituality. That really is the government being a ''nanny state.''
CAROL McDONALD Forest Hills, Queens, Oct. 23, 2012
Ms. Dohrenwend makes several points that I and other members of the clergy have believed for some time. Acting as an agent of the state with regard to marriage is a clear violation of the separation of church and state. The general synod of my denomination, United Church of Christ, has gone on record that there should be no barriers to same-sex marriage. Ms. Dohrenwend's suggestion that marriage is a rite of religion while civil union is a legal formulation is what many of us would embrace.
But there is a further issue that I have encountered more often than gay and lesbian couples wanting to marry: senior citizens who have to choose unmarried cohabitation over the loss of Social Security and/or pension benefits from a deceased spouse (which would drive many of them into poverty). Allowing religious marriage would give these couples the peace of mind they so often have told me they desire. These couples could choose not to apply for legal recognition of their union, keeping their government benefits and not complicating inheritance for their surviving children.
To rewrite Ms. Dohrenwend's final paragraph: Religious bodies would offer marriage of equal validity to all couples, and without intrusion from the government.
(Rev.) WILLIAM PIFER-FOOTE Leesport, Pa., Oct. 23, 2012
I greatly respect Ms. Dohrenwend's work to bring awareness to L.G.B.T. parents, and she deserves praise for her role in the struggle for equality. But her stance that marriage should be put in its ''original state as a religious sacrament'' is sorely mistaken. Marriage has always been a right protected and respected by the government. To allege that it is solely a religious sacrament and thus irrelevant to civil recognition is simply false.
As has been held now by numerous states, our close international allies, two different circuit courts of appeals and increasingly the American people at large, same-sex marriage strengthens civil society and benefits every citizen, gay or straight. Whether a religion believes itself an arbiter of marriage is irrelevant; this is a power firmly in the realm of secular society, and one that should be embraced regardless of creed.
MICHAEL DENHAM Brookline, Mass., Oct. 23, 2012
As a gay woman with a wife and daughter and who happens to be Jewish, I agree with Ms. Dohrenwend's definition of family, but have to disagree with her seemingly simplistic solution for gay marriage, which makes a huge assumption. That assumption is that everyone who wants to get married is affiliated with a church, synagogue, mosque or other house of worship. Why should only religious people have the right to get married in addition to a civil union?
The word marriage needs to be redefined as a union between two consenting adults, no matter what the genders of the couple.
VAL BOGNER Fairfield, Conn., Oct. 23, 2012
I feel great sympathy for Ms. Dohrenwend and her partner, who are not entitled to the many important state and federal benefits my wife and I receive by virtue of our state-approved marriage. Bans on same-sex marriage are immoral because they are steeped in value judgments about the characters of gays and lesbians based solely on the private consensual choices of mature adults based on their sexual orientation.
Stable, loving and committed families are a positive force for our country, our economy and our way of life. For what possible reason would any sensible person want to deny two individuals who are in love the motivation and sanction to try to live such a life? The only possible answer is an unacceptable and discriminatory animosity toward gays and lesbians.
Although I agree with Ms. Dohrenwend that the government perhaps should get out of the ''marriage'' business altogether and simply recognize civil unions, that shift is not likely to happen anytime soon. That being the case, same-sex couples need to be treated in the same way as opposite-sex couples as a matter of human dignity, freedom of choice and equal protection under the law.
ERIC SEGALL Atlanta, Oct. 23, 2012
The writer is a professor of law at Georgia State University.
I would much rather see civil unions for both gays and straights, with the requisite rights and privileges we now extend only to ''marriages.'' Then, if a couple wishes a religious ceremony, they will be able to choose the appropriate venue.
Of course, I would miss saying ''by the power vested in me by the State of Colorado,'' but if it will enlarge the possibilities for all God's children to be together legally, it's a no-brainer.
(Rabbi) MEL GLAZER Colorado Springs, Oct. 23, 2012
The Writer Responds
Mr. Puner and Mr. Denham support marriage equality but think that giving churches the authority over ''marriage'' is too great a concession. Mr. Puner speaks from the heart when he says: ''Language has meaning. 'Marriage' conveys love ...'' Unfortunately, many on the far right defend the status quo by appealing to the felt sense of ''marriage.'' Desecularizing marriage allows each of us to define marriage for ourselves.
In the United States, government involvement in marriage began very early on in our history. Those who embraced the separation of church and state thought it important to allow for the legal recognition of a union without the necessity of church sanction.
Of course, bias and religious belief found their way into marriage law. For example, in the late 19th and the 20th century, most states amended their constitutions to ban interracial marriage. The use of the Constitution as a weapon against marital freedom was a mistake then and it is a mistake now.
The failure to keep church and state separate will lead to their mutual corruption. Religions are diminished when government controls the church pulpit; government is diminished when religion is cemented into law.
Our forefathers anticipated that some, aflame with conviction, would try to breech the dividing wall between church and state. That is why they gave us the concept of ''inalienable rights,'' so basic that they should never be put to a vote.
Marriage is richly meaningful and inherently personal and just such an inalienable right. The definition of marriage cannot belong to me, to Mr. White or to any one religion or group of religions. This is the price we pay for freedom.

HEADLINE: The Enchanted Island Of Centenarians

BYLINE: By DAN BUETTNER

 BODY:
In 1943, a Greek war veteran named Stamatis Moraitis came to the United States for treatment of a combat-mangled arm. He'd survived a gunshot wound, escaped to Turkey and eventually talked his way onto the Queen Elizabeth, then serving as a troopship, to cross the Atlantic. Moraitis settled in Port Jefferson, N.Y., an enclave of countrymen from his native island, Ikaria. He quickly landed a job doing manual labor. Later, he moved to Boynton Beach, Fla. Along the way, Moraitis married a Greek-American woman, had three children and bought a three-bedroom house and a 1951 Chevrolet.
One day in 1976, Moraitis felt short of breath. Climbing stairs was a chore; he had to quit working midday. After X-rays, his doctor concluded that Moraitis had lung cancer. As he recalls, nine other doctors confirmed the diagnosis. They gave him nine months to live. He was in his mid-60s. 
Moraitis considered staying in America and seeking aggressive cancer treatment at a local hospital. That way, he could also be close to his adult children. But he decided instead to return to Ikaria, where he could be buried with his ancestors in a cemetery shaded by oak trees that overlooked the Aegean Sea. He figured a funeral in the United States would cost thousands, a traditional Ikarian one only $200, leaving more of his retirement savings for his wife, Elpiniki. Moraitis and Elpiniki moved in with his elderly parents, into a tiny, whitewashed house on two acres of stepped vineyards near Evdilos, on the north side of Ikaria. At first, he spent his days in bed, as his mother and wife tended to him. He reconnected with his faith. On Sunday mornings, he hobbled up the hill to a tiny Greek Orthodox chapel where his grandfather once served as a priest. When his childhood friends discovered that he had moved back, they started showing up every afternoon. They'd talk for hours, an activity that invariably involved a bottle or two of locally produced wine. I might as well die happy, he thought.
In the ensuing months, something strange happened. He says he started to feel stronger. One day, feeling ambitious, he planted some vegetables in the garden. He didn't expect to live to harvest them, but he enjoyed being in the sunshine, breathing the ocean air. Elpiniki could enjoy the fresh vegetables after he was gone.
Six months came and went. Moraitis didn't die. Instead, he reaped his garden and, feeling emboldened, cleaned up the family vineyard as well. Easing himself into the island routine, he woke up when he felt like it, worked in the vineyards until midafternoon, made himself lunch and then took a long nap. In the evenings, he often walked to the local tavern, where he played dominoes past midnight. The years passed. His health continued to improve. He added a couple of rooms to his parents' home so his children could visit. He built up the vineyard until it produced 400 gallons of wine a year. Today, three and a half decades later, he's 97 years old -- according to an official document he disputes; he says he's 102 -- and cancer-free. He never went through chemotherapy, took drugs or sought therapy of any sort. All he did was move home to Ikaria.
I met Moraitis on Ikaria this past July during one of my visits to explore the extraordinary longevity of the island's residents. For a decade, with support from the National Geographic Society, I've been organizing a study of the places where people live longest. The project grew out of studies by my partners, Dr. Gianni Pes of the University of Sassari in Italy and Dr. Michel Poulain, a Belgian demographer. In 2000, they identified a region of Sardinia's Nuoro province as the place with the highest concentration of male centenarians in the world. As they zeroed in on a cluster of villages high in Nuoro's mountains, they drew a boundary in blue ink on a map and began referring to the area inside as the ''blue zone.'' Starting in 2002, we identified three other populations around the world where people live measurably longer lives than everyone else. The world's longest-lived women are found on the island of Okinawa. On Costa Rica's Nicoya Peninsula, we discovered a population of 100,000 mestizos with a lower-than-normal rate of middle-age mortality. And in Loma Linda, Calif., we identified a population of Seventh-day Adventists in which most of the adherents' life expectancy exceeded the American average by about a decade.
In 2003, I started a consulting firm to see if it was possible to take what we were learning in the field and apply it to American communities. We also continued to do research and look for other pockets of longevity, and in 2008, following a lead from a Greek researcher, we began investigating Ikaria. Poulain's plan there was to track down survivors born between 1900 and 1920 and determine when and where individuals died. The approach was complicated by the fact that people often moved around. That meant that not only were birth and death records required, but also information on immigration and emigration.
The data collection had to be rigorous. Earlier claims about long-lived people in places like Ecuador's Vilcabamba Valley, Pakistan's Hunza Valley or the Caucasus Mountains of Georgia had all been debunked after researchers discovered that many residents didn't actually know their ages. For villagers born without birth certificates, it was easy to lose track. One year they were 80; a few months later they were 82. Pretty soon they claimed to be 100. And when a town discovers that a reputation for centenarians draws tourists, who's going to question it? Even in Ikaria, the truth has been sometimes difficult to nail down. Stories like the one about Moraitis's miraculous recovery become instant folklore, told and retold and changed and misattributed. (Stories about Moraitis have appeared on Greek TV.) In fact, when I was doing research there in 2009, I met a different man who told me virtually the exact same story about himself.
The study would try to cut through the stories and establish the facts about Ikaria's longevity. Before including subjects, Poulain cross-referenced birth records against baptism or military documentation. After gathering all the data, he and his colleagues at the University of Athens concluded that people on Ikaria were, in fact, reaching the age of 90 at two and a half times the rate Americans do. (Ikarian men in particular are nearly four times as likely as their American counterparts to reach 90, often in better health.) But more than that, they were also living about 8 to 10 years longer before succumbing to cancers and cardiovascular disease, and they suffered less depression and about a quarter the rate of dementia. Almost half of Americans 85 and older show signs of Alzheimer's. (The Alzheimer's Association estimates that dementia cost Americans some $200 billion in 2012.) On Ikaria, however, people have been managing to stay sharp to the end.
Ikaria, an island of 99 square miles and home to almost 10,000 Greek nationals, lies about 30 miles off the western coast of Turkey. Its jagged ridge of scrub-covered mountains rises steeply out of the Aegean Sea. Before the Christian era, the island was home to thick oak forests and productive vineyards. Its reputation as a health destination dates back 25 centuries, when Greeks traveled to the island to soak in the hot springs near Therma. In the 17th century, Joseph Georgirenes, the bishop of Ikaria, described its residents as proud people who slept on the ground. ''The most commendable thing on this island,'' he wrote, ''is their air and water, both so healthful that people are very long-lived, it being an ordinary thing to see persons in it of 100 years of age.''
Seeking to learn more about the island's reputation for long-lived residents, I called on Dr. Ilias Leriadis, one of Ikaria's few physicians, in 2009. On an outdoor patio at his weekend house, he set a table with Kalamata olives, hummus, heavy Ikarian bread and wine. ''People stay up late here,'' Leriadis said. ''We wake up late and always take naps. I don't even open my office until 11 a.m. because no one comes before then.'' He took a sip of his wine. ''Have you noticed that no one wears a watch here? No clock is working correctly. When you invite someone to lunch, they might come at 10 a.m. or 6 p.m. We simply don't care about the clock here.''
Pointing across the Aegean toward the neighboring island of Samos, he said: ''Just 15 kilometers over there is a completely different world. There they are much more developed. There are high-rises and resorts and homes worth a million euros. In Samos, they care about money. Here, we don't. For the many religious and cultural holidays, people pool their money and buy food and wine. If there is money left over, they give it to the poor. It's not a 'me' place. It's an 'us' place.''
Ikaria's unusual past may explain its communal inclinations. The strong winds that buffet the island -- mentioned in the ''Iliad'' -- and the lack of natural harbors kept it outside the main shipping lanes for most of its history. This forced Ikaria to be self-sufficient. Then in the late 1940s, after the Greek Civil War, the government exiled thousands of Communists and radicals to the island. Nearly 40 percent of adults, many of them disillusioned with the high unemployment rate and the dwindling trickle of resources from Athens, still vote for the local Communist Party. About 75 percent of the population on Ikaria is under 65. The youngest adults, many of whom come home after college, often live in their parents' home. They typically have to cobble together a living through small jobs and family support.
Leriadis also talked about local ''mountain tea,'' made from dried herbs endemic to the island, which is enjoyed as an end-of-the-day cocktail. He mentioned wild marjoram, sage (flaskomilia), a type of mint tea (fliskouni), rosemary and a drink made from boiling dandelion leaves and adding a little lemon. ''People here think they're drinking a comforting beverage, but they all double as medicine,'' Leriadis said. Honey, too, is treated as a panacea. ''They have types of honey here you won't see anyplace else in the world,'' he said. ''They use it for everything from treating wounds to curing hangovers, or for treating influenza. Old people here will start their day with a spoonful of honey. They take it like medicine.''
Over the span of the next three days, I met some of Leriadis's patients. In the area known as Raches, I met 20 people over 90 and one who claimed to be 104. I spoke to a 95-year-old man who still played the violin and a 98-year-old woman who ran a small hotel and played poker for money on the weekend.
On a trip the year before, I visited a slate-roofed house built into the slope at the top of a hill. I had come here after hearing of a couple who had been married for more than 75 years. Thanasis and Eirini Karimalis both came to the door, clapped their hands at the thrill of having a visitor and waved me in. They each stood maybe five feet tall. He wore a shapeless cotton shirt and a battered baseball cap, and she wore a housedress with her hair in a bun. Inside, there was a table, a medieval-looking fireplace heating a blackened pot, a nook of a closet that held one woolen suit coat, and fading black-and-white photographs of forebears on a soot-stained wall. The place was warm and cozy. ''Sit down,'' Eirini commanded. She hadn't even asked my name or business but was already setting out teacups and a plate of cookies. Meanwhile, Thanasis scooted back and forth across the house with nervous energy, tidying up.
The couple were born in a nearby village, they told me. They married in their early 20s and raised five children on Thanasis's pay as a lumberjack. Like that of almost all of Ikaria's traditional folk, their daily routine unfolded much the way Leriadis had described it: Wake naturally, work in the garden, have a late lunch, take a nap. At sunset, they either visited neighbors or neighbors visited them. Their diet was also typical: a breakfast of goat's milk, wine, sage tea or coffee, honey and bread. Lunch was almost always beans (lentils, garbanzos), potatoes, greens (fennel, dandelion or a spinachlike green called horta) and whatever seasonal vegetables their garden produced; dinner was bread and goat's milk. At Christmas and Easter, they would slaughter the family pig and enjoy small portions of larded pork for the next several months.
During a tour of their property, Thanasis and Eirini introduced their pigs to me by name. Just after sunset, after we returned to their home to have some tea, another old couple walked in, carrying a glass amphora of homemade wine. The four nonagenarians cheek-kissed one another heartily and settled in around the table. They gossiped, drank wine and occasionally erupted into laughter.
Dr. Ioanna Chinou, a professor at the University of Athens School of Pharmacy, is one of Europe's top experts on the bioactive properties of herbs and natural products. When I consulted her about Ikarians' longevity, she told me that many of the teas they consume are traditional Greek remedies. Wild mint fights gingivitis and gastrointestinal disorders; rosemary is used as a remedy for gout; artemisia is thought to improve blood circulation. She invited me to give her samples and later tested seven of the most commonly used herbs on Ikaria. As rich sources of polyphenols, they showed strong antioxidant properties, she reported. Most of these herbs also contained mild diuretics. Doctors often use diuretics to treat hypertension -- perhaps by drinking tea nightly, Ikarians have gently lowered their blood pressure throughout their lives.
Meanwhile, my colleagues Gianni Pes and Michel Poulain set out to track down the island's 164 residents who were over 90 as of 1999, starting in the municipality of Raches. They found that 75 nonagenarians were still alive. Then, along with additional researchers, they fanned out across the island and asked 35 elderly subjects a battery of lifestyle questions to assess physical and cognitive functioning: How much do you sleep? Did you ever smoke? They asked them to get up and down from a chair five times and recorded how long it took them to walk 13 feet. To test mental agility, the researchers had subjects recall a series of items and reproduce geometric shapes.
Pes and Poulain were joined in the field by Dr. Antonia Trichopoulou of the University of Athens, an expert on the Mediterranean diet. She helped administer surveys, often sitting in village kitchens to ask subjects to reconstruct their childhood eating habits. She noted that the Ikarians' diet, like that of others around the Mediterranean, was rich in olive oil and vegetables, low in dairy (except goat's milk) and meat products, and also included moderate amounts of alcohol. It emphasized homegrown potatoes, beans (garbanzo, black-eyed peas and lentils), wild greens and locally produced goat milk and honey.
As I knew from my studies in other places with high numbers of very old people, every one of the Ikarians' dietary tendencies had been linked to increased life spans: low intake of saturated fats from meat and dairy was associated with lower risk of heart disease; olive oil -- especially unheated -- reduced bad cholesterol and raised good cholesterol. Goat's milk contained serotonin-boosting tryptophan and was easily digestible for older people. Some wild greens had 10 times as many antioxidants as red wine. Wine -- in moderation -- had been shown to be good for you if consumed as part of a Mediterranean diet, because it prompts the body to absorb more flavonoids, a type of antioxidant. And coffee, once said to stunt growth, was now associated with lower rates of diabetes, heart disease and, for some, Parkinson's. Local sourdough bread might actually reduce a meal's glycemic load. You could even argue that potatoes contributed heart-healthy potassium, vitamin B6 and fiber to the Ikarian diet. Another health factor at work might be the unprocessed nature of the food they consume: as Trichopoulou observed, because islanders eat greens from their gardens and fields, they consume fewer pesticides and more nutrients. She estimated that the Ikarian diet, compared with the standard American diet, might yield up to four additional years of life expectancy.
Of course, it may not be only what they're eating; it may also be what they're not eating. ''Are they doing something positive, or is it the absence of something negative?'' Gary Taubes asked when I described to him the Ikarians' longevity and their diet. Taubes is a founder of the nonprofit Nutrition Science Initiative and the author of ''Why We Get Fat'' (and has written several articles for this magazine). ''One explanation why they live so long is they eat a plant-based diet. Or it could be the absence of sugar and white flour. From what I know of the Greek diet, they eat very little refined sugar, and their breads have been traditionally made with stone-ground wheat.''
Following the report by Pes and Poulain, Dr. Christina Chrysohoou, a cardiologist at the University of Athens School of Medicine, teamed up with half a dozen scientists to organize the Ikaria Study, which includes a survey of the diet of 673 Ikarians. She found that her subjects consumed about six times as many beans a day as Americans, ate fish twice a week and meat five times a month, drank on average two to three cups of coffee a day and took in about a quarter as much refined sugar -- the elderly did not like soda. She also discovered they were consuming high levels of olive oil along with two to four glasses of wine a day.
Chrysohoou also suspected that Ikarians' sleep and sex habits might have something to do with their long life. She cited a 2008 paper by the University of Athens Medical School and the Harvard School of Public Health that studied more than 23,000 Greek adults. The researchers followed subjects for an average of six years, measuring their diets, physical activity and how much they napped. They found that occasional napping was associated with a 12 percent reduction in the risk of coronary heart disease, but that regular napping -- at least three days weekly -- was associated with a 37 percent reduction. She also pointed out a preliminary study of Ikarian men between 65 and 100 that included the fact that 80 percent of them claimed to have sex regularly, and a quarter of that self-reported group said they were doing so with ''good duration'' and ''achievement.''
During our time on Ikaria, my colleagues and I stayed at Thea Parikos's guesthouse, the social hub of western Ikaria. Local women gathered in the dining room at midmorning to gossip over tea. Late at night, after the dinner rush, tables were pushed aside and the dining room became a dance floor, with people locking arms and kick-dancing to Greek music.
Parikos cooked the way her ancestors had for centuries, giving us a chance to consume the diet we were studying. For breakfast, she served local yogurt and honey from the 90-year-old beekeeper next door. For dinner, she walked out into the fields and returned with handfuls of weedlike greens, combined them with pumpkin and baked them into savory pies. My favorite was a dish made with black-eyed peas, tomatoes, fennel tops and garlic and finished with olive oil that we dubbed Ikarian stew.
Despite her consummately Ikarian air, Parikos was actually born in Detroit to an American father and an Ikarian mother. She had attended high school, worked as a real estate agent and married in the United States. After she and her husband had their first child, she felt a ''genetic craving'' for Ikaria. ''I was not unhappy in America,'' she said. ''We had good friends, we went out to dinner on the weekends, I drove a Chevrolet. But I was always in a hurry.''
When she and her family moved to Ikaria and opened the guesthouse, everything changed. She stopped shopping for most groceries, instead planting a huge garden that provided most of their fruits and vegetables. She lost weight without trying to. I asked her if she thought her simple diet was going to make her family live longer. ''Yes,'' she said. ''But we don't think about it that way. It's bigger than that.''
Although unemployment is high -- perhaps as high as 40 percent -- most everyone has access to a family garden and livestock, Parikos told me. People who work might have several jobs. Someone involved in tourism, for example, might also be a painter or an electrician or have a store. ''People are fine here because we are very self-sufficient,'' she said. ''We may not have money for luxuries, but we will have food on the table and still have fun with family and friends. We may not be in a hurry to get work done during the day, so we work into the night. At the end of the day, we don't go home to sit on the couch.''
Parikos was nursing a mug of coffee. Sunlight sifted in through the window shades; the waves of the nearby Aegean could be barely heard over the din of breakfast. ''Do you know there's no word in Greek for privacy?'' she declared. ''When everyone knows everyone else's business, you get a feeling of connection and security. The lack of privacy is actually good, because it puts a check on people who don't want to be caught or who do something to embarrass their family. If your kids misbehave, your neighbor has no problem disciplining them. There is less crime, not because of good policing, but because of the risk of shaming the family. You asked me about food, and yes, we do eat better here than in America. But it's more about how we eat. Even if it's your lunch break from work, you relax and enjoy your meal. You enjoy the company of whoever you are with. Food here is always enjoyed in combination with conversation.''
In the United States, when it comes to improving health, people tend to focus on exercise and what we put into our mouths -- organic foods, omega-3's, micronutrients. We spend nearly $30 billion a year on vitamins and supplements alone. Yet in Ikaria and the other places like it, diet only partly explained higher life expectancy. Exercise -- at least the way we think of it, as willful, dutiful, physical activity -- played a small role at best.
Social structure might turn out to be more important. In Sardinia, a cultural attitude that celebrated the elderly kept them engaged in the community and in extended-family homes until they were in their 100s. Studies have linked early retirement among some workers in industrialized economies to reduced life expectancy. In Okinawa, there's none of this artificial punctuation of life. Instead, the notion of ikigai -- ''the reason for which you wake up in the morning'' -- suffuses people's entire adult lives. It gets centenarians out of bed and out of the easy chair to teach karate, or to guide the village spiritually, or to pass down traditions to children. The Nicoyans in Costa Rica use the term plan de vida to describe a lifelong sense of purpose. As Dr. Robert Butler, the first director of the National Institute on Aging, once told me, being able to define your life meaning adds to your life expectancy.
The healthful plant-based diet that Seventh-day Adventists eat has been associated with an extra decade of life expectancy. It has also been linked to reduced rates of diabetes and heart disease. Adventists' diet is inspired by the Bible -- Genesis 1:29. (''And God said: 'Behold, I have given you every herb yielding seed . . . and every tree, in which is the fruit of a tree yielding seed; to you it shall be for food.' '') But again, the key insight might be more about social structure than about the diet itself. While for most people, diets eventually fail, the Adventists eat the way they do for decades. How? Adventists hang out with other Adventists. When you go to an Adventist picnic, there's no steak grilling on the barbecue; it's a vegetarian potluck. No one is drinking alcohol or smoking. As Nicholas Christakis, a physician and social scientist at Harvard, found when examining data from a long-term study of the residents of Framingham, Mass., health habits can be as contagious as a cold virus. By his calculation, a Framingham individual's chances of becoming obese shot up by 57 percent if a friend became obese. Among the Adventists we looked at, it was mostly positive social contagions that were in circulation.
Ask the very old on Ikaria how they managed to live past 90, and they'll usually talk about the clean air and the wine. Or, as one 101-year-old woman put it to me with a shrug, ''We just forget to die.'' The reality is they have no idea how they got to be so old. And neither do we. To answer that question would require carefully tracking the lifestyles of a study group and a control group for an entire human lifetime (and then some). We do know from reliable data that people on Ikaria are outliving those on surrounding islands (a control group, of sorts). Samos, for instance, is just eight miles away. People there with the same genetic background eat yogurt, drink wine, breathe the same air, fish from the same sea as their neighbors on Ikaria. But people on Samos tend to live no longer than average Greeks. This is what makes the Ikarian formula so tantalizing.
If you pay careful attention to the way Ikarians have lived their lives, it appears that a dozen subtly powerful, mutually enhancing and pervasive factors are at work. It's easy to get enough rest if no one else wakes up early and the village goes dead during afternoon naptime. It helps that the cheapest, most accessible foods are also the most healthful -- and that your ancestors have spent centuries developing ways to make them taste good. It's hard to get through the day in Ikaria without walking up 20 hills. You're not likely to ever feel the existential pain of not belonging or even the simple stress of arriving late. Your community makes sure you'll always have something to eat, but peer pressure will get you to contribute something too. You're going to grow a garden, because that's what your parents did, and that's what your neighbors are doing. You're less likely to be a victim of crime because everyone at once is a busybody and feels as if he's being watched. At day's end, you'll share a cup of the seasonal herbal tea with your neighbor because that's what he's serving. Several glasses of wine may follow the tea, but you'll drink them in the company of good friends. On Sunday, you'll attend church, and you'll fast before Orthodox feast days. Even if you're antisocial, you'll never be entirely alone. Your neighbors will cajole you out of your house for the village festival to eat your portion of goat meat.
Every one of these factors can be tied to longevity. That's what the $70 billion diet industry and $20 billion health-club industry do in their efforts to persuade us that if we eat the right food or do the right workout, we'll be healthier, lose weight and live longer. But these strategies rarely work. Not because they're wrong-minded: it's a good idea for people to do any of these healthful activities. The problem is, it's difficult to change individual behaviors when community behaviors stay the same. In the United States, you can't go to a movie, walk through the airport or buy cough medicine without being routed through a gantlet of candy bars, salty snacks and sugar-sweetened beverages. The processed-food industry spends more than $4 billion a year tempting us to eat. How do you combat that? Discipline is a good thing, but discipline is a muscle that fatigues. Sooner or later, most people cave in to relentless temptation.
As our access to calories has increased, we've decreased the amount of physical activity in our lives. In 1970, about 40 percent of all children in the U.S. walked to school; now fewer than 12 percent do. Our grandparents, without exercising, burned up about five times as many calories a day in physical activity as we do. At the same time, access to food has exploded.
Despite the island's relative isolation, its tortuous roads and the fierce independence of its inhabitants, the American food culture, among other forces, is beginning to take root in Ikaria. Village markets are now selling potato chips and soda, which in my experience is replacing tea as the drink of choice among younger Ikarians. As the island's ancient traditions give way before globalization, the gap between Ikarian life spans and those of the rest of the world seems to be gradually disappearing, as the next generations of old people become less likely to live quite so long.
The big aha for me, having studied populations of the long-lived for nearly a decade, is how the factors that encourage longevity reinforce one another over the long term. For people to adopt a healthful lifestyle, I have become convinced, they need to live in an ecosystem, so to speak, that makes it possible. As soon as you take culture, belonging, purpose or religion out of the picture, the foundation for long healthy lives collapses. The power of such an environment lies in the mutually reinforcing relationships among lots of small nudges and default choices. There's no silver bullet to keep death and the diseases of old age at bay. If there's anything close to a secret, it's silver buckshot.
I called Moraitis a few weeks ago from my home in Minneapolis. Elpiniki died in the spring at age 85, and now he lives alone. He picked up the phone in the same whitewashed house that he'd moved into 35 years ago. It was late afternoon in Ikaria. He had worked in his vineyard that morning and just awakened from a nap. We chatted for a few minutes, but then he warned me that some of his neighbors were coming over for a drink in a few minutes and he'd have to go. I had one last question for him. How does he think he recovered from lung cancer?
''It just went away,'' he said. ''I actually went back to America about 25 years after moving here to see if the doctors could explain it to me.''
I had heard this part of the story before. It had become a piece of the folklore of Ikaria, proof of its exceptional way of life. Still, I asked him, ''What happened?''
''My doctors were all dead.''

HEADLINE: The Dead Don't Lie

BYLINE: By ROBERT W. STOCK

 BODY:
On a bright, chilly morning in February, Susan P. Baker sat in her fifth-floor office at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore, staring at her computer screen. She had just completed a search for the word ''sightseeing'' in a federal database of U.S. aviation crashes between 2000 and 2010. Now she was scrolling through a seemingly endless list of grim case histories of people who were killed or injured when their sightseeing aircraft or balloon crashed.
A month before, she read a news story about the crash of a tour helicopter in Nevada. Five people died, including a couple celebrating their 25th anniversary. ''It made me sad and angry,'' she recalled. ''Such senseless deaths!'' So Baker, an epidemiologist, did what she's been doing for more than four decades. She decided to find out why people were dying and what could be done to stop it. 
Working with Sarah-Blythe Ballard, a doctoral candidate and Navy flight surgeon, Baker prepared an abstract and sent it to the Aerospace Medical Association. When it's finished, the article will delineate the number of fatalities for each mode of sightseeing flight, including balloon, helicopter and fixed-wing; describe the circumstances that led to each crash, like encounters between hot-air balloons and power lines; and offer suggestions for reducing the risk of a crash -- for example, increasing training for pilots on landing in unfavorable wind conditions and avoiding power lines. Then, if everything goes the way it usually does when Baker publishes her work, the article will be picked up by the media, putting pressure on the businesses that run sightseeing flights, as well as the legislative committees and agencies that oversee their operations, to improve the way these flights are conducted. Over time, the hope is, fewer people will die in these sorts of accidents.
Baker has had a hand in more than 250 such research papers, as well as her nearly 40 monographs and textbook chapters and 5 books. She has endlessly lobbied, in person and in print, for gun control and air bags, motorcycle helmets and home sprinkler systems. She has fought to put the discipline of injury prevention on the nation's public-health agenda, leading to the creation of the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control and nearly a dozen injury-research centers at universities and hospitals around the country.
Dr. Gary Smith is the president of the Child Injury Prevention Alliance, in Columbus, Ohio. He is also one of the hundreds of today's injury-prevention leaders who decided on their life's work while sitting in Baker's classroom. ''Sue is to injury prevention what Einstein was to theoretical physics,'' he says. ''There were people there before them, some remarkable people, but these two changed everything.''
At 82, Baker is still pursuing the grisly facts behind deadly statistics. More than 120,000 Americans die from accidental injuries each year, and Baker believes many of them can be saved. As she explains it, ''To say that a car crash is an accident is to say it's a matter of chance, a surprise, but car crashes happen all the time, and the injuries that people sustain in those crashes are usually predictable and preventable.''
When Baker started her career in the 1960s, public health was still mostly about preventing disease, not injury. Tuberculosis and influenza killed tens of millions in the first part of the 20th century. To the extent that people were injured or lost their lives in accidents at home or at work or on the roads in between, corporate and government leaders generally viewed that as a cost of doing business, an unfortunate accompaniment to progress. It was the responsibility of the individual to keep himself safe from these dangers.
That focus on individual behavior led to the licensing of drivers and to decades of safety slogans in schools and factories and on the highways. By the 1930s, Burma Shave's billboards were ubiquitous: ''Keep well/To the right/Of the oncoming car/Get your close shaves/From the half-pound jar/Burma-Shave.'' Over the years, though, it became evident that education had its limits, and engineers began examining the environments in which most injuries occurred: homes, workplaces and roadways.
An early pioneer of the modern injury-prevention movement was Hugh DeHaven, a Brooklyn-born pilot with the Royal Canadian Flying Corps. After barely surviving a plane crash during a military practice mission in 1917, DeHaven was inspired to pursue a career in safety engineering. He developed the notion of ''packaging'' the occupants of a plane or car, like eggs in a carton, to prevent or reduce injuries in a crash.
In 1954, Dr. John Paul Stapp put DeHaven's ideas to the test at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico. Using a seat belt and a shoulder harness, he strapped himself into a rocket-propelled sled that rode along a rail. He went from a standing start to 632 miles an hour in five seconds, then came to a dead stop in 1.4 seconds. The effect was something like a car's hitting a brick wall at 120 miles an hour. Because he was strapped to his seat, Stapp survived.
Despite growing evidence of the seat belt's efficacy, the nation's carmakers did not immediately include them in most models. Robert McNamara, a general manager at Ford, placed a big, ill-fated bet on safety with the company's 1956 models, heavily advertising such features as stronger door latches, optional lap belts and padded instrument panels. Sales plummeted. As a refrain at the time put it: ''McNamara is selling safety, but Chevrolet is selling cars.''
Through the 1960s, however, the American public became increasingly concerned with safety. By the middle of the decade, seat belts were becoming standard in U.S. cars. And in 1965, Ralph Nader's best seller, ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' moved injury prevention onto the front page by criticizing the safety record of the auto industry in general and the Chevrolet Corvair in particular. With fatal crashes rising and the public up in arms about it, Congress passed the 1966 Highway Safety Act, which gave the federal government the power to establish safety standards for new cars. To set those standards, President Lyndon Johnson picked a physician-engineer named William Haddon, an early promoter of a lifesaving technology known as the air bag, who would soon cross paths with a young Susan Baker.
In 1967, Baker, then in her first year of a master's program in public-health epidemiology at Johns Hopkins and a mother of three, joined her husband, Tim, on a trip to Annapolis. Tim Baker, a professor of international health at Johns Hopkins, was planning to testify at a legislative committee hearing in support of a bill, radical at the time, to allow the police to test motorists for the presence of alcohol if they suspected drunken driving.
During the hearing, a toxicologist testified that 50,000 people died each year in car crashes. ''I was horrified,'' Baker recalled, ''and I realized that Hopkins wasn't doing anything about it -- no research in injury prevention, no courses, not even a single lecture.''
She embarked on an independent research project -- a comparison of drivers who were not responsible for their fatal crashes with drivers who were -- and in 1968 she sent Haddon a letter seeking federal financing for her study. He came through with $10,000 and continued to finance her research after he became president of the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety a year later.
Baker, meanwhile, got a job as a junior faculty member in forensic pathology with access to what she called ''a gold mine of data'' in the Baltimore medical examiner's office. Each morning she would visit the autopsy room to see the bodies that had arrived overnight, looking for patterns to the injuries -- what parts of the body were damaged and what caused the death.
Even while traveling, she didn't stop thinking about injury prevention. In 1971, while she was in Rio de Janeiro with her husband, who was working on a public-health project, she decided to study the city's pedestrian-fatality rate. Though she had only a tourist's knowledge of Portuguese, she memorized a few key words, spent weeks in a medical examiner's office isolating pedestrian deaths from overall fatalities. She wrote a paper showing that the number of pedestrians killed was four times the official figure.
By 1973, she was teaching Hopkins's first class in injury prevention. Baker's decision to champion what was at the time a virtually nonexistent discipline was a mystery to some of her colleagues. One of them, a public-health professor, asked what she was working on. ''The connection between alcohol and highway safety,'' she replied.
''Oh,'' the professor said, ''is that public health?''
Later Baker developed a close working relationship with a group of trauma surgeons, a rare alliance for an epidemiologist at the time. It led her to an important medical breakthrough: the Injury Severity Score (I.S.S.), a method of assigning an overall mathematical rating to patients with more than one injury. Once that score was calculated, scientists could explore the impact of other variables -- age, sex, specific treatments -- on the injured person's medical outcome. First published in 1974, the I.S.S. is still in widespread use for judging the efficiency of triage systems in trauma centers.
The I.S.S. turned out to be a major factor in Baker's promotion to a full professorship at Hopkins, even though she lacked a Ph.D. When she received her master's degree in 1968, she recalled, ''I was impatient to continue with my research. I figured if I needed a Ph.D. sometime, I could get it.'' She never needed it. She eventually became the first director of Hopkins's injury-research center, where she focused on training others in injury prevention.
Because highway injuries claimed so many lives, they attracted the most attention from injury-prevention scientists. But ideas about prevention in other areas were evolving as well. In 1970, President Richard Nixon signed the Occupational Safety and Health Act, giving the government authority to enforce injury-prevention standards for a majority of America's workers. Two years later, Congress created the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which covered products ranging from fixtures to furniture to fireworks.
As Baker moved from one area of research to another, writing on everything from infant suffocation caused by hot dogs to the importance of playgrounds with softer surfaces, her national reputation grew. She was asked to consult with or serve on advisory panels by dozens of organizations, including the Institute of Medicine, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Department of Transportation.
In the beginning, she was often the lone woman at professional gatherings. During the coffee break at her first meeting of the American Trauma Society in the early 1970s, she walked up to a group of men and introduced herself. ''They greeted me pleasantly,'' she recalled, ''and asked where my husband was.''
Among Baker's most important legacies is the widespread use of the infant car seat. By examining data from car crashes, she demonstrated that the passengers most likely to die were those younger than 6 months. They were killed at double the rate of 1-year-olds and triple the rate for ages 6 to 12. Why? Because babies rested in their mothers' arms or laps, often in the front passenger seat, and because their still-fragile bodies were more susceptible to fatal injury than those of older children. Baker published her study in the journal Pediatrics in 1979, making headlines in newspapers across the country.
One interested reader of those headlines was Dr. Kenneth Roberts, a pediatrician who was leading the drive for a child-car-seat law in Maryland. ''In my testimony before the Legislature,'' he recalled, ''I used Sue Baker's infant-fatality study, and I told them they could save more children's lives by signing their name than I could save in my lifetime.'' Roberts also sought out the pediatricians who were caring for the children or grandchildren of legislators who were against car-seat legislation -- and asked them to push for the measure personally. Legislation mandating car-safety restraints for children in Maryland was finally passed in 1983.
Around that time, Baker was one of the main authors of a report calling for the creation of a federal injury-prevention agency. Today the National Center for Injury Prevention and Control coordinates with state programs and underwrites research projects aimed at preventing injury, ranging from the intentional (rape, homicide, suicide) to the unintentional (falls, residential fires, drownings).
In one of her recent projects, Baker looked at another aspect of highway deaths. The study, which Baker prepared with David Swedler, a doctoral candidate, examined more than 14,000 fatal crashes involving teenage drivers. They found that male drivers were almost twice as likely as female drivers to have had high levels of alcohol in their blood and were also more likely to have been speeding and driving recklessly. Significantly, 38 percent of 15-year-old drivers, both male and female, were found to have been speeding, but by age 19, female speeders dropped to 22 percent, while male speeders remained steady at 38 percent.
Those differences, Baker says, suggest that boys and girls should not automatically receive the same driver training -- and that boys should perhaps receive their license at an older age than girls. ''Males might scream foul,'' Baker acknowledges, ''but let them.''
It wouldn't be the first time she has made enemies. At one point in the 1970s, Road Rider Magazine anointed her Bad Guy of the Month, because she insistently campaigned for laws to force motorcyclists to wear helmets. In 1979, at a Department of Transportation public hearing about the dangers faced by truck drivers, Baker angrily explained, ''Isn't it time we did some crash testing with trucks and dummies, rather than with drivers themselves?'' Later, according to Baker, the trucking industry hired a researcher to try to discredit her driver-safety studies. Unable to uncover problems with her work, he eventually gave up and called to tell her about his assignment.
Her critics sometimes complain that the injury-prevention movement infringes on their individual freedom. Sam Peltzman, an economist at the University of Chicago, has even argued that injury prevention can be counterproductive. In the mid-1970s, Peltzman did research on highway fatalities that suggested that mandatory safety features like seat belts and padded dashboards actually encouraged people to drive less cautiously.
Baker acknowledges that there may be some individuals in cars with anti-lock brakes, for example, who may not apply the brakes as soon as they did with the old brakes. But she insists there is no evidence that better brakes or air bags have encouraged recklessness -- that they have in fact saved many thousands of lives. ''What concerns me,'' she says, ''is that these spurious arguments are used by companies to bolster their opposition to beneficial safety regulation.''
Baker still puts in six-hour days at Johns Hopkins, teaching, researching and writing. Along with Guohua Li, a former student who is now a Columbia University professor, she recently edited a 700-page book, ''Injury Research: Theories, Methods and Approaches.'' It's the first textbook that comprehensively presents the theories and methods of injury research -- from the way ergonomics can reduce injuries to the effect of trauma-center systems on an injured person's chances of survival.
Sipping tea one afternoon in June in the living room of her home outside Baltimore, Baker assessed the current state of the injury-prevention movement. Annual highway fatalities have fallen to 35,000 in 2010, from 50,000 back when she was in graduate school, even as the population has risen by more than 50 percent. But a new government projection shows a rise of 9 percent in highway fatalities in the first six months of this year when compared with the same period last year. Deaths from all unintentional injury, she notes, are on the rise, going to 121,000 in 2010, from 98,000 in 1999. This, she insists, should be cause for alarm. ''What would happen if a new disease started killing Americans at the rate of 121,000 people a year?''she demanded. ''The government would instantly mobilize, and we'd do whatever it took to conquer the disease.''
As she talked about what still needed to be done, her voice was tinged with anger: ''Buildings need to be designed so it's not so easy to fall down stairs. All new homes should have sprinklers. Traffic lights should be timed for pedestrians, not to move as many cars as possible through an intersection. CPR training should be required for high-school graduation. Stoves and sinks should be close enough so you don't have to carry a pot of boiling water across the room. Parents should let their teenagers drive the new family car, not the old one -- it has better crash protection.'' She stopped for a breath. ''Don't get me started,''she said.
Of course, Baker knows that we can't make the world completely injury-proof. But her decades of research show how fairly simple preventive measures -- fences around swimming pools, bike helmets, childproof caps on medicine containers -- can save thousands of lives.
And you never know when an accident is going to hit close to home. Last year, Baker and her husband were driving north on I-83, not far from their home, when they were in a crash that destroyed the front end of their car. The air bags deployed instantly, and the couple escaped with minor injuries.
In an e-mail to friends about the incident, Baker described her ambulance trip to the hospital. Even in the midst of her own emergency, she couldn't stop thinking about injury prevention for others. ''My attention alternated between the readings for my blood pressure . . . and the lack of crash protection for the E.M.T.'s.'' She ended by noting her appreciation for all those who had worked to get air bags into cars, concluding that she ''never thought one would save my life.''

HEADLINE: President In Shining Armor

BYLINE: By ROSS DOUTHAT

 BODY:
FAR in the future, long after today's partisan passions have cooled, some enterprising women's studies doctoral student will be able to write a fascinating dissertation on the rhetoric and iconography surrounding gender in Barack Obama's 2012 campaign.
Such a dissertation might start with the Obama campaign's striking ''Life of Julia'' slide show, which portrayed an American woman protected from toddler-hood by the ''steps President Obama has taken,'' and menaced at every turn by Mitt Romney's reactionary policies. 
From there, it could touch on the campaign's unusual suggestion that Obama supporters use their wedding registries to solicit donations to the president's re-election effort. It might linger over the White House's elevation of Sandra Fluke, a progressive activist and Georgetown University law student, as a kind of martyr for free contraception after she was insulted by Rush Limbaugh. And it would probably conclude with the Obama campaign's release last week of a winking video from ''Girls'' creator Lena Dunham, urging young women to make sure their ''first time'' is with a ''great guy'' like President Obama. (Their first time voting -- what do you think she meant?)
To today's Obama supporters, these forays -- like the campaign's broader ''war on women'' framing, and its recent attempts to make the election a referendum on abortion in cases of rape -- just emphasize that the president is on the side of female empowerment, sexual, professional and otherwise.
But given the way Obama's once-enormous edge among female voters has shrunk in many polls, tomorrow's feminists may look back on his campaign's pitch to women and see a different theme emerge: a weirdly paternalistic form of social liberalism, in which women are forever single girls and the president is their father, lover, fiancé and paladin all rolled into one. (Our future dissertation author may note with bemusement, for instance, that Dunham's ad mirrors a similar advertisement cut for ... Vladimir Putin.)
This paternalistic pitch assumes that liberalism's traditional edge with women is built mostly on social issues, and that Democrats -- especially male Democrats -- win when they run as protectors of the sexual revolution, standing between their female constituents and the Todd Akins of the Republican Party.
But that conceit is probably wrong. The gap between men and women on issues like abortion is overstated, and the female preference for Democrats predates Roe v. Wade. In a recent blog post, Christina Wolbrecht of the University of Notre Dame calls the gender gap ''a recurrent, if not consistent, feature of presidential elections throughout the postwar era,'' which probably dates to Barry Goldwater's 1964 presidential campaign.
Not coincidentally, that was a year when Republican economic rhetoric took on a particularly individualistic cast. If there's a deep driver of the gender gap, it's usually views about spending and the role of government. Men are more likely to be libertarian, women are more likely to be communitarian, and this creates what Wolbrecht calls a natural ''divergence in preferences for social welfare policies.''
This helps explain why, among recent elections, the gender gap yawned widest in 1996 -- not an election with many culture-war flash points, but a year when Bill Clinton relentlessly tied Bob Dole to the Congressional Republicans' attempted cuts to domestic spending and entitlements.
It also helps explain why Romney made ground with women after his performance in the first presidential debate -- when he mostly pivoted toward the center on economic issues, and emphasized solidarity and community rather than ''you built that!'' individualism.
None of this means that the Obama White House's social issues appeals don't resonate with many female voters. But they're most successful as a form of narrowcasting -- a pitch to a particular group of women, often younger and left-leaning and unmarried, rather than to the female population as a whole.
Which is why it once seemed safe to assume that Obama's social issues strategy was a way of solidifying his base, and a warm-up act for the fall campaign. He would extol Planned Parenthood and hail Sandra Fluke all summer, the theory went, and turn Clintonian and talk mostly about entitlements and economic security after his convention.
Instead, the idea of Obama as a kind of knight protector for America's Julias and Lenas and Sandras, waging a lonely counteroffensive in the war on women, has basically become the White House's concluding pitch not only to his base, but to female undecided voters as well.
An imaginary Republican plot to ban contraception, the illusory threat that Mitt Romney would ban abortion in cases of rape, a wave of faux-chivalric outrage over Romney's line about ''binders full of women'' -- in a tight-as-a-tick, economy-centric election, this is the message that Obama is relying on to push him back over the top.
Perhaps it will actually work. Perhaps the Electoral College will save the president. But I'll just say this: It's awfully hard to imagine Hillary Clinton closing out a campaign this way.

HEADLINE: Of Mad Men, Mad Women and Meat Loaf

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD

 BODY:
WASHINGTON
MY sister, who was a secretary in the ''Mad Men'' era, is not worried that Republicans want to drag us back to being secretaries in the ''Mad Men'' era, as Tina Fey suggests.
Peggy is that most sought-after creature, an undecided woman who is a swing voter. She started as a blond concrete block in President Obama's female firewall, but like many other women, is now pondering divorcing him for the man who looks and darn well talks like a '50s sitcom dad. 
She does not believe the economy is getting better, and she trusts Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan not to do anything radical on women's reproductive rights or Medicare. She rejects my contention that Republicans in Congress would force them to; they see Mitt as an empty suit who would happily sign their far-right bills as long as he got Air Force One.
Our mom, a strict Catholic, taught us that it was immoral for a woman to be expected to carry a rapist's baby for nine months. (Don't even mention that rapists can assert parental rights in 31 states.)
But compassion is scant among the Puritan tribe of Republicans running now. As The Huffington Post reports, at least a dozen G.O.P. Senate candidates oppose abortion for rape victims. The party platform calls for a constitutional amendment with no exceptions for rape, incest or the mother's life.
Representative Todd Akin, running against Senator Claire McCaskill in Missouri, differentiated between rape and ''legitimate rape,'' implying that women would fake rape to get abortions, and suggested that women have a magic way not to get pregnant from rape.
Representative Joe Walsh, running for re-election in Illinois, contended that ''with advances in science and technology, 'health of the mother' has become a tool for abortions of any time or for any reason.'' Appalled obstetricians ticked off a litany of life-threatening situations.
Last week, Richard Mourdock, a Senate candidate in Indiana, said in a debate that ''even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen.''
Mitt was certainly no profile in courage after Mourdock's comment blew up. He didn't take back his endorsement. He hid from reporters on his plane, and even dodged his usual custom of giving a reporter a birthday hug. Instead, he broadcast a birthday message to her on the intercom from the safety of first class.
It shouldn't be a surprise that many women support Romney, even though he has somersaulted on reproductive rights and his running mate sponsored a bill with Akin giving fertilized eggs the ''legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood.'' Just as it shouldn't be surprising that Romney has the support of a huge swath of blue-collar white men, even though he's on a mission to make the 1 percent 100 percent able to indulge in car elevators.
Republicans are geniuses at getting people to vote against their own self-interest. Hispanics, however, do not seem inclined to vote against their self-interest on immigration laws, and Obama is counting on that to buoy him.
After the draining W. years -- when grumpy old men foolishly refought grumpy old wars -- Barack Obama was going to sweep us to modernity.
But, as the Republican strategist Alex Castellanos notes, ''He gets to Washington and calls Larry Summers.'' The only hope and change Obama could conjure this time was changing the period on his campaign slogan -- ''Forward.'' -- to an exclamation point. Romney was right when he spoke at a rally in Iowa on Friday and said the president had made the election ''about small, shiny objects.''
Mitt may have peaked too soon. Now he is left counting on what advisers call ''the silent majority.'' Obama's support among white voters has dived, and news reports call this the most racially polarized race since 1988. John Sununu, shockingly still a Romney surrogate, offered another flash of thinly veiled racism when he suggested that Colin Powell endorsed the president because they both were black, a comment he recanted. Sarah Palin said Obama was guilty of ''shuck and jive'' on Benghazi.
The high-minded Obama is trying to be hip, trash-talking Mitt in Rolling Stone, going on MTV to chitchat about hip-hop, joking with Jay Leno about his childhood in Kenya with Donald Trump. His campaign has a new ad with Lena Dunham, the creator of ''Girls,'' slyly comparing your first vote to ''your first time.'' The ad agitated some conservatives -- one used Twitter to align Dunham and Obama with Satan -- but was harmless. Ronald Reagan had a racier version 32 years ago.
Mitt hopes Americans are ready for some rules -- and binders. He is baked in the fuddy-duddy dad image from the era when white men ruled and the little women toiled over a hot stove. On Thursday, Ann Romney made his annual birthday treat, meatloaf cakes, on Rachael Ray's show while the candidate collected the endorsement of Meat Loaf, another blast from the past who balked at the notion that the cold war was over.
Mitt may have my sister. But he still needs Ohio.

HEADLINE: What's at Stake in This Election

BYLINE: By JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ. 
A Nobel laureate in economics, a professor at Columbia University and the author, most recently, of ''The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future.''

 BODY:
THE presidential election offers Americans a real choice, one with potentially large consequences. The future course of inequality and what, if anything, to do about it is one of many issues on which the candidates have profound differences that have not been adequately debated. Mitt Romney has been explicit: we should talk about inequality only behind closed doors. But American inequality has become so extreme, as The Economist reported in a recent special series, that it is adversely affecting our economy. Inequality, in other words, is no longer just a moral issue.
Perhaps this helps explain why the issue of poverty should suddenly appear as part of the Romney-Ryan makeover: now they're compassionate conservatives. Paul D. Ryan's speech on Wednesday in Cleveland might lead one to conclude that the Republican nominees are genuinely concerned about poverty, and perhaps they are.
But the numbers in the Ryan budget are far more revealing than any of the candidate's speeches. Mr. Ryan's proposed budget would gut programs that serve those at the bottom end of the economic ladder while enriching those at the top with tax cuts. 
The macroeconomic consequences of the Romney-Ryan economic program would be devastating: it would slow growth and increase unemployment while decreasing the protection of government safety nets just as Americans would need them more. And that's not even counting the Romney-Ryan approach to health care. They have criticized the president's reforms but have said nothing about how or whether they would ensure universal access to doctors, nurses and medicine.
Inequality in America is at a historic high. It is greater here than it is in any other advanced country, and it is rising. Our widening equality gap is not purely the result of market forces -- far from it, as the experience of other advanced countries subject to the same forces shows. Government policies -- or their lack -- played a big role in creating and maintaining these inequities.
Inequality in ''market incomes'' -- what individuals receive independently of any government transfers -- has increased as a result of ineffective enforcement of business competition laws, inadequate financial regulation, deficiency in corporate governance laws and ''corporate welfare'' -- huge corporate subsidies that reached new heights in the Bush administration.
It is disturbing how little Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have done to distance themselves from the economic policies of the Bush administration, which not only led to poor economic performance but also to so much inequality. Understandably, perhaps, Mr. Romney has not explained why individuals in the hedge fund and private equity fund business should enjoy a loophole in the tax law that allows them to pay just 15 percent taxes on their earnings, while ordinary workers pay a far higher rate. The 14 percent rate Mr. Romney reportedly paid on his income last year is well below that of Americans of comparable incomes who created a real business or made real innovations that transform our economy. Tax havens like the Cayman Islands facilitate another level of tax avoidance. We can be sure that the money is not in the Cayman Islands just because it grows faster in the bright sunshine there.
Our government does less to correct these inequalities than it did in the past -- and less than other countries do. And as disparities in market incomes have increased, the government's effort to correct them have diminished. It's not just a matter of redistribution, as some suggest, but a matter of ensuring that those at the top pay their fair share of taxes. Putting all this together isn't the politics of envy. It's about cold, hard economics. Tax avoidance and low tax rates on capital gains -- and the inequality they amplify -- weaken our economy and distort the way in which we allocate resources. They lead to underinvestments in infrastructure, technology and education.
The Romney campaign, however, has justified its failure to deal directly with inequality by deploying a handful of myths.
Here are a few of the most important:
America is a land of opportunity. While rags-to-riches stories still grip our imagination, the fact is that the life chances of a young American are more dependent on the income and wealth of his parents than in other advanced countries.
Trickle-down economics works. America's recent economic history, in which the rich have gotten richer, while most Americans have become worse off, disproves this patently false notion.
The rich are ''job creators,'' so giving them more money leads to more and better jobs. Mr. Romney's own private-sector history gives the lie to this. Many private equity funds made their money not by creating jobs in America but by restructuring, downsizing and moving jobs abroad. But more generally, many, if not most, of the crucial innovations in recent decades, from medicine to the Internet, have been animated primarily by government-financed research and development.
The cost of reducing inequality is so great that, as much as idealists would like to do so, we would be killing the goose that lays the golden egg. In fact, the engine of our economic growth is the middle class, and inequality, American style, has been weakening the middle class.
Markets are self-regulating and efficient, so any governmental interference with markets is a mistake. The 2008 crisis should have cured everyone of this mistaken idea. We grew much faster, and more stably, in the decades after World War II than in the period after 1980, when we started stripping away regulations that had protected the economy. And in the former period we grew together, in contrast to the latter, during which we grew apart.
The cost of these myths goes far beyond the damage to our economy. The fabric of our society and democracy is suffering. While we may be disappointed at how little of the money at the top goes into real investments in America, we should be concerned about how much goes into political investments, from which the very rich expect, and have received, high returns. These political investments corrupt our democracy: it's becoming more like one dollar, one vote than one person, one vote. Political inequality leads to economic inequality, which leads in turn to more political inequality, in a vicious spiral undermining our economy and our democracy.
Recognizing all this is not class warfare. It is simply acknowledging the realities of life in the United States. President Obama has at least touched on key elements: his education policies will enhance opportunity. His tax proposals will do a little bit about the extremes at the top. His jobs and investment programs will expand growth now and in the future, and they will be of enormous benefit to those in the middle.
Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan have tried a hard tack to the center in their rhetoric in recent weeks. But let no one be deceived: their tax policies will lead to more inequality, the continued hollowing out of the middle and more poverty at the bottom. Worst of all, their policies would lead to a more divided society, one that endangers our future -- our economy, democracy and sense of national identity.

HEADLINE: Who Gets Credit for the Recovery?

BYLINE: By DAVID LEONHARDT. 
David Leonhardt is the Washington bureau chief of The New York Times.

 BODY:
Washington
THE housing bust finally seems to be over. Health care costs have slowed. The unemployment rate has fallen below 8 percent, much sooner than forecasters were predicting a few months ago. Consumer confidence has reached a post-recession high.
There is still no guarantee that the economy is on a stable path to recovery, given its structural problems and the false starts of the last few years. But the odds that the recovery has finally begun have never been higher. Which is one more reason the presidential campaign, for all the groaning it has inspired from left, right and center, matters so much.
The winner is likely to be able to claim the mantle of the president who brought the country out of a long economic slump, as Bill Clinton and Ronald Reagan were previously able to do. Both sides know as much, too.
President Obama and his aides quietly chafe at the idea that Mitt Romney would be able to take credit for a recovery. Publicly, Mr. Obama has begun to emphasize the economic good news in recent weeks. Mr. Romney, for his part, has said he expects the economy to improve early in his presidency, not because of his policies but because of optimism about what he will do. 
Every presidential election affects the country's future, and it's silly to claim that this election is more significant than any other. Yet the prospect that the president who takes office in January will have the economic winds at his back -- that he can claim his party is the solution and the opposition was the problem -- is one of three main factors heightening the importance of the 2012 election.
The second is the fiscal cliff, $600 billion in spending cuts and tax increases scheduled to take effect on Jan. 1. They will allow the president to shape the future of American government without having to make a grand legislative push. Mr. Obama or Mr. Romney will help determine whether taxes on the affluent rise and what happens to spending on defense, education, scientific research and alternative energy.
The final factor, one that Mr. Obama's base often overlooks, is that his presidency has produced a more significant set of policies than any Democratic presidency in a half-century. And an assertive Republican Party has promised to undo many of those policies if it wins.
The scope of Mr. Obama's changes is easy to miss in part because he has used incremental, even moderate, means to achieve liberal ends. The health care law he and his Congressional allies passed relies less on government-provided care than either Richard M. Nixon's or Mr. Clinton's plans. But it is nonetheless the largest expansion of the safety net since Medicare and the most aggressive attack on inequality since inequality began rising in the 1980s.
In education, the Democrats expanded college financial aid, partly by eliminating bank subsidies, and pushed dozens of states to make K-12 schools more accountable. The 2009 stimulus bill also expanded and revamped infrastructure, antipoverty and research programs, as Michael Grunwald documents in his recent book, ''The New New Deal.''
Even Mr. Obama's and his allies' biggest domestic failure (aside from misjudging the depth of the economic downturn) was not complete. Although Washington never passed a sweeping climate bill, it sharply raised fuel-mileage standards and spurred a wind and solar boom with subsidies -- subsidies scheduled to expire on Jan. 1.
''We're not talking at this point in American history of brand new steps. We're talking about changing the direction,'' Theda Skocpol, a professor of government at Harvard and the author of ''Obama and America's Political Future,'' told me. ''What Obama was able to do was partially carry through on his promises to shift the direction of American domestic policy.''
She added: ''A great deal has been accomplished'' -- whether you think those accomplishments to be positive or negative -- ''but none of it sticks unless he is re-elected.''
The economy matters so much because Americans tend to judge a president more on its condition than on the partisan makeup of his plan. The yardstick for a president is ''not really liberal or conservative,'' Michael Gerson, a former speechwriter for George W. Bush, has said. ''It's strong or weak.''
A president who looks strong can move the country in the direction he wants. The paradox, of course, is that the president has only a limited effect on the economy's condition, especially in the short term.
Whoever wins on Nov. 6 is hardly assured of presiding over a boom. Households remain scarred by the housing bust, both financially and emotionally, and consumer spending is still subdued. Unemployment is likely to remain elevated for years.
But the crucial question, for the country's mood, is the economy's direction. In addition to the recent run of encouraging data, history also offers some reason for hope: over decades of financial crises, economies have typically begun to rebound between five and six years after the crisis began, according to oft-cited research by Carmen M. Reinhart and Kenneth S. Rogoff. They date the start of this crisis to mid-2007.
IF Mr. Romney were presiding over the recovery, he could present himself as a Reaganesque figure whose rejection of big government was getting the economy moving again.
He could insist on making the Bush tax cuts permanent, including on annual income above $250,000, and possibly reduce rates even further. He could push for an overhaul of the tax code and a reduction in regulation, both of which he argues would spur hiring. Depending on the makeup of the Senate, he could try to eliminate many of the subsidies for health insurance in the Obama health law. Republicans have signaled they would also try to increase military spending and reduce spending on Medicaid, the health-insurance program primarily for the poor.
In short, Mr. Romney could try to extend and expand the age of Reagan -- rather than to start a new period in domestic policy, as Mr. Obama has done.
For Mr. Obama, a second term with a recovering economy would lock in the policies of his first term. It would allow him to make the case that the Democrats' economic strategy was far superior to the Republicans', citing not only his own record but Mr. Clinton's strong economic record and the younger Mr. Bush's flawed one. In the broadest terms, Mr. Obama would try to fashion a response to the income slump of the last dozen years based around a more progressive tax code and government programs -- investments, in his phrasing -- meant to lift economic growth.
The fiscal cliff could give him leverage to insist on tax increases for the affluent and, relative to current law, tax cuts for everyone else. He has indicated he will accept cuts to Medicare, Medicaid and other social programs, but smaller than the ones Republicans favor. He could also expand programs for scientific research and alternative energy and, in 2013, push for an immigration overhaul.
Throughout much of the 2012 campaign, the debate and the stakes have seemed small, if not superficial. Mr. Obama, in place of a clear second-term agenda, published a brochure in the last week that repackages previous proposals. Mr. Romney, in place of a clear first-term agenda, has released a budget plan that does not add up. They are both exaggerating the near-term impact the election's outcome will have on the economy.
The next president probably will not determine the fate of the economy in 2013. But the economy will help determine the next president's power to shape the country. Right now, there is good reason to be bullish about the extent of that power.

HEADLINE: Awash in Milk And Money

BYLINE: By ANDREW MARTIN

 BODY:
THERE was a time not long ago when Gregg L. Engles was considered a genius in the dairy industry, a shrewd C.E.O. who had cobbled together a string of local businesses to create the nation's largest milk bottler, Dean Foods.
Dean's Web site described Mr. Engles as the primary architect of dairy consolidation, the often painful and perhaps inevitable shift to fewer, larger farms and bottling plants. His company's soaring share price made him a Wall Street star.
In fawning profiles in the business press, dairy clichés flew: Mr. Engles was ''cream of the crop,'' ''head of the herd'' and ''milkman to the nation.''
These days, however, as he prepares to step aside as chief executive of Dean Foods, Mr. Engles, 55, is perhaps better known for his paychecks, which continued to be hugely generous even as his company's fortunes tumbled. 
The Motley Fool noted in March that he had averaged $20.4 million in compensation over the previous six years, while Dean's stock fell 11 percent a year, on average. Forbes ranked him among its Worst Bosses for the Buck in 2011.
Wall Street soured on the nation's milkman.
A long-running antitrust lawsuit in a federal courthouse in Greeneville, Tenn., offered one possible explanation for his early success, by contending he engaged in a conspiracy more than a decade ago that helped expedite dairy industry consolidation and make himself a bundle.
Filed by a group of dairy farmers in 2007, the lawsuit said Mr. Engles cut a deal with the head of the nation's largest dairy cooperative, the Dairy Farmers of America, to eliminate competition in the Southeast. Another lawsuit was filed in Vermont in 2009, involving allegations of a similar scheme in the Northeast. Dean Foods, whose brands include Garelick Farms, Land O Lakes and Horizon Organic, has settled both lawsuits, without admitting wrongdoing; the suits continue against the D.F.A.
By normal rhythms of the industry, Mr. Engles and Gary Hanman, 78, a former chief executive of the D.F.A., would be financial adversaries. That's because bottlers try to buy raw milk as cheaply as possible. Many farmers joined cooperatives in the hope they could leverage their numbers for higher prices.
But according to the lawsuit, the deal that Mr. Engles made with Mr. Hanman went against normal economics. Mr. Engles promised that the D.F.A. would be the exclusive supplier to Dean's milk plants. The D.F.A., in turn, promised a reliable supply of Dean's main ingredient, raw milk, at the lowest prices, plus rebates and credits so Dean could acquire more milk plants, the suit says.
It all resulted in a small group of men making enormous sums of money, according to files in the Southeast lawsuit that recently became public. One business partner of Mr. Hanman was paid $100 million by Dean's predecessor and the D.F.A. for his stake in milk plants; the partner had paid $6.9 million for it two years earlier. A business partner of Mr. Engles was paid more than $80 million for his investment in milk plants; that partner had paid little more than $5 million.
Mr. Hanman was paid $31.6 million during his seven-year tenure as chief executive, including bonuses for increasing the cooperative's market share, according to court records.
As for Mr. Engles, his compensation over the last decade comes to $156 million, according to Equilar, a firm that tracks executive pay.
Dairy farmers say they didn't share in the riches. Instead, they say that they were paid suppressed prices for raw milk, and that the fallout continues. They are seeking more than $1 billion, including penalties, in the Southeast; the damage estimate for Northeast farmers remains under seal.
Dr. Sam Galphin, a North Carolina dairy farmer and veterinarian, said the Dean-D.F.A. pact was devastating to dairy farmers in the Southeast, cutting into incomes and ultimately forcing some out of the business. He said he continues to get suppressed prices for raw milk because there are few if any options for farmers, and he expects to lose $100,000 on his dairy farm this year.
''Even today there is no competition in this market,'' he said. ''Half of the people who were in business when the lawsuit was filed are now out of business.''
Through a Dean spokeswoman, Mr. Engles declined to comment for this article. Dean settled the suit with the Southeast farmers for $140 million in July, and settled with the Northeast farmers a year earlier, for $30 million, In both cases, it admitted no wrongdoing.
''We continue to be confident that we operated appropriately in our raw milk procurement,'' a Dean Foods statement said. ''We settled these cases to avoid the expense, uncertainty and distraction of litigation and the possibility of a lengthy appeals process.''
Mr. Engles is stepping down as C.E.O. in coming weeks, though he will remain chairman. On Friday, Dean had an initial public offering of its WhiteWave-Alpro unit, which includes the Silk and Horizon Organic brands; Mr. Engles will be C.E.O. of the new company.
Mr. Hanman referred questions to his lawyer, who declined to comment. A trial in the Southeast case against the D.F.A. is scheduled to begin in January; the Northeast case against the cooperative has not reached a trial stage.
Richard P. Smith, the D.F.A.'s current president and chief executive, disputed the notion that the pact between Dean and the D.F.A. was a conspiracy that suppressed prices for farmers. Instead, he characterized it as a business decision that didn't always work out the way the cooperative had hoped.
He maintained that the D.F.A. was able to charge Dean and other processors higher prices in the Southeast, but that this was often offset by the costs of bringing in additional milk from elsewhere to meet bottlers' demands.
But Mr. Smith, who succeeded Mr. Hanman in 2006, said the D.F.A. had been ''hung up on big rather than best.''
As for the payments to its former business partners, he said: ''The premise of a lot of these partnerships was D.F.A. would bring the milk and largely the investments and the partners would bring the expertise and know-how. And if all things worked out, it would be a win-win.
''Obviously when you look at some of the facts, some of it looks skewed, there is no doubt.''
The Justice Department conducted a 26-month antitrust investigation into the dairy industry during President George W. Bush's second term and recommended that enforcement action be taken against Dean Foods and the D.F.A., but no charges were filed, according to state and federal officials.
GREGG ENGLES stumbled into the dairy business, though he seemed destined to consolidate something.
According to several published profiles, he was born in Durant, Okla., and raised primarily in Denver. His father was a doctor.
His early résumé is impressive: Dartmouth College, Yale Law School, law clerk for Anthony M. Kennedy, who was then a judge on the United States Court of Appeals. Mr. Engles was admitted to the bar in Colorado and Texas.
But working for a law firm didn't interest him. Young lawyers he knew were making money but seemed bored with their jobs. By contrast, several entrepreneurs ''impressed him as being fully engaged in their work,'' according to a 2002 article in Chief Legal Officer, a publication that is now defunct.
''Many lawyers let knowledge of risk paralyze them,'' Mr. Engles was quoted as saying. ''They focus exclusively on risk, while entrepreneurs focus primarily on opportunity.''
After unsuccessful ventures, Mr. Engles and a partner paid $22 million, most of it borrowed, for Reddy Ice, a packaged-ice company. Mr. Engles then set about consolidating the packaged-ice business, tripling his company's size in seven years through acquisitions, according to a Forbes article in 2000.
During a golf game, Cletes Beshears, who was known as Tex and had run the dairy business of the Southland Corporation, then the parent of 7-Eleven, suggested that Mr. Engles could do the same in the dairy business.
''By the time we had made the turn,'' Mr. Engles told The Dallas Morning News in 1999, ''Tex and I had become partners in the dairy business.''
Their first in a series of acquisitions was a $100 million leveraged buyout of Suiza Dairy in Puerto Rico. Suiza went public in 1996 and, four years later, after 40 acquisitions, was the nation's biggest dairy processor. But Mr. Engles wasn't finished. He set his sights on his biggest rival, Dean Foods.
If Mr. Engles stumbled into the milk business, his ally in the Dean acquisition, Mr. Hanman, seemed destined to run a dairy cooperative.
He grew up on a livestock farm in north central Missouri, married his high school sweetheart and earned a bachelor's degree in agricultural economics from the University of Missouri, according to the Cooperative Hall of Fame. He also earned a master's in dairy marketing.
After a lengthy stint in the milk marketing office of the Agriculture Department, he began working for dairy cooperatives in 1964. Described as whip-smart and politically savvy, with a folksy demeanor that made him popular with farmers -- he wore bright red suspenders with ''Dairy Farmers of America'' down the front -- he rose quickly through the ranks.
But the ascent wasn't without controversy. He was questioned, but not charged, in an investigation into accusations that the Nixon administration bolstered milk price supports after the dairy industry pledged $2 million in campaign contributions. In 1988, he was suspended from trading for two months on the National Cheese Exchange in Wisconsin for bragging to members about boosting the price of cheese. And in 2008, the D.F.A., Mr. Hanman and a colleague paid a $12 million fine to settle charges that they had tried to manipulate milk futures.
Like Mr. Engles, Mr. Hanman was a proponent of consolidation. The D.F.A. was created in 1998 through the merger of four smaller cooperatives, one of which was overseen by Mr. Hanman.
And, like Mr. Engles, Mr. Hanman went against the time-honored practices of his trade. For instance, instead of squabbling with bottling companies over price, he sought joint ventures with them. Such arrangements gave members ''greater market security and an opportunity to capture income from the retail market,'' he was quoted as saying in a 2000 academic article published in the International Food and Agribusiness Management Review.
One joint venture was Suiza Foods. The D.F.A. owned a third of Suiza's dairy division and provided Suiza's plants with raw milk. ''The Suiza relationship reflects a major strategy change compared to the traditional role of a full-service milk cooperative,'' the academic paper said.
The lawsuits take another view, contending that it was the beginning of a relationship that ultimately increased the power -- and paychecks -- of a small group of executives at the expense of unwitting dairy farmers.
''I ENJOYED our meeting on Friday, and came away more convinced than ever that we share common interests in the evolution of the dairy industry, and that we can do an enormous amount of business together,'' Mr. Engles wrote in a 1997 letter to Mr. Hanman that is part of the court file.
As part of Suiza's deal with Mr. Hanman, Mr. Engles agreed to provide exclusive supply agreements to the D.F.A. The deal gave the cooperative an outlet for its farmers' milk, but also forced farmers to sign up with the cooperative if they wanted to continue selling to Suiza plants. The cooperative, in turn, agreed to use credits and rebates to help Suiza expand, and it turned over its share of milk bottling plants to Suiza.
Such deals worked out very well for the cooperative's partners in the milk plants. For instance, Pete Schenkel, a business associate of Mr. Hanman, was paid $100 million in 2000 for his share of Southern Foods, a dairy processor, by the cooperative and Suiza.
Allen Meyer, Mr. Schenkel's partner at Southern Foods, turned a $70 million profit on one bottling venture with the cooperative, and Robert Allen, a veteran dairy executive, made $22 million on his two-year investment in bottling plants with the cooperative.
On their investments in bottling plants with the D.F.A., Mr. Beshears made more than $80 million and Tracy Noll, who had worked with him in the dairy side of the Southland Corporation, made more than $26 million, court records show.
As Mr. Engles claimed a greater and greater portion of the dairy processing industry, he told The Dallas Morning News in 1999 that he hoped to achieve a market share of 30 percent to 40 percent in three or four years.
In fact, it took him just two years. He worked out the deal to buy Dean Foods on a hunting trip in South Dakota with Mr. Hanman and Mr. Schenkel, among others, court records show.
The merged entity kept the Dean Foods name and worked out an arrangement with D.F.A. that expanded their relationship and their control over dairy farming and milk processing, particularly in the nation's eastern third.
To appease Justice Department concerns, Suiza and Dean sold some of their dairy plants to a newly created company, National Dairy Holdings, that was supposed to provide additional marketplace competition.
But the D.F.A. provided much of the funding for National Dairy Holdings, and the new company's partners were Mr. Beshears, Mr. Meyer and Mr. Noll,. Mr. Hanman served on National Dairy Holdings' management committee and had veto power over its decisions. As was the case with Dean Foods, the D.F.A. was given full-supply agreements with National Dairy Holdings.
In other words, National Dairy Holdings wasn't a real competitor but a thinly veiled arm of the D.F.A., court records show. Mr. Meyer, the C.E.O., later testified that he didn't set prices for his milk without checking with the D.F.A. to find out what Dean and other processors were charging first.
Though dairy farmers and other cooperatives did not have to join the big cooperative, they were required to sell their milk through new marketing agencies controlled by the D.F.A. if they wanted to sell milk to Dean or National Dairy Holdings.
A provision in the D.F.A.'s contract with Dean required the cooperative to sell raw milk at the lowest price in the marketplace, court records show.
But the cooperative's control of the Southeast created a problem: there weren't enough farmers to meet demands of milk plants in the region. So it required farmers to pay the costs of having milk trucked in from the Southwest, where a proliferation of huge dairies produces a surplus of milk.
As it turned out, the D.F.A. had its own milk hauling company, which it owned with a Missouri man named William Honeycutt, who owned a hunting lodge in South Dakota with Mr. Hanman and others. The cooperative eventually bought Mr. Honeycutt's $247,500 stake in the company for $18.1 million, court records show.
Mr. Noll, Mr. Beshears and Mr. Meyer could not be located for comment. Mr. Schenkel declined to comment.
Mr. Honeycutt didn't dispute his earnings from the hauling company. But he said he and the cooperative each put $247,500 into the transport company to begin with and built it into a $32 million operation, when he sold his half.
THE Dean-Suiza merger made Mr. Engles's company the dominant player in milk processing. It was a boon for investors, and for his bank account.
Dean's stock climbed steadily, from less than $20 in 2002 to more than $37 at its peak at the beginning of 2007, adjusted for splits. In 2003, Forbes included Mr. Engles in an article about best bosses; it noted a 29 percent annualized return to shareholders since 1996.
Mr. Engles received $2 million in compensation in 2001, the year Suiza acquired Dean Foods and kept the Dean name. His salary rose thereafter, to $7.5 million in 2002 and $17.5 million in 2003, according to Equilar. His biggest Dean payday was in 2006, when his overall compensation was $65 million.
In addition, Dean leased two corporate aircraft from companies owned by Mr. Engles and Mr. Schenkel, an arrangement that cost it $2.1 million in 2002. The next year, Dean bought the aircraft for $9.6 million, the amount Mr. Engles and Mr. Schenkel owed on the planes, according to corporate filings.
But the heady times for Mr. Engles ended abruptly in 2007. Just as Dean's stock was peaking, he announced it would borrow $4.8 billion, using $2 billion of it for a one-time, $15-a-share dividend. Some saw it as a defensive measure to ward off takeover attempts.
Though investors cheered, the move couldn't have come at a worse time. Shortly thereafter, prices for raw milk shot up sharply; the economic crisis soon followed, and retailers used milk as a loss leader to generate business.
Weighed down by debt and a flat economy, Dean struggled for several years as its stock price continued to slide, bottoming out near $7 in 2010.
The stock has since rebounded somewhat, to $16.74, and some Wall Street watchers say Mr. Engles may have recaptured the magic. Last May on ''Mad Money'' on CNBC, Jim Cramer suggested that Dean might be ''the best corporate turnaround of the era.''
''The phenomenal performance of Dean Foods practically leaves me speechless,'' Mr. Cramer said.
But at Dean's annual meeting in May, many shareholders vented frustrations at the board and Mr. Engles. One shareholder told him, ''I have lost money on this particular company,'' according to a Dallas Morning News account.
''As have I,'' Mr. Engles said. ''An enormous amount.''

HEADLINE: In a Tight Senate Race in Nevada, an Ethics Investigation Looms Large

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI

 BODY:
RENO, Nev. -- Representative Shelley Berkley, battling for a Senate seat, flew to northern Nevada hours after appearing with Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. at a rally in her Las Vegas district. On Oct. 19, before returning south for the start of early voting, Ms. Berkley crisscrossed Washoe County, the battleground where her image has been largely shaped by a barrage of television advertisements from her rival attacking her ethics.
With Ms. Berkley, a Democrat, locked in a very tight race for one of the most fiercely fought Senate races in the country, her Republican opponent, Senator Dean Heller, was calculating that he could scrape his way to re-election with an unrelenting focus on the ethics cloud surrounding her, analysts said.
Mr. Heller made no public appearances during the week, but his ubiquitous television ads have hammered at the congresswoman, who is being investigated by the House over allegations that she used her office to help her husband's medical practice. 
The race has remained tight despite the investigation, experts said, because of Ms. Berkley's popularity in her district, which she has represented for seven terms, her tenacious campaigning and the formidable support of Senator Harry Reid's muscular machine. In the early morning cold, Ms. Berkley sought votes from Teamster members at a United Parcel Service center before heading to a breakfast here with a receptive group of older residents.
''I will stand with you, I will work with you, and I will fight for you,'' she said, pledging to protect Medicare and Social Security.
A victory by Mr. Heller is critical to Republican hopes of wresting the Senate from Democratic control and dislodging Mr. Reid, this state's senior senator, as majority leader. A former congressman who was elected to a safely Republican district here in 2007, Mr. Heller was appointed last year by Gov. Brian Sandoval to succeed John Ensign, another Republican, who resigned from the Senate over a sex scandal.
Still reeling from the nation's highest unemployment rate and one of its highest home foreclosure rates, Nevada has emerged as one of the most contested states in the presidential battle, and the Senate race has also become a proxy, pitting two candidates with records of voting along partisan lines.
A onetime stockbroker who referred to the unemployed as ''hobos'' in an unguarded moment, Mr. Heller, 52, is a social conservative who has attacked Ms. Berkley for supporting President Obama's economic policies. A social liberal, Ms. Berkley, 61, has assailed her opponent for embracing the Republican top of the ticket's proposed spending cuts and Medicare changes.
Ms. Berkley is depending on Mr. Obama, whose formidable voter turnout operations helped him carry the state in 2008. But Mitt Romney has invested considerable resources in forging a ground operation in the state, which has a significant Mormon population. Both Mr. Romney and Mr. Heller are Mormons. Here in Washoe, the county that makes Nevada a swing state, registered Republicans slightly outnumber Democrats this time.
Darren Littell, a spokesman for Team Nevada, which oversees Republican campaigns, said candidates were now coordinating their efforts on the ground.
''I think it's going to positively affect the Senate race here,'' he said.
To overcome her deficit in the polls, Ms. Berkley must win big in her Democratic district and blunt a likely victory by Mr. Heller here. In Las Vegas, she tried to fire up core supporters recently, eating a hot dog at a picnic by the Laborers' International Union of North America and riding in a red Jeep in the annual Hispanic Day Parade.
Ms. Berkley mentioned her support for the Dream Act, a bill that would have given legal status to young illegal immigrants and was popular among Hispanics, who account for 14 percent of the state's electorate. Mr. Heller opposed the Dream Act, which he called a ''backdoor amnesty program'' and ''pandering'' to Hispanics, and has also spoken in favor of eliminating birthright citizenship, a hard stance on immigration that resonates in rural areas and among some white voters elsewhere.
''I believe it was a portion of the Constitution years ago at the beginning of this country. It made a lot of sense then; it makes less sense today,'' Mr. Heller said during the third and final debate on Oct. 15.
But more than anything, Mr. Heller's television ads, as well as those financed by ''super PACs'' pouring money into Nevada, have aimed at Ms. Berkley's ethics problems. A House panel is investigating whether Ms. Berkley wrongly intervened with Medicare officials in 2008 to keep open a troubled kidney transplant center with ties to her husband's practice.
The investigation has hurt Ms. Berkley among voters like Steven Foremaster, 47, a lawyer who was watching the Hispanic parade. An Obama supporter, he said Ms. Berkley would not get his vote because of the investigation.
''That was the main thing for me,'' he said.
In an interview, Ms. Berkley repeated her position that Nevada politicians worked together to save the state's only kidney transplant center and that her husband's ties to it were widely known.
Speaking of her opponent's focus on her ethics -- his latest ad called her ''one of the most corrupt members of Congress'' -- she said, ''He doesn't have anything else.''
But Mr. Heller clearly believes it is enough to win, analysts said.
''Heller is running this safe, lackluster, almost issue-less campaign, except for Berkley's ethics,'' said Eric Herzik, chairman of the political science department at the University of Nevada, Reno.
Mr. Heller has held few events open to the public, and his aides have refused to inform journalists in advance of the rare event on his schedule. Asked why, Chandler Smith, a spokeswoman for Mr. Heller, declined to comment.
''When you're ahead, you try not to make mistakes,'' said Dave Buell, chairman of the Washoe County Republican Party.
But Mark Peplowski, a political scientist at the College of Southern Nevada, said Mr. Heller might be overestimating the impact of Ms. Berkley's ethics problem, especially in her district, where more than 70 percent of the state's voters live.
''Ethics resonates in Washoe County because they don't know her up there,'' he said. ''But down here, people are going: 'That's not Shelley. She's not that type. She's a scrapper. She fights for us.' ''
Here in Washoe County, the enthusiasm for Mr. Obama has ebbed since 2008, when he carried the county by 12 percentage points, a fact that will make it even more crucial for Ms. Berkley to define herself on her own terms in the final weeks before Election Day. Reno, the county's biggest city, whose gambling industry has been decimated by the popularity of Indian casinos in Northern California, is struggling to pull itself out of the recession and find a new economic base.
Here in downtown Reno, where many shuttered casino buildings have sat empty for years, Larry Thomas stood in line recently to hear Mr. Biden speak.
Mr. Thomas, 52, a longtime registered Democrat, said Mr. Heller's ads had planted doubts in his mind about Ms. Berkley. But he said she had won his support after he wrote to her office and he received a reply elaborating on her policies.
''The only way she's known here is through the ads,'' he said, ''and it's not a way to get to know her.''

HEADLINE: Here a Cliff, There a Cliff. But Then There's the Fed.

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
ANYWHERE investors turned last week, they seemed to be approaching a cliff. But the Federal Reserve provided a margin of safety, and said it stood ready to do so for many months to come.
The stock market, which had climbed so steadily for so long, has been stumbling. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index is up more than 12 percent for the year, but it has declined 3.7 percent since its peak on Sept. 14.
''Cliffs are in fashion this fall,'' Ed Yardeni, an independent economist, wrote on Thursday. There are fiscal cliffs, earnings cliffs, revenue cliffs and political cliffs -- notably, the stark uncertainty of a presidential election lurching to a razor-close finish. 
Mr. Yardeni said the market ''is already stumbling off an 'earnings cliff,' '' and investors worry that political gridlock could render the nation unable to avert a fiscal precipice, too.
That dreaded fiscal cliff came into unexpected view on Monday night, in a presidential debate that was putatively focused on foreign policy. President Obama told Mitt Romney, his Republican challenger, that an automatic cut in military spending simply ''will not happen'' on Jan. 1. But it wasn't clear how Mr. Obama would manage to avoid the fiscal cliff -- a crushing combination of tax increases and budget cuts -- if he cannot reach agreement with a lame-duck Congress on how to avoid it.
The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimated in August that a crash off the fiscal cliff would mire the economy in a ''significant'' recession. And the International Monetary Fund warned this month that the ''fiscal cliff'' would trim roughly 4 percent from the growth rate of the American economy. Gross domestic product is already growing at an anemic annual rate: 2 percent in the third quarter, the Commerce Department reported on Friday.
One sign of heightened corporate concern about the danger of the fiscal cliff emerged on Thursday morning, when executives of more than 80 large American corporations signed a statement calling for a debt-reduction compromise that would ''include comprehensive and pro-growth tax reform, which broadens the base, lowers rates, raises revenues and reduces the deficit.'' That implies a tax increase, which Mr. Romney and other Republican leaders have vowed to prevent. The executives said they would push for a bipartisan agreement once this contentious election season was over.
Wall Street, meanwhile, has been disappointed by the corporate earnings reports streaming in, with analysts expecting a 1.2 percent decline in earnings for the third quarter, which would be the first quarterly decrease since the third quarter of 2009, according to Thomson Reuters I/B/E/S. Revenue is expected to fall at the same rate.
Bellwethers like General Electric, 3M, Xerox and DuPont have issued downbeat forecasts. Bloomberg reported that since Sept. 1, North American-based companies have announced that they will eliminate 62,600 jobs, the biggest two-month toll since early 2010. Speaking of the market as whole, Mr. Yardeni said revenues seem to be at the edge of a cliff. ''If they fall off of it,'' he said, ''so will the profit margin.''
Consumer confidence and the housing market continue to be haunted by the financial crisis and recession that ended in 2009, but they have rebounded considerably. But corporate investment remains constrained. Barry Knapp, United States equity strategist at Barclays, said big business was engaging in a ''capital strike'' -- a reluctance to commit substantial sums for long-term projects ''until the results of the election are known, and it's clear that the fiscal cliff can be averted.'' Until then, he said in an interview, ''we're going to have a subpar recovery.''
IN the midst of these unsettling portents, Fed policy makers said on Wednesday that they would take whatever measures were necessary to ensure that the economy grew and that unemployment declined.
What is more, they promised to continue their stimulative policies, not just while the economy is weak but ''for a considerable time after the economic recovery strengthens.'' Fed policies now in place include ultralow short-term interest rates and intervention in the fixed-income markets, where the central bank is buying $85 billion of securities each month in an effort to keep longer-term rates, including mortgage rates, low.
The Fed's policy has come under attack from Republicans during the election campaign. Mr. Romney has said the Fed has raised the risk of runaway inflation, increasing uncertainty and dousing the enthusiasm of business, thus impeding the economic recovery. If elected, he says, he will replace Ben S. Bernanke, the Fed chairman, whose term expires in January 2014.
That could create a timing issue. In its statement, the Fed said it expected to hold short-term interest rates near zero ''at least through mid-2015.'' And there are indications that the central bank is considering changes ''that could ensure that Bernanke's growth-oriented policies will endure long after his term as Fed chairman expires,'' said Michael E. Feroli, chief United States economist at JPMorgan Chase.
It could do that if Fed members with years remaining in their terms embraced measures now that commit the central bank to an expansionary monetary policy until certain conditions are met. A future Fed chairman's power could ''be circumscribed by a more formal policy-making process,'' Mr. Feroli said.
For example, the Fed might keep short-term rates ''at zero until the unemployment rate is at least below 7 percent, provided inflation doesn't breach 3 percent,'' Mr. Feroli said. Charles L. Evans, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, advocates that change.
This issue could come up at the Fed's December meeting -- after the election, but before the government reaches the fiscal cliff.

HEADLINE: A Quick Trip To 2016

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON.

 BODY:
Now that the campaign is almost over, it's clear that this presidential cycle was all about the economy. Just not the economy we're actually entering. This thought crossed my mind during the second presidential debate as Mitt Romney declared that, if elected, he would label China as a currency manipulator. It was a rehearsed entreaty meant to appeal to thousands of frustrated manufacturing workers and their bosses in Rust Belt states. But it mainly confirmed how far we are from understanding our place in the new global economy. 
Not that long ago, the U.S. had that global economy all to itself. From the 1950s to the 1980s, it was the world's dominant producer and consumer. In countries spanning Europe to Latin America, and throughout Asia, success was determined by how well they could siphon off a bit of this incredible growth. Things began to change in the 1970s, however, when Japan and Germany started making cars and factory equipment and electronic gadgets that beat their American competitors. And for the next 30 years, the U.S. struggled to adjust to increasingly competitive Asian and Latin American producers. But as long as it remained the world's largest consumer market, the U.S. maintained lots of leverage. The government persuaded Pakistan to join the global war on terror, for instance, partly by promising its sock manufacturers duty-free access to its market.
It's useful to consider the framework of Ian Bremmer, president of the Eurasia Group, a political consultancy. American power during the past half century, Bremmer says, has been based on a strong military and an enormous market -- one that can reward and punish. And while the former has maintained its standing, the rest of the world is becoming much less fixated on the latter. Romney and Barack Obama can promise to punish China all they want (Obama, in fact, made an identical point in 2008), but their statements merely suggest either that they don't realize America's economic power has diminished or (more likely) that they're just too afraid to say it out loud. And that's too bad. Those Rust Belt voters would be better served, Bremmer says, if the next president could persuade American businesses to stop complaining about China and instead focus on making goods that its consumers want to buy. For decades, Chinese businesses studied the American market. Now it's time to play catch-up.
As this political cycle comes to a close, it's clear that the U.S. has entered a new economic chapter. By the next election, the upheaval of the past few years will have (hopefully) settled, and we'll be looking at a clearer vision of our future. I asked several leading experts to project what the U.S. will look like by 2016, and there was a consensus. Instead of a sudden bounce back, Harvard's Jeffry Frieden told me, there will be steady but far-too-slow growth. Unemployment will be at around 6.4 percent, according to Nigel Gault of IHS Global Insight, an economic forecaster. More significant, by 2016, Frieden and Bremmer noted, the U.S. will be adjusting to an economy in which inequality is a structural fixture. There will be millions who are unable to get work, and tens of millions more who will have to adapt to lower income. Meanwhile, those with college and advanced degrees will experience a country that has rebounded. Their incomes will grow.
China's economy probably won't eclipse the U.S. economy until some time in the 2020s, but by 2016, far fewer Americans will believe that the U.S. can stop China from manipulating its currency or doing whatever else it wants. By then Americans will probably have experienced its economic might firsthand. Brent Iadarola, a director at the industry-research firm Frost & Sullivan, told me that the new global economy will look like our current mobile-phone market. Nearly every American adult has a cellphone, but only 40 percent of them have an iPhone, Android or other smartphone. As such, the industry is expecting rapid growth in the next few years. By 2016, though, the U.S. market should be saturated, and smartphone manufacturers will have to add a lot of new features just to get a small number of people to upgrade. There won't be large growth or large profits in the U.S. The major companies -- and the secondary economy of case makers and app designers -- will be focused on the tastes of emerging markets in Asia, Eastern Europe, Latin America and Africa.
It's also going to be much clearer to American workers in various industries that many of their best opportunities are overseas. Pharmaceutical companies are encouraged by the U.S. market in the next few years partly because so many baby boomers are reaching their peak medicine-consuming years. Once that market begins to disappear, though, Big Pharma will most likely pursue the billions of middle-aged people in quickly advancing poor countries. (They'll have their work cut out for them competing against generic and local companies, but the potential is extraordinary.) According to the IMS Institute for Healthcare Informatics, 41 percent of all drugs sold throughout the world in 2006 were sold to Americans. Only 14 percent of drugs were sold to all of the emerging markets combined. By 2016, IMS expects that patients in those markets will buy the same value of drugs as Americans.
I heard this basic outline again and again -- from cars to entertainment and even to agriculture. Mark Evans, editor of the trade journal Fertilizer International, told me that even in the crop-fertilizer industry ''the baton is being passed.'' Which is the best way to think of the shift our economy will take. It's not that the U.S. economy will shrink. Rather, the U.S. economy is becoming boring while other markets are offering huge opportunity. An empire may not be abruptly ending, but the days of politicians talking dismissively about China's monetary policy sure are.
Soon after the second debate, I called William Roger Louis, a leading scholar of the final stages of the British Empire. Louis told me that after watching Obama and Romney, he thought of Harold Macmillan, the first postwar British prime minister to fully accept that the U.K. needed to adjust to a smaller role in the world. After coming in to office, in 1957, Macmillan asked his cabinet to prepare an audit: to study Britain's relationship with every colony, protectorate and outpost. He asked them to do so with a cold accountant's eye and adopt simple economic pragmatism.
Over the next few decades, Macmillan's audit served as a guide. The U.K. quickly left numerous Pacific colonies, shored up its relations with India, Pakistan and other former underlings and offered independence to various African and Caribbean nations while maintaining a huge economic presence. Sure, this comparison is imperfect. The U.S. has no colonies and will still be the biggest economy in the world for some time. Nevertheless, Louis said, the U.S. could still use a Macmillan moment -- a statesman to help it adjust to an economy that doesn't have the same amount of pull as it used to. In 2016, we will be one step closer. The question is when our leaders will be talking honestly about it.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. This election was all about yesterday's economy.
2. Time to figure out what gadgets people want in China.
3. How does a president manage a waning empire?

HIGHLIGHT: Best of long-form journalism this week. 

 BODY:
Whether it is Communist China or democratic, socialist India, corruption by top politicians seems to follow the same path, use the same techniques and yield the same results -- politicians and their family members suddenly become rich as they become powerful.
In India, of course, politicians have followed similar pattern, irrespective of the party they came from. Examples include corruption in the telecommunications industry, the Commonwealth Games, the allocation of coal mining blocks and the illegal mining of iron ore. Allegations about companies promoted by Nitin Gadkari, the president of opposition Bharatiya Janata Party and Robert Vadra, the son-in-law of Sonia Gandhi, also follow the same patterns.
In "Hunger Stalks My Father's India Long After Starvation Ends," the Bloomberg reporter Mehul Srivastava returns to his father's village of Auar, in Uttar Pradesh, where villagers once survived on coarse, imported wheat from the United States in the 1950s, to find their situation little improved now.
Mr. Srivastava and his immediate family escaped the plight of many of these villagers thanks to his family's emphasis on education. A "single generation of good nutrition" that he and his cousins experienced separates them from their parents, and catapulted them into the top 10 percent in India for height and health, he wrote. "In Auar, I felt like a giant, stooping through doorways, my feet dangling over the edge of my borrowed cot."
Time Magazine's special report on India, carried a series of articles that focused on the overarching theme-"can the nation recover its magic?" One of the articles, by the author Akash Kapur, argues that the entire country "has been reduced to a giant dumping yard," with plastic bags, bottles and rubber tires strewn around and the air polluted with chemicals. He writes that the "garbage crisis" is symptomatic of the "nation's troubled engagement with modern capitalism -- reflecting a new prosperity and consumer boom, yet a reminder too of the terrible price often expected by that boom."
Mr. Kapur postulates that if India wants to overcome social, cultural and environmental depravation, it needs to search for a new identity. An alternate model of development will matter deeply not only to India, but also other emerging economies around the world, he notes. "Even in the West, with capitalism in crisis and a sense of old certainties crumbling, India's search has a new salience."

HEADLINE: Trading With the Enemy

BYLINE: PHIL LEIGH


HIGHLIGHT: Despite a blockade and an embargo, the North-South cotton trade thrived during the Civil War. 

 BODY:
Gen. Ulysses S. Grant took command of the Department of Tennessee on Oct. 25, 1862, and immediately started planning to capture Vicksburg, Miss., the principal remaining Confederate stronghold on the Mississippi River. In doing so, he came face to face with the dangerous consequences of a surprising fact of the Civil War: the semi-illicit trade in cotton between North and South. Northern merchants paid well, and often in gold, for the Southern crop; the Confederates then used that gold to buy new weapons, sometimes from clandestine suppliers in Northern or occupied cities like Cincinnati and Memphis. Grant soon found himself confronting rebel troops sustained by such trade, including cavalry armed with modern breech-loading carbines. 
It's well known that British textile manufacturers relied heavily on Southern cotton for their raw materials, but the New England mills ranked second. Consequently, by the autumn of 1862 Northern "cotton speculators" were regularly infiltrating front lines seeking to acquire feedstock needed in Britain and New England. The year before Lincoln's election, the South accounted for 70 percent of American exports, the great majority of it cotton. 
The war, and the federal blockade of Southern ports, sharply curtailed those exports. This wasn't just a problem for the textile industry: President Lincoln could scarcely hope for a favorable trade balance without cotton. Given that gold was the international settlements standard, the situation could strain the Treasury thereby eroding America's international status and inviting foreign recognition of the Confederacy. At the same time, Lincoln, Seward and others believed that Europeans might intervene if their textiles industries were overly deprived of the commodity. And so the decision was made to quietly allow intersectional trade in cotton. 
Federal policy toward North-South trade evolved fitfully. Expecting limited activity, in July 1861 Congress gave the president and Treasury secretary the right to issue "such trading licenses as the public good might require." But even within the administration, Cabinet members disagreed and even changed viewpoints. To complicate matters further, Washington's official policy rarely translated perfectly in the field, where generals and Treasury agents pursued their own agendas, even when they ran at cross purposes to the president's. 
Things were more straight-forward in the South. Confederate armies were so desperate for essential supplies like salt for food preservation that they had little choice but to accept the benefits of trade despite official prohibition. The historian James McPherson summarized, "The Davis administration looked the other way out of necessity; the Lincoln administration looked the other way out of policy." 
The money, after all, was very good. By the fall of 1862 a combination of an initial Southern embargo and a tightening Federal naval blockade created a scarcity that inflated cotton prices. Behind Confederate lines the staple could be purchased at 10 cents a pound, but was worth 70 cents or more in Northern or overseas markets. Given that differential, efforts to prevent North-South trade were as ineffective King Canute's orders to hold back the waves. 
Government officials and military officers were bribed to shut their eyes. As the historian Ludwell Johnson wrote, "Cotton permits were sold on the streets of New York; soldiers were bribed; traders were blackmailed; Treasury agents were disgraced." In January 1863 Charles Dana, who was a special investigating agent for War Secretary Edwin M. Stanton, wrote from Memphis, "the mania" for cotton had "corrupted and demoralized the army." Five months later, Lincoln himself admitted to his Illinois friend William Kellogg, "The officers of the Army in numerous instances are believed to connive and share in the profits" from the cotton trade. Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase's agent in New Orleans repeatedly wrote that he could not stop "unwarranted" trade because the brother of Gen. Benjamin Butler, who ran the city, profited from it. 
Of course, this being war, the Union Army saw an easier way to get cotton than by purchase: it could simply capture it. But whenever a Union advance appeared imminent, only the opportunity to sell their crops and inventory might prevent Southern farmers and soldiers from routinely burning the cotton.
Lincoln's policy did not go unchallenged. Among others, Gen. Edward Canby wrote to the president that cotton traders "follow the track of the army (and) traffic in its blood," with all the "baseness of Judas Iscariot, but without his remorse." Lincoln responded that, since higher cotton prices enabled the Confederacy to make as much profit as before the war off a small fraction of the antebellum tonnage, it was better to let Northern commercial interests buy and export the cotton than to let the rebels do it directly. 
And there was no getting around the fact that the North desperately needed cotton itself. The historian Lauriston Bullard wrote, "Massachusetts was almost as much dependent upon cotton as South Carolina or Mississippi." The demand was ravenous: two weeks before the Union captured Memphis, a major cotton port on the Mississippi River, 18 New England textile manufacturers petitioned Congressman Samuel Hooper of Massachusetts to re-establish trade there. 
The Bay State's colorful Edward Atkinson - variously a prominent abolitionist, cotton mill industry leader and weapons supplier to John Brown - persuaded Lincoln to liberalize between-the-lines trading. Later in the war Atkinson urged that New Englanders be given Texas lands to raise cotton, utilizing former slaves for labor. To questions about whether ex-slaves would accept the scheme, he answered that if they declined, they should be allowed to starve, "and so remove the Negro question - but still we must have cotton." 
Aside from the pragmatism and self-interest that drove the trade, there was also a humanitarian impulse. Put simply, cotton sales in the occupied regions were the principal means by which destitute whites - including those loyal to the Union - and former slaves avoided starvation. Owing to the poverty left behind as Confederates withdrew from western Tennessee, Gen. Henry Halleck resolved that the cotton trade was a matter of "extreme necessity." 
Slaves, and former slaves, were similarly affected. After reporting that Federal troops had confiscated 700 acres of his corn, 150 of his cattle and 400 of his hogs, a Southern planter sought permission to sell cotton to buy a sizable quantity of provisions to feed the hundred slaves wishing to remain on his plantation. Otherwise, he said, he would turn them over to Federal authorities because he did not want them to starve.
Whatever the motive, the North-South cotton trade propped up the Confederacy just when it was reeling back on its heels. After the fall of Vicksburg, the Confederate general Edmund Kirby-Smith, who oversaw rebel territory west of the Mississippi, organized a Cotton Bureau and empowered it to impress half the production of each grower. The bureau would then sell cotton to almost any agent, including Northerners, who could make his way to the general's headquarters in Shreveport, La. The money Kirby-Smith made off the trade supported him in his successful effort to turn back two Northern campaigns. 
With or without cotton, the South was doomed. But the quiet, robust trade in cotton let it live longer and fight harder than it might have otherwise.

HEADLINE: Corruption Probes in China Said to Rise 13 Percent

BYLINE: MARK MCDONALD


HIGHLIGHT: China has become increasingly vigilant about ferreting out official corruption and bribe-taking, according to a new report in the state-run media. Investigations are up, and even the spouses of officials are being lectured about how to avoid corruption. 

 BODY:
HONG KONG - China has become increasingly vigilant about ferreting out official corruption, bribe-taking and dereliction of duty, according to a report published Monday in the state-run media.
The authorities conducted 12.7 percent more investigations in the first half of 2012 compared to the same period last year, the China Daily newspaper said in its lead story. 
More than three-fourths of the cases were for corruption and bribery, notably in the engineering, construction, rail and transportation sectors, and also in finance and real estate, the paper said. Its article cited remarks by Song Hansong, a director of the corruption prevention department of the Supreme People's Procuratorate.
In a preview of the important 18th Party Congress that is set to begin Nov. 8, the official Chinese news agency Xinhua said in a commentary that "unswerving efforts should be made to combat corruption and ensure clean governance." 
Mr. Song cited the case of Zhou Jinhuo, a former administrator in Fujian Province who has become a kind of poster boy for official malfeasance in China. For the past half-dozen years he has often been mentioned in anti-corruption stories, editorials and Communist Party campaigns.
Chinese authorities said Mr. Zhou took $16 million in bribes in exchange for the awarding of industrial and commercial contracts under his control. He wired the money abroad and then fled to the United States - following his wife, who had already obtained U.S. residency and a green card. 
"He is still a fugitive there," China Daily said.
A 2010 story in Global Times, a newspaper affiliated with the party, described Mr. Zhou's case and the graft-and-go phenomenon: 
Chinese netizens coined the term luo guan (meaning naked officials), which refers to officials such as Zhou, who escape trouble by moving their spouse and children, along with their assets, to a foreign country.
They plan ahead by depositing money in accounts under the name of their spouse or children. Even if they are apprehended, the cash transferred to overseas banks often remain the property of family members.
An increasing number of officials engaging in this scam has frustrated investigators and have challenged the level of tolerance for such behavior among the public.
Rendezvous also reported this summer about luo guan:
Wealthy mainlanders, including government and party officials, are feverishly offshoring their cash by buying properties abroad, from Hong Kong and Macau to Australia, Europe and the United States. Hedging against possible political or economic upheavals, they are keeping so few (seizable) assets in China that they're being called luo guan - "naked officials."
The Chinese business magazine Caixin reported earlier this year that China's central bank believes as many as 18,000 officials and employees of state-owned firms have left China since the mid-1990s, fleeing with an estimated $127 billion. 
After staging its once-a-decade leadership transition next month, the party will undertake a five-year plan for eliminating corruption, Xinhua has reported, citing He Guoqiang, a member of the Standing Committee of the Politburo. 
Mr. He, who oversees corruption enforcement within the party, called the effort a "dynamic and long-term strategic project." The Xinhua report noted that "China has always paid great attention to fighting corruption and creating a clean government," using "its own unique methods to combat corruption."
Two disciplinary and watchdog agencies of the party said recently that nearly three-quarters of a million officials nationwide now receive anti-corruption education every year.
 "Education is given through lectures, case studies and visits to historic areas, as well as attendance at court trials and talks with people who have been imprisoned for corruption," China Daily reported in its story about the party circular. 
A county in Guangdong Province in southern China recently lectured the partners of more than 400 local officials in "how to prevent corruption," China Daily reported. The attendees were taught "how to resist bribes and help their incumbent husbands and wives stay clean."
"Those attending the class," the paper said, "thought the initiative was informative and provoked deep thoughts."

BYLINE: THOMAS B. EDSALL


HIGHLIGHT: The political parties are losing control of the political dialogue, which might not be as good as it sounds. 

 BODY:
If there is one rule of thumb governing campaign finance regulation, or the lack thereof, it is that the consequences of any changes in the system are unpredictable.
In 2002, when Congress enacted the McCain-Feingold law barring large "soft money" contributions from corporations, unions and rich people to the political parties, many observers assumed that the Democrats would suffer more. The party had never fully cultivated a small donor base and had consistently been more dependent on mega-contributions than the Republican Party.
In less than two years, this assumption was proven wrong. First, in the 2004 election, small donors in droves gave their credit card numbers to the Democratic campaign of John Kerry, and Kerry was able to keep pace with George W. Bush, dollar for dollar. Four years later, the cash flow to Barack Obama swamped John McCain. The Internet, and with it the ability of campaigns to inexpensively reach millions of prospective donors, permanently transformed fundraising.
In 2010, campaign finance law was turned on its head. The Supreme Court decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, and appeals court decisions such as Speech Now v. F.E.C., opened the door to unlimited contributions to technically independent political action committees (super PACs) from corporations, unions and individuals.
The result has been a stupefying array of PACs, 501(c)4s and 501(c)6s that even professionals can barely keep track of. The future that Buckley v. Valeo set in motion almost 40 years ago has arrived, and the current multiplicity and multidirectionality of "reform" has overwhelmed both the people and the parties.
The virtually unanimous view throughout the course of four decades of revised regulation was that the Republican Party and its candidates would be the major beneficiaries, and, so far, that has been true.
The first chart, provided by the Center for Responsive Politics, shows that outside spending tilted left in every year from 2000 to 2008, but that in 2010 - in the aftermath of deregulation - the balance skewed decisively to the right. In the current 2011-12 election cycle, it shifted overwhelmingly to the right:
The movement rightwards of almost half a billion dollars in this cycle alone - signified by the red bar on the graph representing Republican donations - is not, however, the pure gold that analysts on both sides expected.
While, the rapid growth of well-financed and autonomous competitors threatens all existing power structures, the bulk of the costs are likely to fall on the Republican Party. The right wing of the Republican Party has more disruptive potential than the left wing of the Democratic Party because it is more willing to go to extremes: see the billboards showing Obama bowing down before an Arab Sheik, or the ads and DVD claiming that Obama is the bastard son of the African American communist, Frank Marshall Davis.
There are, furthermore, structural and historical differences between the parties: the Republican Party and the conservative establishment is institutionally stronger than the Democratic Party, with an infrastructure that served as a bulwark through the 1960s and 70s - the American Enterprise Institute, the Heritage Foundation, the Cato Institute, the Olin Foundation, etc. - when Republicans appeared to be a permanent congressional minority. Its financial prowess enabled the party to enforce more discipline on its consultants and elected officials. The Republican establishment also exercises more authority over policy and candidate selection than does its Democratic counterpart.
In recent years, the Democratic Party organization has gained some strength and it plays a much more active role in campaigns at all levels than in the past, but as an institutional force capable of command and control, it remains light years behind the Republican Party.
Republicans, in contrast to Democrats, prefer hierarchical, well-ordered organizations, and are much more willing to cede authority to those in power. Democrats, despite the discipline of individual campaign efforts, tend more toward anarchy than hierarchy. Historically, one result of this partisan difference is that the Republican establishment has tightly managed candidate selection at the presidential level. With extraordinary consistency, the party has crushed insurgent candidates and selected the next in line. Ronald Reagan and Bob Dole, for example, both had to wait until it was their turn.
The Republican establishment has a full arsenal of weapons at its disposal, including endorsements, favored speaking engagements at key party gatherings, leverage over top consultants and a signaling process to show who has been anointed from on high.
The most powerful weapon of all was always the oversight exercised by party leaders over the flow of money to candidates. Every four years when the nomination process began, business leaders, Republican-leaning trade associations, top corporate law firms and investment bankers slowly formed a consensus behind a favored candidate.
The establishment snuffed out insurgencies, including candidates from the social right - Pat Buchanan, Pat Robertson and Gary Bauer - and candidates from the economic right like Jack Kemp and Steve Forbes. None of these outsiders rose past marginal status, although their presence in primary contests often forced the mainstream candidate to make concessions that proved damaging in the general election.
Compare that history of unbroken authoritarian dominance to the 2012 Republican nomination fight.
Unleashed by Citizens United, a handful of renegade billionaires made life miserable for Mitt Romney, the establishment candidate. More importantly, it only took four men - Sheldon Adelson, the Las Vegas and Macao casino mogul; Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based leveraged buyout specialist; Foster Friess, a conservative Christian and a successful investor; and William Dore, a Louisiana energy company C.E.O. - to stun traditional party power brokers during the first four months of 2012.
The millions of dollars these men put into the super PACs associated with two clearly marginal candidates, Newt Gingrich and the former Pennsylvania Senator Rick Santorum, turned the primary process into an open contest, giving full voice to the more extreme wings dominated by the Tea Party and the evangelical right.
The newly empowered billionaires are positioned to challenge the Republican Party at its point of greatest vulnerability, during the primaries. The three major party organizations - the Republican National, Congressional and Senatorial Committees - cannot, except in unusual circumstances, intervene in primaries. Those are to be decided by voters, not the party.
The new class of financial bosses, equipped to legitimate primary candidates at all levels, has no such restriction over participation in primaries. Instead, the incentives are substantial to engage full force in the nomination process where the marginal value of each dollar is higher and more likely to influence the outcome than in the general election.
These new players, along with their super PACs, undermine the influence of the parties in another crucial way. Before Citizens United, the three major Republican Party committees exerted power because their financial preeminence gave them the final word on the award of contracts to pollsters, direct mail, voter contact, and media consultants - very few of whom were willing to alienate a key source of cash.
The ascendance of super PACs creates a separate and totally independent source of contracts for the community of political professionals. Super PACs and other independent groups already raise more than any of the political party committees and almost as much as either the Republican or Democratic Party committees raise in toto.
This chart shows the rapidity of the growth of independent spending: 
And this chart shows the amounts raised so far this year by the party committees:
Nathan Persily, a professor at Columbia Law School and a political scientist, made the point to me with a question: "Who is the Republican Party in the Citizens United age? If you had to point to the 'Republican Party' would you be more likely to point to Reince Preibus (and implicitly the R.N.C.) or Karl Rove (and Crossroads G.P.S.)? I think candidates might consider Rove more important."
Preibus is the chairman of the R.N.C.; Karl Rove founded American Crossroads, a super PAC, and Crossroad GPS, a tax exempt independent expenditure organization that is not required to disclose donors. So far in the 2011-12 election cycle, American Crossroads and Crossroads GPS have spent $174.28 million, a sum two million dollars greater than the $172.2 million spent by the Republican Congressional and Senatorial Committees combined.
By now you may have the question in the back of your mind: who cares about the political parties? Aren't they just agents of the status quo at a time when innovative thinking is needed? Maybe diminishing their role will help lessen polarization and open up the system?
There may be some truth to this and perhaps the benefits will outweigh the costs. Conversely, the diminishment of the parties means that the institutions with the single-minded goal of winning a majority will be weakened. When parties are influential, they can help keep some candidates and office holders from going off the ideological deep end. The emergence of independently financed super PACs give voice to those with the most extreme views. An ad like this is likely to alienate as many citizens as it motivates:
Predictions are notoriously dangerous, given the multitude of possible outcomes. If the parties are eviscerated, the political system could adjust itself and regain vitality. But I doubt it. For all their flaws, strong political parties are important to a healthy political system. The displacement of the parties by super rich men determined to flex their financial muscles is another giant step away from democracy.
 Thomas B. Edsall, a professor of journalism at Columbia University, is the author of the book "The Age of Austerity: How Scarcity Will Remake American Politics," which was published earlier this year.

HEADLINE: Tracking the Storm

BYLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES


HIGHLIGHT: Get the latest as the city and region endure a once-in-a-generation storm. 

 BODY:
Millions of people across the mid-Atlantic region struggled to recover from widespread storm damage on Tuesday amid power failures, high winds, downed trees and powerful flooding. Transit shutdowns and school closings continued, the death toll from the storm rose, and people in New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and elsewhere began assessing the aftermath.
More than six million American homes were without power, and more than 1.9 million of them were in New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said. The New York City subway system, hit by unprecedented damage from the storm, will remain closed for "a good four or five days," and schools will be closed again on Wednesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.
Officials reported deaths related to the storm from North Carolina to Connecticut. The New York Police Department confirmed that there had been nine storm-related deaths in the city and said that number was expected to rise. Scores of homes in the Breezy Point section of the Rockaways were destroyed by a wind-whipped fire.
President Obama declared a federal disaster area in New York City, Long Island and eight counties in New Jersey. Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey praised Mr. Obama, repeatedly and effusively, for leading the federal government's response to the storm. He said the storm's cost in his state was "incalculable."
 01:55 PM | Total Death Toll at 38 
As searches revealed grim scenes up and down the Eastern Seaboard, the overall death toll from the storm had climbed to 38, officials said. 
Here are the state-by-state totals, reported by The Associated Press on Tuesday afternoon, with two deaths not listed:
New York: 17
Pennsylvania: 5 
New Jersey: 4
Connecticut: 3
Maryland: 2
Virginia: 2 
West Virginia: 1
North Carolina: 1
Off the coast of North Carolina: 1

 01:27 PM | Congressman's Home Burned Down in Storm 
Representative Bob Turner's home in Breezy Point, Queens, was one of dozens that burned down in the storm, a spokeswoman confirmed Tuesday. 
Mr. Turner, a Republican, was home when the fire broke out early Tuesday morning, but both he and his wife are safe, said Jessica Proud, who was a spokeswoman for his campaign. "They made it out safely. They were there well into the storm," she said. 
Michael R. Long, chairman of the state Conservative Party, had a home nearby that also burned down, Ms. Proud said. It was not his primary residence and he, too, was safe, she said. 
The fire in Breezy Point, fueled by the storm's unrelenting winds, reduced more than 80 homes to smoldering ash. Flooded streets in the area prevented firefighters from reaching the blaze, compounding the devastation. 
"If you and I were trying to walk in waist-deep water, it's difficult - now picture doing that to fight a fire. It's incredibly difficult," said Frank Dwyer, a spokesman for the city's Fire Department. "Very high winds were creating blow-torch effects on the blocks, spreading the fire around."

 01:25 PM | Blizzard Conditions in Appalachians 
The freak winter storm that crashed into the tropical storm from the Atlantic brought as much of two feet of snow to Appalachian states, spreading blizzard or near-blizzard conditions over parts of Tennessee, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia and North Carolina, officials said.
The storm dumped what may well be a record amount of heavy, wet snow in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park. 
"Our average snowfall for the month of October is two inches, and now here we are at over 22 inches and we still have another day to go," Dana Soehn, a park spokeswoman, said on Wednesday morning. 
More than a foot had fallen at Newfound Gap, Tenn., a small community at about 5,000 feet near the Tennessee-North Carolina border, according to the National Weather Service. 
A few inches of snow had fallen in higher elevations in other parts of eastern Tennessee, as well, and in parts of the North Carolina mountains near Asheville, N.C. 
Wet snow and high winds spinning off the edge of the storm also spread blizzard conditions over parts of West Virginia and Maryland, The Associated Press reported. 
The National Weather Service said a foot and more of snow was reported in lower elevations of West Virginia, while higher elevations were getting more than two feet, according to The A.P.
Authorities closed more than 45 miles of Interstate 68 on either side of the West Virginia-Maryland state line because of blizzard conditions and stuck cars.
Meanwhile, gusty winds from the storm continued to be felt in eastern Alabama and parts of Georgia, some of them topping 35 miles per hour.

 12:53 PM | Bus Service by 5 P.M., Cuomo Says; J.F.K. Open Tomorrow 
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York said that officials expected limited, and free, New York City bus service to be restored by 5 p.m. today. 
"Basically, a Sunday schedule," he said. "Hopefully tomorrow, there will be full service on the buses." No fares will be charged on the buses today or tomorrow.
The governor said that he also expected Kennedy International Airport to reopen tomorrow, though not La Guardia Airport, "due to extensive damage."
Mr. Cuomo also said that the state's death toll from the storm had climbed to 15. 
Other highlights from the governor's 11:30 a.m. briefing. 
*Lower Manhattan flooding: The Federal Emergency Management Agency has sent its National Unwatering Team to drain out downtown, and is offering other assistance.
*Power: About two million families are without power, nearly half of them on Long Island.
*Bridges: All bridges reopened at noon today. The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and the Holland Tunnel will remain closed. 
*Global warming: "Anyone who thinks that there is not a dramatic change in weather patterns is denying reality," Mr. Cuomo said. "We have a new reality, and old infrastructures and old systems."
*Reflections: "What I saw last night in downtown Manhattan, on the South Shore of Long Island were some of the worst conditions I have seen," the governor said. "The Hudson was literally pouring into the ground zero site, with such a force that we were worried about the structure of the pit itself. The Hudson River was pouring into the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel like a river at high velocity. The response of the first responders was as courageous as anything I've seen. They were running right into the face of danger. If it wasn't for their heroism, things would have been much worse."

 12:43 P.M. | Falling Tree Kills 2 Westchester Boys 
North Salem is horse country, known for some multimillion-dollar estates owned by film stars and other celebrities, but it is also mainly a working-class town with many winterized bungalows, and it was on one of those wood-frame cottages that a tree downed by high winds crashed through the roof Monday night and killed two boys.
"I lost my son," Valerie Baumler told Danny Seymour, the boy's uncle, as she clasped him and cried. "I lost my son."
Jack Baulmer, 11, a sixth-grader known as one of the best Little League baseball players in North Salem, and his best friend and neighbor down Bonnieview Street, Michael Robson, 13, were killed by the tree that tore through the roof of the one-room cottage. It is one of a number of modest homes on Peach Lake, some of which were once summer cottages. Two other boys who were also in the house while the storm raged outside were slightly injured. Ms. Baulmer was physically unscathed.
"We lost two beautiful young boys last night," said Mr. Seymour, choking back tears, in an interview outside the Baulmer house. "Our hearts are broken. The pain is raw. We believe faith will carry us through. North Salem has a huge heart, and they will wrap their arms around thee two families. These two boys exemplify everything that's best about America. We're so proud to have them in our lives."
Mr. Seymour was helping neighbors clear out furnishings from the house. It was so badly damaged that a police officer guarding the street said it might have to be demolished.
- Joseph Berger 
 12:30 P.M. | Flooding Blamed for New Jersey Power Failures 
PSE&G said it had 1.3 million electricity customers in the dark, including many customers in Newark without power, because a surge in Newark Bay had flooded substations and other equipment.
The company, the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, had laid sandbags, based on previous experience with flooding from rain and runoff, but was not prepared for the surge, said Ralph A. LaRossa, president and chief operating officer of Public Service.
The sandbagging "really didn't match up with where this storm surge hit us in Newark Bay," he said in a telephone conference call with reporters on Tuesday morning. "This wall of water that hit us was not something we could have prepared for, although I certainly wish we could have." The surge knocked out power to Essex County and Hudson City, among other areas. Some gas-fired generating stations in Newark and the Raritan Bay area were also knocked out, Mr. LaRossa said.
- Matthew L. Wald 
 12:20 PM | Christie Praises Obama for Storm Response 
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey took an unscheduled break from partisan attacks on the President Obama on Tuesday to praise him, repeatedly and effusively, for leading the federal government's response to the storm.
"Wonderful," "excellent" and "outstanding" were among the adjectives Mr. Christie chose, a change-up from his remarks last week that Mr. Obama was "blindly walking around the White House looking for a clue." 
Some of Mr. Christie's Republican brethren have already begun grumbling about his gusher of praise at such a crucial time in the election.
But the governor seemed unconcerned. When Fox News asked him about the possibility that Mitt Romney might take a disaster tour of New Jersey, Mr. Christie replied:
I have no idea, nor am I the least bit concerned or interested. I have a job to do in New Jersey that is much bigger than presidential politics. If you think right now I give a damn about presidential politics, then you don't know me.

 12:12 P.M. | New York Stock Exchange to Open Wednesday 
The New York Stock Exchange intends to open as usual on Wednesday at 9:30 a.m. Eastern time, but it is testing its contingency plan as well, "just in case," Larry Leibowitz, the company's chief operating officer, said Tuesday, according to Reuters.
"As of now, we are shooting hard to open tomorrow and fully expect to do so," he said in an interview.

 12:05 P.M. | Nursing and Adult Homes Struggling 
Several nursing and adult homes in the Rockaways, which were heavily hit by the storm, struggled with flooding and knocked-out generators Tuesday.
Administrators at Horizon Care Center and Seaview Manor said they had repeatedly sought instructions and advice from the city's emergency management authorities but did not receive directions to evacuate before the surge hit between 8 p.m. and midnight on Monday.
At Horizon, all 269 patients had been moved to the second floor when the surge came. But there was very rapid flooding within 5 minutes and the generator was knocked out within 10 minutes, said Nicole Markowitz, an administrator. By Tuesday morning, residents were cold and scared. One patient was on oxygen, and only about five hours of oxygen remained.
Ms. Markowitz said they had stayed put because the city did not give them orders to evacuate. "We weren't mandated to leave," Ms. Markowitz said. "It's much harder to leave than to stay." 
At Seaview Manor, an adult home on Beach 47th Street, a case manager who would give her name only as Younger said Tuesday morning that the generator was out and several staff members had fled the institution that morning.
A reporter visiting the nursing home found flooding, sand on the floors and tables overturned in what appeared to be the kitchen area. But patients seemed unhurt.
She said the staff had called the city's emergency operations center a few times during the night. "They said they're going to get back to me," she said. "They never did."
The home could not cook and was feeding patients sandwiches. "How many times can I give a cheese sandwich?" the case manager said. Staff members' cellphones were out of power, and they were trying to use their car batteries to charge them. Late in the morning, the adult home began directing a few patients -- some in pajamas, many clutching pillows and blankets -- into a van for evacuation.

 11:50 A.M. | Breezy Point Fire Destroys Scores of Homes 
Dozens of homes in the Breezy Point section of the Rockaways - many of them elaborate year-round homes, some of them seasonal bungalows - were turned into acres of smoldering ash by a wind-whipped fire that burned for perhaps nine hours throughout Monday night and early Tuesday morning.
The fire left a huge swath of this private community in Queens on the western tip of the Rockaway Peninsula scorched. Small flames and smoke still emanated from acres of land on the neighborhood's southwest section.
City officials said as many as 50 homes had been destroyed, but the number appeared to be higher.
With the New York Fire Department tending other fires on the peninsula, and also blocked from getting its trucks into Breezy Point by the high floodwaters, a small team of local residents and volunteer fire departments tried to fight the fire, even while stopping to rescue other residents seeking to flee the rising waters.
The area where the homes burned had been reduced to an expanse of charred timbers, melted beach toys and cheery mailboxes with snappy summer slogans.

 11:57 A.M. | Obama's Response to the Storm 
President Obama worked through much of Monday night to oversee the federal response to the storm, telephoning state and local leaders in New York and New Jersey and signing federal disaster declarations for both states, according to the White House.
After abruptly leaving the campaign trail to fly home to Washington, Mr. Obama spent the day in briefings in the White House Situation Room, and spoke with Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg of New York, and Mayor Cory Booker of Newark. Thefull report is on the Caucus blog.

 11:53 A.M. | All Power Out in Jersey City and Newark, Christie Says 
At his briefing Tuesday morning, Gov. Chris Christie sounded tired but determined, wearing his navy-colored "Chris Christie" pullover. He is planning to go on an aerial tour of the damage this afternoon.
Overview:
 Tidal flooding is widespread.
 All power in Jersey City is out; all power in Newark is out from the tidal surge.
 National Guard is helping in Jersey City with evacuations.
 450 high-water vehicles and helicopters from the National Guard have been deployed statewide.
 5,500 residents statewide are in shelters.
 An additional 2,000-person shelter is being opened at Rutgers.
 Salvation Army and FEMA are distributing food statewide.
 2.4 million New Jersey households are without power: "This is twice the number as Hurricane Irene," Mr. Christie said. 1.2 million of those are PSE&G (in the Newark and Jersey City areas.) "Hurricane Irene took eight days to restore, this may take longer," the governor said.
 Avoid travel unless absolutely necessary. Private employers: "Unless you can identify a safe route for employees to get to work, I'd ask you to let them stay home today."
 Garden State Parkway is open. The turnpike is open from Exits 1 to 10.
 24 small rail cars were moved by the tidal surge onto the elevated roadway on the New Jersey turnpike, northbound side, around Exit 12. Cranes are working to remove these railcars.
 New Jersey Transit is assessing the system. There is major damage on "each and every one of New Jersey's rail lines." Large sections are washed out on the coast, large trees are on rails across the state, and several rail bridges are damaged.
 Drinking water: There are 10 facilities with minor or major problems, but there is not yet a risk to public health.
 Health care facilities. 29 hospitals lost power, plus additional facilities. Many have generator power.

 11:40 A.M. | Schools to Stay Closed, Bloomberg Says; Subways Out '4 or 5 Days' 
The New York City subway system, hit by unprecedented damage from the storm, will remain closed for "a good four or five days," and schools will be closed again on Wednesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said Tuesday morning.
The mayor said, however, that he hoped some bus service would be restored by Tuesday afternoon, and that he hoped to announce full restoration of bus service by Wednesday.
Other highlights from the mayor's 11 a.m. briefing:
Death toll: Now stands at 10
Breezy Point fires: The blazes that destroyed more than 80 homes overnight in the Rockaways are finally under control. "It looked like a forest fire out in the Midwest," the mayor said.
Other fires: At least 23 major fires elsewhere in the city.
Tap water: Safe to drink, but heavily chlorinated so it will taste different.
Group cabs: An executive order was signed, allowing yellow cabs to pick up multiple passengers at multiple points, and allowing livery cars to pick up street hails.
Power: At least 750,000 New York City residents are without power, including residents of 59 public-housing buildings.
Shelters: More than 6,100 people are now at 76 shelters.
Airports: Closed.
Causes of storm fatalities: "A whole variety of causes," the mayor said. "Someone was in their house in their bed and a tree fell on him and killed him. Someone stepped in a puddle where there was an electric wire. We had a couple of bodies in someone's house, I'm not sure what the story is there."
Dangling crane: It is stable but can't be fully secured till the winds die down. "The procedure will be to get the boom and strap it to the building, then we can reopen the streets," Mr. Bloomberg said.

 11:04 A.M. | Cuomo Raises Possibility of Building Levee in Harbor 
Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo of New York on Tuesday raised the possibility of building a levee in New York in the aftermath of major flooding in Lower Manhattan and other parts of the city. 
"It is something we're going to have to start thinking about," Mr. Cuomo said. "The construction of this city did not anticipate these kinds of situations. We are only a few feet above sea level. The flooding in downtown Manhattan was really extraordinary and unlike anything I had seen."
- The New York Times 
 10:53 A.M. | Homes Destroyed in Breezy Point, Queens 
In Breezy Point, in the Rockaways in Queens, at least 50 tightly packed homes in the beach community were destroyed overnight. 
 10:51 A.M. | Death Toll in New York City Rises 
The New York Police Department confirmed on Tuesday that there had been nine storm-related deaths in New York City and said that number was expected to rise. No further details were available.
- The New York Times 
 10:49 AM | Some Bridges Set to Reopen 
The city expected the Manhattan, Brooklyn, Williamsburg and Ed Koch Queensboro Bridges to reopen shortly on Tuesday morning, an official said.
Earlier on Tuesday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo said the Tappan Zee Bridge had been reopened. 
The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and Queens-Midtown Tunnel remain closed, according to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the tunnels. The Lincoln Tunnel has been open throughout the storm.
On Monday, the governor closed many of the area's major bridges, including the George Washington, Verrazano-Narrows, Whitestone and Throgs Neck Bridges.

 10:11 A.M. | Power Could Be Out in Manhattan for Days, Con Ed Says 
Watch on Youtube.
Much of Manhattan below Midtown could be without electricity for several days after an explosion at a substation on the East River on Monday night, a spokesman for Consolidated Edison said Tuesday morning.
More than 240,000 customers - and many more people - were without power more than 12 hours after the explosion that looked spectacular but did not injure any of about a dozen utility workers who were at the site at the east end of 14th Street. Each customer could represent a household or even an entire apartment building. 
The blast knocked out electricity for all of Manhattan below 39th Street on the east side and 31st Street on the west side - with the exception of a few pockets, including Battery Park City.
In the two hours before the explosion, Con Edison officials purposefully turned off all power to two small sections of the financial district in Lower Manhattan and in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn. Power to those areas could be restored in three or four days after utility crews pump out floodwater and dry and repair equipment below ground, said Bob McGee, a spokesman for Con Edison. But he said it may take longer to restore power to customers whose service was interrupted by the explosion.
John Miksad, the company's senior vice president for electric operations, said, "This is the largest storm-related outage in our history."
Con Edison officials believed the explosion was caused by water flooding the substation but had not ruled out flying debris, the spokesman said.

 09:28 AM | Transit Restoration Likely to Be Piecemeal 
Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, suggested that New Yorkers should expect their mass transit to return "in pieces and parts" in the days to come.
"We're going to try to be creative," Mr. Lhota said in an interview with WNYC. "Those portions of the system that can be up and running, I want them up and running as quickly as possible."
He added, "If there's a portion of the system that's going to take longer to repair, that doesn't mean the whole system is down."
He suggested, for instance, that buses could be rerouted to complement the mass transit services that are available.
Mr. Lhota declined to give a timetable for restoring service, saying that to do so would be "a scientific wild guess on my part." He said the authority could provide a more substantial update later in the day Tuesday, as the sunlight allowed crews to assess the system more thoroughly.
But it was already clear that significant damage had been done. "Our electrical systems, our alarm systems, tell us when there's water down there," Mr. Lhota told WNYC. "They basically shut off. It's an automatic system that saves the electricity and doesn't cause problems. And they all shut off in relatively quick fashion. They would only shut off if there was water down there."
While seven subway tunnels were flooded beneath the East River, Mr. Lhota has emphasized that the damage was not confined to the Lower Manhattan area. On the Metro-North Railroad's Hudson line, power was lost from 59th Street to Croton-Harmon. On the New Haven line, it was lost through New Haven. The Long Island Rail Road evacuated its West Side Yards, and one East River tunnel flooded.
The Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel flooded end to end, and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel took on water as well.
Mr. Lhota told WNYC he had just sent a text message to Patrick J. Foye, the executive director of the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, in hopes of determining how and when the agencies could open bridges and tunnels.
"The tunnels, if they're dry, the assessment can be relatively straightforward," Mr. Lhota said. "The bridges, given the extent of the wind, we're going to need a couple hours having the engineers assess that there's no damage to any of the bridges."

 09:20 AM | Search and Rescue in Atlantic City 
Search-and-rescue missions were combing Atlantic City on Tuesday morning as floodwaters receded.
Much of the city, particularly inland from the shore, appeared to have survived without great damage, at least from an initial survey of the main commercial district. 
Around the city, planters, newspaper boxes and garbage cans had been tossed around. Many neighborhoods did not have power, and it remained quite windy. But the waist-high floodwaters that surged through the streets on Monday had largely receded. Most buildings remained intact, and most roads were passable.
The high-rise casinos that line the Boardwalk appeared largely unscathed. Near the Trump Taj Mahal, an overhead traffic light had crashed down into the road, but the slot machines inside the casino remained illuminated, ready for gamblers. By Bally's, some fencing on the beach had toppled, but the Boardwalk was intact.
Some of the most visible damage was in the city's northern section, where an older stretch of the Boardwalk had washed away on Monday as Hurricane Sandy approached. By Tuesday, the storm had left little more than a tangle of timber planks and bits of concrete. Some bits of the Boardwalk had washed as far as a quarter of a mile inland.
The city still felt like a ghost town, with storefronts covered in plywood and many traffic lights not working, but there were a few signs of life. One restaurant, the Tun Tavern, remained open Monday night, running out of pumpkin ale but otherwise nourishing dozens of people who were hunkered down at a hotel.
And although a 20-foot red awning for a pizza shop lay across the street nearby, the 24/7 Food Market on Atlantic Avenue had ample hot coffee on Tuesday morning.
One of its owners, Faheem Tariq, said the store had about 20 customers over the course of the storm. "We've been open the whole time," he said.

 09:10 AM | Storm's Death Toll Is at Least 14 
At least 14 deaths have been confirmed or are being investigated as related to the storm over the past 48 hours, the authorities said.
In Connecticut, a 90-year-old woman and a firefighter were killed in separate incidents, the first confirmed casualties in the state since Hurricane Sandy struck the Northeast region, the state police said.
In Maryland, the deaths of three adults were confirmed to be related to the storm, in traffic- or vehicle-related accidents or after a tree fell on a house, a medical official there said.
And in West Virginia, a 40-year-old woman was killed when her vehicle was in an accident in snowy weather conditions, an emergency official confirmed.
 In North Carolina, a man was killed when his vehicle hit a tree that was crashing down in Surry County, said an official with the state emergency offices. 
Officials in Pennsylvania said two deaths - a boy in Susquehanna County and a 62-year-old man in Berks County - were being investigated but that the county coroner had not yet confirmed them as related to the storm.
In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo's office said late Monday night that at least five deaths in the state were caused by the storm. 
A New York City emergency management official said more deaths were being investigated as related to the storm, but no determination had been officially made by the medical examiner. 
In New York City, where three people had been reported dead, rescuers have found a fourth person dead, inside a home in Midland Beach on Staten Island on Tuesday, The Staten Island Advance reported. 
 In Virginia, there were no confirmed storm-related deaths.

 09:28 AM | Atlantic City Mayor Strikes Back at Christie 
Atlantic City's mayor, Lorenzo Langford, struck back at Gov. Chris Christie on Tuesday after the governor accused him of encouraging the city's residents to defy his evacuation order and called him a "rogue mayor."
"The governor is either misinformed or ill advised or just deciding to prevaricate," Mr. Langford said Tuesday on the "Today" show on NBC. "Isn't it sad that here we are in the throes of a major catastrophe and the governor tries to play politics?"
Mr. Christie said Monday that he had heard that Mr. Langford had told the city's residents they could ride out the storm at home or in a school a block from the ocean. 
Mr. Langford said: "That is absolutely false and the governor needs to be challenged. He is dead wrong."
The mayor said what happened was the city had a contingency plan in place for those who did not heed the warning to evacuate.
"It's better to have options and not need them than to need options and not have them," Mr. Langford said. "Fortunately, most of our residents did heed our warnings to flee the city."
Mr. Langford did not seem inclined to let the matter rest there. "I would love nothing better than that than to confront the governor mano-a-mano," he said.

 7:56 A.M. | Assessing Damage in Montauk 
Officials were out before dawn in Montauk on Tuesday, roving in pickup trucks and S.U.V.'s, trying to get a grasp on the damage the coming light of day would reveal. On the edge of the Atlantic Ocean, just south of Main Street, South Emerson Avenue was strewed with flotsam, clumps of seaweed and deep with sand swept along when the sea had breached several sand levees along the avenue at the height of the storm.
That was just one snapshot of the damage caused by the potent storm, which knocked out power to more than 900,000 customers on Long Island, according to officials. Many roads were impassible as a result of downed tree limbs and the threat from fallen electrical wires.
On the north side of Montauk Village, along the Long Island Sound, roads were flooded and sand dunes wiped out, commercial fishing ships in Montauk Harbor were battered and the popular waterside restaurants filled with water.
"It's by far been the worst on the North Side that I've ever seen in my life," Bill Wilkinson, the East Hampton town supervisor, said Tuesday just before sunrise in Montauk. More than 175 people spent the night in a shelter in East Hampton, which will be open for a second night on Tuesday.
On Monday night, seawater began to pour over the Napeague Stretch, cutting off Montauk from the mainland. Teams worked to excavate the dunes, and redeposit the sand as a levee against the ocean, said, Stephen Lynch, the East Hampton town highway superintendent. "I haven't seen that since I was in sixth grade," he said.
On Cooper Lane in East Hampton on Monday, a giant tree uprooted, slamming down into the house next to it, crushing the roof. "There's a lot of wind damage; trees are snapped and broken down," said Richard Webb, the town's maintenance crew leader.
At the Gurney's Inn, on Old Montauk Highway, the early light of Tuesday morning revealed the decimation of the beach club restaurant, the Beach Barge, which guests at the bar on Monday night had watched slowly disintegrate, battered by waves. The restaurant, which had recently been renovated following damage from Tropical Storm Irene, was shattered, the boardwalk outside gone and the restaurant tipped on its side and partly washed away.
"They love the Barge, the people that stay here," said Nancy Miller, the front desk supervisor. "It's very sad to see that thing go."

 08:24 AM | 5,700 Flights Canceled Tuesday; 3 Major Airports Remain Closed 
More than 5,700 flights have been canceled on Tuesday, bringing the total number of cancellations caused by the storm to 15,500, according to FlightStats.com. That surpasses the disruptions from Hurricane Irene, which caused 14,000 flight cancellations in August 2011. 
The three major New York airports remained closed Tuesday morning. Airlines hope to resume service to and from New York by Wednesday afternoon. Travel experts say it could take several days, or even into next week, for passengers to be rebooked.

 7:13 A.M. | A Bridge Divided as Night and Day 
The power failures that plunged much of Lower Manhattan into darkness appeared to stop halfway across the East River on the Williamsburg Bridge. 
The above photo, submitted by a reader and taken from Williamsburg on Monday evening, showed a stark dividing line between areas where residents shuffled about with candles and flashlights late into the night and early Tuesday morning, and neighborhoods where the bulbs still burned. 
A similar electrical line in the sand could also be found on the Brooklyn Bridge, according to live images broadcast on NY1 news overnight.

 08:32 AM | Storm's Cost 'Incalculable,' Christie Says 
Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey appeared on a half-dozen morning talk shows on Tuesday to outline the difficulties his state still faced in the aftermath of the storm. 
There were 2.4 million without power in the state, a "devastated Jersey Shore," "almost no power in the city of Newark" and many people stranded in areas where waters breached protective barriers. 
He said the cost to the state was, at the moment, "incalculable."
"We are in the midst of urban search and rescue," he said on CNN, describing the situation in the borough of Moonachie in Bergen County as tidal floodwaters overwhelmed a natural berm.
Hundreds had been rescued so far in the area, he said, but the search continued in an area where high waters threatened residents of trailer parks who had clambered to the roofs and awaited rescue. "Those are the folks that were most in danger," Mr. Christie said, adding that those living on higher ground or in two-story homes could get to higher ground.
He also spoke of the situation in Atlantic City, sharply criticizing Mayor Lorenzo Langford for sending "a mixed message" to residents by telling them they could safely stay in the city after Mr. Christie had ordered an evacuation. 
"That was the wrong thing to do," he said, and now "urban search and rescue" was continuing in the city on Tuesday morning.
On a subsequent appearance on the Fox News Channel, Mr. Christie was asked whether he had plans to tour storm-ravaged areas of the state with Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee for president who is supported by Mr. Christie.
 "I have a job to do that much bigger then presidential politics," he said, taking time on each show to mention three calls he had with the president. "If you think right now that I give a damn about presidential politics, then you don't know me."

 08:29 AM | Crossings Remain Closed Tuesday Morning 
There appeared to be no reopenings of major crossings Tuesday morning, as officials said they had not yet been able to inspect roadways and assess the damage wrought by the storm. The Lincoln Tunnel, operated by the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, remained open, as it had been throughout the day on Monday, but the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel had flooded end to end. The Queens-Midtown Tunnel also took on water, the authority said.
For the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel, workers would have to "wait until water goes down enough where they can pump out the rest," said Judie Glave, a spokesman for the authority. She added that flooding was not nearly as substantial at the Queens-Midtown Tunnel.
On Monday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo ordered that many of the area's major bridges close, including the George Washington, Verrazano-Narrows, Whitestone and Throgs Neck Bridges. The city also shut down its East River crossings like the Brooklyn and Manhattan Bridges.

 07:02 AM | In Lower Manhattan, Beneath a Darkened Skyline 
In Battery Park before dawn, a darkness unseen since the New York City blackout of 2003 painted every high-rise building the color of a deep bruise. Even 1 World Trade Center was just a black monolith, without even an aircraft-warning light on the top.
"It's like a ghost town," said Melvin Allen, a maintenance worker who was stranded. "Darkness everywhere."
In most parts of Lower Manhattan, the only lights were the flashing red-and-blue strobes on police cars acting as roadblocks. 
On West Street, the traffic artery for the area, a torrent of floodwater rushed north late Monday, flooding north past 1 World Trade Center, and poured down into the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel. Everyone in the area was marooned for the night on an island within an island, and many residents tried to drive away, only to find each route blocked by water.

 6:57 A.M. | Storm Heads Through Pennsylvania 
Early on Tuesday morning, the former Hurricane Sandy continued to spin westward through southern Pennsylvania, the National Hurricane Center said, packing still-ferocious winds with a maximum sustained speed of 65 m.p.h. and gale-force winds from Virginia to New England.
At 5 a.m., the storm - now known to meteorologists as a post-tropical cyclone - was roughly 90 miles west of Philadelphia and was expected to take a turn north later on Tuesday. It would then pass through New York State on its way to Canada, crossing the border sometime on Wednesday, the hurricane center said. 
The storm, while steadily weakening, could still cause coastal surges that, when combined with the next high tide on Tuesday, could cause some flooding, the center said.

 06:59 AM | Rockaways Still Burning; 3 Dead Elsewhere in City 
A six-alarm fire that has engulfed several entire blocks of houses in the Queens beach community of Breezy Point in the Rockaways was still burning out of control on Tuesday morning, the Fire Department said. Firefighters were hampered by high winds and the lack of available water.
"Once we get there it's hard to begin fighting it," a spokesman, Firefighter Danny Glover, said.
"The wind is pushing it from house to house; that's a big factor," he said. "Another big factor is the difficulty of gaining access to viable water sources." Seawater cannot be used in firefighting equipment, he added.
Fire officials did not know if there were people injured in the Breezy Point fires.
But three deaths were recorded elsewhere in the city on Monday night:
- A tidal surge in Tottenville at the bottom of Staten Island caused the collapse of four homes on Yetman Avenue and killed one person.
- A woman on 105th Avenue and 134th Street in Queens was electrocuted in her home. 
- A man in East Flushing, Queens was killed when a tree fell on his house.

In New York City and Westchester County, where more than 670,000 Consolidated Edison customers, some of them large buildings with hundreds of residents, were dark Tuesday morning, a spokeswoman for the company, D. Joy Faber, said it would take days to restore power.
In Manhattan, Ms. Faber said, where pre-emptive power shutdowns by the utility to to keep floodwater from hitting live equipment account for a large number of the 230,000 customers without power, "we could see some restoration within three or four days," Ms. Faber said. 
"Tidal surge caused considerable damage to equipment," she said, and assessments need to be done.
"In other areas," Ms. Faber added, "particularly for Westchester and Staten Island, we've got larger things that are going to hamper our restoration efforts," including closed roads and the fact the utility has to wait until winds die down to send crews up to fix wires and poles.

 2:34 A.M. | Worst Disaster in Subway's History, M.T.A. Chief Says 
The Metropolitan Transportation Authority said early on Tuesday that the storm was the worst disaster in the history of the New York City subway system.
"The New York City subway system is 108 years old, but it has never faced a disaster as devastating as what we experienced last night," said Joseph J. Lhota, the authority's chairman, in a statement. "All of us at the M.T.A. are committed to restoring the system as quickly as we can to help bring New York back to normal."
He outlined the extent of the damage that city workers and residents would face in the coming days:
As of last night, seven subway tunnels under the East River flooded. Metro-North Railroad lost power from 59th Street to Croton-Harmon on the Hudson Line and to New Haven on the New Haven Line.
The Long Island Rail Road evacuated its West Side Yards and suffered flooding in one East River tunnel.
The Hugh L. Carey Tunnel is flooded from end to end and the Queens-Midtown Tunnel also took on water and was closed. Six bus garages were disabled by high water.
Asked when New Yorkers could expect the transit system to be back up and running, a spokesman for the authority, Aaron Donovan, said in a television interview that there was "no firm timeline."

 11:52 P.M. | Explosion and Flooding Knock Out Power 
At least 660,000 people in New York had lost power as of late Monday night, the result of a higher than normal storm surge, a planned power shut-down and an explosion at a substation in Manhattan, John Miksad, a senior vice-president at Consolidated Edison said in a news briefing.
The explosion occurred on Monday evening at a substation in the vicinity of 14th Street and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, Mr. Miksad said. The precise cause of the blast was unknown, but Mr. Miksad said floodwaters or flying debris could have been involved. It knocked out power to about 250,000 people, he said.
A video of the explosion showed a large fireball light up the New York skyline on the East Side.
Con Edison intentionally cut power to tens of thousands of people in an effort to protect equipment from rising floodwaters. But the flooding was more extensive than expected.
"We were expecting tides at 10 to 12 feet," Mr. Miksad said. "Not only did we exceed those tides, we went up to 14-foot levels, which no one expected."
Flooding left another 250,000 people without power.

 10:53 P.M. | Dangerous Water Levels at Nuclear Plant 
Rising water threatened the cooling system at the Oyster Creek nuclear plant, in Toms River, N.J., on Monday night. The plant declared an alert at 8:45 p.m., which is the second-lowest level of the four-tier emergency scale established by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The water level was more than six feet above normal. At seven feet, the plant would lose the ability to cool its spent fuel pool in the normal fashion, according to Neil Sheehan, a spokesman for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission.
The plant would probably have to switch to using fire hoses to pump in extra water to make up for evaporation, Mr. Sheehan said, because it could no longer pull water out of Barnegat Bay and circulate it through a heat exchanger, to cool the water in the pool.
If ordinary cooling ceased, the pool would take 25 hours to reach the boiling point, he said, giving the operators ample time to take corrective steps. The reactor itself has been shut since Oct. 22 for refueling, so it is relatively cool.
Alerts are declared a handful of times every year among the 104 power reactors around the country.
So far, no reactors in Sandy's path have been forced by the hurricane to shut down, although one in Waterford, Conn., Millstone 3, has lowered its power output to 75 percent. The operator said this was done to assist the New England grid, which would be destabilized if the reactor shut down suddenly from full power, and also to reduce the chance that it would automatically shut down; at 75 percent, Millstone 3 could withstand the loss of a pump without having to close.
Several other reactors in the region are now closed for refueling, which is ordinarily carried out in the spring or fall, when electricity demand is low.

 10:48 P.M. | Flooding in Tunnels and Subways 
The storm surge in Battery Park City on Monday exceeded 13 feet, and was much higher than expected. Floodwaters rushed into the Brooklyn-Battery Tunnel and seeped into the tubes connecting Lower Manhattan and Brooklyn.
CBS News showed footageof water streaming into the tunnel.
A spokesman for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said water had also entered the No. 1 subway line between Chambers Street and South Ferry.
While the authority said it could not predict when service might be restored, officials estimated that pumping water out from flooded under-river tunnels could take anywhere from 14 hours to more than four days. It is possible that the subway system will return at partial capacity as floodwaters are pumped out of the system and imperiled equipment is inspected for potential water damage.
Some PATH train stations also flooded, a spokesman said.

 10:42 P.M. | New York's 911 System Overloaded 
As trees fall, power shuts down and flood waters rise to higher than expected levels, New York's 911 system is being deluged with calls, many unwarranted, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said in a press conference Monday evening.
The volume of calls was creating a potentially dangerous situation as emergency officials were wasting time responding to requests that did not involve life-threatening emergencies, Mr. Bloomberg said.
The system was receiving 10,000 calls per half hour, Mr. Bloomberg said. On a typical day, it receives 1,000, he said. 
There were dire situations unfolding across the city as Sandy pushed through the region. The mayor said the hospital at NYU Langone Medical Center had lost its backup power supply, forcing it to move patients elsewhere.
At least two people have died in New York, the authorities said. A 29-year-old man was killed on Monday when a tree crashed through his home in Queens. Another man in Queens was electrocuted, officials said. He has yet not been identified.
At his news conference, Mr. Bloomberg called on New York drivers to stay off the roads, saying they could interfere with the work of emergency officials.

 9:29 P.M. | 250,000 Without Power in Manhattan 
Just as executives of Con Edison finished methodically cutting off power to three relatively small parts of New York City's power grid on Monday evening, an unforeseen event knocked the lights off for about 250,000 customers across a broad swath of Manhattan.
At about 8:30 p.m., electricity suddenly stopped flowing to apartments and office buildings from East 39th Street all the way down to the southern tip of the island, said Michael Clendenin, a spokesman for Con Edison. The abrupt failure even turned Con Edison's headquarters building near Union Square dark for several minutes before a generator kicked on, he said.
Several blocks away on West 14th Street, traffic signals stopped working. 
Mr. Clendenin said company officials assumed that flooding in substations interrupted the flow of power. He said they expected to be able to restore it before the night was over.

 8:53 P.M. | Q & A: What About the Post Office? 
According to Connie Chirichello, a spokeswoman for the United States Postal Service, mail was "curtailed" in all five boroughs, as well as on Long Island, on Monday. In the five boroughs, mail carriers returned from their routes by noon. About 90 percent of the mail in postal boxes was picked up, but only until 1:30 p.m. Monday. Service at the postal lobbies in Manhattan and the Bronx closed at 9 a.m., and at noon in the other boroughs.
Depending on local conditions tomorrow, postal management will consider, on a case-by-case basis, whether it is safe for carriers to deliver, Ms. Chirichello said.
The famous motto of the U.S. post office that "neither snow nor rain nor heat nor gloom of night stays these couriers from the swift completion of their appointed rounds" apparently did not take a hurricane like Sandy into account.
"Every attempt was made to deliver mail today, however, with suspended subways, M.T.A. railroads and New Jersey transit, many employees were not able to make it to work," said Ms. Chirichello, who added that the safety of the carriers was paramount, as was the fact that mail trucks should not get in the way of emergency vehicles. Also, the weather conditions endangered the safe delivery of the actual mail itself.
Because of the impact of the hurricane, the processing facility at the Morgan Station, on 31st Street and Ninth Avenue, suspended postal operations from 4 p.m. until 7 a.m. tomorrow morning, Ms. Chirichello added.
She said that postal workers who could not get to work and wished to inquire whether their offices were open should call the USPS national emergency notification number at 888-363-7462.
- Liz Robbins 
 8:56 P.M. | Q & A: When Will the Subways Resume Service? 
 John from Queens asks "How long will it take for the Transit Authority to resume service, and can they have partial service if some of the lines have flooding in places?" 
The decision on when to restore service will hinge largely on how damaging the storm surge is to the authority's equipment. Stations in low-lying areas and tunnels that go underneath rivers could be susceptible to flooding. Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, has said that service could return about 12 hours after the storm ends in earnest, and officials have suggested that Wednesday is perhaps the likeliest day for service to return, but it all hinges on how the equipment holds up against the brunt of the storm. Switches can corrode if introduced to excessive salt water. And the authority's electronic signaling system could also be vulnerable, Mr. Lhota said.
The authority also said that if subway tunnels that cross beneath the Hudson and Harlem Rivers become flooded, pumping the water out could take anywhere from 14 hours to more than four days. Obviously this could snarl several lines well after the storm has passed, but it is unlikely that a decision will be made on a restart of service until the authority can inspect its tunnels and equipment.
There is a precedent for the authority to bring back partial service without returning to an entirely normal schedule. After a storm in 1992, three tunnels flooded, and the authority briefly suspended service on every line. Many were restored the same day; the L train under the East River, however, was out of service for several days.

 08:14 PM | The Storm Makes Landfall 
No longer classified a hurricane but still a powerful system, the storm made landfall on Monday evening close to Atlantic City at about 8 p.m., the National Hurricane Center said. 
The storm is now classified a post-tropical cyclone, having merged with a cold weather system approaching from the west.
But the center said the reclassification had no bearing on the powerful winds, driving rains and life-threatening storm-surge expected to accompany its push onto land. 
The storm no longer has a warm center or convection, the upward movement of warm air through the eye, two key characteristics of hurricanes, the National Hurricane Service said. 
The service said the storm was heading north-northwest at about 23 miles per hour, with maximum sustained winds of about 80 m.p.h., slightly weaker than earlier.

 7:43 P.M. | Christie Lashes Out at Atlantic City Mayor 
As the floodwaters rose in Atlantic City on Monday and stranded unknown numbers of people who stayed behind, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey squarely laid the blame for whatever fate may await them in the lap of their mayor.
In the latest dispute between the men, Mr. Christie said he had heard that Lorenzo Langford, the mayor of Atlantic City, had told the city's residents that they could ride out the storm at home or in a school a block from the ocean, directly contradicting the governor's evacuation order.
"You have a mayor, a rogue mayor, telling his citizens not to leave, that it's O.K. not to leave," Mr. Christie said. "I don't know what you call that. I don't call it effective governance."
The remarks came during Mr. Christie's early evening news briefing on the storm at the state emergency command center in West Trenton. Mr. Christie spoke directly to those who stayed behind, saying the storm had grown too close and they would have to wait out the storm until it was safer for emergency workers to return.
The clash between the men, as reported by The Press of Atlantic City, began more than two years ago, when Mr. Christie proposed a tourism district in Atlantic City. Mr. Langford likened the district's proposed borders to apartheid, which Mr. Christie called "playing to the lowest common denominator."
The governor recently said Mr. Langford had "failed" as mayor and was "impossible to work with in any significant kind of way," according to The Press.
Mr. Christie said he had been told that part of the mayor's reasoning behind the instruction to stay in town was that some Atlantic City residents believed they had evacuated unnecessarily last year during Tropical Storm Irene, which did not cause the level of damage that had been expected.
The governor did not spare those residents his wrath.
"I will never understand these people," he said. "They came home to very little property damage and they were alive. And they're angry because they spent a couple of days at Rutgers. We're going to see how they feel now, when they stayed. It's just not acceptable conduct."
But he focused his ire on the mayor, who may have been too busy to defend himself. Mr. Christie said the state had sent New Jersey Transit buses to evacuate people from Atlantic City, but evacuation personnel were told that many people felt they could stay because the mayor had said so.
"And now I'm going to have federal and state emergency personnel going in their first thing tomorrow morning with live downed electrical wires all over the place, risking their lives," Mr. Christie said. "Because Mayor Langford was worried that some of his people were angry? That's not leadership, everybody."
Lest anyone think that Mr. Christie had been subsumed by politics amid a disaster, the governor, who spoke at the Republican National Convention in support of Mitt Romney, heaped praise on President Obama.
Mr. Christie said Mr. Obama had called to make sure he had everything needed from the federal government and left a number to call him directly at the White House should any unmet needs arise.
"I appreciate that call from the president," Mr. Christie said. "It was very proactive. I appreciate that kind of leadership."

Around 7 p.m. the torch at the top of the Statue of Liberty, which shone all through thick daytime fog, driving rain and an early nightfall, went black.

 At the Battery at the bottom of Manhattan, the water level was at 10.7 feet as of 7:20 p.m., breaking the record of 10.0 feet set by Hurricane Donna in 1960.
 The level was expected to hit nearly 12 feet by the time the tide crests at 8:53 p.m., the National Weather Service said.

 7:38 P.M. | Cars Floating on Wall Street 
As the evening high tide was drawing closer, there were reports of flooding in several low-lying areas around the five boroughs, places that had not in recent memory experienced flooding. In Lower Manhattan, water crossed South Street, and cars could be seen floating on Wall Street on television screens at the ConEd headquarters. In Brooklyn, water had piled back onto Van Brundt Street - which flooded during the morning high tide - well in advance of the evening high water mark. At 7:25 p.m., Ninth Street in Gowanus was a nearly uncrossable river of water.

 7:25 P.M. | Con Ed Shuts Off Power to Lower Manhattan 
As the surge of water pushed into parts of Lower Manhattan on Monday night, Consolidated Edison took the unprecedented step of cutting off power to customers because of weather.
The utility said it needed to do that to try to prevent damage to equipment stored underground so that power could be restored more quickly after the storm.
At 6:42 p.m., Con Ed shut down the first network at the southern tip of Manhattan, which serves 2,500 customers.
About 20 minutes later they turned off a second network in lower Manhattan that serves about 4,000 customers.
At about 7:47 p.m., with the tide at 12 and 1/2 feet above normal high tide, a Con Ed official called for the Brighton Beach network to be turned off. Suddenly, an additional 28,000 customers were without power.

 5:55 P.M. | Scenes at City's Shelters 
At some shelters, the number of people seeking refuge in shelters set up by the city increased as the day wore on.
The total number of people at the 10 shelters administered by the City University of New York stood at over 1,200 late on Monday afternoon. There were 184 at the Hunter College shelter on East 68th Street, near its capacity.
The occupants were residents of the Baruch Houses, on the Lower East Side, and some of New York's homeless population. Students from Hunter's Brookdale dormitory, on East 25th Street between First Avenue and the Franklin D. Roosevelt Drive, were sent across the street to the theater at Hunter College.
Rodrigo Garcia, a chef and a jewelry maker who normally sells in Bryant Park, called several city agencies asking to volunteer as a chef. Mr. Garcia, 35, who said he has catered large events in Vermont, did not realize that the food at the shelters was already packaged and needed little assembly. He stayed anyway to help. "I put salt in the water with the meals," he said. On the menu: chicken with noodles and rice with chicken.
Earlier on Monday, a relatively small number of people were at the Philippa Shuyler School on Greene Avenue in Bushwick.
Among them was Rossely Muñoz, 22. Ms. Muñoz's parents lived through a terrifying earthquake in Mexico and did not want to leave on Sunday night, but Ms. Muñoz convinced her parents that they should leave their Bushwick apartment for a sturdier building. "My father was like 'Ah, nothing is going to happen, please,'" she said. "I panicked. I tend to worry. So I was like, 'Guys take this seriously.'"
She spent Sunday night in a classroom with her parents and two sisters. "My apartment is very old," she said. "A lot of buildings here are not properly renovated. They have landlords where you constantly have to fight for them to fix things. I don't trust them."
At the shelter, workers and storm refugees gathered in the cafeteria to watch CNN. They also began eating the emergency rations - cereal and peanut butter and jelly - stored away at the school.

In addition, two of the three bridges between Staten Island and New Jersey, the Outerbridge and the Bayonne, closed on Monday afternoon. With the 7 p.m. scheduled closing of the George Washington Bridge and the morning closing of the Holland Tunnel, only the Lincoln Tunnel and the Goethals Bridge will remain open as crossings between New York and New Jersey.
Scores of highways are also closing throughout the region, including the F.D.R. Drive south of 155th Street as of 6 p.m., the Garden State Parkway south of the Driscoll Bridge, and parts of the New Jersey Turnpike.

 5:31 P.M. | Power Losses Cascading as Storm Descends 
In late afternoon, Hurricane Sandy started to play havoc with overhead electrical wires.
As of 4:45 p.m., Consolidated Edison said the number of its customers that had lost power had jumped to 68,700 and was sure to keep rising as the storm neared the metropolitan area. Most of the power failures were caused by falling trees and branches' pulling down cables.
About 21,800 of the affected customers were in Westchester County; 18,500 were on Staten Island; and 18,200 were in Queens. Most of the rest were in Brooklyn. The company has no overhead wires in Manhattan. Con Ed is regularly updating a map to show power failures. 
Con Edison also said that it had expanded the area receiving automated calls warning of potential cutoffs of power networks to some of its customers in the South Bronx and some along the northern edge of Queens.
Jersey Central Power & Light, which provides electricity in many shore towns, had more than 290,00 customers without power just after 5 p.m.JCP&L's map is here. Public Service Energy & Gas, also in New Jersey, reported that more than 74,000 customers were without power in counties between Gloucester in the southern part of the state and Bergen in the north. A map is here.
Connecticut Light & Power had more than 185,000 customers without power at about the same time. A regularly updated map is here.

 4:42 P.M. | Replica of H.M.S. Bounty Sinks Off North Carolina; Body of 1 Missing Crew Member Found 
A replica of the H.M.S. Bounty, a tall ship built for the 1962 movie "Mutiny on the Bounty" starring Marlon Brando and used in the recent "Pirates of the Caribbean" series, sank Monday off the North Carolina coast. The body of one crew member, Claudene Christian, 42, was recovered; another crew member, Robin Wallbridge, 63, remained missing. The ship had been battered by 18-foot-high seas and thrashed by 40-mile-an hour winds from Hurricane Sandy, the United States Coast Guard reported.
In a dramatic early morning rescue over the Atlantic Ocean, Coast Guard crews in a pair of MH-60 Jayhawk helicopters hoisted up 14 sailors who had huddled together in the darkness on two covered life rafts as the Bounty, a 180-foot wooden vessel, took on water nearby. 
A Coast Guard video (see above) shows one of the helicopters hovering - at times just 33 feet over the roiling sea - as a rescue swimmer in flippers helps stranded sailors into a small basket, which is then pulled up to the helicopter and then let down again for the next sailor. As each sailor is lifted to safety, the voice of the helicopter's computer system can be heard repeating the word "altitude," to warn crew members how close the chopper is to the water. 
The Bounty, built in 1961 and based on the 1789 original, went down 90 miles southeast of Hatteras, N.C. - some 160 miles west of the eye of Hurricane Sandy.
When Coast Guard crews arrived after receiving a phone call Sunday night from the ship's owner, who was not aboard, and a subsequent distress signal from the ship that pinpointed its location, the Bounty was already taking on water and had lost the use of its twin 375-horsepower engines.
The Bounty had been trying to sail from New London, Conn., where the ship had been docked to host a private party last Thursday, to an event scheduled for Nov. 10 in St. Petersburg, Fla., according to the Coast Guard and the Bounty's Web site.

 04:06 PM | Bridges Around New York to Close 
Half a dozen bridges in and around New York City are closing, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced Monday afternoon. 
The Tappan Zee Bridge over the Hudson River, about 20 miles north of New York City, closed at 4 p.m.
The George Washington Bridge, the Verrazano-Narrows Bridge, the Throgs Neck Bridge and the bridges to the Rockaways are closing at 7 p.m., the governor said.
The Holland and Brooklyn-Battery Tunnels closed earlier in the day.
For now, the Lincoln and Midtown Tunnels will remain open, along with the Robert F. Kennedy Bridge and the Bayonne, Goethals and Outerbridge crossings.
But he added, "If the winds continue to increase, and the weather conditions get worse, they can close on very, very short notice."

 4:04 P.M. | Atlantic City Official: 'City Is Under Siege' 
The storm captured Atlantic City early and refused to let go. As the rainwater and surging waters of the ocean that hugged the city's beaches invaded its streets and wrenched apart pieces of its famed Boardwalk, the city was left an anxious and isolated island missing its slot-machine pulse.
Well before the worst ravages of Hurricane Sandy were expected to descend on the New Jersey coastline, Atlantic City was already in big trouble.
By high tide around 8 a.m. on Monday, officials said 70 to 80 percent of the city was underwater. Water as much as eight feet deep coursed through many streets, leaving them impassable. Heavy rains and sustained winds of more than 40 miles an hour battered the city.
All arteries leading into Atlantic City were closed, and officials speculated that they might remain so for days. No one could enter Atlantic City. Casinos were shut down.
"The city is under siege," said Thomas Foley, the chief of emergency services. "Sandy is pretty furious at Atlantic City. She must have lost a bet or something. As we say in our slogan, 'Do A.C.' She's doing A.C., all right."
Atlantic City, by many projections, is at or near where the hurricane will make landfall. And so as flooding eased as the tide receded later in the day, city officials feared that the storm's evil consequences might be far worse when the next high tide arrived at 8 or 9 p.m., around when landfall is anticipated.
The National Guard dispatched high-water trucks for the police and firefighters to try to evacuate some 400 people who had not heeded earlier warnings but later called for help. However, city officials said winds were approaching speeds at which they deemed it too risky to send out rescuers.
In the early afternoon, a gasoline spill inside City Hall from floating gas tanks in the basement shorted out some of the 911 equipment, and the city almost had to abandon its 911 system, but managed to keep it fully operative.
One 50-foot portion of the Boardwalk, worn down by earlier storms, was chewed apart. Chunks of woods floated down the flooded streets like crudely constructed rafts. "Timbers on Atlantic Avenue" came reports from first responders on police scanners.

 3:58 P.M. | Q. and A.: What About Government Employees? 
 Several readers have asked, "Will city government employees be required to go to work on Tuesday?" 
Several readers, including Ryan Shaffer, asked about how city employees - many of whom were at work on Monday - would be able to get around the city, with the subways shut down. And Jonathan Masserano asked about city employees whose offices are in the low-lying Zone A.
At a briefing Monday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg defended his decision to keep most of the city government open for business on Monday, saying "that's what we're here to do, to serve New Yorkers." But he did say that he had instructed his commissioners "to use their judgment" to determine if employees who were not involved in response or shelter operations could "leave work early to get home." No word yet on Tuesday, though he did say that sanitation workers, for instance, would be on 12-hour shifts to pick up refuse, and clear storm debris.

 3:49 P.M. | Q. and A.: What About Nuclear Power Facilities? 
 L. L. Barmack from New York City asks, "Why hasn't the nuclear power plant at Indian Point been shut down?" 
"Indian Point is protected from hurricane force winds, but would act conservatively to shut the plant down if sustained wind speed on site was anticipated to reach 75 miles per hour," said Jerry Nappi, a spokesman for the Indian Point Energy Center, which is operated by Entergy Nuclear. "We are not anticipating sustained winds of that magnitude, but are prepared to shut down if needed."
 farisam from 05401 asks "In the event of a prolonged power outage will the generators at Oyster Creek provide sufficient power for cooling?" 
"Oyster Creek's reactor was shut down on Oct. 22 for a planned refueling outage, so a long-term power interruption brought on by Hurricane Sandy would not have a significant impact on reactor cooling," said David Tillman, a spokesman for Exelon Nuclear, which operates the Oyster Creek Generating Station in Lacey Township, N.J.. "If the station were online however, multiple and redundant power backups, including two locomotive-sized diesel generators, would provide ample power almost indefinitely to the station's emergency cooling systems."

Inmates at are not being evacuated because the island is elevated and so not in any of the three evacuation zones, said Samantha Levine, a City Hall spokeswoman. The areas surrounding the island - including Hunts Point in the Bronx and Randalls Island - are awash in yellow and orange, and occasional spots of red, signifying the three evacuation zones, but Rikers is higher up, Ms. Levine said. It was not evacuated last year for Hurricane Irene, either.

 02:31 PM | Crane Collapses on West 57th Street 
The boom on a crane at the luxury skyscraper under construction at 157 West 57th Street was collapsing as of about 2:40 p.m., the Fire Department said. 
According to scanner reports at 2:57 p.m., debris, glass and bricks were falling from the site onto West 56th Street. The authorities did not immediately have reports of any injuries. 
The crane was dangling about 80 stories above 57th Street. Police officers cordoned off surrounding blocks as spectators withstood a bufffeting mist to gawk and take pictures. 
The building, known as One57, is to be New York City's tallest residential building and perhaps its priciest, with duplexes being offered for $90 million.
"We heard a big noise, and we didn't know what it was," said Victor Font, 40, who was eating lunch at Rue 57, a restaurant that looks out onto the high-rise. They rushed outside and saw the huge crane dangling over the street. As the police rushed to the scene, he said, his first thought was: "What are they going to do? How in the world will they bring that down?" At 3:15, with the wind starting to grow stronger, police officers began to widen the evacuation corridor, pushing pedestrians back to Fifth Avenue.

 02:26 PM | More Than 9,000 Flights Canceled So Far 
Hurricane Sandy has forced airlines to cancel roughly 9,000 flights, stranding travelers and raising the prospect that air travel might not be back to normal until next week.
FlightAware, a data provider based in Houston, said that more than 6,800 flights were canceled on Monday. It said that 1,300 flights had been canceled on Sunday, and that many more were being dropped for Tuesday, when high winds and heavy rain are still expected to buffet the East Coast.
FlightAware said that Philadelphia International Airport led the way in cancellations on Monday, grounding over 1,200 flights. The three major airports in the New York City area each canceled around 1,000 flights on Monday, the data service said.
Kate Hanni, the director of FlyersRights.org, a passenger rights group, said that given high fuel costs, extra seats were hard to find on most airlines even before the storm. 
"The airlines have cut back so much on staffing, and some are flying less, and I think it could take well over a week for them to reschedule all the passengers, " she said. "We've got a huge problem."
She said her group's phone hotline was already flooded with calls from passengers who could not get through to the airlines, whose customer service numbers have been overwhelmed by the high volume of calls.
US Airways, which has substantial East Coast operations, said it canceled 1,641 flights on Monday, or nearly half the normal daily total for its entire system. It said it would shut down all flights to and from Boston, New York, Philadelphia and Washington on both Monday and Tuesday.
Delta and United said they would resume flights Tuesday around midday. American Airlines and American Eagle suspended flights at airports along the Mid-Atlantic and Northeast regions from 10 p.m. Sunday to about midday Wednesday. 
American warned that the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy may force some additional delays and cancellations of scheduled flights beyond Wednesday.
Most airlines are allowing travelers to make changes with paying fees - and are granting refunds in some cases - for itineraries potentially impacted by the storm.
The best way to make flight changes is on airline Web sites. Airlines are also asking travelers not to go to airports for extended waits.
Given the storm's huge expanse of rain and winds, some flights were canceled as far inland as Buffalo and Pittsburgh.

 2:16 P.M. | Fast-moving Storm Churning Toward Southern Jersey 
The huge storm, which has been picking up speed and strength over water, was producing sustained winds of 90 miles per hour at 2 p.m., the National Hurricane Center said.
The storm was moving northwest at 28 m.p.h., a bit faster than forecasters had anticipated. They now forecast that the eye of Sandy will come ashore along the southern tip of New Jersey in the early evening. The storm will likely remain at hurricane strength for several hours as it moves inland.

 2:34 P.M. | Con Ed Warns of a Possible Power Shutoff 
At the headquarters of Consolidated Edison near Union Square, company executives were expecting Hurricane Sandy to cause a record number of their customers to lose power. But the strong winds that would cause those problems are not the company's primary concern.
The most critical question is how high the water in New York Harbor will rise on Monday evening. If the forecasts prove accurate, the storm surge will cause so much flooding in Lower Manhattan and possibly also in the Brighton Beach section of Brooklyn that Con Edison will take the unprecedented step of shutting off entire electrical networks because of weather.
"That is unprecedented for us," said John Miksad, the utility's senior vice president for electric operations. "We came close during Hurricane Irene."
The networks would be shut down as a pre-emptive move to protect underground equipment. The three networks the company is considering turning off serve about 35,000 customers. But the total number of people affected would be a multiple of that number, Mr. Miksad said, because in some cases a single meter covers a large number of apartments.
Con Ed customers in the most vulnerable networks, as well as others in Manhattan as far north as 34th Street, have been receiving automated calls from the company warning them that their power could be shut off. 
The tidal forecasts show the water rising 10 to 12 feet above normal. "We suspect that if we get to the upper end of that 10- to 12-foot range, we will not be O.K."
By that, Mr. Miksad meant that he would expect to hear from crews monitoring critical equipment in those areas that floodwater was threatening to cause damage that would take much longer to repair than if the networks were shut down. The most susceptible networks in Manhattan are at the southern tip of the island and just north of there along the East River. That is where the worst flooding occurred in Manhattan during the Irene storm last year, he said.
The highest tide will occur after 8 p.m., but the surge could cause company officials to cut the power earlier in the evening, on short notice, Mr. Miksad said. And he added, if the surge is "worse than we're expecting, we will be looking at other networks."

 1:35 P.M. | Q. and A.: How Strong Will the Winds Be? 
 Several readers, including Jerold Paulson from Richmond Hill, N.Y., and Nick from New York, have asked about the strength of the winds and what risk they will pose. AVB from Upper Manhattan asked: 
Could the storm cause window breaking or building collapse in N.Y.C. - especially for the high buildings - due to high winds? Is there something people should do to minimize risk of injury while either staying home or walking in the streets?
Wind gusts from Hurricane Sandy, according to the National Weather Service, are expected to reach 80 miles per hour in the New York City area on Monday night, and up to 60 to 70 miles per hour Monday afternoon. Wind at that speed does present a danger to pedestrians and others out on the streets, due mostly to the risk posed by flying debris. It is for that reason that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, in his news briefing on Monday morning, asked New Yorkers to stay home if possible.
Apartment windows in high-rises are designed to withstand winds upward of the strength we will see in this storm. Therefore, most residents should not face a problem with their windows breaking. However, people who live on upper floors of high-rises, generally considered over the 10th floor, were urged by the mayor to close their window shades and stay away from their windows as much as possible. That's because wind speeds are amplified at higher altitudes.
A pamphlet (pdf) issued by the city on hurricane preparedness contains more tips, including making sure that items on balconies are secured and residents should relocate to a lower floor if possible during the worst conditions.

 2:24 P.M. | In Westchester, Concern About Those Who Stayed 
In Westchester, Robert P. Astorino, the county executive, toured the lower-lying towns of Rye and Mamaroneck on Monday. The choppy Long Island Sound surf already covered much of the beach at Rye Playland and was almost at boardwalk level. Still, he expressed concern about the number of people he saw casually walking around in areas that were supposed to be evacuated.
"This is not the time to be a hero, this is not the time to be a thrill-seeker," he said. "This is a dangerous storm."
Earlier, Mr. Astorino suspended the county's bus service, the Bee-Line, and closed much of the flood-prone Bronx River Parkway.
The county has also closed all its parks for Monday and Tuesday and said county offices would be open but with limited staffing. Westchester County Airport is open but all flights have been suspended. The Indian Point nuclear power plant is operating normally, the county said. A number of shelters are open in area schools and community centers, some of which also accept pets.

 1:47 P.M. | No Holiday for the Highest Court 
 Proving that it is an independent branch of the government, the United States Supreme Court heard two hourlong arguments on Monday morning. The court has historically been reluctant to close its doors for weather. Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, who died in 2005, ordered the court to remain open during a winter storm in 1996 that shut down the rest of the federal government.
 During the first argument, concerning government surveillance, Justice Stephen G. Breyer referred to Hurricane Sandy in questioning a government lawyer about how much proof was needed to show that something was bound to happen. "It might not be a storm tomorrow," he said. "I mean, you know, nothing is certain."
 Shortly after the second argument, the court announced that it would be closed on Tuesday, rescheduling that day's arguments for Thursday.

 1:54 P.M. | Parts of Atlantic City Are Flooded 
EGG HARBOR TOWNSHIP, N.J. - Parts of Atlantic City and other coastal communities in South Jersey were underwater on Monday even before the brunt of Hurricane Sandy arrived in the area.
Knee-high water filled streets in some parts of Atlantic City, where on Sunday the casinos had been ordered shut down and residents had been told to evacuate. Widespread flooding was also reported in oceanfront areas like Cape May, Wildwood and Long Beach Island. Here in Egg Harbor Township, about 10 miles west of Atlantic City, the rain and wind had grown stronger over the course of Monday morning.
More than 2,200 people were in shelters in New Jersey, according to the State Office of Emergency Management. But some people in the most vulnerable areas had hunkered down in their homes; in Cape May County, the southernmost portion of the state, officials estimated that perhaps 40 percent of the residents of the county's barrier islands had decided to stay put.
Across the state, emergency officials urged people to stay indoors, asking residents not to be tempted to go outside to take cellphone pictures or video of the storm. Atlantic County banned travel on public roads, and the Garden State Parkway was shut down in both directions south of Exit 38 at the Atlantic City Expressway because of flooding. State officials warned that additional shutdowns of major highways were likely as the storm approached.

The dire storm surge forecasts have raised the possibility that subway infrastructure will be damaged during the storm. Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he was particularly concerned about the surge in Lower Manhattan, noting that saltwater and the subway system "do not mix very well together." Switches could "corrode quite easily" if the water reaches them, Mr. Lhota said, and the electronic signaling system could also be imperiled.

 1:18 P.M. | Minor Flooding Along the Connecticut Coast 
 WESTPORT, Conn. - Gusts of 50 miles per hour whipped through Connecticut on Monday morning, and high tide brought minor flooding along the coast, swamping roads and low-lying areas along the shoreline as residents braced for worse to come with the full moon this evening.
High winds caused scattered power failures across the state. About 15,000 people were without power as of noon, Gov. Dannel P. Malloy said at a news conference in Hartford. Hundreds of thousands of residents were expected to lose power this evening as flooding and high winds were expected to grow more severe. The tidal surge was expected to rise 6 to 11 feet, more than double last year's surge from Tropical Storm Irene.
"The mother is yet to come," he said.
United Illuminating Company put out a warning before noon that it was shutting down a flood substation in Bridgeport, cutting off power to about 35,000 customers. But flooding was less severe than expected and the outage was averted, utility officials said. The utility warned that it may be forced to close the substation this evening as the tide rolls back in.
In East Haven, roads along Cosey Beach were flooded and city officials were urging residents to adhere to a mandatory evacuation order. In Weston, several miles inland, more than 1,000 people were without power.
In Westport, tidal waters surged over sea walls and engulfed Harbor Road leading to Saugatuck Island. Many of the residents in the area, which received substantial flooding during Tropical Storm Irene, heeded evacuation warnings. On one boarded-up house, a child's note was posted on plywood panels covering the windows. "Sandy go away," it read. "Don't come back."

 11:20 A.M. | In Westchester, More People Are Expected to Seek Shelter 
Mamaroneck, a Westchester town that has both affluent and working-class areas, set up a shelter in its high school gymnasium, and by 10 a.m. Monday it held seven people. One of those was Owen Patterson, a 65-year-old Jamaican immigrant and retired laborer who lives not near the flood-prone Long Island Sound shoreline but near a narrow river inland that floods badly in drenching rains.
He lives by himself, and he recalls a few years ago when a storm flooded the streets off Mamaroneck Avenue with five feet of water and he could not easily leave his second-floor apartment on the avenue. He does not want to repeat that experience.
"What goes up must come down," he said. "I can stay in the building but can't come downstairs. So I decided to ride it out here. I'm not going home until it's safe to go back."
The gymnasium was outfitted with more than 100 green cots loaned by the American Red Cross. Luann Jacobs and her husband, Matthew, volunteers for the Larchmont-Mamaroneck Community Emergency Response Team, were among those taking care of those - mostly elderly single people - seeking refuge. They recalled that during Hurricane Irene the shelter housed 200 people, so they expect many more to come Monday night.
In a wealthier area known as Orienta, water was lapping over the harbor walls and shoreline and flooding the harbor park and Rushmore Avenue, a main approach to the leafy Orienta peninsula.
"This is crazy," said Robbie Goldberg, the owner of a Larchmont deli who came by to see the flooding and videotape it. "This early in the storm and the water has already covered Rushmore Avenue and the parking lots of both marinas."
Although many stores and gas stations were shuttered and the streets were unusually empty of traffic, some people proceeded as if Monday was not out of the ordinary.
"It's a normal day," said Don Freda, the owner of Hennessy-Freda, an automobile repair shop and Citgo gas station on Boston Post Road, as he pumped gas in a customer's car. "We come to work just as we always do. We're open as long as the electricity stays on. "

 12:12 P.M. | Confused Tourists in Times Square 
All over Times Square Monday morning, tourists aimed their cellphones and cameras toward the gray and drizzly sky. With the city shut down tight, what else was there to do besides photograph the neon lights on Broadway?
Laura Taylor, an English and drama teacher at Lewis School in Pengam, South Wales, posed for a colleague, Mike Oliver, a history teacher, in front of the Times Square zipper, with the police station framed in the background.
They arrived Sunday and booked trips to all the usual tourist sites. But with the theaters dark and Central Park and most stores and restaurants closed, they were wandering around, improvising. "We're going back this Thursday, so we're not thinking we're going to see too much," Mr. Oliver said. Still, he was upbeat, adding: "That's life. This is still a great piece of Americana. We're doing this just because we're trying to make the most of what we can."
Being from Wales, he added, they were used to wet and windy weather, but they did not consider the impending hurricane a joking matter.
Down the block, a group of four friends from England took pictures of the bright lights of the Hard Rock Cafe, which was, however, closed.
"Strange, isn't it?" said Julian Cooke, a farmer from about 20 miles west of Oxford, looking around at the other dazed and glum-looking tourists, who looked like characters in an apocalypse movie, milling about aimlessly and gazing anxiously toward the sky. He was traveling with his wife, Sarah, and another couple, Rob Tylee, a Baptist minister, and his wife, Sue.
Ms. Tylee was optimistic despite the weather. She said she was still hoping to get to the Museum of Modern Art, Macy's and Bloomingdale's before their flight home on Wednesday. What will they do if they have no flight home on Wednesday? "No idea," she said.

 12:30 P.M. | A Closed Central Park Leaves Dogs at a Loss 
 They were crestfallen, whimpering in disbelief. The city's dogs walked right up to an east side entrance of Central Park, saw the fence and could not fathom why they - and their owners - were not allowed in. For a little wind? Light rain? They had seen worse.
"I may have to carry him away," said John Blondel, nodding to Rollo, a spry-looking white Labrador who was 10 and a half years old. Rollo decided to engage in a sit-down strike in front of the 79th Street entrance on Fifth Avenue.
Mr. Blondel, 56, who is in the investment management division for Goldman Sachs, had driven from his apartment in the West Village to give Rollo his daily constitution. Later, he would work from home. "This is going to be it for a while," he said to his friend.
Soon, Rollo was joined by several other dogs dragging their walkers to yet another blocked entrance. "They're just amazed," Mr. Blondel said.
When a gust of wind blew an opening in the temporary fencing, Rollo was wise to the opportunity. Mr. Blondel had to pull him back and head to the car.
The city's parks had been closed since Sunday evening, and the morning scene was an abject one indeed. As joggers dashed by on the slippery, leaf-laden sidewalk adjacent to the park - some took advantage of the empty bus lanes to run in the street - they had to dodge the dogs, who were similarly displaced from their morning routine.

 12:42 P.M. | President Urged People to Heed Evacuation Orders 
 President Obama, echoing mayor and governors across the Northeast, urged people in evacuation zones to get out of the way of Hurricane Sandy.
 "Please listen to what your state and local officials are saying," the president said in a nationwide address at 12:45 p.m Monday. "If you are not evacuating when you've been asked to evacuate, you are putting first responders in danger."
 The president said, regarding preparations and emergency response to the storm, "I'm confident that we're ready but the public need s to prepare for the fact that this will take some time to clean up."
 The president waved off a reporter's question about the storm's impact on next Tuesday's election.
 "I'm not worried about the impact on the election," the president said. "I'm worried about the impact on families, on first responders, on the economy and on transportation. The election will take care of itself next week."

With the hurricane expected to make landfall near Atlantic City around midnight, Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey warned Monday afternoon that for residents in evacuation zones who had not left yet, time was running out, and for some of them it was now too late to leave.
"They are now in harm's way and I don't know if we can get them out now," the governor said. "These decisions were both stupid and selfish and I don't know if we can get them out in the next 12 hours."
He said that tens of thousands of residents were already without power.
And he added that he was "trending" toward ordering state government offices and schools to close on Tuesday.

 11:39 A.M. | New York City Schools Will Remain Closed on Tuesday 
With mass transit expected to remain shut through Tuesday morning, city public schools will remain closed on Tuesday, Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg said.
 "There's no chance that mass transit will be back in time to serve people," the mayor said.
The mayor delivered a stern warning to those who had defied his evacuation order that time was running out for them to get safely out of their neighborhoods.
 "The window for you to leave is closing," he said. "You should have left but now it's getting to be too late to leave."
 Mr. Bloomberg said that about 3,000 people had come in to city shelters, a tiny percentage of the 370,000 covered under the evacuation order, most of whom are presumably staying elsewhere. Pets are allowed at shelters, and the mayor said that about 70 had been brought in.

 11:18 AM | City Offices Are Open, but Many Desks Are Empty 
New York City's public agencies are purportedly open for business on Monday, per Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's instructions.
But a search for public servants near City Hall on Monday - amid a shutdown of virtually all of New York's mass transit network - proved somewhat futile.
The doors to the Department of Buildings, at 280 Broadway, opened with a gentle nudge, but the lone security guard stationed inside quickly indicated that the entry was mostly symbolic.
"Are you open today?" a reporter asked. The guard shook her head and made a throat-cutting gesture, then smiled apologetically. 
City Hall itself was almost entirely deserted, although its stoic French Renaissance facade appeared unruffled in the morning winds. 
The interior hallways had a ghostly feel. The office of the City Council speaker, Christine C. Quinn, was completely empty, although its gate remained open. 
The mayor's insistence that city employees go to work on Monday - despite closed schools, no mass transit and a general encouragement from public officials to stay inside - raised eyebrows among some municipal observers. But asked about it at a Sunday news conference, Mr. Bloomberg said the city must function when its denizens need it most.
"We need the city workers," Mr. Bloomberg told a reporter. "We all take great pride in our dedication to serving the public, and this is something that we are going to have to do. It may be inconvenient, hopefully it's not dangerous, but city workers are here to help others, and I think they all understand that."
A spokeswoman for the mayor, Julie Wood, said on Monday that many city employees were working in the field, rather than offices.

 11:11 A.M. | Maryland Governor Provides Grim Prediction on Storm 
Gov. Martin O'Malley of Maryland gave an unvarnished assessment of the grim situation as the storm raked the coast and roared inland, warning that "there will be people who die and are killed in this storm."
"We need to watch out for each other, but the intensity of this storm is such that there will undoubtedly be some deaths that are caused by the intensity of this storm, by the floods, by the tidal surge, and by the waves," he said in a news conference from the state's emergency center.
Shifts in the storm's trajectory are now raising concerns of flooding in the Chesapeake Bay. Rather than pushing water out of the bay as originally anticipated, the storm now appears poised to push water inland into rivers and streams already likely to flood.
High winds will most likely force the state to close the long Bay Bridge that links mainland Maryland to the Delmarva Peninsula, which is already seeing damage from the pounding surf, he said. Residents should "hunker down at home with your families - it's going to be a long 24 to 36 hours," he said.
"The more responsibly citizens act, the fewer people will die," he said.

 10:48 A.M. | In Philadelphia, Some Seeking Shelter as Storm Worsens 
 Mayor Michael Nutter of Philadelphia said on Monday morning that about 150 people had checked into the city's three emergency shelters. Occupants include adults, children, dogs, cats, a turtle and a spider, he said.
In an interview with KYW Radio, Mr. Nutter said winds at about 6 a.m. were sustained at 21 miles per hour, gusting to 28 m.p.h. Those speeds are likely to double later in the day, he said.
"It's bad, and it's only going to get worse," he said. "It's getting colder, there's more rain, it's very windy. This is a serious storm and you need to take it seriously."
A refinery operated by Philadelphia Energy Solutions is cutting its output in response to the storm, said Cherise Corley, a spokeswoman for the company, which normally processes 330,000 barrels of crude oil a day into petroleum products. "We continue to monitor the storm and take the appropriate precautions. We are currently running at reduced capacity," she said.

 09:46 AM | Morning Floods, Then a Pause, With a Deluge to Come 
The flooding in New York City's coastal and riverfront neighborhoods that accompanied this morning's high tides will recede a bit as the day wears on, but it is only a dress rehearsal for tonight's surge, the National Weather Service said.
Forecasters are expecting a 6-to-11-foot surge to hit the city at high tide around 8 p.m. - the highest surge of the entire storm cycle. 
"What we're seeing now is just the beginning of what we're going to be seeing worse, later," said David Stark, a meteorologist at the weather service office in Upton, N.Y. 
At the Battery at the bottom of Manhattan, the water level was eight and a half feet at Monday morning's high tide, considered moderate flooding. Tonight at the Battery, Mr. Stark said, "We may see water level of 10 or 12 feet which is a major flooding category."
Tonight's high tides will coincide with Hurricane Sandy making landfall in southern New Jersey. "All the water the hurricane is bringing will be pushed on-shore right at high tide," Mr. Stark said. Tonight is also the peak tide time in the lunar cycle (full moon is at 3:49 p.m. Eastern time on Monday, not Sunday as reporter here earlier).

On the Upper East Side, a man who gave his name only as Patrick was trying to catch a cab to his job at a Midtown bank. He lives across the river in Hoboken, N.J., but he stayed with a friend in Manhattan because the PATH train was shut down.
"It's obviously not that bad right now," he said of the weather before the expected rain had started. "I just wish the subway was open." 
Doormen at several buildings on Park Avenue in the upper 80s said there were fewer cabs out than normal. Alberto Ventura, who works at 1111 Park Avenue, was outside with a resident who stepped into a cab just before 7 a.m.

 7:07 AM | Open for Business, and Walking to Work 
In Brooklyn, south of Williamsburg and into Dumbo, Monday morning dawned calm, with a few gusts of powerful wind. A smattering of stores were open, mostly bodegas like J&J Navy Yard Sub Shop, owned by Marcos Martinez, who said he could not afford to stay closed.
"I can see there's no storm happening yet," Mr. Martinez, 47, said shortly after 6 a.m. He had driven to work from Park Slope.
How was business? "It's a slow morning."
A few lonely-looking police officers stood on street corners as the first fat drops of rain began to fall around 6:30. Workers in front of a Chinese market on Flushing Avenue were even seen sweeping fall leaves into dustpans on the sidewalk by their front door.
Some people were walking to work, in the absence of mass transit.
Felix Toro, 23, walked from his home in Fort Greene over the Manhattan Bridge to his barista job at Bowery Coffee on Houston Street. He said his boss had offered him the day off, but "I didn't want to spend today at home."
"I wanted to see what it was like," said Mr. Toro, who carried a dry change of work clothes in a plastic bag slung over his shoulder.
He said he was prepared to sleep at the coffee shop if he became stranded by the storm.
"I don't have a death wish or anything," he said.

 06:56 AM | Monday-Morning Non-Evacuators 
The police have been going door to door in the evacuation zone. No one is going to drag you out of your house if you refuse to leave.
But the National Weather Service issued a rather blunt warning on Sunday to those considering defying an evacuation order:
THINK ABOUT YOUR LOVED ONES, THINK ABOUT THE EMERGENCY RESPONDERS WHO WILL BE UNABLE TO REACH YOU WHEN YOU MAKE THE PANICKED PHONE CALL TO BE RESCUED, THINK ABOUT THE RESCUE/RECOVERY TEAMS WHO WILL RESCUE YOU IF YOU ARE INJURED OR RECOVER YOUR REMAINS IF YOU DO NOT SURVIVE.
Those in New York City who refuse to evacuate will also earn the wrath of Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, as well as the wrath of Hurricane Sandy itself, as Cara Buckley reported Sunday night.
But in the Rockaways, where rain has begun to fall, plenty of people were around. "Don't leave the castle," a father of four told WINS-1010 radio. "I don't think my safety's at risk. We're going to tough it out and play Wii all day until the power goes out."

 06:46AM | Traffic Report: Not Much 
Any worries that the canceling of all mass transit would clog the roads with excess drivers appeared unfounded at the start of what would normally be the Monday morning rush.
As of 6:20 a.m., there were no reported delays at bridges and tunnels and no reports of extensive road congestion anywhere. "Not many people driving on the L.I.E. or the Northern or Southern State," said the 6:18 report on WCBS 880. 
There are, however, road closings, either preemptively - like a stretch of the Bronx River Parkway - or because of flooding: Route 7 in Hudson County, N.J., and Routes 18 and 27 near the Raritan River and New Brunswick. Route 36 out to Sandy Hook, N.J. is also closed.

 6:41 A.M. | Tall Ship With 17 Aboard in Distress Off North Carolina 
A three-masted tall ship that is a replica of the H.M.S. Bounty was in distress off the coast of North Carolina with 17 people aboard, as Hurricane Sandy barreled up the seaboard early Monday, the Coast Guard reported.
Coast Guard Sector North Carolina received a call from the ship's owner, who had not heard from the crew since late Sunday evening, the report said. A Coast Guard command center in Portsmouth, Va., then received a signal from a radio beacon registered to the Bounty that indicated where the ship was and that it needed help.
A plane crew found the ship caught in 40-mile-an-hour winds and 18-foot seas about 90 miles southeast of Hatteras, N.C., the Coast Guard said. The 180-foot-long ship reportedly had no power and was taking on water.
The Coast Guard said that it was monitoring the situation but did not report having rescued any of the crew or passengers.
 The Coast Guard said that the Bounty's crew decided to abandon ship because it was taking on so much water. The crew and passengers donned cold-water survival suits and boarded two 25-man lifeboats lowered from the Bounty,
 The lifeboats were equipped with radios, so their passengers could continue communicatingwith the Coast Guard, a Coast Guard spokesman said. He said that the Coast Guard had not decided yet whether to attempt to rescue the evacuees by helicopter or with a cutter.

 1:38 A.M. | Quiet in Times Square, Except for the Tourists 
The approach of Hurricane Sandy may have shut down Broadway theaters on Sunday night, but it did not blow all of the tourists out of Times Square.
Late into the evening, hundreds of people milled about in the cool, fresh air, bathed in the glow of electronic signs and giant TV screens. They seemingly had no place to go: All the stores had been closed for hours, many surrounded by sandbags that appeared too small to hold back much more than the overflow from a bathtub.
Restaurants that normally would cater to the after-theater crowd were dark. Even the flashy McDonald's on 42nd Street had closed at 5 p.m. The only culinary offerings were the street meats sizzling on pushcarts parked all around the square.
But, save for the ominous, swirling images flashing on the giant screens overhead, nobody would have known that a monster storm was chugging up the seaboard. Tourists perched on the red staircase over the discount-ticket booth and chatted in various languages, undaunted. Some posed for sketch artists while others grinned for cellphone snapshots.
Several police officers were posted around the square, but they were so idle that one used the trunk of his cruiser as a desktop while he caught up on his paperwork. The clearest sign that something was amiss was that there were virtually no private cars mixed in with the stream of yellow taxis flowing slowly down Broadway.
All of the locals had heeded the warnings to get indoors and stay there. Only the out-of-towners were braving the tame streets of Midtown.

There were reports of roadways flooding, and Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware ordered that no one would be allowed on Delaware roads after 5 a.m. on Monday.
Along the Maryland, Virginia and Delaware coasts, winds began to pick up intensity, and bands of rain whipped coastal towns.
Near the Norfolk Naval Station, there were reports of sustained winds of 45 miles per hour and gusts topping 53 miles per hour.
The latest forecast from the National Hurricane Center, issued at 11 p.m., said that the storm was still 470 miles from New York City and moving northward at 14 miles per hour.
It was not losing steam as it plowed forward. Hurricane force winds over 75 miles per hour were measured by monitors on ocean buoys 170 miles from the storm's center. Tropical force winds extended 520 miles from the heart of the giant weather system.
The computer tracking models showed the storm still likely to make landfall somewhere in the vicinity of southern New Jersey by late Monday evening.
In Ocean City, Md., where residents were evacuated earlier in the day, live-streaming Web cams - now disabled - showed the storm surge already reaching up to the boardwalk.

PHILADELPHIA - Kwame Osei-Prempeh, 26, an immigrant from Ghana in West Africa who now lives in Newark, was among the legion of travelers trying to find their way to the New York region on Sunday.
His trip had begun on Saturday in his hometown of Kumasi, Ghana, where he gone to set up a film and music business. He took a bus to the capital, Accra, a plane to Lagos, Nigeria, and another flight to Houston, where he learned that his connecting flight to Newark had been canceled. He quickly found a seat on a United Airlines flight to Philadelphia and his plane was one of the last to land at the Philadelphia airport before the authorities closed it to further arrivals Sunday night.
Mr. Osei-Prempeh then found his way to 30th Street Station in Philadelphia where he snagged a seat on an Amtrak train to Newark.
Judging by overheard conversations at the station, many other passengers had also been forced to reroute by plane through Philadelphia.
Despite the fact that he had been traveling for 38 hours, Mr. Osei-Prempeh seemed to be in good spirits.
"I have no choice," he said cheerily as he waited to board the train.

 6:47 P.M. | Q. and A.: How Serious Is This Storm? 
 Several readers have asked if Hurricane Sandy will actually be as bad as meteorologists are predicting. 
Any predictions about the storm's path and strength are subject to change, but forecasters and officials believe that Hurricane Sandy will have a significant effect on a large swath of the East Coast.
A major concern is the size of the storm. Forecasters warned that it could have ravaging effects far beyond its projected trajectory and urged people to heed calls for evacuation and prepare for the worst. Though the storm will not reach land until sometime on Monday, tropical storm-force winds will extend 520 miles from its center. Many regions will likely loose power, and there will be a significant danger of falling debris.
The storm surge is perhaps the most pressing danger immediately. In its latest report, the National Hurricane Center said there was a possibility of a storm surge as high as 11 feet above normal levels along Long Island Sound and Raritan Bay - significantly higher than in previous forecasts - and warned that major flooding could occur across the Eastern Seaboard. In addition to a storm surge, forecasters expected torrential rains in some regions, which would add to the flooding problems.
Emergency officials, local leaders and President Obama have urged people to take this storm seriously and heed the advice of local emergency services including requests to evacuate.

Decisions on closings will be based largely on wind speeds and will be determined on a case-by-case basis, depending also on rainfall and roadway conditions. If sustained winds exceed 60 miles per hour, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates seven bridges and two tunnels, could close some or all bridges to traffic. At lesser wind speeds, there may be some restrictions on driving speed or the type of vehicle that can traverse a bridge. Updates can be found on the M.T.A.'s Web site or the site for the New York State Thruway Authority.

 05:25 PM | Storm's Approach Sends Cruise Ships Back to Sea 
The Brooklyn and Manhattan Cruise Terminals planned to clear out their vessels as Hurricane Sandy churned toward the city. In Manhattan, the Norwegian Jewel, Aida Luna, and Carnival Miracle cruise ships were expected to leave by Sunday night, said Kyle Sklerov, a spokesman for the New York City Economic Development Corporation, which manages the terminals. In Brooklyn, the Queen Mary 2 was expected to depart.
Mr. Sklerov said he did not know where the ship planned to go next. A message left for the Queen Mary 2's operator was not immediately returned.
The storm's approach also prompted the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to close its maritime facilities beginning at midnight. The port terminals to be closed are: Port Newark Container Terminal, Port Elizabeth Marine Terminal, Port Jersey Marine Terminal, Howland Hook Marine Terminal on Staten Island, and the Brooklyn-Port Authority Marine Terminal.
Deep draft vessels have already departed the terminals. The agency said it was providing a safe berth for numerous barges, dredges, and floating cranes.

 03:57 PM | In Red Hook, Short on Time, and Kale 
In the Zone A neighborhood of Red Hook, Brooklyn, residents along the streets closest to New York Harbor were checking sump pumps in their basements, and piling sandbags against exterior doors. 
Cars tore down Van Brunt Street and into the parking lot of the Fairway Market, where scores of people were stocking up on food supplies. (Jordana Rothman, the food and drink editor for Time Out New York, sent out a dire message via Twitter from the scene: 
BREAKING: KALE SOLD OUT AT FAIRWAY. EVAC NOW! EVAC NOW! #sandy
- Jordana Rothman (@jordanarothman) October 28, 2012
Gino Vitale, a builder and landlord who owns several properties in the neighborhood, was delivering sandbags piled high in the bed of his white Ford pickup truck to tenants along Conover Street, a block from New York Bay.
 "We dodged most of it with Irene," he said, referring to last year's tropical storm, which flooded basements in Red Hook but not much else. "I'm hoping we can do that again. This is a low-lying neighborhood, but this right here is the high spot."

 2:56 P.M. | Cape May, N.J.: To Stay or To Go? 
Hours before the deadline for a mandatory evacuation, the authorities on Sunday morning urged residents at the southernmost tip of New Jersey to head inland, but some were content to stay home and hope for the best.
Gov. Chris Christie ordered residents of New Jersey's barrier islands to evacuate by 4 p.m. Sunday, and the Cape May county government said it would open a handful of shelters in safer inland areas. By early afternoon, a cold drizzle had begun to fall, and most of the spectators along the beach headed for shelter.
Some residents planned to hunker down. Scott Thomas, 56, who manages a jewelry store, pointed out that his apartment was in a brick building. "The big bad wolf can huff and puff all he wants, you know?" Mr. Thomas said. "There's a lot of buildings in Cape May that I don't think I'd want to stay in, but this one's fine."
Mr. Thomas was helping a fellow merchant, Joanne Klineburger, cover the front windows of her novelty t-shirt shop. They used the same boards that had protected the storefront during Hurricane Irene, using black spray paint to change "Go away Irene" to "Go away Sandy."
Mike Keosky, 68, a human resources consultant, also pulled out the plywood that he had bought before Irene approached; he had stored it ever since behind his shed.
Taking a break from drilling, Mr. Keosky noted that he had a generator in his home. He listed several neighbors who, like he and his wife, Norma, were planning to ride out the storm in Cape May. "Last year we went away for two days," he said. "When I came back, all I had were a few leaves on the ground."

 02:01 PM | Disabling a Mass Transit System, Step by Step 
What was once without precedent will now happen for the second time in 14 months: New York City's transit system is going dark.
But while the shutdown before Tropical Storm Irene last year began at noon on a Saturday - and the restoration of subway service began before the Monday workday - the suspension of subway, bus, and railroad service this time could prove particularly disruptive for the region.
Joseph J. Lhota, the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, suggested the city could be without the bulk of its transit system for two full weekdays. By Wednesday, he hoped, some service might be restored.
While subways will begin suspending service at 7 p.m. on Sunday, some buses could remain on the road until 9 p.m. It takes about eight hours to shut down the subway system, but the bus system requires only six hours.
The authority's hurricane plan calls for service to be suspended if sustained winds reach 39 miles per hour. Thousands of buses and subway cars have already been removed from service and stored in safe locations. Flood-prone subway yards and depots have been cleared, and subway stations in vulnerable areas, like Lower Manhattan, will be evacuated.
The authority said that "critical track-level components" were being removed from beneath river tubes to protect the materials from the corrosive effects of salt water in the event of flooding.
On Metro-North Railroad, equipment was to be removed from low-lying areas like the east end of a New Haven yard and Highbridge and Mott Haven yards in the Bronx. Some trucks, cranes, bulldozers and other equipment was being moved to higher ground. Plans included bringing trains into Grand Central Terminal for shelter.
Some wooden crossing gates were also removed and secured on both Metro-North Railroad and Long Island Rail Road.
The authority cautioned riders that a suspension of service on its railroads did not imply that power would be cut to the third rail or overhead wires.
The authority's paratransit service, Access-A-Ride, suspended its outbound trips at noon Sunday; return trips were expected to continue until 5 p.m.
The authority said the Staten Island Railway would continue operations for as long as the Staten Island Ferry was in service, if conditions permitted, so that no riders would be stranded at the ferry terminal.
The authority's bridges will close to all traffic if sustained winds reach 60 miles per hour. Required slowdowns will likely be instituted if winds exceed 39 miles per hour.
The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that PATH train service would be suspended beginning at 12:01 a.m. Monday morning until further notice.
Operations remained normal at local airports, the agency said, but travelers were encouraged to check with their individual airlines.
Though Mr. Lhota expressed optimism about restoring service by Wednesday, a return to normal operations is likely to come in fits and starts. A little over 24 hours after subway, bus, and rail service was suspended for Tropical Storm Irene, some limited bus service returned. About 14 hours after that, the restoration of subway service began. Railroad service was restored on a line by line basis, as some required substantial cleanup of debris and mudslides and others waited on power to be restored.

 02:14 PM | New York Stock Exchange to Stay Open 
The New York Stock Exchange still plans to open as usual on Monday, according to a notice posted to the market operator's Web site. The exchange added that it is monitoring the weather conditions.
Because so much trading today is conducted electronically, the exchange has closed because of weather far less frequently. The NYSE shut down for three days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.

 1:49 P.M. | In Times Square, Tourists Dwindle as Storm Nears 
Mickey and Minnie, Woody and Buzz, and Elmo and Cookie Monster were out in force in Times Square Sunday morning, but there were not many tourists to greet them.
"It's the Frankenstorm economy," said Mike Tyler, one of the many ticket agents canvassing the area's pedestrian malls in search of someone - anyone - who wanted to a ticket to a show, a game or a tour. "It's just way emptier." 
The crowds that normally clog Times Square were noticeably thin ahead of Hurricane Sandy's arrival in New York, which has already prompted the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to announce a shutdown of subways, buses and railroads beginning Sunday evening. Although visitors from around the country and the world could still be seen lining up for Broadway tickets at the TKTS booth, posing for photos against a backdrop of flashing billboards and consulting pocket-size maps of the city, the looming storm thriving economic force that is Times Square appeared to be slowing.
Mr. Tyler said he had been instructed to discount tickets that he normally sold for $130 or more to $99 or less in an effort to attract buyers who were shying away because of the impending storm.
Contemplating such deals were tourists like Randy and Sherry Chapman, from Waterloo, Iowa, who had been planning their trip to New York for months and changed their flights to come in a day earlier when they heard news of the hurricane. They were scheduled to leave on a cruise on Wednesday, to the Caribbean - "where the storm came from," said Mr. Chapman, 56, with a chuckle - but did not know if the ship would leave on time.
"We're a little nervous," admitted Mrs. Chapman, 61. The couple wanted to visit the 9/11 Memorial and the Statue of Liberty, but their plans had fallen into disarray. "It just kind of depends on what the storm does."
"The storm might end up being the entertainment," Mr. Chapman said.
Around the square, street vendors and store owners predicted the tourist hub would empty out by this evening. At the Yankees Clubhouse Shop, signs in English and Spanish announced that the store would be closing early, at 4 p.m., because of Sandy. Walter Wells, who runs a souvenir T-shirt stand, said he and other vendors were planning to leave well before the subways were to close at 7 p.m. They usually stay out until about midnight.
Mr. Wells bemoaned the lack of foot traffic. "I mean, I got bills to pay," he said.
The TKTS booth was still doing a healthy business, though lines were shorter than usual. Agents near the line advised tourists that though shows would likely still go on Sunday evening, shows on Monday and Tuesday might be cancelled.
Then there were Donald and Terri Beak and their two children, who appeared relatively unconcerned as they wandered around the TKTS plaza, holding shopping bags from the M&M store. "We're English; we don't worry about things like that," said Mr. Beak, 48, referring to the hurricane. "We're used to rain and bad weather."
Though they felt slightly inconvenienced by the transit shutdown, worrying that they might have trouble getting back to the city from the New York Jets game this afternoon, they said they would be happy to ride out the storm at a shopping mall somewhere in New Jersey.
"We just don't think it's as bad as the TV's making it out to be," Mr. Beak said.
Mrs. Beak appeared willing to give the meteorologists a little more credit. "Better to be prepared, I guess," she said.

HEADLINE: Beyond Detroit's Economic Woes and Series Deficits

BYLINE: By BILL MORRIS

 BODY:
This is more like it. This is the kind of place that can turn a disastrous World Series around for a Detroit Tigers fan. It's called the Motor City Bar, tucked into a vale of saloons on Manhattan's Lower East Side, its walls covered with stuff guaranteed to thrum a native Detroiter's heart strings -- signs for Vernor's ginger ale, the Bob-Lo Boat, the Bridge to Canada. Bolted into the bar are the chrome nameplates of Detroit cars that are music to any gearhead's ears: Torino, Galaxie and Eldorado, Skylark and Valiant. The handles to the restroom doors are steering wheels from muscle cars. The only TV in the place is a battered little box perched on the bar. Enough said. 
Meeting me here for Game 3 -- a must win for the Tigers -- is fellow Detroiter Mark Binelli, who is about to publish a magnificent book called ''Detroit City Is the Place To Be: The Afterlife of an American Metropolis.'' It's a crackling rebuttal to ruin porn, those glossy coffee table books that fetishize Detroit's decay, bursting with pictures of the gutted Packard plant and Michigan Central Station and maybe, by way of piling on, a once-bustling thoroughfare like Gratiot Avenue, shot at midday, with not a car or a soul in sight, just the echoes of ghosts.
Such pictures don't lie -- Detroit is bristling with photogenic ruins and empty spaces -- but they tell only a fraction of the truth about the city where I grew up during its last hurrah and where Mark Binelli grew up during the first laps of its long decline. To his credit, Binelli looks beneath the clichés and writes about urban farmers, vigilantes, artists, entrepreneurs, autoworkers, activists, and a successful magnet school for pregnant teenagers and mothers. These are stories about the unquenchable energy that has convinced Binelli and me that something special is happening in our hometown, something way bigger than this so-far disappointing World Series.
In fact, as soon as the game begins and I buy a round of beers, I'm astonished to learn that Binelli, 42, has little appetite for the two staples of nearly every Detroiter's daily diet: cars and sports.
"There were a few perfunctory trips to Tiger Stadium when I was a kid because that's what Americans are supposed to do," says Binelli, the son of Italian immigrants. "I tried to make the effort to follow sports, but I was always faking it. I was never an obsessive car guy, either." He pauses as a dark thought clouds his face. "People from Detroit are going to turn against me when they find out I don't care about sports or cars."
Not likely. His book is the medicine our hometown needs right now. It's a clear-eyed look at promising recent developments, without any saccharine optimism. Amazing positive things are happening in Detroit these days. Unfortunately, they're not happening inside Comerica Park tonight. The Giants score two runs in the second inning and the Tiger bats remain as meek as the Yankee bats were a week ago during the American League Championship Series.
But I remind myself that this is, after all, just a baseball game. In his book Binelli dismisses claims that the fate of a sports team says something meaningful about a city, including this breathless slice of baloney from a CNN columnist: "History has shown that when the city's sports teams start doing well, it's a sign of healing in Detroit."
The Detroit Tigers are not doing well. As the game moves to the bottom of the ninth inning with the Giants still leading, 2-0, Binelli, a hard-wired optimist, says, "I think we're going to turn it around."
After the first two Detroit batters fly out, I say, "This was not meant to be." The final batter of the night proves me right by striking out.
Mark Binelli heads for the door with a shrug. "Sometimes," he says, "you get the feeling the fates are not aligned for these Tigers."
True words, spoken by a teller of important truths.
