HEADLINE: Cuomo Asks Panel to Consider Privatizing Horse Racing in State

BYLINE: By JAMES BARRON

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo plans to instruct his study group on horse racing to focus on whether the New York State Racing Association and Offtrack Betting Corporations throughout the state could be transferred to private ownership, state officials said yesterday.
Mr. Cuomo created the panel, the Commission on Racing in the 21st Century, in an attempt to recast the structure of racing in the state. He has made a target of the nonprofit racing association, saying among other things that its management is overpaid. The $261,000-a-year salary of its top official is twice the Governor's. 
 Mr. Cuomo said yesterday that the commission, which has held hearings in recent months in Albany and New York City, would "take a look at selling all of N.Y.R.A. and OTB to private groups, with the state to get a lump sum and then a stream of profits."
Mr. Cuomo said he would send the commission chairman, Vincent Tese, a letter this week describing what he wanted the commission to do about privatization, but Mr. Tese said that he and the Governor had already briefly discussed the idea of exploring the state's options.
"The Governor would like us to take a long, hard look at privatization, with the hope that we possibly could recommend it," Mr. Tese said yesterday. "There is a general feeling that the private sector could do better than the current configuration, but as to what should be privatized and what should not be privatized, that is still being explored."
Mr. Tese said that some members of the commission "have a bias toward exploring and privatizing the whole thing, and some members probably would like to see just the OTB's privatized."
The commission's recent hearings focused on how to stem the slide in racing's popularity. Racing association officials, who testified last month, proposed letting the race tracks take over off-track betting, as well as reducing the state tax on bets and trimming the winter racing season by six weeks.
Horse breeders, who had their turn before the commission on Dec. 3, assailed the racing association as an autocratic anachronism. They said it should be replaced by a state-supervised profit-seeking enterprise.
The Governor's fight with the racing association began when racing association officials balked at his plan to sell 23 acres of land at Aqueduct to the Port Authority for $40 million. Association officials changed their minds in July after Mr. Cuomo threatened to pack the association's board with his appointees.
Mr. Cuomo has long wanted to sell all or part of the 203-acre Aqueduct property, but it took this year's budget deficit and some cajoling on Mr. Cuomo's part to persuade the state Legislature and the racing association to go along with the deal.
The money came out of a $200 million Port Authority fund earmarked for economic development projects. Port Authority officials described the land purchase as a form of economic development because the land could be sold or leased to airport-related industries.
Even after the racing association agreed to the sale, Mr. Cuomo attacked executives of the association, saying the association's salaries and bonuses were excessive.

HEADLINE: Integrating Hartford;
State and Accusers Agree on the Goal For Schools, but Not on How to Get It

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WEST HARTFORD, Conn., Dec. 18

 BODY:
The first witnesses in a lawsuit seeking to integrate Hartford's public schools with those of its suburban neighbors began painting a grim picture of conditions in the schools of Connecticut's capital this week.
But what also began to emerge were the contradictions involved in a trial in which the defendant, the State of Connecticut, supports its accusers' goals on integration and improving education and is fighting only to avoid having a judge order what the state believes it should do itself. 
 While Connecticut's education officials are working on strategies to persuade towns to adopt voluntary integration plans that would cross municipal lines, lawyers for the state have little choice but to question the efficacy of higher spending and mandatory integration plans on overcoming the problems of inner-city schools.
The problems in the state's largest and most segregated school system, Hartford principals and administrators testified in Superior Court this week, are immense at every level. Many of the children are so poor -- nearly half are from families on welfare -- that they come to school hungry and ill-clothed.
 
Concentrated Poverty
 Many suffer from depression or other emotional problems or from the effects of premature birth or their mothers' drug addiction. Eighteen percent need special-education programs, and 20 percent need bilingual instruction, far higher percentages than in neighboring towns.
The children's need for special instructors, social workers and psychologists takes money from instruction, library books and supplies, principals testified. So many students are poor and either black or Hispanic -- minorities make up 92 percent of the enrollment -- that they have little sense of the open-ended world a few miles away that children in West Hartford or Farmington take for granted.
"Youngsters learn from one another, and I don't think they can aspire to something they don't have around them," said Donald Carso, the principal of McDonough School, which has 846 pupils in a 94-year-old main building, 14 portable classrooms and an antiquated annex four blocks away.
The testimony offers a comprehensive explanation for Hartford's shortcomings in academic achievement, programs, supplies and buildings, despite the city's spending more per-pupil than all but two of its suburbs: the burden of concentrated poverty.
 
Concern As Conditions Worsen
 And conditions are worsening for the city's 25,700 schoolchildren. In the last two years the schools have eliminated 40 teacher positions, all of their reading consultants, and dozens of other jobs. Scores on Connecticut's statewide mastery tests are declining. Some 3,000 children attend school in portable classrooms.
For the civil-rights lawyers presenting the case, called Sheff v. O'Neill, this gloomy portrait is proof that the racial and economic segregation in Hartford's schools deny children the equal educational opportunity guaranteed by the state's constitution.
It also leads toward an important conclusion for them: that these children cannot be offered an equal opportunity simply by spending even more money on them. What is left to be done? Integrate Hartford's children with their suburban neighbors, they say.
"The physical plant can be worked around," Mr. Carso said, when Judge Harry Hammer asked how important his school's physical shortcomings were. "The problem with our school is who's in it."
 
State Aid Stressed
 But for the lawyers defending the state, the picture is evidence of the web of social and economic factors, rather than intentional discrimination, that have divided metropolitan areas into largely white suburbs and mainly minority cities, into bands of wealth ringing the poor.
"There is no state in the country that does not have the kinds of problems that will be discussed in this case, but there is no state in the country that has pursued the objective of quality and integrated education as firmly," Assistant Attorney General John R. Whelan said in his opening statement on Wednesday.
As the portrait given by witnesses for the plaintiffs forms, detail by detail, nearly every stroke drawn by Mr. Whelan's questions seems to point far ahead, not to the issue of whether the despairing conditions in Hartford's schools are a great injustice or merely tragic, but to what more can possibly be done about them.
In cross-examining witnesses, he and a second assistant attorney general, Martha M. Watts, carefully draw out how much the state is already doing for Hartford.
The state provides 57 percent of the city's school budget, compared with 20 percent or less of many of its suburbs' budgets. This year, when financial pressures forced the state to cut school aid to most suburbs, and Hartford to cut its own spending, state aid to Hartford schools rose $4.4 million.
As Hartford educators describe special school programs that address the problems of poverty, from providing breakfast for every elementary pupil to getting more parents involved, the lawyers make sure the state gets credit for financially supporting them.
Betances School, for example, has a family resource center that offers all-day day care and adult education for its children's families. Ms. Watts asked the principal, Edna Negron, to read from the school's brochure describing the center.
"The state-funded center," she read, "proves once again that Connecticut is a leader in providing services to families."
The questions also suggest that the Hartford board of education, ultimately, has responsibility for how it spends its money.
This year, for example, the school board met a budget cut by eliminating reading consultants. But, Mr. Whelan asked the deputy superintendent, Charles Senteio, did not the board also continue a program for gifted and talented students, so that it chose that program, for a small number of children, over reading help for everyone?
 
Double-Edged State Strategy
 "Yes," Mr. Senteio said. "If you are now running 92-percent minority, what are the kinds of things you must provide to keep the people who could move out of the city?"
In bringing out these facts, and in later presenting testimony that court-ordered integration plans elsewhere have produced little improvement for minority students, the state's goal is to persuade the court that no judge, through an order addressing only schools, can correct enormous social problems and that the task is better left to the Legislature, local authorities and parents.
But in underlining how little effect the state's aid has had, Mr. Whelan also strengthens the case of the civil-rights lawyers that something more must be done.
At the same time, he is helping to complete a portrait of despair so deep that it could pose a daunting obstacle to the state's efforts to persuade towns to adopt integration plans voluntarily. Those efforts are based on the argument that integration will improve the education of suburban children as well as Hartford's.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Municipal Bond Issuers Are Learning to 'Detach'

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Peter Coffin, the municipal-bond portfolio manager at Massachusetts Financial Services in Boston, has the "detachable calls" from millions of dollars of bonds in his portfolios. And he would like to have millions more.
But the immediate future of this new financial product -- it is not a mobile phone -- seems to depend less on demand from him and other portfolio managers and more on the state, city and local government issuers of tax-exempt municipal bonds nationwide. 
 If these borrowers are willing to give up the call -- the protection against getting stuck with high-interest-rate bonds after interest rates fall -- then the brisk business that the State of New Jersey did in these detachable calls last week ought to become a regular part of the bond business.
"The big question is how receptive issuers will be to this," Mr. Coffin said.
 
Parts Exceed the Whole
 What is a call? It is an option to buy a bond in the future at a set price, such as in 10 years at a price of $102, $2 over the bond's face value. Issuers generally put such an option, or call, in their bonds so they can cut their borrowing costs if interest rates decline.
Much of the invention in financial markets involves taking a piece of a security and figuring how the security can be bought or sold if the piece is stripped off. Inherent in this is the sense that the sum of the parts is greater than the whole.
In the case of the detachable call, which has been around for only nine months, the innovation is just selling the option to someone else, leaving the issuer with a bond without a call.
Based on the results of the sale last week of the detachable calls on $86 million of New Jersey bonds due in 2013, the two parts -- the bond and the detachable call -- got a better price than just a bond without any call in it originally.
As part of the $1.8 billion bond sale, New Jersey also sold bonds due in 2011 that did not have a call. They were priced to yield 6.07 percent. The bond due in 2013 with the detachable call was priced to yield 6.15. Then the detachable calls were sold for 11 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point. So the net cost to the state was 6.04 percent, 3 basis points less than the bond that was sold originally without any call.
But the inventor of the detachable call, Jeff Holt, first vice president and head of new products for the municipal department at Paine Webber, warned that this advantage in selling a detachable call versus a bond without a call was likely to disappear as investors learned more.
"It might work for the next year or six months, but that yield will have to go away," he said.
 
Advance Refunding
 He said he did not initially intend that the detachable call be sold at the time of issue of the bonds, leaving the issuers with a noncallable bond. The idea, he said, was to give the issuer long-term flexibility and allow it, when interest rates declined, to be able to gain the same savings using the detachable call that an issuer can now get with what is called an advance refunding.
In an advance refunding, an issuer borrows money at lower interest rates to pay off existing higher-interest-rate bonds. The existing bonds are paid off by setting up an escrow account and buying Treasury securities that are used to redeem the old bonds at the date they are callable.
Mr. Holt argues that selling the detachable calls in the future will achieve the same kind of savings for issuers, without going through the process or costs of an advance refunding. In addition, he said, issuers, like airports and ports, which are now prohibited from doing advance refundings, would be able to sell the detachable calls and achieve similar savings.
A lot of what actually will happen is still unclear, however. It is Mr. Holt's computer models that show the savings from selling the detachable calls. Only one other sale of detachable calls besides New Jersey's has been held; that was by the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia last month. And both of these sales have been at the time of issue.
None of the more than $3 billion of bonds that Paine Webber and other firms have underwritten with the language needed for the issuer to sell the calls has been around long enough for an issuer to be in a position to decide if it is worth trying to sell them. The first detachable call was appended by Paine Webber to a $67.3 million Las Vegas, Nev., bond issue in April.
In addition, many legal issues are still unclear. In some states, including Nevada, legislation must be approved to allow the sale of detachable calls. More important, the Treasury is still pondering how it wants to approach this new financial product. The Treasury could open the door or it could limit it, depending on how it decides to treat the sale of a detachable call.
One main issue is the impact on the tax-exempt municipal bond market, where the Treasury has sought for years to limit issuance because of the revenue the Government loses.
Still, Mr. Coffin of Massachusetts Financial Services loves detachable calls. He bought close to half the detachable calls on the $70 million of bonds issued by the Georgia utility and about a third of the calls on the $86 million in bonds sold by New Jersey on Thursday.
The detachable calls help him even out the volatility in his portfolio, which comes from the fact that so many of the municipal bonds he owns give the issuer the option to redeem them, generally after 10 years.
What the presence of the detachable calls do for his portfolio is this: The movement in the prices of his bonds is varied because some include traditional calls held by the issuer and a few do not. Because of the risk of the call, when interest rates decline, the price of a bond without a call will rise, for example, 10 percent, while the price of a bond with a call will rise 7 percent. But if interest rates rise -- which means a bond is less likely to be called -- the price of both callable and noncallable bonds drops about 10 percent.
The addition of the detachable calls, which have their own value that moves with interest rates, help him gain back the three percentage points he loses on callable bonds when interest rates rise.

HEADLINE: Report Sees Sewer-Plant Threat to L.I. Sound

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: STAMFORD, Conn., Dec. 19

 BODY:
Long Island Sound is a vital but ecologically troubled estuary, threatened by pollution that pours into it every day from sewage-treatment plants, according to a preliminary report issued this week on a seven-year study of the Sound.
The report recommends limiting the amount of nitrogen that flows from sewage plants into the Sound, a proposal that some say would stifle development in surrounding communities. Up to $8.1 billion may have to be spent to limit the nitrogen releases, the report says. 
 Describing the Sound as "perhaps the most important estuary in the nation," the study warns that because of intensive use, "the water quality of the Sound and its suitability for human enjoyment, commercial use and as a habitat for fish and wildlife is threatened."
The report, titled "The Long Island Sound Study Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan," is the culmination of a seven-year study initiated by the Federal Environmental Protection Agency. A series of public hearings will be held before a final report is issued.
 
Business Groups Concerned
 The report's proposal to limit sewage-treatment plant discharges is troubling to many municipalities and businesses, which fear those limits would unfairly curb development and lead to a virtual halt on construction as communities seek to discourage new sewage hook-ups.
The proposed limits on sewage discharges drew fire on Thursday at a public meeting in Stamford on the plan, reviving a debate over whether environmental concerns are incompatible with economic priorities.
"We are not so desperate as to stifle the one stimulant to this economy that will not only get us out of this recession, but is vital to human needs," said Gerald D. Lloyd, representing the Westchester County Chamber of Commerce and a builders' group. The limits proposed in the report, he said, "will result in a de facto moratorium on construction."
But members of a panel leading the discussion said there would be no moratorium.
Other environmental experts said the release of nitrogen, a byproduct of sewage treatment, could be controlled in several ways, either through costly technology or simply through increasing public awareness of the problem. Too much nitrogen in the water deprives it of oxygen, creating a condition called hypoxia that can kill fish and other marine life.
 
Call for Conservation
 "There are nutrient-removal technologies that can remove nitrogen from waste water prior to discharging it into the Sound," said Sarah Clark, a staff scientist with the Environmental Defense Fund in Manhattan. "Water conservation is another very cost-effective way of not only reducing nitrogen, but also bringing down the burden on sewage treatment plants."
The management plan also discusses land-use issues, although the study only recently began to consider that aspect and will issue another report on the topic next year.
"This is a new way of doing business -- managing Long Island Sound as an ecosystem," said Mark Tedesco, who heads the Long Island Sound Office of the Federal Environmental Protection Agency in Stamford, one of several set up to coordinate the $15 million study.
The study called hypoxia "the most serious unaddressed problem impacting Long Island Sound." It recommends first limiting any increases in the amount of nitrogen released, and then actually reducing it.
 
Seeking Federal Aid
 Other recommendations include controlling toxics and disease-causing organisms that are frequently released into the Sound, through industrial sewers or mishaps in municipal sewage systems.
Grants available through the Federal Clean Water Act and state revolving funds could help pay for major programs like upgrading sewage-treatment plants, panel members said. "The cost will be an obstacle only if the Federal Government and the states don't step up to their responsibility to pitch in," said Donald S. Strait, executive director of the Connecticut Fund for the Environment. "If the burden is shared, then I think we can have a clean Sound without putting a terrific burden on any municipality."

HEADLINE: GLOOMY PROSPECTS SEEN FOR GROWTH WORLDWIDE IN '93

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
The world economy will grow far more sluggishly next year than was predicted just a few months ago, economists say, because of a surprisingly deep slump in Europe and Japan.
The economists say the situation will not only hurt American exports and make it harder for the American economy to pick up speed, but could also force President-elect Bill Clinton to concentrate more on short-term measures to stimulate the economy rather than on the long-term efforts he says are needed to put it back on track. The sluggish growth, they add, may also compel him to push Japan and Germany to do more to promote growth. 
 The overseas slump, they say, could mean the difference between respectable growth in the United States next year, with unemployment falling substantially, and another lackluster year with the jobless rate hovering above 7 percent.
 
German Recession Gets Blame
 In a forecast to be released Tuesday, the International Monetary Fund says growth in the industrial world will be 2 percent next year, considerably below the respectable 3 percent it predicted just three months ago. The report says that largely because of a recession in Germany, growth in Western Europe will be a feeble 1 percent, with the jobless rate climbing to almost 11 percent.
The Washington-based Institute for International Economics says the global slump may reduce American exports by $20 billion next year and cause employment to grow by 400,000 fewer jobs than previously predicted. When growth falters abroad, foreign businesses buy fewer American-made goods.
"A lot of people are predicting that the United States will have 3 percent growth next year, but I don't believe that, because most people haven't factored in a further deterioration in our trade balance caused by the weakness overseas," said C. Fred Bergsten, director of the institute.
Because Europe's and Japan's economies have run out of steam, many experts say, it is now up to the United States to power the world economy. "The world needs a strong and sustainable U.S. recovery," Michel Camdessus, the managing director of the International Monetary Fund, said in a speech on Thursday.
Although the American economy remains in ragged shape after three years of anemic growth, the outlook for it appears more robust than that for other large industrial nations. The I.M.F. predicts that the American economy will grow by about 3 percent next year, compared with 1 percent for Germany. In September, 2.6 percent growth was estimated for Germany. The growth forecast for Japan next year has been cut to 2.5 percent from the 3.8 percent predicted in September.
 
Higher Taxes and Less Spending
 In blunt advice to Mr. Clinton, Mr. Camdessus said that for the United States to have a strong, sustained economic expansion, it should cut the Federal budget deficit soon through tax increases and spending cuts. He acknowledged that cutting the deficit could be painful, but he said it would increase business confidence and reduce long-term interest rates.
"Past experience shows that the costs of such action are small and temporary, while the benefits are considerable and long lasting," Mr. Camdessus said.
The President-elect has said he plans to focus on the domestic economy, but foreign economic problems could force him and Lloyd M. Bentsen, his nominee for Treasury Secretary, to focus on the international economic scene.
Mr. Clinton and Mr. Bentsen could soon find themselves in the same frustrating position as President Bush and his Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady: imploring Germany's fiercely independent central bank to lower its interest rates, only to have their entreaties ignored.
 
Short-Term Rate Increased
 Eager to lower Germany's 4 percent inflation rate to less than 2 percent, the Bundesbank has increased its key short-term interest rate to 9.5 percent. This has plunged Germany into recession and is strangling growth throughout Western Europe. It is also casting a shadow on countries of the former Soviet bloc, hurting their efforts to increase exports.
Mr. Bentsen has talked vaguely about the need for increased international cooperation, and many economists say that will probably mean renewed pressures on Germany and the Bundesbank.
Mr. Bush's international economic team "made a career running into that brick wall," said Rudiger Dornbusch, an economics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. "It would be a mistake for the new Administration to break its teeth on the Bundesbank."
He predicted that the overseas slump would cause American growth to be five-tenths of a percentage point lower next year than it would have been without such a slump.
 
Pressure on Kohl
 Many economists suggest that Mr. Clinton will press Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany to reduce Bonn's bloated budget deficit, a move that would give the Bundesbank more leeway to cut rates. Mr. Clinton's doing this might prove more compelling -- and less hypocritical -- if he first puts his own economic house in order by cutting the Federal deficit.
"There's a significant chance that the Bundesbank is looking for an excuse to reduce rates, and if there was some external coordination, some movement abroad, that just might do it," said Mr. Bergsten, the Washington-based international economist.
Mr. Clinton's economic team is also expected to nudge Japan to speed up its growth, which is snail like by that nation's postwar standards. Japan's central bank has cut its rates, and the Government has promised a huge public works program to create jobs.
 
Japan 'Dead in the Water'
 "Japan remains dead in the water," Mr. Bergsten said. "I think it will be easy to pressure them to do more than that."
He sees a possible rebirth for international economic cooperation in which the American Government approves an important deficit reduction plan, Bonn does likewise and Germany's and Japan's central banks agree to cut interest rates.
One wild card for the United States is the dollar. Some economists fear it could soar if the Federal Reserve raises rates in response to faster American growth and if Germany's central bank reduces rates to lift Germany out of recession. Higher American rates would attract more money from foreign investors, helping push up the dollar.
A far stronger dollar could hurt American exports, as it did in the early Reagan years. Economists say cutting the Federal budget deficit might help keep the dollar from soaring because it should in theory lead to lower interest rates.

In the 1940's, a young artist, Samella Sanders Lewis, traveled to the Bayou Teche region of Louisiana to document the life of black sugar workers. "These were people trapped in a system that wasn't even a sharecropper system: it was beneath that," said Ms. Lewis, now 68 years old and living in Los Angeles.
"I needed a voice and they needed a voice," she continued. "I had things I needed to say about the social situation at that time. There was a hurt inside of me that I could not get rid of unless I understood it a little better." 
 The lithographs Ms. Lewis produced are included in a joint exhibition, "Alone in a Crowd: Prints of the 1930's and 1940's by African-American Artists From the Collection of Reba and Dave Williams," which opened on Dec. 11 in Manhattan at the Equitable Gallery at the Equitable Center, 787 Seventh Avenue, at 52d Street, and in New Jersey at the Newark Museum.
The exhibition, which continues through Feb. 27, comprises 150 prints by 41 artists from the Williamses' collection of more than 3,500 American prints, most of which are works made between the world wars. Mr. Williams is the chairman of Alliance Capital Management, an investment-management concern.
 
'We Were a New People'
 Like Ms. Lewis, many artists in the exhibition concentrated on creating realistic images of black people and their social condition. The documentary impulse ran strong at the time, long before the first stirrings of the civil rights movement, when black Americans felt ignored and abandoned, and when their visual representation lay in the hands of Madison Avenue and Hollywood.
"We were a new people, a new race, in a hostile country, and as a new people, identityless, we had to first define what we looked like," said Leslie King-Hammond, the dean of graduate studies at the Maryland Institute College of Art, who wrote the main catalogue essay for the exhibition.
"If we had not discovered that," she said, "we could not have given rise to the Jacob Lawrences and Romare Beardens and Adrian Pipers."
For many black artists, opportunity came either through employment by the Works Progress Administration or through courses at community art centers, like the Harlem Recreation Art Center, established by the program, and the W.P.A.'s graphics workshop in Philadelphia, where the printmaker Dox Thrash created a new etching technique. Using Carborundum, a grinding and polishing agent, he modified lithograph stones to create rich, velvety forms.
 
Cataloguing Black Artwork
 "For black communities, this was one of the most vital periods, because the Government had set up institutions where students could come to study and work," said Ms. Hammond-King, who has for several years been cataloguing artwork done by blacks under the W.P.A., much of it still languishing in cardboard boxes at the National Archives and at local libraries and government buildings across the country.
Given access to teachers and materials, young black printmakers set about describing rural life in the South, the great migration northward to the factories, the black experience in the military during World War II and the harsh living conditions of most black Americans.
Some printmakers celebrated the achievements of black Americans, depicting inspirational figures from black history or describing black contributions to music and dance, but most of the prints in the exhibition reflect a particularly bleak period for blacks.
"Remember, we did not have our Little Rock, and there was no Jackie Robinson in baseball," said Robert Blackburn, 72, who became a printmaker at the Harlem Recreation Art Center and for the last 30 years has served as director of the Printmaking Workshop in Manhattan. "It was really a cry into the night that we were expressing."
 
Isolation and Employment
 In his lithograph "Streetcar Scene" (1945), John Woodrow Wilson depicted a black worker, lunch box on his lap and a Boston Navy Yard badge on his overalls, riding the streetcar surrounded by white women. The print reflects a giant step forward for blacks in America.
"After the soldiers went off to war, women were recruited to work in factories, and eventually, the defense industries began recruiting black people, who were unemployable before," said Mr. Wilson, now 70 and still working as an artist in his native Boston. "On my street, everybody was on welfare in the 30's. Suddenly, blacks became welders."
 
'I Had to Invent It'
 The print also expresses a mood of isolation that Mr. Wilson says he felt acutely as a black artist. "There was nothing in my formal education that introduced me to a black artist doing art, or examples of art by black people with black images that was important," he said. "There was no precedent for using images of black people, so I had to invent it for myself."
Elizabeth Catlett, 73, is represented by a print series on the plight of black women, who, she said, "had been very neglected in art outside of nudes."
Like several other black artists, Ms. Catlett was deeply influenced by the work of the Mexican muralists Diego Rivera and David Siqueiros. In 1946, she applied for a grant to study at the Taller de Grafica Popular, a cooperative printmaking studio in Cuernavaca, Mexico, where she has lived ever since.
"Black artists heard a parallel voice in the Mexican muralists," Ms. King-Hammond said. "Those who won travel grants often elected to go to Mexico instead of Europe. Besieged by similar problems, they used the Mexican experience to see how they might seek resolutions in their own work."
 
Looking to Africa
 Other artists looked to Africa for a visual language. William McBride, who discovered African art when looking at textile designs in a British magazine, incorporated African design elements and African masks into his silk-screen prints. Such artists as Hughie Lee-Smith and William H. Johnson used the visual language of European modernism to interpret black experience. "We were trying to find a voice and find a place," Mr. Blackburn said.
"When I look back on it," Mr. Wilson said, "I guess what I was trying to do was make the invisible man visible, to build into these images such power and impact that you couldn't ignore them. I guess that's what I've been doing all my life."

HEADLINE: No Magic in Bank Deregulation

 BODY:
Apply for a loan now, and you'll automatically be entered in our FREE LOAN GIVEAWAY. You could win a FREE LOAN -- borrow up to $15,000 and NEVER pay it back!
Dear Mr. Clinton:  
 Think about this ad placed by a large Wichita, Kan., bank in local newspapers. The bank put up a pot of gold worth $15,000 to lure would-be borrowers. Apparently this bank was perfectly willing to lend more money, but couldn't find many takers during these recessionary times.
The bank's discovery doesn't square with some of the statements made at last week's Little Rock economic conference. Bankers promised to pump billions of dollars of new loans into the economy if only you would ease the amount of reserves banks are required to hold and waive other costly regulations. The new loans, they argued, would jump-start the sluggish economy -- and not cost Congress a dime.
The proposition sounded wondrous -- and it certainly grabbed your imagination. But, as the ad suggests, bank deregulation is no magic elixir.
To see why, recall the elegant testimony provided by Robert Solow and James Tobin. These economists showed that the current high unemployment rate is caused by too little spending. The answer is to stimulate the economy with temporary -- so as not to drive up the long-term deficit -- spending hikes and tax cuts.
As long as consumers aren't buying very much, they won't want to borrow very much. Neither will businesses who aren't selling very much. So giving banks more incentive to lend won't accomplish very much.
That said, there is reason for your administration to review bank regulations passed by Congress last year. Some are wasteful, some even absurd. For example, it took more than 250 pages pages to translate Congress's will into regulations governing how banks would be allowed to advertise interest rates on deposits. And there wasn't much of a problem to begin with.
There is also reason, as Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman David Mullins pointed out last week, to believe that regulations are unnecessarily steering banks away from small-business loans.
Carefully pruning regulations to make financial markets work better makes a lot of sense. But hasty deregulation for the purpose of manipulating the unemployment rate is foolhardy. If your administration tries, it will risk replaying the savings and loan debacle.

HEADLINE: The Case for the Colorado Boycott

 BODY:
Deciding where to go for a skiing vacation ordinarily poses no moral dilemma. But this winter it surely does. Colorado, site of some of the finest ski areas in the nation, adopted a bigoted anti-gay initiative last month, shattering the state's reputation for tolerance. Gay groups and others are urging a boycott; their call deserves to be heeded.
Admittedly, an economic boycott is not a precision weapon. Targeting Colorado's $5 billion tourist industry stands to hurt not just the unenlightened, but also the progressive towns of Denver, Aspen, and Boulder, where most voters opposed the anti-gay amendment. 
 But that is no reason to let Colorado off the hook. A successful boycott can help energize the most progressive Coloradans to overturn their new law. And it would send a potent warning to other states that may soon consider similar measures.
When it takes effect next month, Colorado's Amendment 2 will void existing civil rights protections in jobs and housing for gay men and lesbians in Denver, Aspen and Boulder and will bar other localities from passing such ordinances. That puts Colorado a big step behind even states like New York, which has no statewide gay rights law but allows cities and towns to enact their own protective ordinances. The Colorado law amounts to an aggressive statewide policy to allow discrimination and block attempts to mitigate it.
Legal challenges to Amendment 2 are under way. Meanwhile, homosexual Coloradans live in fear, with gay-bashing incidents rising steeply. And forces of intolerance aligned with Pat Robertson's Christian Coalition are already working to put Colorado-style initiatives on the ballot by 1994 in at least eight other states: California, Idaho, Maine, Minnesota, Missouri, Ohio, Oregon and Washington.
The boycott's prospects are uncertain. Barbra Streisand's vocal support has ignited a civil war in the Hollywood film community -- leaving the impression that some top entertainers care a lot about civil rights, except when it interferes with their Aspen vacation plans.
But momentum appears to be building. Several big-city mayors, including those of New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and Atlanta, have now endorsed the boycott, and the U.S. Conference of Mayors has just pulled its annual meeting from Colorado Springs next June.
Mayor Wellington Webb of Denver, a longtime supporter of gay rights who opposes the boycott, pleads that Colorado is merely the first "casualty" of a broader assault by the Christian right. He warns that the clever stealth strategy used in Colorado -- depicting basic anti-discrimination protections for homosexuals in housing and employment as unjustified "special rights" -- is likely to have even greater appeal in other states with less tolerant traditions.
It's easy to sympathize with Mr. Webb's plight. But a successful boycott could help reverse the tide. The boycott is a legitimate weapon in a democratic society and, historically, one of the most effective.

How Clinton Is Doing 

BYLINE: By WILLIAM SAFIRE

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When Ed Koch was Mayor of New York, he would plunge into the subways to ask riders "How'm I doin'?" (His Beijing look-alike, Zhu Rongji, is doin' fine.)
How does Bill Clinton after two-thirds of the interregnum? My criteria are his Cabinet choices, his economic outreach and last week's news conference. 
 1. Thirteen Yes-Persons and a Multiculturalist. Eisenhower's Cabinet was called "Eight Millionaires and a Plumber"; Lord Grenville's star-studded Government, after the death in 1806 of William Pitt, was dubbed "the Ministry of All the Talents" (changed within a year to "all the hacks"). What conclusions can we draw about the coming Clinton administration from the Cabinet choices so far?
"I didn't want a Cabinet of strangers," he says. In a sense, that's a pity; the stranger in the Nixon Cabinet was George Shultz at Labor, who turned out to be the best of the bunch. Clinton's Labor choice, Robert Reich, abandoned his intrusive idea of mandatory job-training spending by business within a week of his nomination, a sensible if gutless retreat; we can hope he is more stalwart about espousing free trade. (Organized labor got its feeble payoff with a protectionist Council of Economic Advisers.)
The Bentsen-Altman team at Treasury along with the Panetta-Rivlin duo at Budget and Ron Brown at Commerce offer a clear indication that Ross Perot's message got through: working with Congress to reduce the deficit is the top priority, which is a good thing. To appear to offer economic stimulus, Clinton will spread about some roads-and-bridges pork under the name of "infrastructure investment," but that is only to get credit for the recovery that is taking place on its own; it will hardly offset the $15 billion in tax refunds that George Bush handed out a year early.
Democratic lefties will get their share of rhetoric and symbolism, more important to them than real money. The sop to the liberal Cerberus is Donna Shalala, reputed high priestess of political correctness, whose multicultural passion will be harmless enough if accompanied by the promised health and welfare reforms.
The leaked intention of nominating a woman (preferably with a law degree) to be Attorney General is blatantly sexist; I hope it is offset by nominating a man to be Treasurer of the U.S., which would be a modern first. (Hang the cost of putting in a men's room at the Mint.) The only group not given its quota so far is Republicans; I'd like to see Carla Hills at the State Department, but that, along with the N.S.C., is supposedly set for Carter II.
Will the Senate's prim Tower Rule be applied to the Clinton choices? The first Republican to drag sex practice or preference into the confirmation hearings will get a zap from us partisans of privacy, but at least a couple of the newcomers can expect to be roughed up; Clinton properly warned of going "beyond the Pale."
2. The Little Rock Economic Seminar. The object was to show "the Presidency is in the details," like God and the Devil; the televised wonkmanship was an exercise in public involvement, and the President-elect succeeded in showing the world he can stay awake through a morning meeting.
3. News Conference Preparation. In last week's introduction of Henry Cisneros, Clinton quietly launched his '96 campaign against Jack Kemp, describing HUD as "an agency that badly needs reform and revitalization."
Asked about the murder of Israeli soldiers followed by the two-year expulsion of members of the Hamas terrorist group, Clinton avoided the standard State Department Arabism. He said: "I share the anger and the frustration and the outrage of the Israeli people . . . on the other hand, I am concerned that this deportation may go too far . . ." We'll see if his choice for Secretary of State veers back to knee-jerk condemnation of Israel.
To an astute question about the wisdom of appointing a veterans' advocate to head Veterans Affairs, Clinton argued that with a couple of veterans lobbyists in charge, he will be better able to get "a serious attempt at eligibility reform." That means he expects the former lobbyists to sell out their constituency by denying expected health benefits. Either Clinton is kidding himself or us.
How's he doing? Our next President is practicing safe politics. He runs the risk of running no risk.

Preserving Tissue in Deep Freeze

BYLINE: By Edmund L. Andrews

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
THE science of preserving human body parts in deep freeze took a modest step forward last week, when a small Georgia company patented a method for preparing tissue so that it has a better chance of surviving after being thawed.
The method of storing body parts for later use at about 200 degrees below zero Centigrade already constitutes a small business. The technology is nowhere near advanced enough to preserve entire organs, much less to bring about the more lurid science-fiction schemes of storing terminally ill people until cures for their diseases are developed. 
But the method is already being used to preserve and recycle human heart valves and veins used in heart surgery, and it forms the basis for a small service business for Cryolife Inc. of Marietta, Ga. The company stores about 200 heart valves every month, as well as a smaller number of veins that can be used in heart bypass operations. These are removed from people who have just died and are typically thawed for a new recipient within a few weeks.
"The problem is that cells become metabolically depleted, because they are coming from a person who has died," explained Kelvin G. M. Brockbank, head of research at Cryolife. That depletion reduces the chances that a heart valve can be used after it is thawed. "What we do," Dr. Brockbank said, "is give them an opportunity to correct that problem before they are frozen."
He and another researcher, John F. Carpenter, patented what amounts to a special feeding program. Technicians place the heart valve or vein in a dish containing a rich mixture of nutrients and keep it at normal body temperature for at least six hours before freezing it.
He and Mr. Carpenter received patent 5,171,660.
 
Possible Application For 'Buckyballs'
 Researchers at Bell Laboratories have patented one of the first potential applications for "buckyballs," the unusual carbon molecules that are shaped like soccer balls and have fascinated scientists around the world since they were discovered a few years ago.
"Buckyball" is the nickname for a molecule consisting of 60 carbon atoms that are connected in a perfectly symmetrical globe made of hexagons and pentagons. Because the structure closely resembles the geodesic dome developed by R. Buckminster Fuller, scientists formally named the newly discovered molecules "buckminsterfullerenes" and almost universally refer to them in casual parlance as buckyballs.
What fascinates scientists is that buckyballs look exactly the same from all sides, and many believe this symmetry makes them useful for creating a host of innovative compounds. Buckyballs can also be used to make superconductors -- capable of transmitting electricity with virtually no resistance -- though thus far only at colder temperatures than the ceramic materials discovered around 1987.
Last week, three researchers at Bell Labs patented what could be the first practical application. Led by Arthur Heber, a specialist in superconductors, the group discovered that buckyballs convert light into electricity, making them potentially useful for opto-electronic switches used in fiber-optic communications and ultrafast light-based computers.
In one example, Dr. Heber said, he and his colleagues made a thin-film sandwich of buckyballs between two layers of metal. Shining a low-power laser on one side induced a thousandfold increase in electrical current on the other. The scientists also put buckyballs in a water solution, and upon exposing it to light, produced a big jump in electrical voltage.
The inventors believe this may open the door to a wide range of high-speed switches that convert light to electricity -- and vice versa -- more easily than is now possible.
"The challenge is to make it economic and competitive," Dr. Heber said . "It's still very much in the research stage." He and two other researchers, Barry Miller and William L. Wilson, received patent 5,171,373.
 
A New Container For Chilling Liquids
 By reducing air pressure to lower the boiling point of water, Israel Siegel of North Miami, Fla., has invented a self-cooling container that uses no electricity or Freon.
The invention is based on the fact that the boiling temperature of water drops sharply if the air pressure around it is lowered as well. In a vacuum, water will boil -- and thus give off its heat -- even if it is below room temperature.
The container features two chambers, one that holds the liquid to be cooled and a second that features a desiccant, a compound that absorbs vapor. Air is pumped out of the entire container, but vapor created by the liquid initially keeps pressure and boiling temperature at normal levels in the first chamber.
To cool the liquid, a person presses a button that opens up a pipe connecting the two chambers. The desiccant, which can be calcium sulfate, essentially sucks vapor out of the first chamber and almost instantly lowers the pressure of the second chamber. The liquid boils, the heat is sucked with the new vapor into the second chamber and, the inventor said, the liquid chills to refrigerator temperature in about 30 seconds.
Dr. Siegel received patent 5,168,708.
 Patents are available by number for $3 from the Patent and Trademark Office, Washington, D.C. 20231.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 23, 1992, Wednesday

 CORRECTION:
The Patents column in Business Day on Monday missidentified an inventor at Bell Laboratories who patented a new application for carbon molecules known as Buckminsterfullerenes. He is Arthur Hebard. The article also omitted the name of one inventor; he is Joseph M. Rosamilia.

CLINTON CHOOSES 2 AND DEPLORES IDEA OF CABINET QUOTAS

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 21

 BODY:
At a news conference where he named two more members of his Cabinet, President-elect Bill Clinton lashed out at women's groups who had been complaining about the pace of appointing women, calling them "bean counters" who were more interested in quotas than competence.
His comments came as he announced the appointment of Hazel R. O'Leary, a 55-year-old power company executive from Minnesota, to be Energy Secretary, and former Gov. Richard W. Riley of South Carolina, 59, as Education Secretary. 
 In Mrs. O'Leary, Mr. Clinton turned to a former regulator in the Ford and Carter Administrations who is familiar with Washington's power brokers but whose own views are not widely known. And in Mr. Riley, he chose a champion of education reform with a knack for getting the changes he wants. [Profiles, page B9.]
 
Defending Appointments
 Responding to questions at today's news conference about the complaints from the women's groups, Mr. Clinton voiced sharp displeasure with those who have criticized his Cabinet selection process.
At the same time, he defended his decision to pass over a white man who had been the leading candidate for the energy post, Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, as part of his effort to assemble a more diverse Cabinet.
Friends of Mr. Wirth said he had been promised the job several weeks ago and had accepted. But the pressure for sexual and racial balance apparently slowed the process of choosing a Cabinet, and gave Mr. Wirth's enemies an opening.
In a candid discussion today, Mr. Clinton said he was particularly unhappy that two of his appointees -- Laura D'Andrea Tyson as chairwoman of the Council of Economic Advisers and Carol M. Browner as administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency -- were being treated by some women's advocates as less important than other appointees because their jobs were not in the Cabinet.
"I believe that if I had appointed white men to those jobs, those people, those same people would have been counting those jobs in a very negative way," he said. "They would have been counting those positions against our Administration, those bean counters who are doing that, if I had appointed white men to those positions."
As recently as this month Mr. Clinton said he intended to raise the head of the E.P.A. to Cabinet level. He has not said whether the administrator would actually become a Cabinet member or simple attend Cabinet meetings.
 
Third Black Nominee
 Gesturing toward Mrs. O'Leary, who is black, he said that no women's group or black group had included her name as a recommended Cabinet choice. Mrs. O'Leary is the third black Mr. Clinton has chosen for a senior position.
Aides said Mr. Clinton was close to selecting a black Agriculture Secretary as well. Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi, a leading candidate, met with Mr. Clinton on Sunday.
The President-elect must also choose an Interior Secretary and Attorney General before turning to national security appointments. Former Gov. Bruce Babbitt of Arizona is the leading choice for Interior.
Mr. Clinton is considering several women to be Attorney General and transition aides said he asked the person at the top of his list, Judge Patricia M. Wald of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to reconsider her decision to remove herself from consideration.
As for national security positions, Representative Les Aspin is expected to be named Defense Secretary and Warren M. Christopher, the transition director, is expected to become Secretary of State.
Transition officials said Former Gov. Madeleine M. Kunin of Vermont had emerged as a candidate for ambassador to the United Nations, another position that aides have said could be elevated to Cabinet level..
Mr. Clinton has been under pressure in recent days to increase the number of women he appoints. In a letter to Mr. Clinton, Eleanor Smeal, President of the Fund for a Feminist Majority, called on the President-elect to "shatter the glass ceiling" and surpass President Bush's record of appointing three women to Cabinet positions.
Mr. Clinton said today he expected to name more than three women to his Cabinet and added that he felt his critics should consider the influence of his appointees as well as their number.
"I have sought to give the American people a Cabinet that would be both more diverse in terms of numbers, but far more powerful in terms of substantive impact than ever before," he said. "And I may be wrong about this, but I think, unlike some people who are apparently commenting on this in public, that both issues are important."
To tamp down the growing displeasure of some women's groups, Vernon E. Jordan, the transition chairman, met with several of their representatives in Washington today. Some have complained that Donna E. Shalala, Mr. Clinton's choice to head the Health and Human Services Department, was the only woman he had chosen to run a Cabinet-level department.
As for naming more minority members to top posts, Mr. Clinton said today that a "distinct possibility" existed that there would be Hispanic nominees in addition to former Mayor Henry G. Cisneros of San Antonio, whom he has chosen to head the Department of Housing and Urban Development.
In naming Mrs. O'Leary to run the Energy Department, Mr. Clinton turned aside Mr. Wirth, who had all but been offered the job.
But, Mr. Clinton contended, "It is absolutely untrue that his appointment was nixed, if you will, by any interest group contacting me or by anybody within my transition operation."
Some Senate Republicans, including John McCain of Arizona and Phil Gramm of Texas, indicated in recent days that they would oppose Mr. Wirth's appointment and try to tie him to irregularities in the savings and loan industry.
Mr. Clinton said he expected to offer Mr. Wirth another post. But in a statement from Mr. Wirth's office that was phrased in the congratulatory tone of the gracious loser, he indicated that he would pass on this offer.
"For several months, my name has been mentioned as a possible Cabinet nominee," he said. "I would have been pleased to serve, but am equally pleased to be returning to private life." He offered his congratulation to Mrs. O'Leary, whom he called a "wise and prudent choice."

HEADLINE: New Energy Chief Has Seen 2 Sides of Regulatory Fence

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton's choice of Hazel R. O'Leary, a little-known executive with a Minnesota utility, to lead the Department of Energy was bound to please groups that had been looking for more women and blacks in his Cabinet. But it may take longer for energy producers, marketers, environmental groups and the Energy Department's biggest constituency -- the military and the nuclear weapons industry -- to see how they feel.
Mrs. O'Leary, a 55-year-old former regulator in the Ford and Carter Administrations who later worked in an energy-consulting firm, fits the developing mold of the Clinton Administration: she is familiar with Washington's power brokers in her field. Still, her own views are not widely known. 
 She has been executive vice president for corporate affairs at the Northern States Power Company for the last three and a half years, overseeing the company's legal and personnel departments, environmental affairs, public relations and lobbying.
 
Weeks of Intense Lobbying
 Mrs. O'Leary became Mr. Clinton's choice only after several weeks of intense lobbying that dimmed and then sank the prospects of several more prominent candidates, including Senator Tim Wirth, Democrat of Colorado, who decided not to run for a second term this year and had been regarded as the early front-runner for the energy post.
Many of the commentators and Washington power brokers who had been handicapping the selection process had expected Mr. Wirth or some other widely known figure to be tapped because transition officials had been suggesting that Mr. Clinton was planning to give the Energy Department a more prominent role.
Mrs. O'Leary's sudden emergence apparently surprised her employers as much as Washington insiders. Just last week Northern Power announced several executive changes, including her appointment as president in charge of its natural gas operations. That assignment was to begin on Jan. 1.
A company spokeswoman said last night that it was unclear whether Mrs. O'Leary would start the new company assignment pending confirmation of her appointment by Congress.
The Energy Department, a bureaucracy with almost 18,000 employees, had been relegated to the background in the Reagan and Bush Administrations after initial proposals to eliminate it entirely. Mr. Clinton is said to want the department to spearhead efforts to make industry more efficient and cleaner, to create jobs in environmental businesses and to reduce the nation's dependence on coal and oil.
 
Billions in Cleanup Costs
 But the biggest part of the department's budget goes to supervise the nation's nuclear bomb complex, a web of reactors, factories and laboratories that has experienced safety problems and pollution cleanup costs estimated at billions of dollars a year.
Mrs. O'Leary's comments yesterday suggested that her management experience at Northern Power, one of the largest gas and electric utilities in the Midwest, had tempered her views about the wisdom of using Government regulation to meet those or any other goals.
"In the public sector I've regulated industry broadly," she said at a news conference in Little Rock, Ark., where Mr. Clinton announced her appointment. "In the private sector, I've been forced to live with those regulations and, perhaps more importantly, I've seen how those regulations if not carefully crafted and balanced can impact jobs and lives and economies of people who expected and hoped for better from their Government."
Some environmental groups spoke warily of the appointment, noting that Northern States has been involved in several projects that they oppose. The most hotly contested project recently has been a proposal by a consortium of companies to build a nuclear reprocessing plant in an impoverished section of Louisiana.
 
Alternative Energy Projects
 But Northern States in general -- and Mrs. O'Leary in particular -- has also been associated in recent years with several conservation and alternative energy projects similar to those praised by Mr. Clinton and Vice President-elect Al Gore. She noted yesterday, for instance, that she drives a demonstration vehicle that runs on compressed natural gas.
One Minnesota environmentalist who has frequently clashed with the company said Mrs. O'Leary might prove to be surprisingly sympathetic.
"She's not an ideologue," said George Crocker, head of the North American Water Office in Lake Elmo, Minn. He said that Mrs. O'Leary had repeatedly opened doors for him to advocate the utility's move toward a pricing structure that rewarded the company for investments in conservation and tailored its rate of return to progress in meeting conservation goals.
"I talked with her yesterday and she told me that conservation programs are closest to her heart," he added.
There was little talk yesterday of the Energy Department's biggest budget commitment through the years, financing nuclear weapons research and cleanup. The Clinton transition team has said that transferring technologies developed for the military cleanup to the private sector should be a major priority for the Government.
Born and reared in Newport News, Va., Mrs. O'Leary graduated from Fisk University in Nashville in 1959 and earned a law degree at Rutgers University in 1966. She was an assistant New Jersey Attorney General, a prosecutor in Essex County, N.J., and a partner in the Washington office of the accounting firm of Coopers & Lybrand before working at the Federal Energy Administration under President Gerald R. Ford and in the Energy Department under President Jimmy Carter.
She joined O'Leary Associates, a Washington-based energy consulting firm, in 1981 as vice president and general counsel. In 1980 she married John F. O'Leary, the firm's founder.
Mr. O'Leary, who served as Deputy Energy Secretary in the Carter Administration, died in 1987. Mrs. O'Leary has a son, Carl G. Rollins, a lawyer in Washington.

HEADLINE: Barricades and Passes for Drug Neighborhood

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: LAWRENCE, Mass., Dec. 21

 BODY:
Residents of a neighborhood frequented by drug dealers were required to travel through a police checkpoint starting today just to get home, resulting in protests from civil liberties groups.
Police officials in this city of 70,000, which is about 40 miles north of Boston, said the unusual tactic was an effort to stem drug dealing, often to buyers from suburban communities. 
 "This is not an occupation army coming in and setting up a police state; this is part of community policing," said Police Chief Allen W. Cole.
But John Roberts, director of the Civil Liberties Union in Massachusetts, called the measure "martial law without the Federal troops." Mr. Roberts said his group would probably challenge the measure in court on civil rights grounds.
 
District Attorney Opposes Plan
 The Essex County District Attorney, Kevin Burke, said he had advised Chief Cole not to put up barricades.
"I told him it was not legal, and I didn't see how he could enforce it without running the risk of violations," he said.
The police issued passes to residents of the four-square-block area to come and go. Those without passes could enter the neighborhood but only after having their vehicle identified at a roadblock of squad cars and yellow barrels.
Officers recorded the license plate numbers and planned to send a letter to the owners saying their cars had been seen in that area.
"If you were coming in here to buy drugs, would you drive past a police car, knowing that a letter will be sent to your house?" Chief Cole asked.
 
Police Claim Blocks' Support
 The chief said his department had been trying to drive drug dealers out for months. But when one officer was fired at and another had a gun drawn on him within the past 10 days, he had the police canvass residents, who said they would support barricades.
The police say the barricades will be in place 18 hours a day indefinitely.
Some residents of the barricaded area say they are fed up with the unemployment and crime that have haunted the city for several years.
One, Lisette Ortiz, 24, said her racially mixed neighborhood was pleasant in daylight but became a haven for drug dealers and prostitutes at night.
"Twice they've tried kicking in my door at night, asking if I sold drugs," Ms. Ortiz said. "I don't go out at night. I'm scared."

HEADLINE: CONFLICT IN THE BALKANS;
Serbia's Enigma: An Aloof Leader Who Stoked Fires of Nationalist Passion

BYLINE: By JOHN F. BURNS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BELGRADE, Yugoslavia, Dec. 21

 BODY:
On the ruined walls of towns and villages across Bosnia and Herzegovina that have been devastated by "ethnic cleansing," one word, "Slobo," appears again and again, scrawled in spray paint by the Serbian fighters who have swept through, terrorizing inhabitants and razing homes.
For those who have made his name a totem of their cause, it seems no matter that "Slobo" -- Slobodan Milosevic, the President of Serbia -- has never visited the battle zone, nor even their wounded fighters. As the political patron of Serbian nationalism, and as the head of the Serbian Government that has given the arms and money Bosnia's Serbs have needed to carry out their killings, Mr. Milosevic is a hero above all others among the forces who have seized two-thirds of Bosnia as an exclusive Serbian domain. 
 Today, those fighters and their supporters in Serbia were celebrating what seemed likely to be a victory for Mr. Milosevic in Sunday's presidential election. If the trend in early returns is sustained, Mr. Milosevic will have defeated Milan Panic, the Serbian-American millionaire who was his principal rival, on a platform that has prompted many in Serbia to fear that Mr. Milosevic may yet widen the war.
Mr. Panic's associates were issuing statements today alleging that the election was rigged, but Mr. Milosevic's associates said that the returns would strengthen the Serbian President and stiffen his resolve in meeting increased Western pressures for an abandonment of the militarist policies he has pursued since the break-up of Yugoslavia began last year.
During the election campaign, which was conducted as the United States and other Western nations reviewed a range of military options intended to restrain Serbian offensives in Bosnia, Mr. Milosevic vowed never to turn away from a policy of "great solidarity with the Serbian people outside Serbia." This is a term he has used in the past to describe the use of military force in support of "ethnic cleansing" and other practices that have been condemned by the Western powers as atrocities.
 
Despite Carnage, Little Remorse
 Already, these policies have caused the deaths of at least 150,000 people in Bosnia and Croatia, and have driven at least 1.6 million people from their communities as refugees. But while Mr. Panic described the conflict as "an intolerable tragedy" and vowed to end it, Mr. Milosevic, who is 51 years old, appears to have been unmoved by the consequences of his actions.
In part, this has been a matter of personality, since even his close associates describe the former Serbian Communist leader as dispassionate, cool and unrattled even amid the growing international condemnation of Serbia and its leaders.
On Wednesday, Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger named Mr. Milosevic among possible war criminals whom Mr. Eagleburger said should face trial on charges relating to atrocities committed in the Balkan fighting.
Mr. Milosevic answered in less than a day. Traveling first to Kosovo, the region of southern Serbia where a million ethnic Albanians are agitating for independence, then to Nis, a Serbian industrial city nearby, Mr. Milosevic offered what appeared to be an oblique justification for "ethnic cleansing" when he said that the Albanian majority in Kosovo had been its first practitioners, by encouraging an exodus of Serbs over the past decade.
He went on to declare that despite all threats Serbia would not abandon what he called "our great solidarity with Serbian people outside Serbia."
"This country has many times in its history endured the challenge of foreign threats," he said. "Now, we are called upon once again to decide whether we will stand up, or go down on our knees and become a new Balkan colony. So I tell you: We will never surrender Serbia."
He attended his closing election meetings to the accompaniment of rhythmic chants of "Slobo! Serbia!" and sat through lengthy speeches that ascribed to him almost mythic qualities. For Mr. Milosevic, this was not new. In Belgrade, portraits have appeared depicting the stocky, almost cherubic-looking Serbian leader as a medieval knight like those who fought, and lost, Serbia's watershed battle against the invading Turks in Kosovo in 1389.
 
Leader Who Plays On Ancient Fears
 The invaders went on to make Serbia and Bosnia an outpost of the Ottoman Empire for nearly 500 years, fostering the embattled political psychology among Serbs, and in particular the fear of Muslims that Mr. Milosevic has exploited in building his political career.
According to former associates, this represents a sharp break with his attitude during the years when he was working his way up through the Communist Party apparatus. Then he aligned himself with Titoist orthodoxy, which outlawed nationalism.
Until three years ago, Mr. Milosevic, as Serbia's Communist Party chief, had little popular following. But after he traveled to Kosovo in 1989 and made a fiery speech about the rights of Serbs, he unleashed a wave of nationalist feeling. Fear of this resurgent nationalism fueled independence movements in four of the other five Yugoslav republics, which had no desire to trade a Communist yoke for a Serbian one.
In 1990, with Yugoslavia beginning to break up, Mr. Milosevic rode the nationalist wave to victory in Serbia's first post-Communist election. From there, it was a short step to the policies that led to war in Croatia and Bosnia.
By conventional standards, the two years since the last election have been a disaster for Serbia. The collapse of the Yugoslav economy, coupled with the stringent economic sanctions imposed by the United Nations, have idled more than 60 percent of the Serbian work force and fostered an annual inflation rate of about 10,000 percent.
But Mr. Milosevic, who rarely appears in public except at election time, seems not to have shared the pain felt by many Serbs. During the election, he addressed crowds of unemployed workers in industrial cities devastated by the economic collapse and congratulated them on increasing production, puzzling some local officials.
At rallies where thousands had been bused in by his Serbian Socialist Party, a new version of the old Communist Party, he stared stony-faced as cheers washed over him, and looked uncomfortable when he was asked to take tea and make small talk with voters. But perhaps the strongest signal to his character has been his attitude toward the war in Bosnia.
Contemptuously rejecting the American war-crimes charges, Mr. Milosevic held to a posture he has adopted from the start of the Bosnian conflict, denying any responsibility for the Bosnian war despite the release of transcripts of telephone conversations between Mr. Milosevic and Radovan Karadzic, the Bosnian Serb leader, that implicate Mr. Milosevic. Western diplomats say their intelligence reports show similar involvement.
 
Is It Dishonesty, Or Self-Delusion?
 Mr. Milosevic's denials of what those around him know as fact is one facet of a complex personality. Warren Zimmermann, the former American Ambassador to Yugoslavia, who was withdrawn in May as a gesture of protest against the Serbian offensives in Bosnia, told associates after a series of bitter encounters with the Serbian leader that his most prominent character trait was dishonesty.
"Warren used to say that he was astonished by the man's ability to lie with a look of total sincerity on his face," a Western European diplomat said.
Others describe this differently. "Many people who have dealt with him recently speak of him as disconnected from reality," said Ivan Jankovic, a Belgrade patent lawyer who followed Mr. Milosevic through law school at the University of Belgrade in the 1960's.
A man who worked with Mr. Milosevic for years, and agreed to discuss the Serbian leader on condition that he not be named, said, "He decides first what is expedient for him to believe, then he believes it."
Those who look for explanations for Mr. Milosevic's behavior beyond the tangled world of Balkan politics often cite his childhood. He was the son of a Serbian Orthodox priest from Montenegro, a region known for engendering fierce nationalism among its Serbian inhabitants. Both his parents committed suicide while he was still in his teens, as did an uncle.
Growing up in Pozarevac, about 50 miles south of Belgrade, he was known as a disciplined, humorless loner. He married his childhood sweetheart, Mirjana Markovic, now a professor of Marxist-Leninist theory in Belgrade, who shared his Communist orthodoxy.
"He was incredibly disciplined, and took Communism with deadly earnestness, even when everybody else thought it was a terrible bore," one former law classmate said.
Another man who helped Mr. Milosevic as he ascended the Communist hierarchy in Belgrade said that he had never met a man who was more assiduous in developing contacts to promote his own career, and less loyal to those who helped him.
"He's a man who makes no friends," this former associate said. "There is only one thing that matters to Slobo Milosevic, and that is Slobo Milosevic."
 
Visitors Are Few At Walled Mansion
 The sense that the Serbian leader is walled off from those around him is strong. Neighbors in Dedinje, the affluent Belgrade suburb where Mr. Milosevic lives in a mansion that was confiscated by Communist authorities from a prominent Jewish family that died in the Holocaust, say that few visitors ever pass through the wall of bomb-proof steel that surrounds the house. Associates say that Mr. Milosevic has few pastimes, preferring to spend nights and weekends working on Government papers than socializing.
Vreme, the weekly news magazine that has been one of Mr. Milosevic's strongest critics, has noted that he has done few of the things that are routine among wartime leaders elsewhere, such as visiting the wounded.
"He's responsible for the war, and he's shown almost no interest in its victims," one Western diplomat said. "It's one thing for him to show no compassion for Muslim victims of the war, but he doesn't even show any feeling for the Serbs who have been killed or wounded."
But even Mr. Milosevic's harshest critics concede that he has been extraordinarily shrewd in building up his domestic political base. For most of the time since the Kosovo speech in 1989 he has outmaneuvered his political opponents and the diplomats who have attempted to constrain the Serbs.
For months, envoys have elicited what they believed were undertakings from Mr. Milosevic to halt "ethnic cleansing," to stop Serbian forces from seizing more territory in Bosnia, and to place Serbian heavy weapons under United Nations supervision. None of these things has happened, and so far, at least, Serbia has escaped direct Western military intervention.
Although the United States and other Western nations have hinted recently that they may meet any new Serbian aggression with direct military action, some opponents see signs that Mr. Milosevic has concluded that the United States and its allies have no willingness for a military confrontation. Mr. Milosevic is said to have concluded that despite its condemnation of Serbian aggression, Russia will block any United Nations approval of military involvement by outside powers.
 
Will Russia Resume An Old Alliance?
 Associates of Mr. Milosevic say he believes that the conservative challenge to Boris N. Yeltsin, the Russian leader, will lead to the emergence of a nationalist government in Russia that will revive Moscow's 19th-century alliance with Serbia, to the point of aiding Serbia militarily if a wider Balkan conflict erupts.
Diplomats say the Serbian leader may be caught in his own strategy, with the nationalist feelings he has stoked driving Serbia into war, and the war heightening nationalist passions, to the point that he cannot turn back.
"It's become a vicious circle," said Mr. Cerovic, the columnist for Vreme. "I just can't imagine that a man who could start all this will suddenly resign and go to live on the money he and his associates are supposed to have put into banks in Cyprus, or that he will somehow begin to act more reasonably. The world should realize that when dealing with Slobodan Milosevic, there is no reasoning. He understands only violence and force."

HEADLINE: With Casino, the Poor See a Change in Luck

BYLINE: By RONALD SMOTHERS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TUNICA, Miss.

 BODY:
In years past, politicians trooped to this Mississippi Delta town whenever they wanted a backdrop that showed the worst of rural poverty, especially the tumbledown shacks, outhouses and open sewers of the Sugar Ditch section.
But since it opened two months ago, a riverboat casino has begun to transform this town and surrounding county into a gambling and tourist destination, drawing people from Memphis, northern Mississippi, Arkansas and even Kentucky and Missouri. 
 To say that the Splash Casino -- the state's fifth casino over all and the first in the Delta -- has also transformed life for many in Tunica is no exaggeration. That is especially true of the 1,023 casino employees, half of whom live in Tunica County, where the jobless rate has been cut in half.
 
Doubts Behind the Glitter
 The mood is not all upbeat, of course. It will be a while before it becomes clear whether the casino, and its employees, will prosper once the novelty wears off. Others have noted an increase in the cost of living because property values have been pushed up. And some people think that gambling is wrong, no matter what the benefits, and that poor people will be tempted to gamble away their meager savings.
More fundamental is this question: Can riverboat gambling really bring permanent change to a county where, until just a few years ago, a few black people still lived in shacks and emptied their bodily waste into a ditch?
After the plight of the shack dwellers became nationally known in the mid-1980's, when it was revealed that more than $1 million in Federal money had been spent on sewer improvements for white subdivisions rather than the black Sugar Ditch community, the shack dwellers were moved to federally subsidized housing. But Tunica remained mired in poverty: the county was the poorest in the nation, according to the 1980 census, and the fourth-poorest in the 1990 census.
 
Sounds of Optimism
 For now, though, the noise of slot machines, dice tables and roulette wheels are sounds of optimism. Cocktail waitresses like 26-year-old Demetrease Hurt of Memphis and others say they like their new jobs. Some workers say they make more in a day than they used to make in two weeks of stuffing pillows or filleting catfish, to name two jobs typically held by young unskilled workers in these parts.
"Sometimes I can get as much as a $25 chip as a tip from a bettor who's winning," said Ms. Hurt as she took orders for drinks. "I have kids at home, and I can make more in one day here than I made all week at my last job in an auto parts store."
Nearby, a former welfare recipient and part-time school bus driver, Angela Hargrow, made change for slot machine players. "I didn't see much of a future when I was driving the school bus," said Ms. Hargrow, 26. "It was a dead end. But here it's possible for me to get a promotion." She hopes to work in one of the cages where money is counted and the chips are dispensed.
 
Spirits Are Lifted
 This element of optimism is perhaps the most obvious and immediate effect of the casino, said Clayton Henderson, a State Representative and the owner of a local funeral home. He said the casino had lifted the spirits of the county's 8,200 people, 72 percent of whom are black and most of whom are poor.
"The casino has given hope to an area that has been deprived and depressed for years," Mr. Henderson said. "If there is a bad side to any of this, it's either too early to see it or we just haven't seen it."
Those sentiments are being echoed farther south in Biloxi and Bay St. Louis, where four 24-hour riverboat casinos have been moored in the Gulf of Mexico for the last four months. The coast's sagging, tourist-oriented economy has shown signs of improving with 3,000 new jobs. Most of those are attributable to the casinos, whose visitors have accounted for gambling revenues of $46 million.
"People can't believe it, and every call has been positive," said the Bay St. Louis Mayor, Edward A. Favre, whose administration was able to send out property-tax bills this month that reduced most residents' bills by 85 percent because of the revenues anticipated from gambling.
Mississippi estimates that there will be gross revenues of $260 million annually from the casinos already approved for the state, said Lorenzo Creighton, director of the Mississippi Gaming Commission. And while the operations are limited to 14 counties, the state's 8 percent share of the revenue will benefit everyone in Mississippi.
The euphoria and hope may give way to colder assessments, in Mississippi and elsewhere, as gambling outlets become as ubiquitous as sandbars along the Mississippi River's 955 miles from Cairo, Ill., to Venice, La., where it splays into the gulf. Iowa and Illinois now allow riverboat gambling, and Missouri moved in November to do so. Louisiana recently passed a law authorizing a land-based casino in New Orleans and up to 15 riverboat casinos.
What happens in other states could be important to Mississippi because experts on casino gambling have long noted that the gambling market is not limitless. While early entrants prosper quickly, shakeouts from competition are inevitable.
But in the meantime pioneers like the Splash Casino are making big money. Rick Schilling is the managing partner of the group that operates the $22 million casino in a structure that was once a nightclub moored in Cincinnati and later St. Louis.
 
A New 'Boom Town'
 Tunica gets a $1-per-person boarding fee as well as eight-tenths of 1 percent of the gross casino revenues. In the first 11 days of the Splash Casino's operation, the county netted $40,000 from the boarding fees alone; it projects a total annual contribution of $2 million, about equal to the county's current total budget.
All of this has made Tunica a bit of a "boom town," said Paul Battle, the chairman of the county Board of Supervisors and owner of a local catfish-processing plant. The county plans on using $750,000 to build a new access road to the casino, and investors are planning restaurants, hotels, golf courses and apartments.
Mr. Battle said that dozens of workers have left his plant for the $5- to $8-an-hour jobs at the casino. But he added that he had had little trouble finding others to take their place. "Anybody who can't get a job around here now just doesn't want to work," he said, noting that unemployment in the county was about 7 percent, half of what it was before the casino.
 
Eyes on Bigger Things
 Ms. Hargrow, the mother of one child, said that before getting the job making change at the casino she worked part time driving a school bus, and that with that job and her welfare allotment she got about $152 every two weeks, plus food stamps. She lives in Cottonland Apartments, the subsidized housing complex built in 1986 after the Rev. Jesse Jackson highlighted poor living conditions in the county. She pays $68 a month in rent, based on a formula requiring her to pay 25 percent of her income for it.
Ms. Hargrow now makes about $350 every two weeks in salary alone and has her eyes on a promotion that could nearly double her salary. So far, the only downside of the new developments is the notice she got that, because her income is up, her rent would increase to nearly $200 a month in January.
"It's brought some good and some bad," she said of the casino. "I really need to get that promotion for things to really improve for me."
Michael Brown, 25, drove a fork lift for a chemical company until recently. Now he works the floor of the casino, overseeing maintenance crews and attending to the needs of some of the change persons. A native of Tunica, he said he had experienced a tremendous change in attitude with the new job and had noted the same thing in others.
"Usually, we have to scrape so hard for a living and people here are usually always so tired after working on jobs that they don't like," said Mr. Brown. "I was the same way, and every day I got up I hated to go to work. But now I look forward to it."
In her black tights, starched collar and cutaway, it is not likely that a 23-year-old cocktail waitress, Marketta Alexander, would be recognized by anyone she knows from her day job. By day, she is an eighth-grade math teacher in nearby Byhalia. The University of Southern Mississippi graduate said that she was working at the casino to earn extra money to study pharmacy.
 
Rejection Elsewhere Helps
 Tunica's apparent good fortune is largely due to the fact that gambling fever failed to catch on in DeSoto County to the north, when a coalition of churches and others defeated a riverboat-gambling proposal in a November referendum. DeSoto County, considered more a suburb of Memphis than part of the rural Delta and its persistent poverty, had a 3 percent unemployment rate and little economic incentive to approve the gambling proposal. When it was defeated, a lot of people in Tunica breathed more easily.
One reason for their relief is that plans for new housing, restaurants and hotels in Tunica had been frozen as investors awaited the outcome of the DeSoto vote. They reasoned that Tennessee and Arkansas gamblers would not drive the extra 25 miles south to Tunica if there were casinos closer by in DeSoto.
"At first people thought I was an idiot to come here," said Mr. Schilling, the managing partner of the Splash Casino. "But now I'm a genius because its working. And when the competition eventually does come, I suspect they will take some of the cream, but there will still be plenty of milk."

"I didn't see much of a future when I was driving the school bus," said Angela Hargrow, left, who makes change for slot machine players. "It was a dead end. But here it's possible for me to get a promotion." (Rollin A. Riggs for The New York Times)

U.S. Sues 8 Airlines Over Fares

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The Justice Department filed an antitrust suit today that accused the eight largest American airlines of using a computerized reservation system to fix air fares.
Without admitting or denying the accusation, two airlines, United and USAir, agreed to end the practice of communicating proposed future fare increases to each other through the computerized system. 
 But other airlines insisted that they had done no wrong and said that it was wrong for the Government to be adding to the troubles of an industry that has lost $7 billion in the last two years. The other airlines named in the suit were American, Delta, Northwest, Continental, T.W.A. and Alaska Airlines.
 
Accused of Passing Signals
 The airlines are accused of using the computerized system, maintained by the Airline Tariff Publishing Company, to communicate to one another about changes in fares. The company, which provides airline fare information that is used by travel agents, is owned by a group of airlines, including the eight carriers named in the suit. The publishing company was also named in the antitrust suit, which was filed in United States District Court in Washington.
"We believe that the consumer impact was significant," said J. Mark Gidley, Acting Assistant Attorney General in charge of antitrust. But he said the Justice Department could not provide even a rough estimate of the cost to consumers.
The complaint said the listing of future fares on the computerized system was a source of abuse. An airline could signal that starting on Jan. 1, for example, it would increase by $50 its unrestricted economy fare between New York and Chicago. Competing airlines would see the fare increase in the computer system and act accordingly, the lawsuit contended.
In some cases, the suit stated, an airline would signal its intention to reduce a fare on a route that was lucrative for its competitor, which would then retaliate by signaling its intention to reduce a fare on a route that was lucrative for the first airline. In some cases, both fare reductions were then abandoned, or an accommodation was reached, according to the Justice Department.
 
A Matter of Timing
 Some fare increases are placed in the computerized system two months in advance, but most take effect within a week or two.
"Using A.T.P., the airlines were able to engage in an elaborate dialogue with one another about future fares," Mr. Gidley said. "The airlines engaged in a process that involved repeated exchanges through A.T.P. of price-increase proposals and counterproposals, with the effect of raising fares to consumers.
"By using A.T.P., airlines communicated the details of proposed fare increases to competitors and obtained their reactions. These discussions often continued until there was an agreement on a higher fare."
The system enabled the airlines not only to set future fare increases, but also to settle on expiration dates for discount fares, Mr. Gidley said.
Alfred E. Kahn, who championed airline deregulation when he was chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board during the Carter Administration, said in an interview today: "I think it is certainly the case that they used this method of signaling to one another. It isn't much different from meeting in a hotel room, but the fact is that if they are trying to be conspirators they are like the Three Stooges in their success. Their industry is losing money hand over fist."
The airlines say they announce future fares to inform consumers, not their competitors. "Airline customers want to know in advance when prices will rise so they can plan their travel, and buy tickets before the increase," said Anne H. McNamara, a senior vice president and general counsel of American Airlines.
Noting the industry's big losses, Ms. McNamara said, "Surely our Government has better uses for the taxpayer's hard-earned dollar than to attack an industry which has given new meaning to price competition, one in which about 20 percent of capacity is currently in bankruptcy."
"If we are monopolistic price fixers," she said, "then we are laughably inept."
Continental Airlines issued a statement that "categorically" denied the antitrust charges.
The suit involves the same computer system that was the subject of a class-action lawsuit tentatively settled earlier this year by six major airlines. The carriers agreed to distribute $458 million worth of discount coupons to passengers who contended that they had been affected.
The Justice Department is not suing for monetary damages, but rather to eliminate some practices. The agency wants the airlines to put fare changes into effect immediately, rather than at a future date. The department also wants the airlines to stop indicating the date on which discounts will end.
The airline industry has suffered extraordinary financial distress during the period cited in the price-fixing complaint, as airlines have struggled with erratic fuel prices, terrorist incidents that deterred tourism, and excessive debt piled on during the deal-making days of the 1980's.
At least half a dozen airlines have collapsed into bankruptcy in the last four years, including Pan Am, Braniff and Eastern. Among the defendants named in the complaint, Trans World Airlines and Continental Airlines are operating under bankruptcy court protection. Both are nearing agreements that will permit them to emerge from bankruptcy next year.
Even the strongest carriers have problems. Delta recently instituted widespread pay cuts, sharply reduced its stock dividend payments and curbed its expansion plans. American Airlines has announced severe measures to cut costs.
"Judged in the aggregate, the industry is bankrupt," said Julius Maldutis, an analyst at Salomon Brothers, in a recent report. "If the industry were a savings and loan association, the Government would have seized it and liquidated it."

HEADLINE: Western Experts Feel Russia's Move to Free Market Will Continue

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Despite a series of recent setbacks for President Boris N. Yeltsin's drive to establish a market economy in Russia, many Western economists and experts say that the transition is likely to continue, at a slower pace, and that the process may be too far along to be reversed.
In a dozen interviews, experts on Russia as well as officials who deal with Russia in the United States Government, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank said they were disappointed that Mr. Yeltsin had been thwarted in his efforts. But they said they no longer feared that the Yeltsin reforms were in danger of being undone. 
 The interviews were conducted after the biggest blow to Mr. Yeltsin's program last week, the ouster of Yegor T. Gaidar as Acting Prime Minister. Mr. Gaidar had been the driving force behind the move to capitalism and free enterprise under Mr. Yeltsin.
Another sign that Mr. Yeltsin's program might be in danger was his abrupt decision to fly home from China on Friday. He declared over the weekend that new efforts were under way to undermine his program, and there is talk in Moscow of the Government's flooding the economy with new credits that could drive up inflation.
 
Process 'Irreversible'
 "We would have been better off if Mr. Gaidar had continued in his job for a while longer," said a senior Bush Administration official who asked not to be identified. "But while his agenda was incomplete, he may have already done enough to make the process irreversible."
With Mr. Gaidar out, one major issue among Western experts is whether his successor as Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, will replace the young, market-oriented economists who had worked with Mr. Gaidar.
Mr. Chernomyrdin had said last week that he would keep the group that had worked with Mr. Gaidar. But some Western economists say their main concern is not personnel changes but the fact that Mr. Chernomyrdin's main constituents are the managers of giant, inefficient state-owned manufacturing companies who oppose a market economy in which their companies might shrink or go bankrupt.
"A very bad man became Prime Minister of Russia," said Andre Shleifer, a Harvard University economist who has worked with the Yeltsin Government as an adviser. "Mr. Chernomyrdin's fundamental view is that the revival of the economy will take place through the revival of major state companies. But the country does not need more steel or more weapons or more airplanes that sit at airports because they cannot fly."
A major issue among Western experts appears to be the level of Western financial aid needed to keep Russia moving toward a market economy. Last spring, the West offered $24 billion in loans to help stabilize the Russian currency and ease its transition.
There is a dispute among Western economists and officials of the International Monetary Fund over how to count the amounts actually disbursed, with the I.M.F. reporting that nearly $18 billion in promised loans has been granted, while others assert that the actual amount is much lower.
The optimism that Russia will continue to move toward a market economy seemed to be a change in tone from comments last spring and summer, when many experts said Mr. Yeltsin had little time in which to enact his changes. They argued then that the $24 billion should be disbursed immediately to promote radical "shock therapy" and thus rescue Russia from reverting to Communism or a planned economy.
A few economists continue to argue for shock therapy, whose main features include large-scale sale or transfer of government enterprises to private hands, and a cutback of government credits and subsidies that keep inefficient state enterprises alive.
Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist and prominent advocate of shock therapy who served as an adviser to Mr. Gaidar, deplored his ouster and angrily blamed what he sees as the failure of Western nations to support Mr. Gaidar.
"They have no guts, no concept of strategy, and they act, quite frankly, as if they can't tell the difference between a reformer and a Communist," Mr. Sachs said in an interview, referring to officials in the Bush Administration and the governments of the other major industrial nations, as well as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank.
But this harsh judgment is challenged by officials in the Bush Administration, who say Mr. Chernomyrdin may continue the economic changes, although perhaps at a slower pace.
"We know that as Oil and Gas Minister for the past six months, Mr. Chernomyrdin worked closely with Mr. Gaidar," an Administration official said. "On energy, there was not a big difference in their views."
President-elect Bill Clinton's aides declined to discuss their opinions about the latest changes in Russia.
 
Influence Termed Limited
 In the interviews, the Russian experts said Western influence in Russia, whatever the spending, is now very limited.
"At this point, the enormous forces of Russian internal politics have overwhelmed events, putting them beyond any Westerner's control," said Robert Hormats, a vice president at Goldman Sachs & Company, which was hired last year by the Yeltsin Government to solicit Western corporate investment.
Given the limited influence, most experts said Western loans should be used to finance specific projects rather than to put pressure on the Yeltsin Government to bring about a rapid and large-scale reorganization of the economy, as Mr. Sachs has advocated.
Under the original shock-therapy approach, the West had offered the $24 billion in loans, but only if the Russians agreed to various steps to force a market system on the country. The I.M.F. was to negotiate this agreement, but those negotiations have been suspended for weeks.
One step in these talks would have required the Yeltsin Government to remove price ceilings, which Mr. Gaidar has done for most products. A second called for rapid privatization of state companies, large and small, and considerable progress has been made on this score, too.
The main stumbling block was a third condition, which required the Yeltsin Government to reduce inflation, mostly by no longer printing rubles to pay out huge subsidies to inefficient state-owned industries, running up the budget deficit in the process. Parliament's resistance to ending the subsidies played a big role in unseating Mr. Gaidar and also in suspending the I.M.F. negotiations.
Nevertheless, Bush Administration and I.M.F. officials say $18 billion in new loans flowed to Russia this year from the West. The biggest part, they say, was $13.9 billion in bilateral aid from various governments, mostly short-term credits to finance Russian imports from the West.
The remaining amounts in the $18 billion were listed as a $1 billion I.M.F. loan, $670 million in World Bank loans, and an agreement to postpone $2.4 billion that Russia owed the West in interest -- in effect, forgiving the money to the Russians until they pay it later.
 
Figures Are Disputed
 But Mr. Sachs disputed these figures, and I.M.F. officials acknowledged that the calculations were subject to different interpretations. Mr. Sachs said that the $13.9 billion from various governments was not part of the $24 billion promised last spring and summer and that the money carried no requirement that the Russians make economic reforms.
Mr. Sachs added that the $18 billion total included $3 billion to $4 billion in German loans to build housing in Russia for Russian soldiers now stationed in eastern Germany, a sum that was never expected to be included in the $24 billion package.
Whatever the amounts, many Russia experts, including one or two who have submitted position papers to the office of President-elect Clinton, argue that the transition should proceed more slowly.
"The real objective is to slowly shrink state industries," said Mr. Shleifer of Harvard. "Even for Mr. Gaidar, the transition has been slower than shock therapy envisioned."

HEADLINE: CANADA TIGHTENS IMMIGRATION LAW

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO, Dec. 18

 BODY:
Long considered a model of generosity in granting asylum to the world's persecuted, Canada is making its immigration procedures more restrictive in the biggest change in Canadian immigration law in 16 years.
After a long period of economic hard times, and with unemployment well over 10 percent, the new law responds to a decline in Canadian tolerance toward immigrants, among other reasons, because they are seen as competitors in the labor force. 
 The law, which received final approval on Thursday, has drawn criticism from refugee and civil liberties groups. Asylum approvals have been on the decline, from 76 percent of the applicants in 1989 to 57 percent this year, and the law is expected to lower the rate further.
 
Still a Refuge
 But Canada's policies will still be more liberal than those of the United States. For instance, Canada has no country quotas; instead, Canada assesses applicants on the basis of professional, educational and financial backgrounds, a process that is further developed in the new law.
Howard Greenberg, chairman of the national immigration section of the Canadian Bar Association, said that under the new law, "applying to Canada will be like applying to law school: The Government will collect applications worldwide and assess them as against one another, and select the cream of the crop for processing."
The main restrictions relate to refugees. "We're concerned that this new legislation will restrict the number of people who get to Canada to make a refugee claim," said Fay Sims, refugee coordinator for Amnesty International's Canadian Section.
 
Spread of Xenophobia
 A recent survey by the Immigration Department demonstrated that Canada is not isolated from the wave of xenophobia rolling over Europe. More than 40 percent of Canadians, according to the poll, say their country admits too many immigrants. One-third say they want to "keep out people who are different from most Canadians."
But Greg James, president of the Refugee Lawyers Assocation, challenge the general perception that Canada receives more than its fair share of refugees. Thirty thousand people sought asylum in Canada last year, he said, compared with 256,000 in Germany, 46,000 in France, 45,000 in Britain, 41,000 in Switzerland, 27,000 in Austria, 27,000 in Sweden and 26,000 in Italy. According to data from the Immigration and Naturalization Service, the United States accepted nearly 500,000 refugee applications last year.
Some critics argue that the law is part of the positioning of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative Government for elections next year. The measure is seen as stealing thunder from the Reform Party, which has been taking votes from Tories in western Canada and which has long called for immigration curbs.
To Employment and Immigration Minister Bernard Valcourt, the measure meets the "new realities" of the 1990's: according to his figures, 80 million people are on the move worldwide in search of a new homeland. He feels that many would circumvent Canada's immigration laws, if given the chance.
 
Possible Abuse of Power
 Refugee advocates have serious reservations about a provision that gives border guards the right to determine who is entitled to make a refugee claim, without any recourse for appeal.
"We're concerned about that," said Mr. James, the lawyer, "because it will be done in the context of a simple interview in which the claimant may not have counsel or a qualified person to assist him."
Since most refugees come from the United States, a high rejection rate would put a bigger burden on such centers as Vive Inc., in Buffalo, a church-funded way station for refugees from New York City. Of 234 refugees that it bedded and fed last month on their way north, nearly half were from Somalia. The Rev. John Long, Vive's director, worries that his facilities, in an old Roman Catholic school in Buffalo, will be swamped.
 
A 'Militarized Border'?
 Nancy Worsfold, executive director of the Canadian Council for Refugees, which represents about 130 church, community and organizations, said the measure could have a major impact on the border region.
It "creates the incentive to make an illegal border crossing," she said, and Canada could well respond by creating a "militarized border."
Under current law, a refugee who makes it to a border point is automatically given the right to a hearing before the Government and independent adjudicators.
According to immigration records, more than 90 percent of the refugees are initially able to show a credible basis for staying and thus qualify for a second hearing. The Government wants to change the procedure, it says, to cut costs and promote efficiency.
Powers to deport have been broadened, and deportation will be possible not only of a person engaged in illegal activities, but also of a member of any organization linked with illegal activities.

HEADLINE: As Americans Stay Home, Japanese Discover Jamaica

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MONTEGO BAY, Jamaica

 BODY:
After decades of heavy reliance on the winter cravings of Americans for sun and sand, Jamaica, pushed by the persistently weak American economy, has begun a major restructuring of its travel business that is drawing thousands of tourists from new markets.
Frequently scheduled flights now link the island to South America via Colombia, and there are jam-packed charters from Italy, Germany and even Scandinavia. But nowhere have the efforts to diversify the country's pool of foreign guests paid off so well as with Japan. Despite having to travel two days to cover 8,020 miles from Tokyo to Kingston, Japanese visitors are now flocking to many of this country's finest hotels. 
 While much of Caribbean remains in the doldrums because of the slow growth of the American market, vacancies are rare here at the Half Moon Hotel, an elegantly understated luxury resort here that caters to these new guests. Two Japanese travel agencies have desks beside the finely manicured English-style garden adjacent to the lobby, busily booking free-spending guests for golf, horseback riding and guided shopping jaunts.
 
Dinner by Candlelight

At night, the dinner scene is so busy that reservations often must be made two days in advance for a restaurant where Japanese patrons now make up as much as half of the clientele, read their specially printed menus by twinkling candlelight.
At the turn of the decade, indeed for many years, Americans accounted for 85 percent or more of Jamaica's visitors. But as Japanese, European and South American travelers have poured into the country and the American market has stagnated, visitors from the United States have come to account for only about 60 percent of Jamaica's tourist volume.
While visits from North America are now growing again at an annual rate of about 2 percent, Jamaica's new markets taken together are growing at a clip of 60 percent a year. Arrivals from Japan have risen more steeply than any other tourist market.
In 1988, only about 1,800 Japanese visited Jamaica, while more than 25,000 are expected this year, according to Raphael Barrett, chairman of the Jamaica Tourist Board. Last year, Jamaica received a total of about 800,000 overnight visits, plus about 500,000 cruise ship passengers, earning the country $764 million. For the coming tourism year, officials say they expect 1.5 million visitors to the island.
"We have just finished our best year ever, and there is no doubt but that reaching out to new markets has played a big part in that," said Butch Stewart, chairman of Sandals, one of Jamaica's leading resort chains, which has spent heavily to tap the emerging Latin American market.
In addition to increasing overall volume, Jamaican officials say, the diversification of the tourist trade has smoothed out the traditionally steep seasonal peaks and valleys in arrivals, giving the country a true year-round travel business for the first time.
Although there are traditionally popular warm weather vacation spots in Asia that are much more accessible for the Japanese, many visitors from that country explained the attraction by saying that Jamaica still incarnates a prized quality of alien novelty that many Asian destinations have lost.

HEADLINE: Donors to Neediest Cases Wish They Could Do More

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
"Wish I could do more."
The note scribbled by Therese W. Trachtman of Manhattan was brief, but it gave voice to a sentiment expressed by many donors to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund. More and more people seem frustrated by a recession that refuses to release its grip on the New York region. 
 In letters to the fund, the donors say they feel overwhelmed by the seemingly endless number of stories of homelessness, unemployment, hunger and despair. But they add that they know they must contribute something, even if they face shrinking incomes and savings. Mrs. Trachtman, for example, gave $15.
M. Michael Griggs of Pemaquid Harbor, Me., wrote: "How I wish this gift could be 100 times this donation to your magnificent endeavor. I'm 400 miles away, but I think of you and your wonderful work every day." He wrote a similar message on his check for $11.
Another donor who lives far away, Margaret D. McIntire of Mackinac Island, Mich., said she regretted that she could give only $100 to the fund. "Because I love New York," she wrote. "Wish I could do more."
 
Frustration and Compassion
 Stephen Solender, executive vice president of the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, said many donors have conflicting emotions about the poverty around them. U.J.A.-Federation is one of seven charities assisted by the Neediest Cases fund.
"On the one hand, there is enormous frustration that year after year these terrible problems exist," Mr. Solender said. "At the same time, there is real compassion. People would like to have a society where we don't have an army of folks on the streets."
Thomas DeStefano, executive director of Catholic Charities, Diocese of Brooklyn and Queens, another Neediest Charity, said he sensed that the donors themselves were feeling vulnerable in the face of the recession.
"People are not as secure in their jobs as they used to be," he said. "That's part of the burnout. But the reality is that they should recognize that even though they are doing just one thing, they are the hope for someone."
 
'The Best I Can'
 For eight decades, The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has rescued tens of thousands of New Yorkers with nowhere to turn. The New York Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions are given directly to the charities. This year's appeal ends on Feb. 28.
Like Mr. Griggs, Isabel Andrews, 80, a retired investment consultant, wrote to the fund that she wished her donation could be "100 times larger." She gave $50.
"Every time I pick up The New York Times and read of Somalia or Red Hook or Bosnia, it seems to me that the world is crying for help," Miss Andrews said yesterday from her home in Massapequa, L.I. "How are we going to answer all those appeals? You try to meet some of the needs through your local church and charities, but the flood waters seem to increase rather than go down.
"I think it's a universal feeling, from what I hear my friends say," she added. "I'll just keep on doing the best I can. I think that's all anyone can ask of any of us."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Is Slightly Higher In Quiet Day and Gold Falls

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar finished modestly higher against most other major currencies yesterday in very quiet trading.
Gold prices fell sharply on primarily technical selling on the Commodity Exchange, where bullion for current delivery settled at $334 an ounce, down $2.90 from Friday. A late quote from the Republic National Bank said spot gold fell $3 to close at $334.05. 
 Despite France's relative economic stability, many speculators and other market players were selling the franc, betting on a devaluation. The lira, meanwhile, was under pressure from political uncertainties in Italy and mounting expectations of a rate cut.
The Canadian dollar sold off overseas and then was bid back up when a large order kicked in.
But dealers said most big market players were staying on the sidelines, having already squared their positions ahead of the end of the year to lock in profits.
"Everyone is flat as a board," said Ken Nixon, a customer dealer at Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank in New York.
Few banks want to jeopardize hefty revenues garnered during the European currency turmoil in September and October, a bank dealer in the United States said.
Traders were also cautious ahead of today's release of the final third-quarter gross domestic product figure, since currencies could be whipsawed if the new number is sharply above or below the Government's latest 3.9 percent growth figure.
"It's absolutely quiet," said Steven Jury, chief dealer at Chemical Bank.
In Tokyo, the dollar closed in thin trading at 123.15 yen, barely above Friday's 123.05. Later in London, it finished barely changed at 123.03 yen. In New York, the dollar closed at 123 yen.
In London, the British pound was at $1.5645 in late trading and drifted down to $1.5585 at the close of New York trading. On Friday, sterling ended in the United States at $1.5660.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday quotes, included: 1.4135 Swiss francs, up from 1.4085; 5.3610 French francs, up from 5.3420; 1,408 lira, unchanged from Friday, and $1.2676 Canadian, down from $1.2753.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Medical Costs: The Beat Goes On

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
MEDICAL price inflation seems to be easing a bit, stirring hopes that the health-care monster may yet be tamed. But the price numbers can be misleading and even irrelevant, economists say, because the amount spent on health care is still rising by 10 percent a year, swallowing more of the economy.
The Labor Department says that after climbing steadily since 1987, medical price inflation slid to a 6.7 percent annual rate for the first 11 months of 1992, down from 7.9 percent in 1991 and 9.6 percent in 1990. But the slide probably will not be much help to President-elect Bill Clinton as he seeks a formula for affordable health care. 
 "Health spending is still escalating at the same rate as over the past couple of years," said Walt Bottiny, a health economist in Washington with DRI/McGraw Hill, a consulting firm that forecasts trends for the Federal Medicare program. "Medical inflation is moderating, but not any more than overall inflation is."
Sylvester Schieber, benefits research director at the Wyatt Company consulting firm, said medical price rises caused only about a third of the increase in health spending in the 1980's. He said 42 percent was general inflation and 22 percent was from increased volume of services.
And economists caution that the medical component of the Consumer Price Index no longer reflects actual spending patterns for some major items like hospital charges. The index is still based on list prices for hospital rooms, for example, although most large insurers get discounts, notes Joseph P. Newhouse, a professor of health policy and management at Harvard University.
Henry J. Aaron, economic studies director of the Brookings Institution, the Washington research center, said that even as hospital rates rose, patients spent fewer days there, on average, and the quality of service was up. He added: "We can't measure the restoration of health. We don't know if it lines up with the number of hospital days."
Mr. Newhouse laments that "we don't have a measure of medical care price increases." He adds: "We badly need one. The public believes much of the problem is in prices."
On the positive side, most experts agree that the quality of health care has been rising markedly, at least for those who can afford the expensive new tests and surgical procedures that spur much of the growth. Another plus factor: The expansion has generated jobs. Even while the economy hemorrhaged 1.9 million jobs over the last two years, 320,000 were added in health care, which currently employs 8.4 million Americans, 9.6 percent of all private, nonfarm workers.
The mushrooming costs are a major factor in the Federal deficit, the Congressional Budget Office reported recently, and they are increasingly onerous for private employers. The report noted that employers had squeezed much of the increase in medical costs from payrolls by withholding wage increases, which have not kept pace with general inflation.
Employer costs are rising even faster than the rise in medical spending over all. Jon Gable, benefits research director at KPMG Peat Marwick, the benefits and accounting firm, said employer health premiums would increase by about 12 percent in 1993 and jump even higher in 1994, when he expects hospitals and doctors to pass along several years worth of increases in staffing and overhead expenses.
Efforts to slow growth through managed care like discounts on fees and monitoring patients' care have not been effective, Mr. Bottiny of DRI/ McGraw-Hill said. Mr. Schieber of Wyatt added, "If there is any slowdown in the price pressure, most major purchasers have not noticed it."
The long-running growth in spending on hospitals, doctors and expensive new drugs has also drained billions of dollars from Federal, state and local resources. "There is a real crunch coming in government budgets," said Uwe E. Reinhardt, a Princeton University health economist. "There will be less to put into education and the infrastructure."
The Congressional Budget Office said, "The projected rise in Federal health costs is a major reason for pessimism regarding the long-term outlook for the Federal budget deficit." It said the deficit would "balloon to more than $500 billion," or 5.1 percent of potential G.D.P., by the year 2002. Even if the current double-digit trend in medical spending growth slips a bit, the budget office said, the nation's health spending will still double by 2000, to $1.68 trillion -- a staggering 18 percent of the projected gross domestic product -- from $808 billion, or 13.6, in 1992.
But if Federal spending for health could be held to the 1991 share of G.D.P., the budget office said, the deficit could be pushed back to about 1 percent of potential G.D.P. in 2002, about where it was in the 1960's and 1970's, before soaring above 3 percent of G.D.P. in the 1980's.

HEADLINE: BUSH AIDE ACCUSED OF LYING IN INQUIRY ON CLINTON SEARCH

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
The Justice Department says that the White House political director, Janet G. Mullins, "may have made false statements" to Federal investigators and may have helped direct the search of Bill Clinton's passport files during the Presidential election campaign.
The accusations against Ms. Mullins, who is among the inner circle of aides to James A. Baker 3d, mark the first time Federal officials have suggested that the White House may have helped orchestrate the effort to find damaging information about the Democratic candidate at the height of the campaign. 
 An aide to Ms. Mullins said today that she was unavailable for comment.
Ms. Mullins worked for Mr. Baker when he was chairman of George Bush's Presidential campaign in 1988 and when he was Secretary of State, from 1989 to August of this year. She went with Mr. Baker when he was named chief of staff at the White House, where they have been working together since Aug. 23.
 
Responding to Petition
 The accusations were made in the Justice Department's request for appointment of an independent prosecutor to investigate possible crimes. The text of the request was disclosed today by the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, in response to a petition by CBS, The New York Times and The Washington Post.
The court appointed Joseph E. diGenova, a former United States Attorney in the District of Columbia, who is a Republican, as independent prosecutor on Dec. 14, a day before the law authorizing such appointments expired.
Attorney General William P. Barr summarized the evidence against Ms. Mullins in his application to the court.
"Mullins was interviewed twice by agents" of the State Department inspector general, Mr. Barr said. "During those interviews, she made statements denying her knowledge of, or participation in, the search of Clinton's files. Other evidence directly contradicts Mullins's statements."
 
Two Findings May Differ
 Moreover, the Attorney General said, "There is also evidence that Mullins was aware of the interest in Clinton's files before the search occurred, and that Mullins helped encourage and direct the search."
This finding appears to differ from the conclusion of the inspector general, Sherman M. Funk. In his report, issued Nov. 18, Mr. Funk wrote, "We found no evidence that the White House -- or any other external source -- orchestrated an 'attack' on the Clinton files."
In the request for an independent prosecutor, Mr. Barr did not name Mr. Baker or Margaret D. Tutwiler, the White House director of communications, as targets of the investigation. The inspector general concluded that both of them were apparently aware of the search at about the time it occurred, on Sept. 30 and Oct. 1, at the height of the campaign.
 
Liaison to Campaign
 But the court's charter authorizes the independent prosecutor to investigate and prosecute "all matters and individuals whose acts may be related" to the search of Mr. Clinton's passport files.
While at the White House, Ms. Mullins was political director and liaison to the Bush campaign. At the State Department under Mr. Baker, she was Assistant Secretary for Legislative Affairs. In Mr. Bush's 1988 campaign, which Mr. Baker ran, she was in charge of advertising.
Ms. Mullins, 43, is also experienced on Capitol Hill, having served as an aide to Senators Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and Bob Packwood of Oregon, both Republicans. A Kentucky native, she majored in political science at the University of Louisville and studied international economics at American University in Washington.
 
What the Court Ordered
 A special three-judge panel of the appeals court ordered Mr. diGenova to investigate whether Ms. Mullins committed a crime by making false statements, by obstructing the inspector general's investigation, by conspiring to violate Federal law, by stealing confidential information from Mr. Clinton's file for the benefit of the Bush campaign or by using her official authority to interfere with the 1992 election.
The independent prosecutor may also turn up evidence that shows whether Mr. Baker or President Bush authorized or approved the search of Mr. Clinton's files. The inspector general's report quotes Mr. Baker as saying that he learned of the search from Ms. Mullins on Sept. 30 or Oct. 1.
Mr. Baker insisted that no one at the State Department was "feeding a 'blow by blow' account of the progress of the file search to the White House," Mr. Funk reported.
 
'From Credible Sources'
 Attorney General Barr said on Nov. 16 the Justice Department became aware of suspicions that Ms. Mullins had been involved in the search of Mr. Clinton's passport files.
"Information was also received suggesting that Mullins may have made false statements to agents of the State Department Office of the Inspector General who were investigating the circumstances surrounding the search," Mr. Barr said. He concluded that "the allegations against Mullins were specific and from credible sources." The sources, he said, included Elizabeth M. Tamposi, an Assistant Secretary of State who was dismissed from her job on Nov. 10.
In the campaign, President Bush raised many questions about Mr. Clinton's character. He suggested that Mr. Clinton had been unpatriotic in demonstrating against the Vietnam War when Mr. Clinton was a student in Britain in 1969 and 1970. The Bush campaign also raised questions about Mr. Clinton's travel to Moscow in 1969.
 
Citizenship Issue Raised
 Republicans encouraged journalists to file requests under the Freedom of Information Act, to see if Mr. Clinton had ever tried to renounce his United States citizenship to avoid military service in Vietnam.
In his report, Mr. Funk said, "Ms. Mullins related that she had no idea how the rumors concerning Governor Clinton's citizenship and foreign travel got started, and all she knew about the department's handling of the Clinton F.O.I.A. requests was what she had read in the newspaper."
Mr. Funk said Ms. Mullins was in Ms. Tutwiler's office on the night of Sept. 30 when Ms. Tamposi tried to call Ms. Tutwiler to discuss the search.
Ms. Tutwiler "raised her eyebrows," refused to take the call and "told Ms. Mullins that she did not think it would be appropriate for her to become involved in the Clinton files matter," the inspector general said in his report.
This account suggests that Ms. Tutwiler knew enough about the search to avoid Ms. Tamposi's phone call. But Mr. Funk never explained how Ms. Tutwiler might have gained such knowledge, and Ms. Tutwiler has refused to discuss it.
The independent prosecutor was appointed under a section of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978. The special panel of three Federal judges exists exclusively for the purpose of appointing such prosecutors. The judges who named Mr. diGenova are David B. Sentelle, John D. Butzner and Joseph T. Sneed. Judge Sentelle was appointed to the Federal bench by President Ronald Reagan, Judge Butzner by President John F. Kennedy and Judge Sneed by President Richard M. Nixon.

The Saga of the Lonetree Landfill

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: EDGEMONT, S.D.

 BODY:
Had everything gone according to the plans of a Colorado entrepreneur named Hunter Swanson, the Burlington Northern Railroad the and waste-disposal giant Browning-Ferris Industries, a visitor heading south of town would see a stream of rail cars hauling bales of trash from around the nation to a modern, federally approved landfill.
Instead, where the arid rolling prairie drops away toward the rails and an abandoned Army munitions depot in the distance, one sees only subtle remnants of those plans. There's some graded land where preparation of Lonetree, as the stalled disposal site here is known, had begun, a low berm intended to direct rainfall away from the fill and three mounds built four years ago to test water flow through the soil and hundreds of feet of dense shale below it. A thin blanket of snow immobilizing the patches of sagebrush and native grass adds to the stillness. 
 The Nimby, or not-in-my-backyard, syndrome may still be the most frequent killer of plans put forward by business groups trying to profit from waste disposal. But the fate of Lonetree shows that overcoming even that barrier is no longer a guarantee of success. Indeed, most of the residents of this impoverished community have repeatedly voted for the landfill project.
Opposition, though, is no longer a local issue. The waste-disposal industry must now contend with environmental groups that oppose interstate transportation of wastes even when the goal is to get them to better disposal sites.
"Zero landfills may never be a reality but it's a good goal," said Kim Marie Kiepke, an environmental activist who lives in Rapid City and organized a statewide campaign that overturned the State Legislature's endorsement of the Lonetree project. She argues that building remote landfills like Lonetree undercuts pressure on people in populated areas to work harder on recycling and reducing the amount of waste they generate.
Moreover, landfill management is no longer the soaring profit generator it was only recently. Landfill operators have not been able to raise prices in many regions as rapidly as they had projected.
Average disposal costs to customers rose rapidly during the late 1980's, as much as 30 percent annually in some areas. But the annual rate of increase through October this year slowed to slightly more than 4 percent, according to an index published by Solid Waste Digest, a trade journal. In some areas, the costs have actually fallen. The City of Philadelphia's new disposal contract with Browning-Ferris is about 20 percent less than its recently expired contract with Waste Management Inc.
There are several reasons for the slowdown in price increases, including the nation's economic slump and the growth of recycling. The most important cause is the bidding war for waste in some regions among new incinerators, mega-fills and hundreds of older landfills scheduled for closing next fall when new Federal environmental regulations take effect. Prices should increase when the obsolete landfills are finally forced to close but no one is sure how quickly.
"Lonetree is wonderful from a geological point of view -- you couldn't get much better -- but even if all the cards fell right, it's no longer economical," said Philip Angell, administrative assistant to William D. Ruckelshaus, the chief executive of Browning-Ferris. The Houston-based disposal company, which is the nation's second largest after Waste Management, had signed preliminary agreements to be a major supplier of waste to Lonetree and invested nearly $2 million in the campaign to get the site up and running.
 
Lonetree's Roots
 Mr. Swanson, a former oil executive and teacher at the Colorado School of Mines, settled on the waste industry after a small oil-exploration company he headed was sold. South Dakota Disposal Systems, the venture that owns Lonetree, was formed after Mr. Swanson stumbled onto the site while scouting for sites along the Burlington Northern rail line suited for a new landfill.
The geology of the region had already attracted other disposal ventures, including a proposal by Chem Nuclear Systems Inc., a subsidiary of Chemical Waste Management Inc., to bury radioactive waste and a project to process and then bury sewage ash.
Edgemont, which has been fighting for survival since the decline of the local uranium mining and processing in the 1970's and reductions in local employment at the Burlington Northern railyard, welcomed all of the proposals. The sewage ash project received state approvals and began operations but soon went bankrupt, leaving the state to clean up.
Lonetree looked like more of a winner and, in 1989, earned a one-year operating permit from the South Dakota Bureau of Mining and Environment. A five-year extension was granted the following year, but the project had already been stopped by environmental groups.
In addition to litigation challenging both permits, Lonetree's opponents introduced an initiative requiring the State Legislature to vote on any landfill of more than 200,000 cubic yards -- a measure designed to focus on sites big enough to rely on out-of-state garbage. The initiative passed despite opposition from 90 percent of Edgemont's voters, 70 percent of the county's and the majority of voters in the western part of the state.
 
Approval Withdrawn
 Lonetree subsequently won a narrow approval in the Legislature and a an endorsement from Gov. George Mickelson, who said he opposed relying on out-of-state garbage for South Dakota's economic development but that the site was well designed.
Ms. Kiepke of the Rapid City-based Action for the Environment group quickly organized a referendum that in November overturned the Legislature's vote in a landslide.
Ms. Kiepke said that in retrospect it would have been "nice" to link the statewide votes to a proposal to provide some other form of economic development to the Edgemont area. She said the state had raised taxes to support an economic fund available to the town.
The suggestion draws a scornful reaction from Keith Andersen, an engineer here who had been hired as the site manager and hoped to be overseeing a staff of 50 local employees.
"They are going to create jobs where the votes are," Mr. Andersen said of the development fund. "That's political reality."
The Lonetree saga is far from over. There are several lawsuits pending, including a challenge in Federal court by South Dakota Disposal Systems to the constitutionality of the entire process by which South Dakota voters blocked the development and a claim in state court by Mr. Swanson and fellow investors for $100 million in damages from the state government. And Mr. Swanson has been talking to several Indian tribes about selling the site to them for $1. He hopes that Lonetree might be out of the reach of its opponents if it can be incorporated into tribal lands.
 
Doubts about Restarting Project
 Mr. Andersen said that he doubts that any developer would try to pick up where Mr. Swanson has left off, regardless of the environmental benefits of burying waste in sites like Edgemont rather than areas with much higher rainfall and water supplies that are more easily polluted by leakage. Others associated with the project are equally pessimistic.
Marvin Truhe, a Rapid City lawyer who has represented Lonetree in several suits, said that he had been shocked by the passions aroused by the proposal. "I've been representing mining companies seeking to expand in the Black Hills for 20 years and I thought that was a red-hot issue," he said. "But it's about a tenth of what you get when you start talking about importing garbage."

2 Retired Officers to Return to I.B.M.

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
I.B.M. said yesterday that it had recalled two senior executives from retirement to help run the giant computer maker less than a week after it announced a huge charge against earnings and another big round of job cutbacks.
The fact that one of the returning executives was once the chief rival of John F. Akers, the chairman, for the company's top job is a sign that the move is intended to give the board an independent "second opinion" on management issues, according to industry analysts and former executives of the International Business Machines Corporation. 
 The two executives, Paul Rizzo and Kaspar Cassani, who will begin their new assignments in January, are being called back in the wake of the company's announcement last week that it would take a $6 billion charge in the 1992 fourth quarter and shed another 25,000 workers next year.
 
Areas of Expertise
 Mr. Rizzo, 64, who was passed over when Mr. Akers was selected to become chief executive in 1985, is known as a finance and planning expert. The Swiss-born Mr. Cassani, also 64, rose within the company's international ranks to become the head of the I.B.M. World Trade division before his retirement.
"These two are being called back to help out in a crisis," said John B. Jones Jr., an analyst for Salomon Brothers in San Francisco. "The board is clearly involved in this move."
Word of the return of Mr. Rizzo and Mr. Cassani circulated within the company Friday after Mr. Akers sent a brief memo to 100 executives. Their return was first reported yesterday in The Wall Street Journal.
In his memo, Mr. Akers said he had asked the two men to come back to serve as "counselors and advisers."
"Our work will benefit from their insight and seasoned judgment," he added.
A company spokesman, Rob Wilson, said yesterday that the two men would work "essentially as advisers to John Akers," adding that they would focus on increasing the independence of the I.B.M. business units.
A year ago, I.B.M. announced a sweeping reorganization to split itself into smaller entities, intended to give businesses like mainframes, work stations, personal computers, software and services more freedom to respond quickly to changes in the marketplace.
Yet the hoped-for transformation has gone more slowly than anticipated at a time when the pace of change in the computer industry has accelerated, especially the shift from I.B.M.'s traditional strength, mainframe computers, to small but increasingly powerful personal computers and work stations.
"Rizzo and Cassani are not being brought in to change the strategy but to help speed up the execution of the strategy," said Sam Albert, a former I.B.M. executive who is a consultant in Scarsdale, N.Y.
Mr. Akers will not be formally sharing duties or responsibilities with the other two men in an "office of the chief executive," a mechanism some other companies have used to force chief executives to share power. And the company insists that the decision to invite Mr. Rizzo and Mr. Cassani back was made by Mr. Akers.
 
Speculations on Motives
 Still, the move is unusual, and such actions are rarely taken single-handedly by chief executives who decide they want more help. Besides, analysts note, I.B.M.'s share price has plunged from $100 in the summer to $48.875 yesterday, down $2.50 for the day. Bringing back the two executives does show a sense of urgency on the part of the board and management, seeking to ease the concerns of the company's many disgruntled investors.
Whether the return of Mr. Rizzo and Mr. Cassani will help I.B.M. is uncertain, analysts say. Though respected as seasoned managers, they come from the same mainframe-dominated era as Mr. Akers.
"They may be independent from Akers, but Rizzo and Cassani are I.B.M. hard-liners, reared in the I.B.M. way," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix. "It's sort of like bringing back Brezhnev's cronies to reform the Russian economy."
Mr. Cassani, a director of the Institute for International Management Development in Lausanne, Switzerland, could not be reached for comment yesterday. Mr. Rizzo, who recently stepped down as dean of the business school at the University of North Carolina, did not return a call yesterday to his home.

HEADLINE: Tax Politics Last of four articles.

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 21

 BODY:
When Margaret Thatcher became Prime Minister in 1979, the top personal income tax rate was 83 percent, a level that she said sapped incentives to work harder and create more wealth. In a policy shift foreshadowing similar though less drastic moves across the Atlantic, Britain drove down the top rate over several years to 40 percent, where it remains today.
But reductions for people in the middle-income brackets were considerably less, and for all taxpayers, loopholes were tightened or eliminated. And as income tax rates fell, the Government was raising other taxes, most notably the value-added tax, a form of sales tax on goods at the retail, wholesale and producer levels. That levy, which stood at 8 percent in 1979, is now 17.5 percent. 
 The result: a continued increase in overall taxation even during the heyday of a tax-cutter as fervent as Mrs. Thatcher.
 
Upward Pattern Holds True
 As the world's other major industrial democracies have struggled to find tax policies that balance deficit reduction, economic stimulus, pork-barrel politics and social welfare concerns, much the same pattern has held true.
"The public image of what's happened in many countries is that there have been reasonably significant and in some cases dramatic reductions in tax rates," said Jonathan I. Leape, a lecturer in economics at the London School of Economics. But, Mr. Leape said, the amount of taxes people pay has not changed much. In some cases, it has actually increased.
In most countries, public resistance to higher or new taxes has been relatively muted, particularly in comparison with the United States, where the political sensitivity to raising taxes in any form has remained extremely high.
Taxpayers in the United States continue to pay less on a relative basis than their counterparts in almost any other industrialized country. And while nations from Spain to Japan have significantly expanded their use of consumption taxes such as a value-added tax or levies on specific products like gasoline, the United States has remained largely dependent on levies on income and profits.
Economists say it is difficult to isolate the effect of tax-policy changes on economic growth and a nation's fiscal condition, since other factors, including reductions in government spending, play key roles as well. But they said the rising tax burdens in many nations had helped bring deficits down over the last decade.
 
A Choice for Clinton
 In the United States, by contrast, the Federal budget deficit has continued rising over the last decade. And although consumption taxes such as a value-added tax have problems -- they risk putting a higher proportional burden on less affluent taxpayers -- economists said the incoming Clinton Administration might have no choice but to consider them if it was serious about eventually reducing the deficit.
"It would seem that in the U.S. there is not really a lot of room to increase personal or corporate taxes," said Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International Economics in Washington. "There is hardly any way Clinton can achieve his targets for deficit reduction unless he goes with a V.A.T. or a broad-based energy tax."
Among the 24 industrialized nations that are members of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, an international research center based in Paris, total tax revenue as a percentage of gross domestic product increased from an average of 35.2 percent in 1980 to 38.8 percent in 1990, despite widespread cuts in top personal income tax rates and some reductions in corporate rates.
Even excluding social security taxes, which are rising rapidly in many nations to finance retirement and unemployment programs, tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product increased from 26.9 percent in 1980 to 29.5 percent a decade later, the O.E.C.D. said.
In the United States, tax revenues as a percentage of gross domestic product increased only to 29.9 percent in 1990 from 29.5 percent in 1980. Excluding social security, the figure actually fell to 21.1 percent from 21.8 percent over that period.
 
True Picture Masked
 But the general trends mask to some degree the widely varying policies enacted in individual nations, each coping with its own political and economic circumstances. And the gross figures mask essential differences between the United States and most other industrialized countries, where, for instance, national health programs are paid for with tax money and gasoline taxes help pay for mass transit. Gas taxes in the United States as high as those in Europe -- which can be as high as 200 percent -- would be impracticable and even unwise, economists argue, because of the vast distances that must be traveled in areas with sparse populations.
Germany had been cutting rates over the last decade, dropping the maximum rate on personal income to 50 percent from 53 percent in 1990. But the staggering costs of reunification with East Germany forced an increase last year in taxes on cigarettes and gasoline, among other goods and services, and a one-year "solidarity" tax -- a 7.5 percent surcharge on gross personal income -- that expired in July.
In Spain, taxes have been rising as the Government scrambles under a tax-and-spend policy to modernize the country and bring its economy into line with the richer European Community nations.
Still, most nations have been generally guided by the notion that rates should be reduced, but that taxes should be levied more broadly and more fairly.
"The predominant trend has been to cut the tax rate and to make up the revenue by widening the tax base," said Jeffrey Owens, the head of the fiscal affairs department at the O.E.C.D. in Paris.
 
France's About-Face
 In France, the Socialist Party Government of President Francois Mitterrand has since 1983 pursued policies designed to favor investment, capital accumulation and personal income -- counterbalanced by high taxes on consumption. The approach was a radical about-face for a Government that had nationalized state industries.
"The French looked at what Reaganism was supposed to do, and really did it," said Jack Anderson, a tax specialist and partner at HSD-Ernst & Young in Paris. "Mitterrand looked to traditional market-oriented ideas to get him out of a recession that his socialist ideas had gotten him into."
Since 1983, France has reduced top corporate income tax rates to 34 percent from 52 percent. Capital gains taxes are low by the standards of the United States. Personal income taxes are progressive, with about half the population paying none at all, and the other half paying a marginal rate that rises to 57 percent for a single person with earnings of more than $75,000.
The Socialist Government has also imposed a special tax surcharge on the assets of wealthy individuals. A tax of five-tenths of a percent is applied to houses, boats, savings and other assets valued above about $828,000, with the rate increasing to 1.5 percent on assets exceeding $8 million. The proceeds of the tax are earmarked for redistribution as a "minimum revenue" of about $400 a month for individuals without other means of support.
Social security taxes remain high in France. And as in many nations, value-added taxes have been rising and remain high.
Value-added taxes are levied every time goods change hands, through the entire production and distribution chain. But the full levy is only borne by the ultimate consumer, because buyers at each stage of the chain can deduct the tax on all but the value they add to the product. (Food and other essentials are often exempt.)
But consumption taxes are by no means without their problems. Japan, like the United States, has traditionally relied primarily on personal income and corporate profit taxes. When Japan introduced a 3 percent value-added tax in 1989, it was accompanied by a reduction in the top personal income tax rate from 60 percent to 50 percent, and by a reduction in the number of tax brackets from 12 to 5.
But the net effect has been an increased burden on most taxpayers.
With Japan's economy slumping, the ensuing reduction in consumer spending has dampened hopes of a consumer-led recovery. And it has led to complaints that the value-added tax has made the Japanese system more regressive -- that is, more of the tax burden is falling on the less affluent.


GRAPHIC: Taxpayers everywhere complain thay they pay too much. Especially in the United states, public debate on economic and fiscal matters has come to be colored by a pervasive assumption that taxes take too much of the national income, sapping growth and putting the country at a competitive disadvantage.
Graphs: "America the Tax Haven"
 Comparative statistics tell a different story.
 By the measure of total tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product, the United States now taxes its economy much less than most other developed nations. One reason why: Many developed nations pay for universal health care with tax money.
 In the chart, figures for the United States are superimposed on those of other countries for comparision.
 Graphs compare total U.S. tax receipts as a percentage of gross domestic product to commensurate statistics compiled on eight other nations. Data is tracked yearly from 1980 to 1990. (Source: Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development)

HEADLINE: Nonprofit Theaters Turn to Gimmicks To Lure Subscribers

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
Here are a few ideas for selling theater subscriptions:
*Mail your brochures to Lands' End catalogue regulars. 
 *Offer free wine tasting and free chocolate sundaes.
*Start a gay-and-lesbian singles series.
*Fly a banner over Fire Island.
These are strategies cooked up by some of New York's nonprofit theater companies, whose heavy reliance on subscription sales has resulted in a keen competition to find a broader audience.
 
Competition: Helpful or Hurtful?
 The rivalry has paid dividends to several companies, among them the Manhattan Theater Club and the Roundabout Theater Company, whose aggressive and imaginative campaigns have lured new subscribers.
And it may have hurt others, especially at a time when few people believe that the theater audience is growing. At least one company's distress suggests that the increased competition may be creating a Darwinian situation. Circle in the Square, the 41-year-old company which has had continuing financial problems, is seen by many theater people as a victim of the subscription wars. The company announced last month that it was delaying its season opening until February, since it had raised only $90,000 of the $200,000 needed to produce a revival of "The Apple Cart," by George Bernard Shaw. If it cannot conclude current negotiations to bring in a new February production, the company's season may not begin until April.
Theodore Mann, the company's artistic director, denied that the company was suffering from competition from other theaters. "The Roundabout and the National Actors Theater aren't taking away our audiences," he said. "Our troubles are part of the retrenchment that has hit the theater industry in the recession."
He added that Circle subscribers "are loyal and will continue to support us, since we've had to postpone our season four or five times before."
Barry Grove, the managing director of the Manhattan Theater Club, took issue with the commonly held notion that each theater had a unique group of subscribers. To Mr. Grove, the pool of potential subscribers is strongly defined, so it is essential for companies to stress their differences.
"In a sense, we're all marketing to the same group," he said, referring to the sorts of theatergoers -- largely middle-aged and upper middle-class -- that kept the company's last production, "Joined at the Head," 90 percent subscribed during its six-week initial run.
"But each theater has a different constituency based on its style and its programming," he added. "We're all trying to underscore our uniqueness."
 
Looking Beyond the 'Regulars'
 Studies by the League of American Theaters and Producers show that while nearly half of Broadway's annual audience of 7.3 million comes from outside the New York metropolitan area, out-of-towners account for only a small fraction of the audience for nonprofit companies.
Theater marketing experts talk about "regulars," "occasionals" and "nevers." The core audience for nonprofit theaters is made up of the "regulars," a devoted group that attends the theater nearly once a month, and some much more. No statistics exist on the number of regulars, but marketers estimate it from 100,000 to 200,000, most of them Manhattanites, with a smattering in the other boroughs and the suburbs.
This group, however, "just isn't enough," said Helene Davis, the director of press and marketing at the Manhattan Theater Club. That's where innovation and gimmickry come in.
The Manhattan Theater Club, which has been testing different mailing lists, recently had some success flirting with younger, upscale types by dipping into the lists of Lands' End and Williams-Sonoma catalogue users in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. "We try 50,000 more each time we send out our brochures," Ms. Davis said.
The company has also experimented with tailoring promotions to specific productions. To build a black audience for "Boesman and Lena" last season, for instance, Ms. Davis invited black opinion leaders from churches, schools and cultural institutions, and asked for help in getting the word out to their constituents.
 
'It Helped Sell Tickets'
 And on the Labor Day weekend two years ago, the company rented a seaplane to fly a banner for "Lips Together, Teeth Apart" -- a play set at a beach house on Eastern Long Island -- over Fire Island and the Hamptons. "It gave the show prominence, it helped sell tickets and it reached people who might never ordinarily come to the theater," Ms. Davis said. "And we got to go to the beach just to see it."
Whether or not the seaplane helped, Manhattan Theater Club's subscription campaign this year is sold out at 15,500, and there is a waiting list of several hundred.
The Circle Repertory Company (not related to Circle in the Square) has also targeted specific groups. For several of its recent offerings, including "The Baltimore Waltz" and "The Destiny of Me," both of which have gay themes, the company promoted group sales to the Gay Men's Health Crisis, the Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and other organizations. Tanya Berezin, the company's artistic director, said the effort "seems to help our general sales, not just gay-themed plays." "The community has a lot of disposable income, in terms of marketing, and we are grateful for their support," she added.
 
Tickets $1 and Up
 Other theaters are trying an all-inclusive strategy. The New York Shakespeare Festival has started a Pay-What-You-Can Series at the Public Theater. At one designated performance of every play this season, audiences can pay whatever they want. At the first such event, a matinee of "Texts for Nothing" starring Bill Irwin, 92 people showed up in the 100-seat theater, paid from $1 to $25 for admittance, and the take was $493.25, according to Jason Steven Cohen, the Festival's producing director. (On the average regular-price night it was about $2,000.)
Every nonprofit theater is seeking younger audiences, though it isn't easy to lure them. The very idea of subscribership is impractical for many patrons in their 20's and 30's. "They have to come up with a big chunk of money at one time, and settle their schedule months in advance," said Henry Guettel, the executive director of the Theater Development Fund. "It's not exactly like deciding to go to a movie."
There have been some triumphs, however. About a year ago, the Roundabout Theater Company put a tiny item in its regular subscription brochure "announcing a singles series offering complementary refreshments after the show," said Todd Haimes, the company's producing director. "Suddenly we'd sold out 250 subscriptions in one week."
The success of the series has engendered five different singles nights, including one for lesbians and gay men, and has been rewarded with that 90's marketing trophy, a corporate sponsor. The program is now officially the Johnny Walker Black Singles Series.
 
For Children and Tea Sippers
 The new Roundabout brochure also offers the Wine-Tasting Series, the Gallery Series, the Tea Series, the Sundae Series (free sundaes offered in a Sunday series) and the Early-to-Bed Series (five plays with a 7 P.M. curtain). And the company is offering reduced-price tickets for children ages 10 to 18 as part of the parents' subscription. "A lot of families have told us they'd like some encouragement in going to the theater together," Mr. Haimes said.
A more flexible and spontaneous alternative to subscriptions is the membership approach, of which the Lincoln Center Theater is the most successful practitioner. For an annual $25 fee, members can attend a play for $15 and a musical for $20. The membership list of 47,000 is closed, and there is a waiting list of several thousand, according to Thomas Cott, the theater's director of marketing.
This season, as last, the principal advertising strategy of the year-old National Actors Theater has been based on the familiarity of the company's founder and director, Tony Randall, who has tirelessly plugged his company on radio, television and in newspapers. It has also made a selling point of its celebrity actors, including, this season, Tyne Daly, Jon Voight, Rip Torn and Natasha Richardson. Mr. Randall's media blitz, and perhaps the novelty of a new company with big names, worked better last year, when the company drew 28,000 subscribers. This year subscriptions have dropped to 21,000.
Of course, there is the rare institutional theater that has no need to resort to aggressive marketing. Playwrights Horizons is one, regularly selling out its 146-seat house with 4,000 subscribers and 1,600 members. Through the years the theater has had some success in using the L. L. Bean mailing list, but right now, said Paul S. Daniels, the theater's executive director, "We don't want to have too many subscribers: we're full up as it is."

HEADLINE: TV SPORTS;
At Least Handley Has Admirers at One Network

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
If NBC's Bob Trumpy sounded a bit like Alan M. Dershowitz last Saturday in defense of Giants Coach Ray Handley -- "No one deserves the disrespect Ray Handley's gotten the past six weeks" the analyst said during the Giants' 35-21 upset of the Kansas City Chiefs -- well, Trumpy had an extremely willing client.
(Handley has another defender, too; the MSG Network's acerbic Bob Page, who says only "psychopathic murderers" deserve the bile Handley has swallowed.) 
 Handley evidently made quite an impression on Trumpy and his partner, Dick Enberg, during an hour-long production meeting last Friday. To Trumpy, whose penchant for outspokenness is matched only by the maligned coach's mishandling of the news media, Handley was everything the local media said he wasn't.
"He's a solid guy who spoke freely about his situation and his mistakes," Trumpy said yesterday. "He didn't know us, never met us, but he was very forthright. Lots of coaches give you canned answers. We've spoken to a lot of N.F.L. coaches this year, but I don't know of another coach who was more candid than Ray Handley. Coaches don't like to talk about their mistakes with strangers. It was refreshing. He was terrific, wonderful."
And get this: Trumpy said Handley's got a vision for the future. (And nobody, in his talks with players and coaches, mentioned Bill Parcells.)
Terrific? Wonderful? The vision thing? Is Trumpy just being a contrarian? No, he was dead serious. Was he really talking about Ray Handley, arch-enemy of inquisitors like WWOR/Channel 9's Russ Salzberg? Yup!
Maybe Handley has merely presented a hate-the-media front for his 31-game career, and Trumpy found The Real Original Honest-to-Goodness Ray, who cozied up to NBC's No. 1 football analyst with hitherto unseen charm.
Trumpy and Enberg, who call American Football Conference games and were unfamiliar with the Giants and Handley, are like all network TV teams, who have an edge over local news media: the N.F.L. requires that coaches talk to them. Network crews arrive at game sites a day or two in advance and speak with coaches and players. The local news media, however, are the teams' full-time companions.
"I had no sense he was setting us up," Trumpy said of Handley. "I don't think he's that good an actor. We didn't fawn over him or give him false praise. But we said on the air, 'Say what you will about Ray Handley, but if the players have jumped ship, how do you account for them playing so well in the water?' "
Trumpy added: "We'd read the press's slant, and now we had his slant. Things aren't so cut and dried or simplistic as we've seen in the press. He said the problems with the team don't go away if he goes away -- which a lot of the press ignores. What we saw from the press is now what we saw in Ray Handley."
Hearing Trumpy's and Enberg's on-air views of Handley irked Salzberg, who said that in order to know and judge Handley, the coach must be seen regularly.
"Bob and Dick are entitled to their opinion, but they don't see Ray Handley week after week like we do," said Salzberg, who admits he's a sentry on the Handley Unemployment Watch. "They went after the media in defending Handley. I heard Enberg say, 'What a gentleman he is.' But Handley walked out on us, prolonged the quarterback controversy, cut our interview time and changed schedules on us. They had an hour production meeting with Handley? Well, Handley has to cooperate with them. They're the network. How would they have felt if Handley was a no-show at their meeting?"
 
Packer's Views
 The CBS college basketball analyst, Billy Packer, is certain of one thing at this stage of the season: After a top seven of North Carolina, Duke, Kansas, Indiana, Kentucky, Seton Hall and Michigan, "the next batch of teams will have a hard time breaking into the top."
His surprise team so far is Arkansas, which lost Lee Mayberry, Todd Day and Oliver Miller to pro careers, but "they're winning in tough environments, and Corliss Williamson has been hurt." North Carolina is next: "They were a sophomore team last year; they've gone from kids to men. They've buried some teams."
On the ascension of last year's college stars: "Look how many guys are not only having productive N.B.A. careers, but are starring, like Shaquille O'Neal, Alonzo Mourning, Walt Williams, Christian Laettner and Tom Gugliotta. And Jimmy Jackson isn't even playing. . . . More kids are playing basketball than any other sport, and that bodes well for the future of the N.B.A."
On Jerry Tarkanian's brief coaching career with the San Antonio Spurs: "Pro and college basketball are so different that unless you've had prior background in them, you're ill-equipped. The relationship of a college coach to the athletic director is far different from a pro coach's relationship to the general manager. I doubt anybody at U.N.L.V. ever told Tark to change his offense, but he asks the Spurs' owner for a point guard and he's told, 'No!' "
 
AIRWAVES
 MAGIC JOHNSON returns Friday as an NBC analyst for the Spurs-Clippers game. He will work eight other regular season games, the All-Star Game and the playoffs. . . . WNBC-TV's broadcast of the Knicks-Celtics game drew a local Nielsen rating of 5.8, or about 391,471 TV households, not good enough "4 New York." BILL BOLSTER, the station manager, said: "I thought it would do a 10." Would he want another game from the MSG Network, which paid $80,000 for the time? "Not if I thought it would do another 6." Take heart, Bill, Channel 9's Nets-Pacers telecast Saturday night earned a mere 2.2. . . . The WPIX/ Channel 11 telecast of the Jets-Dolphins game Sunday produced a 6.6 rating, or 445,467 TV households, double the usual rating in that time period.

HEADLINE: The Time of the Cuckoo

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis; Flora Lewis is Senior Columnist of The New York Times.

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
Russia's Foreign Minister, Andrei Kozyrev, stuns the 50 other ministers at the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe by promising help for Serbia from "Greater Russia" and reviving the harshest cold war rhetoric.
Walter Russell Mead, a foreign policy expert, writes in the academic World Policy Journal that the U.S. can restore its own frontiersman vigor and solve Russia's dangerous economic and social distress by buying Siberia "at a fair price -- perhaps in the range of two or three trillion dollars." He acknowledges that is a lot more than the per acre price paid for Alaska but points out that "real estate, oil and gold are all up since 1867, and the dollar is down." 
 There is such a confusion of proposals and arguments about how to meet what the French analyst Dominique Moisi calls "the challenge of the new world disorder" that these suggestions have a point. It is the time of the cuckoo; anything might be possible. When the shock had sunk in, Mr. Kozyrev took the floor to explain he had performed a charade. But he wasn't joking. He was forewarning what the world would hear from Moscow if the nationalist-Communist opposition to President Boris Yeltsin came to power. "They talk of shock therapy," he told correspondents. "Well, this is shock diplomacy."
Mr. Mead's article is full of statistics, economic models and predictions about how U.S. development of Siberia could lead to wiping out the budget deficit, bring manufacturing jobs to revitalize America's inner cities and "rediscover a sense of national unity and purpose." It sparks visions of a Wild East division of the new frontier, maybe a compelling Hollywood genre about tough, self-reliant engineers versus rampaging Cossacks -- which, of course, would be called Easterns.
Mr. Mead argues cogently: "Given its social and economic problems, it is not surprising that Russian democracy is under attack. If democracy cannot guarantee a decent standard of living for the people and cannot show that Russia is respected abroad, it has little future in that proud and angry land." So selling Siberia to the U.S. is the best way to solve Russia's problems, he suggests. It would make "Russia a stronger country and not just a richer one," and with the vast capital transfer "Russia can begin to advance into the first world, rather than sliding into the third.
"The small nationalities of the region would receive settlements based on the recent settlements of indigenous land claims in Alaska. All the inhabitants of Siberia would become American citizens with all the rights and privileges the rest of us enjoy plus the right to use their native languages in official business in the new territories . . . . Those who choose to live under Russian rule would be free to leave with guaranteed fair compensation for any property left behind."
Siberia would be divided into territories that could admitted to the Union with rights equal to the 50 states. Echoes of Jonathan Swift's modest proposal to resolve the Irish famine by eating the children? But if this is satire (Mr. Mead calls his article "A Modest Proposal"), there is nothing inhumane in it. And the purchase of Alaska from Russia by Abraham Lincoln's Secretary of State used to be called "Seward's Folly." No longer.
Since earnest people aren't making much sense about the world these days, it may be worth listening to the far-out fantasticks.

HEADLINE: What Global Warming?

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Cheapest Protection of Nature May Lie In Taxes, Not Laws" (Science Times, Nov. 24) echoes the theme that bad taxes become good taxes (alias "green fees") when they tax "bad" things. According to the article, these include fossil fuels, traffic and household garbage. 
 While tax policy can affect behavior, misguided tax policy can dampen economic prosperity in attempting to solve problems that might not exist or that could be solved in less onerous ways. The World Resources Institute study you cite asks Americans to pay higher energy prices to prevent catastrophic global warming.
But there is considerable debate on whether or not man-made greenhouse gases (produced primarily by burning fossil fuels) are triggering a dangerous "global warming" trend. At an international meeting of climate experts in 1990, an intergovernmental panel on climate change concluded that "it is impossible to prove a cause and effect relationship" between man-made emissions and global warming. In the 1992 supplement to that report, the scientists stated, "It is still not possible to attribute with high confidence all, or even part of, the observed global warming to the enhanced greenhouse effect."
We know that climate change over the last 100 years is well within the planet's natural variation (the global climate has never been "stable"). If scientists don't agree that man-made global warming is a problem, does the United States want to pay the costs incurred from an energy tax, including a diminished competitive position with our trading partners? A major Japanese Government agency has backed away from a carbon tax because of its impact on industry. You cite a $5 trillion price tag in the study.
The American business community has made significant improvements in energy efficiency and now spends approximately $100 billion a year complying with environmental regulations. These improvements have resulted in a substantial reduction in greenhouse gas emissions.
A green fee is a carbon tax, and a carbon tax is an energy tax. That translates into higher prices, lost jobs, reduced paychecks and slower growth.

HEADLINE: The Great Giveaway Game

BYLINE: By Tony Snow; Tony Snow is deputy assistant to the President for media affairs.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
It's official: The 90's is the Decade of Inclusion. Bill Clinton has made "inclusion" a hallmark of his permanent campaign, offering balm, bucks and solemnities to all. And some Republicans, eager to prove they are not Bible Belt Torquemadas, also pose as partisans of the open door.
The battle for inclusion represents the latest installment in both parties' struggle to seize the great American middle ground. For them, "inclusion" provides a much-needed nonce word -- a cozy, empty, inviting euphemism for "pandering." 
 During Bill Clinton's two-day encounter session for policy wonks, he invariably mentioned "inclusion" in the context of spending. That thrilled his audience, which included academics auditioning for Administration jobs and philanthropically correct capitalists on the prowl for favors. Despite his insistence on political novelty, Bill Clinton apparently intends to build inclusion the old-fashioned way, by purchasing constituencies one at a time. No fireside chats for the man from Arkansas: His bully pulpit will be an anchor chair on the political equivalent of the Home Shopping Network.
He's not alone. Impressed by Mr. Clinton's success at the polls, a group of moderate Republicans recently put in its bid to play the Inclusion Game. Representative Tom Campbell of California announced the formation of the Republican Majority Coalition by declaring, "We are inclusive, not exclusive." He and his co-founders want to build a party that steers clear of controversies about "values." They vow to avoid vexing moral quandaries, from abortion to the teaching of ethics in schools.
These make-nice Republicans have taken up the mantle of the Laodiceans, whom the Book of Revelations says were "neither cold nor hot . . . [but] lukewarm." Yet like the Laodiceans, they invite contempt. Having given up the chance to define themselves by principles, they can define themselves only by dollars-and-cents promises. At best, they can create cover for libertarians in the Republican fold.
The efforts of Mr. Clinton and the new Republican faction may backfire. The problem with pandering is that it really gets people's avarice flowing. It only creates more special interests and sets them against one other in the struggle for loose Federal funds. As Government grows, so do divisions.
The feud was joined even before the election. President Bush was stunned at the second debate, a question-and-answer session, when speaker after speaker rose in anger to demand something from Washington. Finally, the President said in exasperation, "Every question, almost, says how much more money can you spend from the Federal Government."
If our two political parties are to create a culture of inclusion, they will have to stop encouraging the base instincts of greed and envy and begin appealing to what Lincoln called "the better angels of our nature." They will have to stand for something, stake out clear principles and invite Americans to support a vision for America's present and future.
Haley Barbour, a candidate for Republican National Chairman, has noted that Ronald Reagan created a governing coalition with a "one-wing" party -- a party of predictable ideals and aims. That approach offers great dividends, but it also exposes politicians to the risk of having to say yes to some people and no to others, rather than offering pillowy reassurances to all.
The inclusion-by-pandering forces, in striving to offend no one, will offend everyone. They have laid themselves open to recriminations from people who, having concluded that Washington has become a clearinghouse for checks and perks, will never feel satisfied so long as someone else gets an unclaimed piece of the pie.
Bill Clinton and the Republican Majority Coalition understand that America desperately needs an uplifting politics of inclusion -- one that calls people to serve a higher mission and enables us to feel justly better about ourselves. Unfortunately, they miss out on the equally crucial corollary: You build movements around disciples, not supplicants.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
CHRISTOPHER AND ASPIN NAMED FOR STATE DEPT. AND PENTAGON

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 22

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton selected Warren M. Christopher as Secretary of State and Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin as Secretary of Defense today, making them the two anchors of a foreign policy team that draws heavily from the last Democratic Administration.
In a news conference here today, Mr. Clinton also nominated R. James Woolsey Jr., a 51-year-old former under secretary of the Navy and arms negotiator to be Director of Central Intelligence, Anthony Lake, 53, a professor at Mount Holyoke College, as his national security adviser and Madeleine Albright, 55, a political scientist, to be the United States chief delegate to the United Nations.
 
'No Longer a Simple Place'
 In his comments today, as in the appointments themselves, Mr. Clinton shed little new light on his foreign policy views. 
 "We must act to curb the spread of weapons of mass destruction, to counter terrorism and to prevent the degradation of our global environment," he said in a voice rendered hoarse from seasonal allergies. "The world is no longer a simple place with clear choices. As we enter the 21st century, American foreign policy will require steady hands, bold new thinking and the strength and courage to advance our American values." [Excerpts from the news conference, page A14.]
Except for Mr. Aspin, 54, all of the major appointees Mr. Clinton announced today served in President Carter's Administration. In reaching deep into the Democratic Party's stockpile of foreign policy experts for his Cabinet, Mr. Clinton, a former Governor who during his campaign sought to prove his credentials in foreign affairs, seemed to signal a preference for experienced professionals over the younger generation of foreign policy intellectuals.
 
Emphasis on Teamwork
 Indeed, in contrast to these intellectuals, who have produced a growing body of philosophical writings on the world after the cold war, those on Mr. Clinton's national security team have disclosed little of their views on the major foreign policy issues facing the United States.
Instead, Mr. Clinton seemed to choose the group more out of a sense that it would work together as a team, avoiding clashes that have often characterized relations between the Departments of State and Defense, or between the Secretary of State and the national security adviser.
In selecting Mr. Aspin, who is chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, Mr. Clinton turned once again to Congress to fill a critical position in his Administration. Mr. Aspin said his primary challenges will be coping with reducing the size of the military while maintaining readiness in a changing global environment.
"The Clinton team faces a big job with a big payoff for America and I am proud to be part of it," Mr. Aspin said.
Mr. Clinton has already selected Senator Lloyd Bentsen, the Texas Democrat who is Finance Committee chairman, and Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee, to major economic posts. Representative Mike Espy is still considered the leading contender to become Secretary of Agriculture.
Mr. Christopher, 67, is a Los Angeles lawyer who was Deputy Secretary of State under President Carter and has become a close Clinton adviser as well as his transition director.
 
Priorities of Administration
 He said his appointment today was a "dream come true" and said Mr. Clinton was right when he said that domestic and foreign policy concerns must hold equal sway now that the cold war has ended.
"In confronting these new challenges, we must remain cognizant that a great power requires not only military might but a powerful economy at home, an economy prepared for global competition," Mr. Christopher said. "In today's world, that means that foreign policy and domestic policy must be addressed simultaneously, not sequentially, or else neither will be successful for very long."
Mr. Clinton also used his national security appointments to demonstrate his commitment to what Vice President-elect Al Gore called the need "to build a bipartisan base of support for diplomacy through strength and for an activist U.S. role in the world."
Mr. Woolsey is a conservative Democrat and confidant of both President Bush's national security adviser, Brent Scowcroft, and Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia. A retired army captain, Mr. Woolsey worked as Mr. Scowcroft's chief aide on a commission he headed in the early 1980's that recommended development of the mobile, single-warhead intercontinental ballistic missile known as the Midgetman.
 
Posts Still Unfilled
 If he is to meet his self-imposed Christmas deadline for announcing all of his major Cabinet selections, Mr. Clinton must still appoint an Attorney General, an Interior Secretary, an Agriculture Secretary and a Transportation Secretary. He said today that there was a "good chance" he could meet that deadline but that some other Administration jobs, presumably on the White House staff, would not be filled until after the New Year.
A new possibility for either Attorney General or White House counsel might be Zoe Baird, the general counsel for Aetna Life Insurance in Connecticut, who met with Mr. Clinton here earlier this week. Vernon Jordan, the transition chairman and the only man who had been thought to be under consideration for Attorney General at one time, has taken himself out of the running for any Administration job, a senior transition official said.
Mr. Clinton must also select a United States Trade Representative.
Also within the foreign policy cluster, Mr. Clinton announced today that Dr. Clifton R. Wharton Jr., the former president of Michigan State University and chancellor of the State University of New York system, would be Deputy Secretary of State under Mr. Christopher. Samuel Berger, another Carter Administration veteran, was named deputy national security adviser.
 
National Security Aides
 Mr. Clinton said today that Mr. Berger's national security deputies would be Nancy Soderberg, who advised him during the campaign, and Leon Fuerth, who advised Mr. Gore.
In addition, Adm. William J. Crowe, who served as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President Reagan, would serve as chairman of the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a largely ceremonial post. Admiral Crowe, who came to Mr. Clinton's rescue during the campaign by endorsing him in the face of charges about his decision to avoid the Vietnam War-era draft, was not in Little Rock for the announcement today.
"I did not think I should appoint people who had not lived interesting, full, productive lives in which they had garnered the experience and the judgment necessary to fill these positions," Mr. Clinton said.
"But to say that this is a team of sort of retreads I think, which is the inference there, would be totally unfair to a sterling and diverse array of Americans who are here today. "
He said the mix of nominees he named today would assure "some continuity and some change."
 
Once on Kissinger Staff
 Mr. Lake, much like Mr. Clinton, is known as a mainstream Democrat who is open to rethinking the positions he takes on issues if he feels the situation warrants it. He supported United States involvement in Vietnam in the early 1960's, but resigned his position as special assistant to Henry A. Kissinger, then national security adviser to President Richard M. Nixon, as a protest over the decision to invade Cambodia.
"In 1972, he went to work for Ed Muskie, while Clinton went to work for George McGovern," said Peter W. Rodman, a fellow at the Johns Hopkins Foreign Policy Institute who worked for Mr. Lake under Mr. Kissinger. "That tells you everything."
Mr. Lake is also a Massachusetts farmer who had to be talked into giving up his cattle herd for life in Washington.
"I did it because the price of beef is down," Mr. Lake joked today.
 
A Veteran Educator
 Clifton R. Wharton Jr., Mr. Christopher's deputy, has more background in education as the former president of Michigan State University and chancellor of SUNY than he does in foreign policy. But he pointed out that he grew up the son of the first black career ambassador.
A former chairman of the Rockefeller Foundation and the chief executive officer of a major teachers' pension fund, Mr. Wharton said he chose to concentrate on the technical end of foreign economic development because he thought it would become a central part of United States policy.
"I believe that we in the United States must forge a foreign policy which is responsive to world needs for peace, for progress, as well as guaranteeing the strength of the United States," he said.
All of Mr. Clinton's nominees today took care to draw attention to the uncertainties they say remain in a world where ethnic and regional rivalries hold uncertainty and potential for danger.
"In a number of ways it is a more complex and difficult agenda even than that which existed before," Mr. Woolsey said.
But in one case, the knowledge that the agenda Mr. Clinton will inherit is very different than the one Mr. Bush faced, was the cause for some poignance today.
 
Pride and Tears
 Ms. Albright, a naturalized American citizen who was born in Czechoslovakia, recalled that her father, Joseph Korbel, came to the United States as a Czechoslovak diplomat and subsequently sought asylum.
"You can therefore understand how proud I will be to sit at the United Nations behind the nameplate that says United States of America," she said. Standing behind her, Mr. Clinton's eyes grew moist and he wiped them.
In appointing Ms. Albright, Mr. Clinton said he would make United Nations Representative a cabinet-level position in much the same way that he has promised to elevate the Environmental Protection Agency.
This would increase the number of women Mr. Clinton has appointed to his Cabinet so far to four, including the nominees for Secretary of Health and Human Services and Secretary of Energy. Mr. Clinton complained on Monday that women's groups were not giving him enough credit for drawing from their ranks for his administration. That criticism seemed a pre-emptive strike in anticipation of today's announcements, in which six white men, one black man and one woman were nominated to high positions in his Administration.
The Cabinet-level status is partly symbolic, but it would also give Ms. Albright her own line of access to the President that would not have to be funneled first through the State Department.
All of the appointees avoided answering questions about the foreign policy issues they expected to occupy them during their first days in office. Mr. Aspin, for instance, did an elaborate verbal sidestep when he was asked whether he would pursue Mr. Clinton's pledge to lift the ban on homosexuals in the military. But he said that current policy "has some serious flaws with it in terms of equity and in terms of fairness."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Bell Wins Approval for Fiber Optics

BYLINE: By JERRY GRAY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
State regulators today approved a $1.5 billion plan by New Jersey Bell to replace its entire network with fiber optics by the year 2010. The decision opens the way for New Jersey to become the first state with border-to-border fiber-optic telecommunications.
Such a network would give telephone customers access to vast amounts of information, establish two-way links between physicians and patients or teachers and distant classrooms and allow the reception of hundreds of television channels. 
 In exchange for the approval of the plan, the telephone company agreed to a seven-year freeze on its basic residential rates and its charges for two cheaper services aimed at low-income customers. Increases for other services would continue to be subject to the current review process by the state board. After 1999, regulators and the company are to develop a new rate schedule.
 
Fear of Phone Company
 The decision today "puts New Jersey firmly in the lead," said the chairman of the Board of Regulatory Commissioners, Edward H. Salmon, allowing the state "to set the pace in the realization of economic and social benefits."
Among those benefits are to be video telephones and access to vast pools of academic, financial and retail information made possible by faster and higher-quality communications links.
And in turn, New Jersey officials look forward to an unspecified increase in employment to set up the new system and hope that their state will be able to attract businesses because of the new services.
Fiber optics are hair-thin strands of glass that can relay billions of pieces of information in seconds. The prospect that the telephone company, with its huge resources and near monopoly, would build a vast network alarmed newspaper publishers and cable television operators.
Over their objections, the Legislature approved the Telecommunications Act of 1992, which allowed the broadest changes in the industry since the state began regulating it 80 years ago. Gov. Jim Florio signed the bill into law on Jan. 17.
 
'Level Playing Field'
 "This legislation established that it is state policy to permit the board to consider alternative forms of regulation in order to address changes in technology and the structure of the telecommunications industry, as well as to promote economic development," Mr. Salmon said.
But the New Jersey Press Association, the chief lobbying group for the state's newspaper publishers, and the New Jersey Cable Television Association argued that the legislation would allow New Jersey Bell to offer video billboard service and classified advertising, cutting into the profits of newspapers and cable companies. The publishers and the cable executives said that would give the telephone company an unfair competitive advantage.
"We support fiber optics," said John J. O'Brien, executive director of the press association. "The real crux of our problem with this whole deregulation plan is not that Bell shouldn't get into the information business, but we think they should play on the same field with the same rules as the rest of us."
 
15 Days of Testimony
 Mr. O'Brien cited the telephone company's guaranteed rate of return and its ability to go before the Board of Regulatory Commissioners with requests for rate increases as the most glaring examples of the unfair competitive edge.
Since January, the Board of Regulatory Commissioners has held three public hearings and listened to 15 days of testimony from officials on both sides of the issue.
Before giving its approval, the board amended New Jersey Bell's proposal to bar an increase in rates for basic residential telephone service until Dec. 31, 1999. Additionally, the board froze rates for two programs: low-message-use service, for customers who make limited use of their telephones or mostly take incoming calls, and "Link-Up America," a discounted charge to connect a telephone for certain customers, including the poor and disabled.
 
Paying for System
 Though the cost of the new network will ultimately be paid by New Jersey consumers, markedly higher service rates are not expected because of the potential profitability of the new services, officials of the telephone company and the regulatory board said. The board's approval was contingent upon New Jersey Bell's recouping its expenses by offering wider services instead of by raising rates drastically.
New Jersey Bell expects to finance the first part of the project by paying lower dividends to its parent company, Bell Atlantic, and by investing the retained earnings in the network, said a spokesman, James A. Smith.
Once the initial phase of the network is operational, by 1999 after an expenditure of $1 billion, Mr. Smith said, the company expects to use revenue from new services to complete the project.
New Jersey Bell was not required to project potential profits from the fiber-optic network, regulatory officials said, but the state board decided to limit profits on each service to 13.7 percent. Any excess profits are to be returned to customers. The company is expected to benefit from both wider services and lower operating costs.
The company provides telephone service to about 3.4 million customers, or 97 percent of the state, and will be able to provide its new services to the entire state.

HEADLINE: New York Court Shields Lawyers Who Report Dishonest Colleagues

BYLINE: By DAVID MARGOLICK

 BODY:
New York State's highest court ruled yesterday that law firms cannot dismiss lawyers for doing what their professional disciplinary rules require -- blowing the whistle on a dishonest colleague.
The court, the State Court of Appeals, has almost uniformly protected the rights of employers to dismiss almost any worker for almost any reason, at least when anti-discrimination laws do not apply. But given the role of lawyers as self-regulated officers of the court, the court held, in a 5-to-0 decision, that the rights of law firms must be read more narrowly. 
 The requirement that lawyers with evidence casting substantial doubt on "another lawyer's honesty, trustworthiness or fitness" inform disciplinary authorities is an implicit part of his employment contract with a law firm, the court held. When a firm discharges a lawyer for making such a report, it held, that firm can be sued for breach of contract.
 
'Survival of the Profession'
 Writing for the court, Judge Stewart F. Hancock Jr. said that no lawyer should have to choose between discharge for following the Code of Professional Responsibility or disbarment or suspension for failing to do so. He called the reporting requirement "nothing less than essential to the survival of the profession."
The ruling, which reversed two lower court decisions, came in the case of Howard L. Wieder, a lawyer who claims his former law firm, Feder, Kaszovitz, Isaacson, Weber & Skala of Manhattan, dismissed him five years ago for insisting it report a dishonest colleague to disciplinary authorities. With the court's decision yesterday, Mr. Wieder's lawsuit may now proceed to trial.
By protecting whistle-blowing lawyers against retaliatory discharge, the decision, apparently the first of its kind in the country, could compel the bar to police itself and weed out miscreants more conscientiously.
The decision also marked the court's most dramatic incursion to date into what has been, at least in New York, the largely sacrosanct right of employers to choose and lose employees at will. Those protections on the books in the state, for instance, for civil servants reporting official malfeasance, are there by statute, not court decision.
Twice before, the court has explicitly declined to protect whistle-blowers, claiming that, as it once said, "such a significant change in our law is best left to the Legislature."
Those decisions, the court noted, involved financial managers in large corporations, who are "intrinsically different" from lawyers, because lawyers are not just employees of law firms but also court officers, "responsible in a broader public sense for their professional obligations."
 
Ramifications Unclear
 "Insisting that as an associate in their employ, plaintiff must act unethically and in violation of one of the primary rules," Judge Hancock wrote, "amounted to nothing less than a frustration of the only legitimate purpose of the employment relationship."
Former Chief Judge Sol Wachtler, who heard the case when it was argued in October but who resigned in November after his arrest on extortion charges, did not participate in the decision. Nor did the court's newest member, Judge George Bundy Smith.
Wayne Outten of Lankenau, Kovner & Bickford, an employment law specialist who unsuccessfully represented another whistle-blower before the court, said the decision marked the first time the court has recognized that the right of employers to dismiss employees at will was subject to any implied limitations. Its potential ramifications, he said, were "hard to figure."
"It could be limited to associates in law firms, but it could be applied to other professions, such as doctors, nurses and accountants," he said. "Now that the door has been opened, it's unclear what claims and employees the courts will allow in."
 
Law Firm Welcomes a Trial
 As it has in the past, the court declined to recognize a more general right of employees to sue for "abusive discharge," a cause of action in several other states, despite what the court called the "persuasive" arguments and "compelling" circumstances of Mr. Wieder's case.
Law firms, fearing the loss of clients, bad publicity or higher insurance premiums, have often been hard on any whistle-blowers.
"Study after study nationwide reflects that lawyers don't report misconduct by other lawyers," said Mr. Wieder's lawyer, David Vladeck of Public Citizen Litigation Group in Washington, D.C. "This decision basically opens the door for lawyers to fulfill their ethical and moral duty."
Lawyers at Feder, Kaszovitz have denied that Mr. Wieder's discharge was retaliatory. Gabriel Kaszovitz, a partner at the firm, said he welcomed the chance to try the case.
But by reading the parties' expectations into an employment contract, he said, the court had opened "a big barn door" for lawsuits.
 
Wrongdoing Acknowledged
 In 1986 Mr. Wieder retained another lawyer in his firm, Larry Lubin, to handle the closing of his condominium. Mr. Lubin, he later charged, neglected his duties, then misled him to cover up that neglect. When Mr. Wieder complained to partners at Feder, Kaszovitz, he said, the firm made light of his experience.
Mr. Lubin subsequently acknowledged wrongdoing, and the firm reported him to the Departmental Disciplinary Committee of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in December 1987, three months after Mr. Wieder's complaint. The complaint was ultimately dismissed. So, too, was Mr. Wieder, in March 1988.
Mr. Wieder contends that the dismissal was retaliatory. The firm maintains that it dismissed him for his "poor work habits, unacceptable performance, inability to work with others and poor attitude."
The 39-year-old Mr. Wieder, now a lawyer with the Manhattan firm of Harvis, Trien & Beck, said he was "delighted" by the ruling, but said his whistle-blowing days were over.
"I've been portrayed as crazed, eccentric and litigation-prone, I was unemployed for nine months, I've gone into massive debt," he said. "Even with this decision, any lawyer who pressures his or her law firm to do the right thing will still have to pay an immense price. But now maybe the travail will be considerably lighter than what I've had to face."

HEADLINE: Ex-Inmates Urge Return To Areas of Crime to Help

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES

 BODY:
After 23 years away, it is the parting image of prison, not the first glimpse of freedom, that lingers now with Eddie Ellis, a pioneer Black Panther and convicted murderer, as he labors back home in Harlem on his hard-won new appreciation of a criminal and his community.
The sight that haunts him came on a day last summer when Mr. Ellis was finally being processed back to freedom and walked past a huge hall filled with hundreds of incoming prisoners, all neatly leg-shackled, manacled and seated in two long files of benches, as orderly and sad-eyed, he recalls, as fresh oarsmen on a galley ship. 
 "Oh yeah," said Mr. Ellis, wincing at the memory back in Harlem after serving his own long years. "It was the culmination of everything I had done through those 23 years. Summed it all up." He was speaking of a radical new approach to penology being spawned uninvited by prisoner-scholars like Mr. Ellis from within the system, an approach rooted in a hard fact that he never saw more clearly than in that sea of faces on his parting day:
"The fact that more than 85 percent of prisoners in the state are black or Latino and -- most phenomenal of all -- that 75 percent of the state's entire prison population comes from just seven neighborhoods in New York City," said Mr. Ellis, citing accepted research data culled by prisoners themselves in a prisoner's "think tank" at Green Haven prison in Stormville, N.Y.
The fact that three out of four prisoners come from, prey upon and return to seven neighborhoods encompassed by just 18 of the state's 150 Assembly districts, or 12 percent of the population, is at the heart of Mr. Ellis's new mission as an unaccredited street penologist without portfolio.
Mr. Ellis is one of a handful of gray-bearded model prisoners lately filtering back into freedom bearing the hopes of prisoner study groups they left behind, groups like the blacks' Resurrection Study Group and the Hispanic inmates' Conciencia.
These once-captive penologists are intent on urging a new nontraditional outlook and new social, economic and educational programs to tightly relate the 62 state prisons with the seven "symbiotic neighborhoods," as Mr. Ellis calls them -- the Lower East Side, the South Bronx, Harlem, Brownsville, Bedford-Stuyvesant, East New York and South Jamaica.
In those neighborhoods, Mr. Ellis runs classes to steer teen-agers from early bad encounters with the police, stressing how simple, tough backtalk can create a critical moment in a young man's life. He left behind prison classes meant to help convicts get involved creatively in their community problems once they get back out.
One proposal that he and the other prison-scholars have submitted to the Legislature would require convicts to train for community service in prison and perform specific housing, education or crime-prevention duties as a condition of parole.
 
Predisposition to Crime
 "We began developing a nontraditional approach to the prison problem," Mr. Ellis related, speaking of a loose network of a few dozen long-term felons who used their time as he did, to earn college degrees and ponder their fate and the causes of the vast shift of prison demographics across two decades to where black and Hispanic prisoners now make up the overwhelming majority of prisoners.
"In our analysis, we found out in detail how symbiotic it is, how prison is heavily influenced by inner-city, underclass subculture in just a few neighborhoods," he said. "It's a direct relationship, an umbilical cord." He argued that the environment of the underclass neighborhoods, from eroded schools to fatherless families, can present young males with a powerful tide of negative self-judgment and a predisposition to crime and social hostility that he himself finds frightening now that he is back on the streets.
Outside life has worsened so during his prison years that Mr. Ellis feels he needs a pistol to visit safely his mother's block with its youthful criminals, yet he does not carry one for fear of being returned to prison.
Rather than talk in broad sociological terms of crime and punishment, Mr. Ellis and his prison colleagues prefer to sketch out a sociological whirlwind: 47 percent prisoner recidivism rooted in an annual traffic of 26,000 prisoners going in and 23,000 coming out -- with three-fourths of the cycle churning through their seven targeted neighborhoods.
 
Out-of-Date Strategies
 "The fact that must be faced, then, is that at least 11,000 new crimes are going to be committed by these guys coming out, most of them in their home neighborhoods," Mr. Ellis stressed. "So what we do in the prisons can't be done in the abstract, removed from these neighborhoods and their Afrocentric and Latino cultures." Traditional prison strategies, he argued, are 50 years out of date and geared for the "Jimmy Cagney" days when Italian and Irish prisoners were the white majority in a much smaller, pre-drug-culture prison population.
The study groups within the prisons have crafted room for their activities from the tolerance for reform that followed the Attica prison riot of 1971. The chief groups, sometimes operating with church or civil rights sponsors, meet regularly in Green Haven, Eastern, Sing Sing, Woodbourne, Walkill and Auburn prisons. Each year they sponsor a seminar rooted in their nontraditional approach and attended by outside specialists.
The fourth seminar is scheduled for February at Green Haven and will feature the ideas of prisoners like Juan Rivera, whose mentor in jail house scholarship was George Prendes, who is now back on the street himself. He is working with Mr. Ellis to set up a lobby for the "new experts," as they call themselves -- ex-convicts espousing this nontraditional binding of neighborhood and prison.
Mr. Rivera's most recent paper, printed in the national Journal of Prisoners on Prisons and footnoted with government statistics and studies, is far removed from run-of-the-mill prison polemics about pervasive racism and criminal-justice conspiracies. Fact-rich and dry, it has a scholarly tone that might be envied by traditional penologists who lack Mr. Rivera's advantage of direct experience.
"Since approximately 95 percent of the prison population when released return to the communities from which they come, and since 4 out of 10 of these people will return to prison, this suggests that released offenders returning to their communities are contributing to the higher percentage of the overall crime rate in these districts."
 
Guides to a Better Way
 At its most idealistic, the approach of Mr. Ellis and Mr. Rivera envisions prisoners themselves returning to the targeted neighborhoods to shepherd young men along some better path. A number of the movement's best proponents are, like Mr. Ellis, graduates or students of the New York Theological Seminary's special full master's degree program offered at Sing Sing prison.
As a perpetual immigration funnel, the city and its crime demographics are ever shifting, with, for example, Hispanic inmates now the fastest growing prison population, the way blacks once were. Hispanic inmates account for one-third of the 63,000-prisoner population in comparison to one-tenth of the 18,000 state prisoners in 1979. While the total population has tripled, black prisoners, who accounted for about 60 percent of the inmates in 1979, now are less than 50 percent of the total.
No one, least of all Mr. Ellis or prison administrators, is promising grand things. But the fact that this exercise is taking place at all and that prisoners themselves are its thoughtful initiators is at the least an interesting new chapter in prison scholarship and a practical focus that no white power figure could have identified without stirring controversy.
"If you're around the system any length of time it becomes obvious you have to attack the problem at its root and get to 7- and 8-year-old kids like these guys are saying," said Thomas A. Coughlin 3d, the state Corrections Commissioner.
He concedes Mr. Ellis's point that in the current drug-steeped crime culture, more white people engage in drug abuse than black or Hispanic people. But the commissioner says they are caught less often than other abusers and have better access to treatment and family support. "A black or Hispanic kid doesn't have these supports and courts look at that at sentencing," said Mr. Coughlin, who noted there are waiting lists for treatment programs in minority neighborhoods.
Working with fellow prison alumni Mr. Prendes and Warren Henry, Mr. Ellis has formed a new group, the Community Justice Institute, to lobby for their nontraditional outlook. They have various ambitious proposals, from making minority-neighborhood commitments a condition of prisoner parole to realizing a most unlikely dream: a prisoner-run model prison.
But they lay claim to more than academic conceits, contending that various reform ideas enacted by state authorities -- like pre-release preparation centers, regular phone calls home and special trailers for weekend family visits -- were co-opted, happily, from prisoners' own proposals.
 
Thinking Beyond His Plight
 Mr. Ellis is a lean, highly articulate individual galvanized by 50 years of a life hard but hopeful. From experience, he knows that change begins with the individual but is best nurtured among like-minded, self-resolved colleagues. From his early days at Attica, where he witnessed -- though did not participate in -- the watershed riot, Mr. Ellis said he forged a determination to think beyond his plight and get all the higher education he could, from business administration to paralegal aide.
Judged a model prisoner after his years of prison intellectual life, Mr. Ellis was released last summer into a work-release program in which he is serving as a community educator and curriculum developer at Neighborhood Defender Services of Harlem, a private legal-aid resource for the indigent.
His release allows him to live with his wife but requires him to spend two nights each week for two years under lockup at a Bronx prison. "A terrible experience and at the same time a joyful one," he says of how this leftover incarceration reminds him of the freedom he lost and regained at the price of almost half his years.
His freedom came two years before he finished serving the minimum of a 25-years-to-life sentence for a fatal shooting in 1969. Mr. Ellis has always maintained his innocence, contending the conviction was a result of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's counterintelligence program against the nascent Black Panthers of a generation ago.
But unlike many convicts, he is less interested in justifying his past than in shaping fresh changes in prison and tapping what he and some prison administrators see as a thoughtful talent pool of first-hand experience residing behind bars. Even more, as he exults in being back on the streets of Harlem, his beloved birthplace, Mr. Ellis keeps his departing galley-ship image of the prison system in mind.
"We've had enough textbook penology," he said, trying to urge an outside world sick of the deepening rut of crime and punishment to consider alternative perspectives from some of the system's resident experts.

HEADLINE: Man in the News;
Pathfinders of the Middle Ground: Leslie Aspin Jr.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL R. GORDON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
In selecting Representative Les Aspin to be his Secretary of Defense, President-elect Bill Clinton has picked a military specialist who favors further cuts in Pentagon spending but who will also fortify the new Administration's inclination to intervene in the fighting in Bosnia.
By all accounts, Mr. Aspin's strength is his fascination with military issues. In recent years, as chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, he has thought hard about the future of the Pentagon, the question of military intervention, and about how to put the weapons industry to civilian use. He knows the ins and outs of the budget process in the Pentagon and on Capitol Hill. 
 And along with Sam Nunn, the Georgia Democrat who heads the Senate Armed Services Committee, Mr. Aspin counseled Mr. Clinton on military issues during the Presidential campaign.
 
Gap in Track Record
 But Mr. Aspin has no track record in managing a large, multibillion-dollar organization. And he will assume his post without the close working relationship that Secretary Dick Cheney forged with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. General Powell, who is wary of the limited use of American troops abroad for political or diplomatic purposes, has differed sharply with Mr. Aspin on the question of military intervention in the Balkans.
The Wisconsin Democrat began his career as a military specialist, working for Defense Secretary Robert S. McNamara in the Johnson Administration in the Office of Systems Analysis after earning a doctorate in economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
Running against the war in Vietnam, Mr. Aspin was elected to the House in 1970 at the age of 32 and assumed a place on the House Armed Services Committee. He quickly became a Pentagon gadfly, issuing one weekend news release after another on wasteful Pentagon spending. The releases were astutely embargoed for the Monday newspapers for maximum exposure on what is normally a slow news day.
"Peticare," or the care of military officers' pets at Government expense, was a special concern in the early days, when his interests were less global. But over two decades he has developed into a military expert who has not shrunk from challenging the liberal orthodoxy.
Mr. Aspin's willingness to support the MX missile during the Reagan Administration and his backing of the Persian Gulf war set him apart from many Democrats and gave him solid centrist credentials. Mr. Cheney indicated as much when he recently praised Mr. Aspin as a good candidate for the Pentagon post, while saying that he thought the lawmaker's proposed budget cuts went too far.
 
Studied South Vietnam
 Born Leslie Aspin Jr. on July 21, 1938, to a Yorkshireman who had immigrated to Wisconsin, Mr. Aspin earned degrees from Yale, Oxford and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He joined the Reserve Officers Training Corps at Yale and performed his Army service as a Pentagon economist in the last two years of the Johnson Administration, when he traveled to South Vietnam to study its economy.
Mr. Aspin is divorced, and his main hobby appears to be his work. But he has a warm and informal manner. His dog, Junket, used to go to the office with him, and Mr. Aspin put out a press release when the pet died.
Five years after his election to Congress, Mr. Aspin helped organize the ouster of Representative F. Edward Hebert of Louisiana, a conservative who was chairman of the Armed Services Committee, replacing him with Representative Melvin Price of Illinois. Ten years later, Mr. Aspin helped dethrone Mr. Price, secured the chairmanship for himself and urged the Democratic Party to stop being the "Doctor No" on military issues and shed its dovish image.
As chairman, Mr. Aspin has used the panel to conduct wide-ranging inquiries on military policy. It was under Mr. Aspin that the panel solicited William H. Webster's assessment that the changes in the Soviet Union under President Mikhail S. Gorbachev were "irreversible." The comments by Mr. Webster, the Director of Central Intelligence, touched off a policy debate between Mr. Webster and Mr. Cheney.
 
New Vision of Power
 In several recent speeches Mr. Aspin has sought to articulate a new vision of how military power should be used and what the structure of the military should be.
In a September speech he criticized General Powell's "all-or-nothing" doctrine, contending that the United States should be prepared to use force selectively to buttress its diplomacy. Expanding on the point, Mr. Aspin said in an interview before the speech that the United States should be prepared to use force to slow the killing in Bosnia, a position adamantly opposed by General Powell. On the military budget, Mr. Aspin has proposed cutting $48 billion more than the Bush Administration projected over five years.
General Powell criticized Mr. Aspin's approach earlier this month, saying that in a changing and uncertain world it would be unwise to cut the military forces too deeply.
At the Pentagon, Mr. Aspin will have to contemplate the use of force, not as a policy specialist but as a Defense Secretary whose recommendations could send Americans into harm's way. He will have the enormous task of trying to manage the Pentagon as its budget shrinks and of overseeing the lifting of a ban on homosexuals in the military.
And, say some close associates, he will have to discipline his thinking further, selecting among a flood of new ideas.

HEADLINE: Japanese Warn U.S. Not to Act Rashly on Trade

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 22

 BODY:
In a bluntly worded warning to President-elect Bill Clinton, a panel of influential Japanese business leaders said in a Government-sponsored report today that the United States was focusing on "its own narrow national interests" in economic matters. The executives urged the passage of "necessary and appropriate emergency response measures" by the Japanese Government that would deter unilateral American actions to resolve trade disputes.
In the report, commissioned by Japan's Foreign Minister, the business leaders did not describe the emergency measures they had in mind. But they were widely interpreted as calling for laws that would enable Japan to place high tariffs on American or European goods -- or to block their entry -- if the same actions were taken abroad against its products. 
 The report was released as Japanese officials and business executives have become more critical of the newly signed North American Free Trade Agreement, and increasingly concerned that the Clinton Administration will use tax and trade laws to impede the American operations of Japanese companies. It notes "a growing amount of frustration lingering just below the surface in Japan and in other nations of the world" about what it termed "self-centered thinking" in the United States about trade.
The report also calls for scrapping the Bush Administration's main economic initiative with Japan, an effort to restructure both economies to solve underlying problems that set off constant disputes, and replacing it with a broader, high-level economic panel. Arguing that Japan has rapidly opened its economy while the United States has failed to live up to commitments to reduce its budget deficit, promote saving and eliminate trade barriers, the report says, "While the process has been referred to as a working two-way approach, in fact it has been quite one-way."
The authors are at times critical of Japan as well, saying that its business practices must have clearer rules and be more open to foreigners. They also reiterate calls for its Government to play "a more active leadership role in the international community." In discussing Japan's shortcomings, the report said that the Government should reduce its regulation of the economy, that the retail distribution system needed to be simplified and that anti-monopoly laws ought to be better enforced.
The report describes the United States in terms that most Japanese use only in private. It is particularly critical of Americans who it says call for a trade policy that would measure success with Japan by the reduction of America's trade deficit or its sales of specific products.
The United States has made such a cascade of demands, the authors of the report suggest, that it "is becoming politically difficult for Japan to concede."
Japan may have picked a poor time to make its case. Its trade surplus, not only with the United States but with its Asian neighbors, is soaring. This year, Japan's trade surplus with the world is expected to top $100 billion, and the Government predicts that it will be as high as $135 billion next year.
The report, based on a study begun this spring, was timed for release soon after the American elections. Officials involved in its writing said it was intended to set an agenda for both countries for the next four years, no matter who was elected President.
Though no sitting Government officials served on the panel, it was headed by Yoshio Okawara, a former Ambassador to the United States and executive adviser to the Keidanren, Japan's most powerful business group. Its members included several of Japan's most influential business figures, including Koichiro Ejiri, chairman of Mitsui; Minoru Makihara, president of Mitsubishi, and Akio Morita, chairman of Sony.
The survey of economic relations is dominated by direct, unabashed defenses of many Japanese economic practices, and by warnings that Japan should prepare itself in case protectionists and hard-liners on trade emerge in the new Administration.
For example, discussing keiretsu, the linked relationships among Japanese corporations, the report suggests that the United States has failed to learn lessons about the merits of doing business the Japanese way. "In particular," it says, "the Japanese practice of treating workers as colleagues, rather than treating them mechanically as the elements and means of production, is clearly a more human form of capitalism."
The most controversial step advocated in the report is the adoption of emergency powers that would enable Japan to fight back if, for example, the United States used the "Super 301" provision of the Omnibus Trade Act of 1988. Under that law, the United States can declare that a foreign market is closed to certain products and take retaliatory actions.
Action might be taken if the United States singled out Japanese companies for tougher antitrust enforcement -- something the Bush Administration threatened -- or for stricter enforcement of taxation of foreign companies.

Clinton's New Foreign-Policy Thinkers: Like-Minded Ex-Carter Teammates

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton said today that the times demanded "bold new thinking" in foreign policy. But in choosing his foreign policy team, he took the most conventional of approaches -- picking experienced, loyal and generally like-minded friends and advisers whom he can count on not to get him in trouble abroad while he focuses on problems at home.
What is unsual about that experienced team of advisers is that for most of them, the last time they had their hands on foreign policy was 12 years ago, when many of them served together in the Carter Administration. 
 As a result, many have not written or spoken out publicly very much on the major new foreign-policy issues confronting the United States since the end of the cold war -- from the crisis in Bosnia to the future of relations with Japan.
Therefore it is difficult to predict exactly what sort of foreign policy they will produce with Mr. Clinton, who himself is untested in that field. A Clinton adviser said, "Fasten your seatbelts, ladies and gentlemen."
 
Cold-War-Era Labels
 Secretary-of-State-designate Warren M. Christopher; Anthony Lake, his choice as national security adviser; Samuel R. Berger, the designated deputy to Mr. Lake, and Madeleine Albright, Mr. Clinton's pick as United Nations delegate, all come out of the more liberal wing of the Carter Administration that was in opposition to hard-liners in the Democratic Party who advocated a more confrontational policy toward the Soviet Union.
Immediately after Mr. Clinton announced his choices today, conservative Democrats were complaining in private that they had been frozen out of the top jobs and that Mr. Clinton had turned to cold-war doves for post-cold-war policy.
But Mr. Clinton's circle contends that those old labels have lost their meaning.
For instance, Clinton aides said Mr. Lake, an ardent opponent of the Vietnam War, was the strongest advocate that Mr. Clinton call for the use of force, if necessary, in Bosnia.
 
Veteran Defense Experts
 In many ways Mr. Clinton seemed to choose this group less for their specific views or past ideology than for their instincts and ability to work as a team.
Mr. Clinton could have chosen the leading thinkers on the new world order within his party on Capitol Hill -- like Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey, who has spent a great deal of time working on the Russian economic crisis, or Senator Sam Nunn, who has specialized in the subject of arms proliferation from the former Soviet Union.
He could have turned to Representative Stephen J. Solarz, an outspoken foreign-policy specialist, or innovative but conservative academics like Will Marshall of the Progressive Policy Institute, from which Mr. Clinton draws much of his domestic agenda, and Michael Mandelbaum of the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies.
Those Democrats have spent the last few years compiling an extensive written and spoken record on the post-cold-war world.
 
No 'Team of Retreads'
 Instead, Mr. Clinton reached back into the Carter Administration and to two veteran defense experts, Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin, chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, and R. James Woolsey Jr., to be Defense Secretary and Director of Central Intelligence , respectively.
Several factors seem to have motivated that set of choices. First, as Mr. Clinton has repeatedly stated, he wanted a team that would be as collegial as the Bush Administration's National Security team.
During the campaign Mr. Lake, Mr. Berger, Ms. Albright and Mr. Christopher worked together closely, and managed to develop a Clinton foreign policy that often seemed to have Mr. Bush on the defensive. Aides said that Mr. Clinton's view was that people who proved they could work effectively in the heat of a campaign could be trusted to do the same in government, no matter what Administration they came from.
The Carter Administration "was the only Democratic Administration we had in 25 years," Mr. Clinton said, defending his choices. It was the only place a Democrat could get hands-on experience, and therefore it was unfair to suggest he had picked "a team of retreads," he said.
 
'The Vision Thing'
 Mr. Clinton also was clearly looking for advisers of sober instincts, and proven judgment -- able to handle foreign policy for him on a day-to-day basis, without his having to worry about them pursuing their own agendas or leading him into foreign adventures. In introducing Mr. Christopher, Mr. Clinton kept emphasizing how much he prized his "judgment."
In economic policy, Mr. Clinton chose an elder Congressional statesman -- Senator Lloyd Bentsen -- as Treasury Secretary to carry out a program that Mr. Clinton has already largely designed. In defense policy, Mr. Clinton did the same, seeking out one of the top experts in military spending to reduce the Pentagon budget and reshape the armed forces.
But in foreign policy, Mr. Clinton has chosen an elder foreign affairs statesman -- Mr. Christopher -- to steer a cautious course through the foreign policy problems already facing him and carry out a foreign-policy program that Mr. Clinton knows he must design but has not yet fully thought through.
Clinton aides said the President-elect was not worried about Mr. Christopher's lacking what Mr. Bush sardonically called "the vision thing." Mr. Clinton, they said, believes he knows a lot more about foreign policy than was apparent in the campaign and that he intends to be as much of an intellectual trend-setter, and public voice, in that area as in domestic policy.He will draw on Mr. Lake and Mr. Berger to help him conceptualize his views at the White House, and will lean on Mr. Christopher for his strengths as an implementor, consensus builder, and seasoned negotiator.
 
Comfort With Position Papers
 Whether that balancing act will work is already a matter of great dispute.
"I think this is a time that does call out for some strategic vision and a President who wants to concentrate on domestic policy would do well to appoint someone strong as Secretary of State," said Peter Rodman, former counselor to the national security adviser under Mr. Bush. "Mr. Christopher has many qualities, but his skills as a strategic thinker are unproven. Rightly or wrongly, some people identify him with the least impressive aspects of the Carter Administration."
"In his favor," Mr. Rodman said, "he clearly is someone of great integrity and meticulousness, as well as accomplished negotiator. The President will not have to worry about a Secretary of State with his own agenda and ambitions, or who will distance himself from the President in difficult moments. In this, Mr. Clinton will have an advantage over his predecessor."
Finally, Mr. Clinton was quite comfortable with the foreign-policy position papers that Mr. Berger, Mr. Lake, Ms. Albright and Mr. Christopher developed for him during the campaign.
They called for a much more aggressive stand in support of Bosnia against Serbia, more aid for President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia than the Bush Administration was willing to give, the use of trade sanctions to force China to moderate its human-rights abuses, a quicker United Nations rescue mission for Somalia, a tougher bargaining position in trade negotiations with Japan, and a more sympathetic posture toward Israel than was being evinced by the Bush Administration.
But Clinton aides acknowledge that those policy positions were intended in large part to distinguish Mr. Clinton from Mr. Bush during the campaign, and no one really knows to what extent they will actually shape Mr. Clinton's foreign policy when he takes office.
For instance, since the election Mr. Clinton has noticeably softened his oratory about using trade sanctions against China, and his first statement about the Arab-Israeli conflict -- in response to the Israeli expulsion of some 415 Palestinians -- was as evenhanded as anything ever uttered by the Bush Administration.

HEADLINE: U.S. WILL RELEASE WEAPONS TO CHINA

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Bush Administration announced today that it would send China military equipment already paid for but put in storage for more than three years to protest against the Tiananmen Square massacre.
Richard A. Boucher, the State Department spokesman, said in a statement that the shipment would consist of four anti-submarine torpedoes, two artillery-locating radars, equipment for a munitions-production line and electronic gear to upgrade F-8 aircraft. 
 The sales "were suspended to demonstrate our deep concern about the tragic events in China," Mr. Boucher said, referring to the brutal crackdown on democracy campaigners in June 1989, which left hundreds dead.
He said no further arms sales were planned, and that the United States would not provide training, maintenance or repairs for the equipment.
Senior Administration officials have recently said China has hinted that it may stop cooperating with the United States at the United Nations in response to President Bush's decision during the campaign to sell advanced fighter jets to Taiwan.
China is one of five countries that has veto power in Security Council decisions, and its diplomats have expressed dismay at the growing tendency at the United Nations to use military-intervention powers.
Still, the Administration's decision appeared likely to renew charges in Congress that the United States is coddling an oppressive Government.
The move comes less than a month after reports that American intelligence analysts had detected the shipment of Chinese M-11 medium-range missiles to Pakistan. The shipment appeared to violate an international accord on ballistic-missile proliferation that Chinese leaders, in informal talks with Americans, said they would obey.
 
Responses From Critics
 Gary Milhollin, director of the Wisconsin Project on Nuclear Arms Control, a Washington research group, criticized today's step as undermining American arms-control policy. "This rewards them for proliferating missiles to Pakistan," he said, "and tells them we really don't care very much what they sell to the third world."
Michael Jendrzejczyk, Washington director of the human rights group Asia Watch, said continuing reports of rights violations in China made it wrong to ship military equipment now. "This unfortunate step would reward the Chinese for continuing repression that has in no way eased in the last three years," he said.
This month China agreed, as well, to buy more weapons from Russia. Delivering still more weapons from the United States "takes away any opportunity we might have to object to any more dangerous sales the Russians might make," Mr. Milhollin said.
Mr. Boucher said Mr. Bush would notify Congress of the arms-delivery decision, as required by law. A Senate aide predicted that many members of Congress would register objections.
The President has long been sympathetic to China and its leaders, more so than most American politicians. He has repeatedly vetoed legislation that would have downgraded China's preferred trading status with the United States unless it improved its human rights record and limited arms exports to the third world.
Mr. Bush headed the American liaison office in Beijing in the early 1970's, when relations with Washington had begun to improve under initiatives by President Richard M. Nixon.
The announcement of the weapons shipment was made as Secretary of Commerce Barbara H. Franklin flew home from a six-day visit to China and Hong Kong. The trip was intended to promote trade and to mollify Chinese officials after a visit to Taiwan last month by Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative.
Mrs. Hills's visit was the first to Taiwan by a Cabinet official since the United States recognized Beijing as the Government of China at the end of 1978. Secretary Franklin's trip was the first to Beijing by a Cabinet-level economic official since the 1989 massacre.

HEADLINE: Donors to Neediest Cases Feel Lucky

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Suzanne Crawford is a single parent raising a 5-year-old son, a self-described "Murphy Brown" mom who readily acknowledges that she would have trouble coping if she did not have a good job and supportive relatives and friends.
When she reads about other single mothers who are facing overwhelming burdens, she knows that their struggle could easily be her own. With that in mind, she sent a check for $250 to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, asking that the money be used to buy food for a poor woman bringing up children on her own. 
 "I see so many single mothers out there with kids who are suffering," Miss Crawford, 44, who lives in Manhattan, said. "I feel bad for them."
Many people make contributions to the Neediest Cases because they feel fortunate. In letters to the fund, they write that they will not forget New Yorkers with little hope.
Betty Frankel of Oakdale, L.I., overcame breast cancer 16 years ago. Last year, doctors discovered that the cancer had returned and spread to her bones. After treatment, it went into remission. Although Mrs. Frankel has contributed to the fund for decades, this year she enclosed a note with her $25 check.
"I feel very grateful and very thankful," said Mrs. Frankel, 62, a home economics teacher. "And the rest of my family is in good health. I wanted to share the joy I've had in being able to live with other people."
 
Helpf for a Teen-Ager
 The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which began in 1911, assists seven charities. The New York Times pays for the expenses of the Neediest Cases campaign.
Jacquelyn van der Woude, 48, of Cornwall-on-Hudson, N.Y., wrote to the fund that she felt blessed to have two healthy children and a stable job as a legal assistant. She said she hoped her check for $100 could help a teen-ager in New York City.
"It makes you feel almost uncomfortable that you have a roof over your head and you have food and have clothes," she said.
Miss Crawford said that when her son, Timothy, sees a homeless person, she explains to him about poverty and the importance of charity.
"The best way to make him understand is to tell him that other boys and girls won't get toys around Christmas," she said. "That makes him sad and he sort of understands what it's like."

HEADLINE: Lottery Fails To Finance School Safety

BYLINE: By JAMES C. McKINLEY Jr.

 BODY:
A special anti-crime lottery that was supposed to raise $50 million to pay for new programs at New York City schools this year is selling miserably, so far raising only about a half-million dollars.
In the last six months, the city's instant lottery game, part of Mayor David N. Dinkins's ambitious program to fight crime, has sold only $2 million worth of tickets. 
 But the city has received less than $500,000 of that money, partly because of the cost of printing and administering the game and partly because the city has had to share its profits with the state, officials said. To raise $50 million, $146 million in tickets would need to be sold.
"It's falling on its face," said Philip R. Michael, the city budget director.
 
Response to String of Killings
 The lottery was part of an anti-crime program that gained steam in the wake of the so-called crime wave of the summer of 1990, when a string of children were killed by random gunfire and a tourist from Utah was slain on a subway platform. It was a single plank in the financing package for the $1.8 billion anti-crime plan proposed by the Mayor in October 1990 and passed by the Legislature in early 1991.
The plan relies on a property-tax increase, a special payroll tax and a special 25-cent surcharge on state lottery tickets to pay for the hiring of thousands of new police officers. The other parts of the financing are bringing in what was expected, Mr. Michael said.
In accounting for the lackluster showing, state lottery officials say the poor economy has hurt sales of all instant games and city dwellers have historically preferred the regular lottery. Beyond those problems, they say, the city has been unable to develop a new market for the anti-crime scratch-off game.
When it was first conceived, city and state officials thought lottery buyers would be persuaded to buy the tickets because they were for a good cause.
Mr. Michael said the city would continue to pay for the school programs that the lottery was intended to support out of general tax revenues.
 
Looking to Make It Work
 The lottery money was to have been spent on security guards, after-school programs, and programs that teach teachers and children peaceful ways to resolve disputes, among other things.
City officials say they will scrap the lottery unless they can find a way to make it work.
Mr. Dinkins had envisioned that the city lottery would bring in about $120 million annually that would pay for 18 new community schools, dropout-prevention programs, teen-age pregnancy counseling, remedial summer school and extracurricular activities like math and science clubs, among other programs.
Despite the lottery problems, the Dinkins administration has remained committed to financing the anti-crime programs, including $18 million this year for new security guards and $6 million for multicultural programs and guidance counselors.
"We have received to the penny what we were promised," said the Deputy Schools Chancellor, Stanley S. Litow.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Excerpts From Clinton's News Conference Introducing His Latest Nominees

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 22

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President-elect Bill Clinton's news conference today in Little Rock, Ark., where he introduced his selections for several top positions. The text was provided by Reuters.
 
OPENING STATEMENTS 
 WARREN M. CHRISTOPHER (Secretary of State-designate) Today I want to thank Governor Clinton for making a dream come true. In my law school days I was inspired to public service by the examples of General George Marshall and Dean Acheson, but it was far beyond imagining that I would some day be asked to serve in the office that they held.
Marshall and Acheson were present at the creation of the cold war. Then we were being challenged by a formidable adversary and an alien ideology. America measured its success by how well it contained Soviet expansion and halted the spread of communism.
Today we face a new and vastly more complicated era. As Governor Clinton has said, we're the inheritors of a new world. That world is still a dangerous place. While the risk of nuclear threat has diminished, the new era has produced a new set of dangers -- ethnic and religious conflicts threaten to ignite widespread hostilities in Central and Eastern Europe.
Weapons of mass destruction may reach the hands of untested and unstable powers, and new threats spring from old rivalries in the Middle East, in Europe and in Asia. At the same time we face a world where borders matter less and less, a world that demands we join with other nations to face challenges that range from over-population to AIDS, to the very destruction of our planet's life support system.
In this new era, the Clinton-Gore Administration will be confronted again and again by whether and how to use U.S. power and U.S. resources. We knew that we need bold new thinking to guide us in this new era.
In contrast to the well understood goals of the cold war era, it will be difficult to measure our success as we deal with these new challenges.
No doubt the surest test will be the well-being of the American people and the unfailing concern that they have always had for others.
In confronting these new challenges, we must remain cognizant that a great power requires not only military might but a powerful economy at home, an economy prepared for global competition.
 
 
. . .
 If I may close on a personal note, I'm grateful to many, but most of all to my wife, Marie, for her willingness, one day after our 36th anniversary to leave our beloved California and join me in yet another adventure.
In 1982, or in 1981, when all 52 hostages came out of Iran alive, and reasonably well, I was so thankful that I resolved that I would not again impose by asking for divine assistance in my national endeavors.
Evidently God had other plans. So I humbly ask for the strength and vision to carry out the new task that Governor Clinton has so generously given me.
CLIFTON R. WHARTON JR. (Deputy Secretary of State-Designate) . . . I, too, would like to begin with a personal bit of reminiscence. Mr. Christopher mentioned the Marshall Plan. Some 45 years ago, when I graduated from Harvard, the commencement speaker was George Marshall, and he announced the Marshall Plan. That particular event was seminal for me because it led me not to go into the Foreign Service, like my father, who spent 40 years as a career Foreign Service officer and completed his tour as the first black career ambassador.
I decided to move into the field of technical assistance and foreign economic development, which at that time I believed would eventually become a central part of U.S. foreign policy. As the young people say, what goes around comes around. And here I am at a stage where the ability of the United States to forge a new foreign policy in a post-cold war era is going to involve a significant number of new dimensions, not the least of which are likely to be those areas in which I hope I would be able to bring some experience and expertise and competence.
 
 
. . .
 MADELEINE K. ALBRIGHT (Ambassador-designate to the United Nations) . . . It would be an honor for any American to represent the United States at the United Nations when there is a President who says he will support a policy that will make a difference.
I have to say it is a special personal honor for this American to be asked to serve. I was born in Czechoslovakia and came to this country with my mother, sister and brother in 1948 after the communist coup. My father, Joseph Korbel, a Czechoslovak diplomat, was asked to represent his country as chairman of a special United Nations commission. When he completed his work, he asked the United States Government for political asylum, and as a result of the generous spirit of the American people, our family had the privilege of growing up as free Americans.
You can therefore understand how proud I will be to sit at the United Nations behind the nameplate that says "United States of America."
 
. . .
 LES ASPIN (Defense Secretary-designate) . . . The President-elect has included two sets of big challenges with this nomination. The first set involves maintaining the superb quality of our forces and our high technology edge as we go about the inevitable downsizing of our forces. We know the men and women in uniform today comprise the finest military force in the world and we know that the American technological know-how that we saw in the Gulf war will mean fewer casualties all around if and when we must use force again.
As President-elect Clinton has repeatedly said, and he's heard him say it here this afternoon one more time, our high quality in people, high technology and technological equipment -- that force must be maintained.
The second set of challenges involves meeting the demands of the new post-cold war, post-Soviet world. In this new world the definition of national security has been changed and it has been broadened. It now includes not only the threat from regional powers but it also includes the new nuclear danger of proliferation and the possibility of the reversal of reforms in the former Soviet Union with untold consequences. It even includes economic. The President-elect has set the overall task of reviving our economic security at home. The Defense Department can contribute there, too. . . .
R. JAMES WOOLSEY JR. (C.I.A. Director-designate) . . . The problem posed by one enemy with a worldwide reach is gone with the end of the cold war but the problems posed by the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, terrorism, drugs, ethnic and national hatreds, ecological damage and tough economic competition all give American intelligence a full agenda.
 In a number of ways it is a more complex and difficult agenda even than that which existed before. We have to do some things differently. . . .
W. ANTHONY LAKE (National Security Adviser-designate) . . . Our daily headlines suggest that not since 1968 has a new administration faced more difficult foreign problems. But I am convinced that our of these nettles we can pluck progress and greater security.
I look forward to making sure as best I can that the President gets the wide array of alternatives, the concise information and the broad range of advice that he requires, and that his decisions are carried out with dispatch. And I hope to see a year from now and beyond a group of senior national security officials who are as collegial and amicable as they are today.
There's an immense amount of work to do, and I cannot wait.
SAMUEL R. BERGER (Deputy National Security Adviser-designate) Over the past year, I have had the sometimes exhausting privilege of traveling across America with Governor Clinton and Senator Gore as they campaigned for the Presidency. I have seen the faces of Americans change from cynicism to hope, from serious doubt to genuine excitement about the possibilities for the future.
That is where American foreign policy begins. With the interest, the aspirations, and the values of the American people.
 
. . .

 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

Q. Congressman, could we get your views specifically on lifting the ban against homosexuals in the military, and from your years of dealing with the military establishment, how do you feel this could be best implemented?
MR. ASPIN All right. Let me, let me say about my views on the subject, which are essentially that it has come up when I've given talks and given speeches; it comes up in the question and answer period.
And what I have said is that I think two things. Number one, that the current policy of the U.S. military, that we have set up there, has got some serious flaws with it in terms of equity and in terms of fairness. Secondly, that I saw a correlation of forces that was going to force the U.S. government to have to deal with this and the U.S. military to deal with it.
If you see what's going on in other countries on this issue, if you see what's going on in the courts, if you see what's going on on the college campuses with problems of the R.O.T.C. program because of this, the publicity that's given to rather dramatic instances of people being forced out of the service -- I thought that this was something that would have to be dealt with by the administration that was elected in 1992.
I think that even if Bill Clinton hadn't said anything about it during the campaign, this administration would be dealing with it.
I think even if George Bush had been re-elected in 1992, he would be dealing with it.
What is different now is that we have elected a President who has talked about changing the policy, and what that will do is it will force the Pentagon and the system, meaning Congress, the Administration, all of us, to deal with the subject head on.
There'll be no chance to sort of try and patch up the old program or sideslip the issue. We'll have to deal with it head on, and that's a good thing. I think that's a, definitely a good thing.
Q. Mr. Christopher, can we ask you -- Mr. Lake has referred to all of the challenges and problems that you face, perhaps the greatest number of problems of any incoming administration since 1968. What do you see as your most immediate concern? Is it Bosnia? Is it Russia? Is it Somalia? And how would you change policy?
MR. CHRISTOPHER No, there's a long established tradition in Washington at least in the Foreign Relations Committee that one doesn't answer questions like that until after he is confirmed.

Martha, a Top Clothier, in Chapter 11

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
Martha, the Park Avenue institution that put such fashion designers as Valentino, Galanos, Zandra Rhodes and Christian Francis Roth on the map, succumbed yesterday to the weak economy and filed for bankruptcy-law protection.
The company, which also operates two Martha stores in Florida and a Martha International boutique next to the flagship store in Manhattan, had been struggling to pay its bills as the recession eroded the spending power of its best customers and wrought a fundamental change in attitudes toward clothing. 
 "We've been fighting for a long time, but we just had to file because we needed time to get everything in order," said Sheldon Silverberg of Silverberg Stonehill & Goldsmith, the law firm that represents Martha Inc.
 
Unsecured Creditors
 While sales in the Florida stores have resisted the weak economy, Mr. Silverberg said, plummeting sales in the New York store dragged down overall profitability. At its zenith in the late 1980's, Martha Phillips Management Inc., the parent, had annual revenues of slightly more than $20 million.
Chanel and Galanos have the two largest unsecured claims against the company, $303,540 and $300,651 respectively. Bill Blass, Saint Laurent, Bob Mackie and The New York Times also are among the 20 largest unsecured creditors.
The stores will remain open while the company puts together a reorganization plan that will include new financing. "We've been in the business now for 58 years and plan to remain viable and a trend-setter for many more years to come," Lynn Manulis, daughter of Martha Phillips, Martha's founder, said in a statement.
 
Miss Martha and Miss Lynn
 Mrs. Phillips, known by most as Miss Martha, and Mrs. Manulis, known as Miss Lynn, reign as the doyennes of haute couture in America. They always have the best front-row seats at fashion shows.
Although Mrs. Phillips is 94 years old, she regularly checks on the business. She established an exemplary level of customer service: Mother and daughter have been known to get on their knees to pin a customer's hem.
Mrs. Phillips also has a reputation as a tough businesswoman, taking some of the world's wealthiest men to task for failing to pay their wives' bills on time.
When General Motors knocked down the building at Fifth Avenue and 58th Street that housed the original Martha to put up its skyscraper, it begged Mrs. Phillips to take a shop in the sunken plaza it created under Fifth Avenue. She responded, "Martha's customers never shop in cellars," and she moved her business to Park Avenue, where it thrived.
Martha's financial difficulties were no secret on Seventh Avenue, but designers, retailers and the financiers that back design firms expressed regret that the company filed under Chapter 11. The filing was made at Federal Bankruptcy Court in Manhattan.
"She really built the best little specialty store in the world, and I'm very, very sad this had to happen in her lifetime," Ellin Saltzman, fashion director of Bergdorf Goodman, said of Mrs. Phillips.

Long Bond Continues Rally; Note Auction Is Successful

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The bond market continued its holiday rally yesterday, with the price of the 30-year bond jumping more than half a point and the yield dropping to 7.34 percent, its lowest since Oct. 5.
In the last two days, the price of the long bond has risen a point, and the yield has fallen almost a tenth of a point. The rest of the market followed, with Treasury notes up a quarter-point to a half-point. 
 At the same time, the Treasury auction of the two-year note went better than some traders had expected, also giving the market a lift.
While light trading and other technical factors contributed to the rally, some traders wonder whether a new run toward lower long-term interest rates might also be in the works.
"The fact that this is happening in the current environment is not unreasonable," said Robert D. Sbarra, a managing director at Carroll McEntee & McGinley. He was referring to the fact that inflation remains low and that the economy, while growing, is not expanding rapidly. And with each day, more investors seem to have confidence that President-elect Bill Clinton will concentrate more on reducing the deficit than on stimulating the economy.
But there are others who think that the road to lower interest rates is still bumpy.
"We'll see how long-lasting it is," said Stephen Maher, the head of fixed-income trading at Nikko Securities. "We still have a Democratic Congress, a Democratic President, a big Federal deficit, a Federal funds rate already down to 3 percent and an economy beginning to recover. It just does not spell lower interest rates to me."
Mr. Maher also has doubts about the growing confidence in Mr. Clinton's conversion to deficit reduction, hinting that some investors seem to think that the President-elect "has promised not to be a Democrat anymore."
In late trading, the 30-year bond was offered at 10314/32 , to yield 7.34 percent, compared with 7.39 percent on Monday. The yield has come down from 7.59 percent since Nov. 30.
The price of the 10-year note jumped 15/32 as the yield dropped to 6.63 percent, from 6.69 percent the day before. And in the pre-auction market for the five-year Treasury note to be auctioned today, the yield dropped sharply, falling to 5.99 percent, from 6.06 percent on Monday.
 
Successful Note Auction
 Among the factors moving the market in the afternoon was the surprising success of the Treasury's two-year note auction. The $15.25 billion of notes, with a coupon of 4.625 percent, were sold at a single yield of 4.71 percent, the highest bid at which securities were awarded. But by late afternoon, the yield had dropped to 4.62 percent, reflecting a lot of buying after the auction.
It appeared that the single-price auction the Treasury is testing in the two- and five-year note auctions was still confounding the primary dealers who do most of the bidding. Yesterday it appeared that some bidders thought there would be mild demand and that they could get all the two-year notes they needed by bidding 4.71 percent, which was the yield in the pre-auction market just before the bidding closed at 1 P.M.
But a lot of other bidders were a little more aggressive, meaning that those who bid 4.71 percent only got 27 percent of the total of the securities they bid for, apparently leaving some dealers with much fewer securities than they needed to cover sales they had already made to customers.
 
Buying by Japanese
 Another factor in the rally yesterday was foreign buying. Mr. Maher and other traders said they saw a lot of demand from the Japanese, who had shunned the American bond market for some time. "We have seen more activity from our Japanese customers than we have seen in a long time," he said. One attraction, he said, was the expectation that the dollar would rise against the yen, adding to any profits from a drop in interest rates.
Also bolstering the market in the afternoon was a report by Johnson Redbook on sales by department and chain stores. In the first three weeks of December, sales fell at a 4.3 percent rate, compared with November. Although part of the decline was attributable to the recent storm in the Northeast, traders said the decline reassured investors that economic growth was not racing ahead and posing no inflationary threat.
Following are the results of the Treasury's auction yesterday of two-year notes:

HEADLINE: Taking the 8:15 to the Suburbs;
Commuting Transformed by Growth Outside New York City

BYLINE: By THOMAS J. LUECK

 BODY:
More and more people in the metropolitan region are commuting from homes in the suburbs to jobs in other suburbs, a new Federal study shows, continuing a trend that experts say has been reshaping the region's economy for 30 years.
The study of commuting patterns, released yesterday by the Census Bureau, also found that while New York City remains the region's job center, reverse commuting has risen as more businesses have moved all or part of their operations to the suburbs, where many employers have fared better in the recession than their counterparts in the city.
 
Impact on Transportation Policy
 "What this all tells us is that the region has changed permanently," said Regina Armstrong, an economist and senior fellow with the Regional Plan Association, which analyzes social and economic patterns in New York, New Jersey and Connecticut. 
 She said the findings will buttress calls across the region for more public transportation between suburban job centers that are not served well by commuter trains or buses.
Economists and urban planners said the findings came as little surprise, and underscored a continuing trend, with jobs being dispersed more broadly throughout the region.
But they said changing patterns of commuting have other social and economic explanations. For example, surging home prices of the 1970's and 1980's forced many workers to move far from their suburban offices or plants.
Equally important, the experts say, has been the substantial rise in the number of women in the region's work force and the increase in two-income families over the last two decades. Because many couples have jobs in communities 50 miles apart or more, many have elected to live at mid-points that require both breadwinners to endure long commutes each working day.
 
New York Still a Jobs Center
 Among the Government's findings were that New York City, while losing some of its luster as the region's epicenter of jobs and economic activity, has nonetheless remained the place where the most people in the region work, and where the most people commute to work.
It found that 3.2 million adults in New York City had jobs in 1990, and that 92 percent of them held jobs there, while in 1980, 94 percent remained in the city for work.
The study also found that thousands more New York City residents were commuting out of the city than in 1980 and that these reverse commuters were traveling to suburbs throughout the region. It found that the number traveling to Bergen County doubled, to 31,572, the number traveling to Nassau County rose by more than 80 percent, to 78,760, and the number of city residents traveling to Westchester County rose more than 85 percent, to 51,511.
Almost all the suburbs around New York City gained jobs and added new commuters. For instance, the study found that Westchester had 282,571 residents in 1990 who were over 16 years old and working, 41,000 more than in 1980, but that they increasingly commuted to jobs scattered across the region.
Indeed, the Census Bureau said 19,000 more Westchester residents commuted into New York City in 1990 than in 1980, but that thousands of others commuted to other counties. The number of Westchester residents commuting to Nassau County doubled, to 2,150, and the number working in Bergen County nearly tripled, to 5,253.
 
Changing Role of Suburbs
 Urban planners said the growing economic vibrancy of many suburban communities has all but ended their role as strictly bedroom communities providing quiet residential retreats for workers in Manhattan.
"The growth of reverse commuting is affecting low- and high-income workers alike," said Mitchell L. Moss, director of the Center for Urban Policy Research at New York University.
"Just take a look at the George Washington Bridge in the morning," he added. "There are a stream of vans taking workers from the city to manufacturing plants in northern New Jersey."
Analysts have maintained for more than a decade that the emergence of the suburbs as robust centers of office and manufacturing jobs, while benefiting many workers, has come at a cost. Like Ms. Armstrong, Mr. Moss said that the new data underscore the need for improvements in public transportation in the suburbs.
"Living in the New York region's suburbs has increasingly meant living in your car," he said. "Their roads were just not meant to handle the massive increase in traffic they have experienced."
The Government's study provided statistical snapshots of large increases in commuting -- most of it by car -- between most suburbs.
 
Enduring Long Commutes
 In Essex County, N.J., it found that the number of working adults rose 3 percent during the 1980's, to 356,562. The number commuting from Essex to New York City rose about 50 percent, to 30,385.
But the data revealed other large increases in the number of Essex residents commuting in other directions. The Government said 23,221 Essex workers commuted to Morris County in 1990, up from 13,576 in 1980. It said 14,453 traveled from Essex to Bergen County in 1990, up from 9,997 in 1980.
Similar increases in commutation between suburbs were apparent across the region, although the Census Bureau data for 1990 on Connecticut could not be directly compared with findings for 1980 because its methods of analysis had changed.
In Suffolk County, long considered by most Manhattan workers as a lengthy commute, the study showed commutation surged in the 1980's.
Suffolk had a sharp increase in the number of its residents holding jobs during the decade, from 526,407 in 1980 to 652,989 in 1990, the Government data showed. By far the largest number of the Suffolk workers, 497,746, stayed in their own county to report to their jobs.
But there was also a sharp increase in commutation from Suffolk to jobs elsewhere in region. The Government said 78,291 Suffolk residents traveled to jobs in New York City in 1990, up from 67,559 in 1980.
Some Suffolk workers traveled even farther. The report found that 1,389 reported to work in Westchester in 1990, up from 973 in 1980, and 1,014 traveled to Bergen County, up from 522 in 1980.

Wireless Phones: Way of the Future

BYLINE: By Anthony Ramirez

 BODY:
WHEN the Pacific Telesis Group, one of the largest phone companies in the world, announced earlier this month that it planned to split into a $9 billion traditional phone company and a $1 billion cellular business, the chairman voted with his feet: he's going to the smaller, but faster-growing cellular company.
That seems to say volumes about the future of telephones without wires. Analysts say that while plain old telephone service will remain the biggest revenue source for most phone companies in the near future, it will eventually be displaced. 
 If the Pacific Telesis split goes according to schedule a year from now, Sam Ginn, chairman and chief executive officer, will take over as head of the cellular business, tentatively known as Pactel Wireless. Philip Quigley, who will remain president and chief executive of Pacific Bell, will succeed Mr. Ginn. The split involves assets of $22 billion, or close to the gross domestic product of Chile.
Mr. Ginn said in a recent interview that he was simply going where the Pacific Telesis board had instructed him to go. But it presumably did not take an act of mental telepathy by directors to discern where Mr. Ginn wanted to go. In 1984, he headed and helped develop the company's wireless business.
Nonetheless, "on a personal level, I would have liked things to stay the way they were," Mr. Ginn said. "I would have opposed the breakup because I've got a large important company right now," he added. "But the issue is larger than Sam Ginn."
Pacific Telesis is tired of being thought of as another boring utility, Mr. Ginn and other Pacific Telesis executives have argued. Splitting up creates the "pure play" in cellular that investors crave and transforms a company now valued by investors at $18 billion into two companies worth, according to analysts, perhaps $21 billion.
Moreover, like other regional Bell companies, Pacific Telesis operates under the strictures of the 1984 accord that broke up the American Telephone and Telegraph Company. And, unlike other "Baby Bells," Pacific Telesis faces especially strict regulation in California. A split would lift the burden of the former and perhaps lighten the latter.
The new wireless company would be free to make equipment or, more likely, form a joint venture with an equipment maker. Earlier this year, when Pacific Telesis disclosed it had invested in Qualcomm Inc., developer of an innovative way to expand cellular capacity, Pacific Telesis was criticized for perhaps violating the A.T.& T. breakup accord.
Cellular companies, in general, are lightly regulated by states. But the California Public Utilities Commission has hinted strongly that it wants even stricter oversight, already the strictest in the nation, over Pacific Telesis. The split could lighten the regulators' thumb on the wireless unit if it were separate from traditional telephones, over which the California regulators have clear jurisdiction.
The stock market has heard all of these arguments and its reaction so far has been mildly positive. "It's a mystery to me why the market reaction hasn't been more positive," said Joel D. Gross, who follows Pacific Telesis for Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette and favors the split.
The deal was announced on Friday, Dec. 11. The following Monday, Pacific Telesis's stock closed at $44.876 a share, a 52-week high and up 50 cents a share on the day. Despite unusually high trading volume of 2.3 million shares that day, investors added only a paltry $202 million to the company's previous market value of $18 billion.
Since then, Pacific Telesis has settled in a mid-40's trading range on the New York Stock Exchange. Yesterday it closed at $46.75, up 12.5 cents.
Mr. Ginn, the chief executive, is not troubled by the market reaction. He said that since April, when Pacific Telesis announced it was studying a split, the stock price had soared from $37 a share. "I am elated," he said.
Moreover, analysts seem to be reaching a consensus that the company's traditional phone business will have a market value of about $14 billion and the wireless unit a market value of $6 billion to $7 billion. Current Pacific Telesis holders would get new shares representing the two companies, although the exact ratio has not been determined.
Daniel Reingold, an analyst with Morgan Stanley, estimates Pacific Telesis's post-split value at close to $50 a share, with traditional phones at $35 a share and cellular at $15 a share. Robert Morris, an analyst with Goldman, Sachs & Company, using different criteria, values cellular at $17 a share.
Analysts say the new wireless unit will have to borrow far more than the $750 million planned initial stock offering. They say future borrowings may total in the billions to develop the wireless unit's markets, which include 656,000 actual and 34 million potential United States subscribers.
Such future borrowings will be especially needed for the wireless unit's international operations -- a 26 percent stake in Germany's digital cellular network, 20 percent interest in a mobile radio project in France, and up to 15 percent interests in digital cellular networks in Japan.
Mr. Ginn implicitly acknowledged the analysts' arguments when he said that "the first $750 million is just the beginning."

HEADLINE: Rebates Kept At Chrysler

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: HIGHLAND PARK, Mich., Dec. 22

 BODY:
The Chrysler Corporation, seeking to bolster its share of the United States market, extended rebates today on most of its cars and trucks for three months and doubled cash incentives on some slow-selling models.
Separately, Chrysler's chairman-elect, Robert J. Eaton, predicted that North American car and truck sales for the entire industry would reach 15 million vehicles in 1993, a 5 percent increase over the 14.3 million rate expected for 1992. 
 "You can just about take 15 million to the bank," Mr. Eaton said in a statement. "And if we're lucky, we might see enough improvement next year to approach 15.5 million units."
Mr. Eaton, who takes over from Chrysler's retiring chairman, Lee A. Iacocca, on Jan. 1, said his forecast depended on a number of factors, including economic initiatives of the Clinton Administration, consumers' response and how quickly Canada recovers from recession.
Chrysler said the incentive program, which had been set to expire Dec. 31, offers cash rebates of $500 to $2,000. The promotion runs until March 31, 1993, for most models, but rebates on some models will run through next September.
As an alternative to cash, buyers may choose financing with annual percentage rates ranging from 2.9 percent for terms of up to 24 months to 6.9 percent for 49 to 60 months. Rates on mini-vans range from 5.9 percent to 8.9 percent.

HEADLINE: Bank Rates Remain Flat This Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The average yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit for the week beginning today are little changed from the previous week, according to the latest survey by The Bank Rate Monitor.
Analysts at The Monitor see no further interest rate reductions coming from the Federal Reserve, which has cut rates two dozen times since June 1989. 
 If anything, The Monitor analysts said, the numbers are in a holiday holding pattern, with the exception of a few banks, after going through a modest run-up from mid-October.
Since then, yields on certificates of deposit have risen about 5 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, on the short end and about 22 basis points on the long end, but yields on money market accounts have fallen.
At the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills on Monday, average discount rates were down. The auction is often seen as a sign of deposit-rate changes in the weeks ahead.
The average rate at auction fell 10 basis points for a three-month bill, to 3.16 percent, while a six-month bill fell 9 basis points, to 3.32 percent .
In the New York area, the average money market account yield is the same as the previous week for the second straight week, yielding 2.74 percent. For certificates of deposit, yields are down a basis point for a three-month maturity, to 2.85 percent, and down 2 basis points for a six-month maturity, to 3 percent.
At area savings banks, which traditionally offer higher yields than commercial banks, the average yield on a three-month C.D. is down a basis point, to 2.93 percent, and unchanged on a six-month certificate at 3.10 percent.
 
 
 
Bank Money Accounts
Annual effective yields, in percent, on moneymarket accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Wednesday, Dec. 23, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yield are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Lumber Up by Daily Limit As Supplies Have Tightened

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Lumber-contract prices soared yesterday on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange as wholesalers seeking supplies for the new year found little available from American mills.
On other commodity markets, precious metals retreated; oil futures fell, and grains and soybeans were mixed, as were livestock and meat futures. 
 Spruce 2-by-4's for January delivery shot up the permitted daily limit of $5, to $268.80 for 1,000 board feet. It was the fourth limit gain in the last six trading sessions for lumber, which has risen $23.50, or about 9.6 percent, in a month.
 
'Going Hand to Mouth'
 Signs of a strengthening economy have injected optimism into the building materials industry, and lumber wholesalers looking to restock for an expected construction boom are having to turn to the futures market to lock in supplies, analysts said.
Environmental restrictions on logging in the Northwest and soggy ground conditions in the Southeast have cut deeply into the availability of yellow pine, hemlock and Douglas fir, leading to heightened demand for Canadian spruce, the futures-traded wood.
"The mills are going hand to mouth having to find logs, if they can find them," said Bud Merrill, lumber analyst for Shearson Lehman Brothers in Eugene, Ore.
 
Profit Taking in Oil
 Curt Cunningham, president of the Pacific Futures Trading Company in Seattle, said the harvest from Federal timberlands on the West Coast was 20 percent to 25 percent below a year ago and 45 percent below two years ago, mainly as a result of logging restrictions prompted by environmental concerns.
Profit taking also lowered oil futures prices on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
Light sweet crude oil for February delivery fell 14 cents, to $19.84 a barrel; January heating oil fell 0.28 cent, to 56.83 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline tumbled 0.79 cent, to 54.73 cents a gallon, and February natural gas rose 0.3 cent, to $1.783 forr 1,000 cubic feet.
Soybean futures prices rose in quiet trading on the Chicago Board of Trade, lifted mainly by strong demand for soybean meal. Grain futures ended narrowly mixed.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Rises on Prediction At Bundesbank of Rate Drop

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar rose yesterday against most key currencies, strengthened by a German central banker's prediction of lower interest rates in Germany.
Gold prices slipped. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery fell $1.80 to close at $332.20 a troy ounce. A late bid at the New York Republic National Bank quoted it at $332.30 an ounce, off $1.65. 
 Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, was quoted in a German newspaper interview yesterday as saying that long-term German interest rates could fall below 6 percent in the current trend of lower European interest rates. Such a decline would represent a one percentage point fall in the current long-term German bond rates.
 
Cut Depends on Inflation
 Mr. Schlesinger added that such a cut would depend upon the Bundesbank's ability to control inflation.
German monetary officials have incurred the wrath of their European neighbors this year by keeping German interest rates high in relation to other currencies. The wide gap between German rates and those of the country's neighbors was one reason behind Europe's currency crisis in the fall. Higher rates make the German mark more attractive to foreign investors.
Mr. Schlesinger's comment contributed to an appetite for dollars, which has been based on recent signs of strength in the United States economy, traders said.
In New York, the dollar closed at 1.5895 German marks, up sharply from 1.5690 marks late Monday. In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.5875 German marks, up from 1.5680.
The market was little influenced by the latest United States economic reports showing a gain in the gross domestic product for the third quarter and a survey predicting an increase in business investment spending. Those reports were in line with expectations.
The British pound was quoted at $1.5365 in London, down from $1.5640 late Monday. At the close in New York, the pound cost $1.5370, less expensive than $1.5580 late Monday.
 
Dollar vs. Yen
 In Tokyo, the dollar closed at 123.13 yen, down 0.02 yen from Monday's close. Later in London, the dollar was quoted at 123.60 yen. In New York, the dollar was quoted at 123.75 yen, up from 123.095 yen late Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.4415 Swiss francs, up from 1.4145; 5.4205 French francs, up from 5.3625; 1,422.00 Italian lire, up from 1,409.00, and 1.26195 Canadian dollars, down from 1.26725.
In Europe, dollar rates, compared with late Monday, included: 1.4350 Swiss francs, up from 1.4140; 5.4175 French francs, up from 5.3575; 1.8758 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7627; 1,421.00 Italian lire, up from 1,409.50, and 1.2605 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2674.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
3 New British Plays With Serious Messages

BYLINE: By FRANK RICH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 20

 BODY:
It's no secret that the outstanding British farce of the moment is being written every day by the royal family. But who is going to write the great tragedy this reeling former empire demands?
Battered by recession and terrorism, uncertain of its relationship with either the new Europe or the new Washington, Britain would seem, if little else, a fertile subject for its serious native playwrights. But the most celebrated drama in London this year has been "Angels in America," by Tony Kushner, a New Yorker, and the most acclaimed contemporary works on the fringe right now are "The Wexford Trilogy," in which the playwright Billy Roche examines small-town life in his native Ireland, and the expatriate American Timberlake Wertenbaker's satire on the art market, "Three Birds Alighting on a Field." The Wertenbaker play is in a return engagement at the Royal Court, which has already produced John Guare's "Six Degrees of Separation" this year and will soon present Anna Deavere Smith's "Fires in the Mirror" and David Mamet's "Oleanna." 
 In the West End, where revivals, long-running musicals, thrillers and sex comedies perennially hold sway, new British plays are as scarce as new American plays are on Broadway. But there is one bracing exception: "The Rise and Fall of Little Voice," an acrid comedy by Jim Cartwright that originated at the Royal National Theater before transferring to the Aldwych Theater for its commercial run. Mr. Cartwright, a young Lancashire writer whose "Road" was staged by Lincoln Center Theater in 1988, is not bashful about filling the stage with the muck of present-day England. Set in a squalid lower-middle-class home where the fuses constantly blow and even the cornflakes have turned rancidly green, "Little Voice" finds some of its funnier gags in onstage bouts of alcoholic vomiting and mechanical sexual grinding. When the house burns down in Act 2, the conflagration seems less a disaster for the frequently stupefied, at most semi-literate characters than a sort of liberating deliverance.
It is not the author's view of his society's collapse that makes "Little Voice" special, however, so much as the extraordinary title role he has written for a one-of-a-kind young actress named Jane Horrocks. Miss Horrocks, whom American audiences have seen as the alienated, bulimic daughter in Mike Leigh's film "Life Is Sweet," is a bone-thin, childlike woman with flat blond hair and a catatonic air. In Mr. Cartwright's play, she is the lonely, shy, agoraphobic daughter of a boozy, barking widow (Alison Steadman, who also played Miss Horrocks's mother in "Life Is Sweet") and is known as Little Voice because she rarely speaks.
What she can do is sing. In the upstairs bedroom where she retreats from her mother, Little Voice spends her time obsessively listening to her dead father's old records of female vocalists. When she chooses to express herself, she does so by impersonating the singers (her "tongues," she calls them), often incoherently intermingling fragments of the patter from Judy Garland's Carnegie Hall concert with snatches of Garland's version of "Chicago" or Marilyn Monroe's "Happy Birthday, Mr. President" or Edith Piaf's "Milord" or Shirley Bassey's "Goldfinger."
The spectacle of these clarion, uncannily accurate voices abruptly taking possession of Miss Horrocks's previously inert face and rag-doll frame is one of the most bizarre sights I've ever seen in the theater. And Mr. Cartwright capitalizes on its otherworldly sadness by making "Little Voice" the story of how the heroine's mother and the mother's latest lover, a grotesque small-time agent named Ray Say (Pete Postle thwaite), try to exploit that weird spectacle by selling the terrified girl as a "class act" to the tatty local club.
As a play, "Little Voice" is not without its own mimickry -- of "A Taste of Honey," "Joe Egg" and "The Glass Menagerie," among others. But Mr. Cartwright's incendiary dialogue and bleak comic vision are his own. They are powerfully augmented by Sam Mendes's wired production, only to be undercut by a fairy-tale denouement and the unintelligibility (to American ears, anyway) of too many lines in Miss Steadman's otherwise bravura portrait of the mother from hell. Yet all else pales before Miss Horrocks, whose Little Voice can be as haunting as the Little Sparrow she sometimes imitates. In one incredible scene, she responds to Ray Say's repeated slaps by skipping violently among her various voices as if a needle were leaping tracks on an LP. For a cathartic finale, she at last sings in her own completely unmusical voice, a harrowing, zombielike wail in which the lyrics of "Just in Time" are used to express the same loneliness, suffering and yearning Miss Horrocks had earlier poured into a mock-Garland "Over the Rainbow."
That finale is set on a glittery variety stage that recalls the shabby domain of Archie Rice in "The Entertainer," by John Osborne. It says much about what has happened to that revolutionary 1950's generation of British dramatists, without whom "The Rise and Fall of Little Voice" could not exist, that Mr. Osborne this month put the original handwritten manuscript of "Look Back in Anger" on the auction block. (His sequel to "Anger" had failed in the West End earlier this year.) Mr. Osborne's most influential theatrical contemporary, Harold Pinter, also remains an infrequent playwright. He is currently acting in a revival of his own "No Man's Land" before directing "Oleanna."
But two other writers of similar longevity, David Storey and Peter Shaffer, are represented on London stages by brand-new work. Both of their plays are running in the small studio spaces of the major theatrical companies, both lament the decline of culture in the 20th century, and both are inward, stock-taking dramas about artists facing the waning of their powers and the prospect of mortality.
Mr. Storey's elegiac 75-minute "Stages," at the National, is a monologue with interruptions in which a celebrated painter, paralyzed by depression, tries to untangle the strands of his art, his failed marriage and his impoverished childhood. Mr. Storey, the author of "This Sporting Life" and "Home," wrote a similar and more effective valedictory play called "Early Days" for Ralph Richardson in 1980. This time the actor is Alan Bates, who happily looks to be a long, long way from retirement and who does his best to mine the poetic riffs and turgid emotions of an almost perversely undramatic exercise. The director is Mr. Storey's career-long collaborator Lindsay Anderson, who, like the entire supporting cast and much of the audience, seems to be fighting off sleep.
"The Gift of the Gorgon," as Mr. Shaffer's new play at the Royal Shakespeare Company's Pit at the Barbican Center is titled, proves a far more ambitious effort. A young Midwestern academic (Jeremy Northam) travels to Greece to research a biography of the father he never knew, a provocative playwright (Michael Pennington) who has just died under mysterious circumstances. To get the story, the illegitimate son must win the confidence of his father's protective widow (Judi Dench).
The conflict is the same as in all Mr. Shaffer's plays, that of ecstatic creative passion vs. deadening reason. The audience learns through flashbacks that the dead playwright, a spiritual equivalent to Mozart in "Amadeus" and the horse-blinding Alan Strang in "Equus," was in favor of violent revenge in both his life and in his epic theatrical works, while his wife exerted the restraining hand of gentility and censorship.
But this time Mr. Shaffer seems more ambivalent than ever about his own position (to the point of confusion in his drama's resolution), and the result is a much more stimulating evening than either of its immediate predecessors in his canon, "Yonadab" (not produced in New York) and "Lettice and Lovage." As directed by Peter Hall and fiercely acted, "The Gift of the Gorgon" is compelling when it champions the power of epic theater against the onslaught of cineplex literalism, or when it deals with its moral themes in the domestic arena. When epic theater is actually attempted -- Greek myths acted out in a style reminiscent of Mr. Hall's Lincoln Center production of John Guare's "Four Baboons Adoring the Sun" -- ponderousness ensues.
Mr. Shaffer is a compulsive rewriter of even his most successful works, and one hopes that this intriguing but unsettled piece will be no exception. First, he must recover from the heart surgery that was performed as "The Gift of the Gorgon" opened last week, in a London that his play fittingly characterizes as all "drizzle, emotional and physical."

HEADLINE: Wine Talk

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
FORGET the pre-wrapped food processor. And the overpriced tie. Or the gift certificate. You can do better than that, even with only two shopping days to go. When it comes to the true last-minute Christmas gift, the cliffhanger, the desperation move, it's time to think about wine.
If you are sure of yourself -- and the recipient -- the complete recordings of Glenn Gould may be in order. Or the catalogue from the Matisse show. Or Knicks tickets. But if gift-giving confidence is not your long suit, get yourself and your credit cards to the nearest wine shop. 
 Be forewarned, though: a wine shop just before Christmas can be hazardous to your health. No bargain-basement pandemonium, of course, but tensions can run high. Vague people looking for "a nice little white wine for dinner" will get short shrift. Through Thursday, stressed-out shoppers and short-fused clerks will be the order of the day.
So try to have some idea of what you want and how much you want to pay. If your choice is out of stock, listen to the clerk. There is probably something similar, and in a good liquor store, the clerks will either know something about wine or know how to find someone who does.
If you are hopelessly lost in this world, there are plenty of packaged gift sets. For example: a wicker basket holding four Champagnes -- Moet & Chandon Brut, Mumm Cordon Rouge, Piper-Heidsieck Brut and Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin Yellow Label Brut -- all for about $160 at Morrell & Company, 535 Madison Avenue (54th Street) in Manhattan.
Morrell has an even more impressive selection, a wicker hamper with six prestige cuvee Champagnes: Mumm Grand Cordon, Dom Perigon, Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame and Perrier-Jouet Fleur de Champagne, all from the 1985 vintage, along with a Krug Grand Cuvee and a Laurent-Perrier Rose, both nonvintage; all for $550.
Sherry-Lehmann, at 679 Madison Avenue (61st Street), offers a variety of wicker hampers, tote-bags and baskets ranging from $8 for a wicker baguette basket that can hold one bottle to an elaborate straw picnic case for $35. The wine to put in them is extra, but three bottles of Beaujolais nouveau would be about $18.
Speaking of the nouveau, which is quite tasty this year, a case of it at less than $70 makes a particularly appropriate gift. It's as seasonal as a holly wreath and at its best right now. Duboeuf, Ropiteau, Drouhin and Mommessin are just a few of the producers. Just as an aside, my own choice would be a case of the 1991 Beaujolais Villages for about a dollar a bottle more. The '91 Beaujolais were outstanding.
Always popular at this time of year is the idea of pairing a bottle of premium Champagne, like Dom Perignon, with two champagne flutes, often in a satin-lined box. A tall, thin flute is the preferred glass for sparkling wine, but if the recipients of this sort of gift have none to begin with, it might be more sensible to give six or a dozen flutes and let them buy their own champagne. Though champagne flutes can cost as much as $150 each, very good ones can be found for around $8 apiece.
Actually, a bottle of Dom Perigon, around $80, or any other fine Champagne, needs no embellishment. Not that most Champagne fans would not be delighted to get a bottle or two of Bollinger brut, which costs considerably less, about $28.
If you are buying for someone eager to be on top of events, consider J. Schram, the new premium sparkling wine from Schramsberg Vineyards in California. For about $50, it is intended to go against the best France has to offer.
If spirits seem more in keeping with the season, there are some magnificent Cognacs and Armagnacs. Here, the price range is astonishing. Remy Martin offers its Louis XIII in a Baccarat decanter for around $850 to $900, and Olev Kelt's Les Quatre Vents -- The Four Winds -- sells for $1,500 a bottle. More down to earth is Danflou's Fine Champagne for about $42 or Hennessy's V.S.O.P. for a dollar or two more.
Two truly elegant Cognacs are the Chateau Lafite-Rothschild Reserve, about $190, and the Selection Davidoff, from the famous cigar maker, about $175.
Personally, I'd opt for Armagnac. Cognac has more finesse, is silkier and more nuanced. Armagnac tends to be a bit rougher around the edges but at its best offers extraordinary richness and depth. What's more, unlike Cognac, which is a blend of different vintages, Armagnac can be vintaged. Morrell is offering a selection of vintage Armagnacs this year, including, from Loubere, a 1956 at $99.50 and a 1935 at $185.
There is no American Armagnac yet, but there is an excellent Cognac-style brandy. It's a single-cask brandy from Germain-Robin in California, and for about $40, it rivals many better-known names from the Charente district.
Mercifully, there seem to be fewer wine gadgets around this year. Perhaps it's the economy. We are told that the wine market has improved markedly in recent months, so we can probably expect a new wave of wine kitsch by this time next year.
But a gadget that has been around for a few years deserves your consideration: the Screwpull Lever by the Hallen Company. As hand-held cork pullers go, nothing is in its class. It costs about $100 and makes an excellent gift for a wine enthusiast. Unless your friends prefer their wine from screw-top bottles.
 
 
 
TASTINGS

 
Zind-Humbrecht, 1991 Pinot Blanc, Alsace; about $13.
Robert M. Parker Jr. once referred to pinot blanc as the poor man's chardonnay. At $13, this wine probably could not qualify as a poor man's wine. But given its exceptional quality, it is very much a bargain. Like all Zind-Humbrecht wines, it has intense flavors and a beautiful bouquet, a result of very low yields from the vineyards. There is a touch of spiciness, but this is no gewurztraminer, the true spicy wine of Alsace; this is leaner and more elegant. One of pinot blanc's qualities is its freshness, which is another way of saying that it tends to be acidic. This one has plenty of acidity but is well balanced by concentrated fruit, a Zind-Humbrecht trademark. It is a wine that should be drunk within a year or two of the harvest, four at the most. It is a welcome substitute for chardonnay and, in fact, is better than many of the wines made from that overrated grape.

HEADLINE: Presidential Priorities;
Mr. Clinton's New World Symphony

 BODY:
President-elect Clinton has assembled an experienced foreign policy team wise in the ways of Washington and skilled, variously, at devising policies and effecting them. But caution and competence stir no souls. If there's to be music, all now depends on the conductor. Mr. Clinton will need to define his new direction -- like the promising pro-democracy course he began to chart during the campaign.
Warren Christopher, his choice as Secretary of State, said as much yesterday, citing the global environment and global economic competition among the challenges of this new era. The appointees who will serve closest to Mr. Clinton, Anthony Lake and Samuel Berger at the National Security Council, had a large part in drafting his new direction in the campaign. And Mr. Clinton's other senior appointees have the know-how to put it into practice. 
 But the priorities will have to come from the President-elect. With warlords rampaging where the Red Army once cast its shadow, he'll need above all to articulate the standards for engagement abroad.
Mr. Lake, Mr. Clinton's choice for national security adviser, first won note as a young Foreign Service officer who took pains to learn Vietnamese. He and his designated deputy, Mr. Berger, began to challenge cold war dogmas 15 years ago, when they ran the State Department's Policy Planning staff under Cyrus Vance.
Mr. Christopher has repeatedly demonstrated dignified managerial acumen -- during the Iran hostage crisis in 1979-80, and more recently in the Clinton transition. His qualifications are enhanced by his insight, as well, into domestic affairs, including police reform in Los Angeles.
The choice of Clifton Wharton as Mr. Christopher's deputy underscores the connection between domestic and foreign policy. Mr. Wharton built his reputation as a university administrator and pension fund manager.
Les Aspin, Mr. Clinton's choice for Secretary of Defense, has spent his political life preparing for that job, first as a whiz kid in Robert McNamara's Pentagon, later as a goad and gadfly on the House Armed Services Committee. His work this year on options for downsizing the force structure was analytically sound. But the option he favored was fatter than U.S. security requires.
James Woolsey will have a difficult job weaning the C.I.A. from its cold war mentality, cutting the intelligence budget and redirecting its resources. His well-earned reputation for tough-mindedness as an Under Secretary of the Navy and conventional arms negotiator won't hurt.
The importance of collective security in this new era is nowhere more obvious than at the United Nations. Madeleine Albright, Mr. Clinton's choice of envoy, has no experience there but did serve as a staff member on President Carter's National Security Council and as a Democratic foreign policy adviser in the last three Presidential campaigns.
Bill Clinton has assembled a band of talented instrumentalists to confront the New World Order. The score remains to be composed.

HEADLINE: Hunger, a Growth Industry

 BODY:
Despite the tepid economy, one New York enterprise continues to grow rapidly. City Harvest, the nonprofit group that collects leftovers and delivers them to the hungry, expanded by 30 percent this year. City Harvest is likely to keep growing. There's no shortfall in supply or, unfortunately, demand.
That disturbing fact poses a challenge for Democrats about to move into the White House. 
 Helen VerDuin Palit, who had run a soup kitchen in New Haven, set up City Harvest in New York 10 years ago. The idea is simple: Since many people are hungry and much food goes to waste, find a way to get the food to the people.
This year City Harvest's eight vehicles will collect and distribute about 6 million pounds of food, up from 4.6 million in 1991. Bret Suval, who took over from Ms. Palit two years ago, now keeps the trucks rolling 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to make pickups even from after-theater banquets and bakers at work in the wee hours.
Even so, he says, City Harvest doesn't come close to meeting the need. It distributes to only 130 of the 750 soup kitchens, food pantries and other distribution groups in the city. Meanwhile the supply of leftovers still seems limitless, as New Yorkers continue their dining out, their weddings, bar mitzvahs, holiday parties, corporate feasts, movie shoots and charity balls.
The idea appears to be catching on nationwide. A group called the Prepared and Perishable Food Programs Network has been meeting since 1990 and soon will turn itself into a formal organization called Food Chain. It counts some 120 programs in 38 states. There's Operation Food Search in St. Louis, Twelve Baskets in St. Paul, Food Brigade in Santa Fe.
Private donations pay for City Harvest's $2 million annual budget; most of the other groups rely on charity and volunteer labor. But why leave so demonstrably successful and necessary an enterprise to the vagaries of private funding?
A Federal grant of another $2 million, for example, might allow City Harvest to expand its fleet and get within striking distance of serving all the shelters and soup kitchens that could use leftovers. Similar grants to proven programs in other cities could also yield dramatic returns.
Chronic hunger continues to shame America; so does chronic waste. Why not maximize so obvious and cost-effective a response?

HEADLINE: Home Care Serves a Need, Provides Jobs and Is Cost-Effective

 BODY:
To the Editor:
New York State's home care program, which faces serious budget cuts by the Department of Social Services, offers true social and cost advantages (front page, Nov. 20). 
 Home care is provided to the elderly or disabled with financial need who are unable to care for themselves. For less than $10 an hour (including staff salary, benefits and the costs of administration), the program lets them stay at home, a humane alternative to much more costly nursing homes. Many of the services these patients need can be provided by people with modest education; thus the program provides work to thousands of men and women.
The program limits Medicaid expenditure by keeping down the costs of care and generates tax revenue by providing work to those who might otherwise be unemployed and receiving Government benefits.
Let's hope the home care program survives the critics who would destroy it.

HEADLINE: Real Estate;
New Hotel For Glutted Los Angeles

BYLINE: By Morris Newman

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
CITY officials are hailing the opening of the 439-room Inter-Continental Hotel, a $100 million project that faces a bleak occupancy situation in the lodging industry.
The hotel is in California Plaza, a $1.2 billion, 11-acre mixed-use project in Bunker Hill, a financial district in the city's downtown area, which has been under redevelopment since 1959. The 17-story hotel and a 217-unit residential tower are the two most recent additions to California Plaza, which also contains two office buildings and the Los Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. A third office building and a second residential tower are planned. 
 The developer is California Plaza Hotel L.P., whose general partners are the Tobishima Development Company of Japan and Metropolitan Structures, which is 50 percent owned by the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company. The hotel operator is the Saison Group of Japan.
Despite the poor hotel market, Michael Collins, senior vice president of the Los Angeles Convention and Tourism Bureau, said downtown Los Angeles needed 4,000 more hotel rooms for conventions that are being booked for the late 1990's. The Los Angeles Convention Center is near completion of a one-million-square-foot, $500 million extension.
But the current situation is a marked contrast to three years ago, Mr. Collins said, when 15 new hotels were proposed for downtown Los Angeles. "They all dried up or went into suspended animation when the recession hit us," he said.
Hotel occupancy in downtown Los Angeles for 1992 is projected at 51.8 percent, according to PKF Associates, a unit of Pannell Kerr Forster International. A variety of factors, including the temporary closing of the Los Angeles Convention Center, the recession and the riots in Los Angeles last spring have hurt hotel occupancy in downtown Los Angeles this year.
"It's good for downtown L.A. to have another hotel, but it's unfortunately opening at the worst possible time," said Bruce Baltin, a PKF director.
While the hotel is about a mile from the Convention Center, it is only two blocks from the Los Angeles Music Center on the north end of Bunker Hill. The hotel plans to operate vans to take people from concerts to late-night restaurants and lounges, with the intent of promoting night life in a downtown that is largely empty after 5 P.M.
The hotel is in a style described as contemporary by its architects, Flatow Moore Bryan Shaffer & McCabe of Albuquerque, N.M. According to the architects, both the design and the naturally finished sandstone are intended to complement the reddish sandstone of the nearby art museum, which was designed by Arata Isozaki of Japan and completed in 1985. The interiors, by Hugh Latta of Design Continuum Inc. of Atlanta, feature neo-classical moldings and light-colored stone.
Single rooms run from $165 to $225 daily, while doubles range from $195 to $255. The Presidential Suite goes for $1,500 nightly.
Despite an unresolved dispute with Local 11 of the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union over whether the hotel will be a union shop, the management is emphasizing its role as a fair employer. "We are bringing 240 new jobs to the area," Michel Tourniaire, the hotel manager, said.
Mr. Tourniaire seems philosophical about a hotel market in which half the guest rooms are empty, saying he has seen worse times as the manager of other Inter-Continental Hotels in Iran and Thailand during revolutions in those countries. Compared with those events, Mr. Tourniaire said, "a recession in L.A. isn't so bad."

HEADLINE: Babes in Computerland

BYLINE: By David Gelernter; David Gelernter, associate professor of computer science at Yale, is author of "Mirror Worlds."

DATELINE: NEW HAVEN

 BODY:
Computers, we're being told, are the answer to America's education ills. Not long ago, I heard from a parent about aggressive computer acquisition plans at the school where my 5-year-old attends kindergarten.
The same week, I appeared on a panel with Benno Schmidt, the president and chief executive officer of Whittle Communications' schooling-for-profit Edison Project. He explained the project's vision of "radical change," with classroom computers playing a big role. As we all know by now, President-elect Clinton talks a lot about technology and about education. 
 I'm an easy mark for enthusiasts. Moreover, I've lost no opportunity to pontificate about the importance of scientific and technological literacy. But the more I learn about classroom computing, the more nervous I get.
Today, computers in the classroom are modestly useful. In the future, new computing trends combined with our laziness about education could lead to disaster.
I worry that computers will be used to undermine the teaching of basic skills. The pocket calculator syndrome is well-known: over-reliance on calculators has harmed the teaching of basic arithmetic; computers are calculators writ large. If sophisticated kids' drawing programs infiltrate the schools, will children ever again feel the need to pick up a crayon? Style-checker programs evaluate writing by applying grammatical and stylistic rules; if a program can tell students whether their writing is good or bad, will they still be motivated to develop an ear for prose?
I worry that computers will undermine children's already morbidly depressed desire to read. Multimedia and hypermedia are buzzwords in educational computing.
Multimedia beefs up those mere boring words with audio and video as you browse through a text on a computer screen. What better way to make even a well-written, profusely color-illustrated book seem dull? Multimedia promotions talk up the feeling of "psychological immersion" that their systems produce. Novels used to deliver that product. A child's imagination needs exercise to develop.
Hypermedia does away with a linear presentation of material and encourages readers to roam aimlessly through a text. When you reach the end of a paragraph you don't continue on. You hop forward, at the click of a mouse button, to whatever next topic suits you -- impulse shopping for ideas. It's fun. It's also the ultimate scholarly medium of the Sesame Street age, in which nothing ever lasts for more than three minutes. Hypermedia is no way to develop concentration or the ability to understand the unfolding of a logical argument.
I worry that these systems are promoted on the grounds that kids love them. Of course kids love them! When I was a child, nothing made me happier than seeing a movie in class instead of having to turn on my brain and pay attention to the teacher.
 Most of all, I worry that the educational establishment isn't worried. Granted, these approaches can all be valuable. But to the extent that they become the educational main act and not the sideshow they should be, they all fail in the same ominous way, by fostering glitz over substance. Do schools really need a brand-new way to promote shallowness?
The situation isn't completely bleak. The tutoring software coming into use is hardly exciting but can be helpful. More important, check out the Edison Project's brochure: "If math, physics and leadership are learned more effectively when one actually builds a bridge, then set students to building bridges."
Right. But don't stop at mere hardware bridges, have students build economies, ecosystems, Napoleonic armies -- out of software. Borrow from the military's "man-in-the-loop war-gaming" techniques to let students participate in labor negotiations or a session of Congress or a stock market crash. Software is the greatest modeling clay of all time.
Unlike the predigested, canned reality of today's popular programs, these systems are dynamic, interactive and unpredictable. They offer something new, not just glitzy versions of the same old stuff.
Still, the prognosis is grim. Americans are too easily satisfied. We ask too little of our computers (which is why most are still such a royal pain to use). Sadly, we ask too little of our schools. A study comparing American and Asian schools in the December Scientific American shows Americans excelling only at self-satisfaction. Unless we get serious about classroom computers, the machines won't be agents of revolutionary change -- they will be the low-guilt, high-tech pacifiers of a vacuous Information Age.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
CLINTON PLANNING TO NAME A WOMAN FOR JUSTICE DEPT.

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 23

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton is prepared to name Zoe Baird, senior vice president and general counsel for Aetna Life and Casualty in Hartford as Attorney General, transition officials confirmed tonight. Ms. Baird would be the first woman to hold the post.
News of Ms. Baird's nomination came barely 48 hours after she came here to be interviewed by Mr. Clinton and at the end of a day in which other candidates' names rose and fell within hours of each other. 
 Mr. Clinton is also expected to announce on Thursday that he has selected Bruce Babbitt, the former Arizona Governor, to be Secretary of the Interior, Federico F. Pena, the former Mayor of Denver, as Transportation Secretary, Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi as Secretary of Agriculture and Mickey Kantor, a Los Angeles lawyer who helped run his campaign, as United States Trade Representative, the officials said.
 
Meeting Christmas Deadline
 The flurry of appointments, first reported by the Associated Press, would allow Mr. Clinton to meet his self-imposed Christmas deadline for completing his Cabinet.
Ms. Baird, 40 , is not unfamiliar in Washington circles. She served as associate counsel to President Jimmy Carter and was once a partner in the office there of O'Melveny & Myers, the law firm based in Los Angeles in which Warren M. Christopher, Mr. Clinton's transition director, is a partner.
Ms. Baird was an informal policy adviser to Mr. Clinton in the campaign, primarily on health care issues, and attended his recent meeting on the economy. She received a law degree from the University of California at Berkeley, and before going to Aetna two years ago, she was a senior lawyer at the General Electric Company.
She is a Brooklyn native and lives in New Haven. In June, she was named by Business Week magazine as one of the 50 top women in business.
 
Ending Flurry of Speculation
 Her fortunes rose so suddenly that at least one other finalist for the job, Brooksley E. Born, a Washington lawyer, believed she had been offered the job, according to associates.
The announcement that Mr. Babbitt would take the post at the Interior Department ended a 48-hour flurry of speculation that Mr. Babbitt had been bounced from contention for the position in favor of a Hispanic candidate, Representative Bill Richardson of New Mexico.
And Mr. Espy, who has long been considered Mr. Clinton's top choice for Secretary of Agriculture, emerged as the nominee for the job even after Mr. Clinton interviewed former Gov. George Sinner of North Dakota here today.
Mr. Espy, 39, would be the first black to hold the agriculture post. He was elected to Congress in 1987 and represents a largely rural district.
Mr. Espy serves on the House Agriculture Committee and was an early supporter of Mr. Clinton. He was also one of several black politicians who defended Mr. Clinton against accusations that he was distancing himself from black voters by alienating the Rev. Jesse Jackson.
Mr. Clinton's decision to give the United States Trade Representative job to his friend Mr. Kantor would also end the ideological feud about who would fill this Cabinet post. Some people active in trade issues had debated whether the person who took the job should be in favor of open markets or restricting them in order to benefit American businesses.
Mr. Kantor, who was chairman of Mr. Clinton's campaign, is a Los Angeles lawyer with Manatt, Phelps, Phillips & Kantor. Mr. Kantor, 52, is a native of Nashville with experience in Presidential campaigns dating back to 1976 when he headed the campaign of Edmund G. Brown Jr., then Governor of California. He was also state chairman of President Carter's re-election campaign in 1980 and of Walter F. Mondale's campaign in 1984
 
A Tumultuous Week
 Mr. Pena benefited from Mr. Clinton's desire to nominate a second Hispanic member of his Cabinet. Last week he named Henry G. Cisneros, the former Mayor of San Antonio, to be Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.
A two-term state legislator who defeated a 14-year incumbent to become Denver's first Hispanic mayor in 1983, Mr. Pena served in that job until 1991. In 1988 he started the drive to build the $3 billion dollar Denver International Airport, which is scheduled to be opened by next fall. Since leaving as Mayor, Mr. Pena has been operating a Denver investment and counseling firm.
Mr. Clinton has had a tumultuous week of last-minute decision making that revolved primarily around his attempt to sort through finalists in search of women and Hispanics to fill the final five cabinet jobs.
Ms. Baird's nomination in particular would end weeks of frantic searching. Mr. Clinton had decided he wanted to nominate a woman to lead the Justice Department, but had been stymied when his leading choice, Judge Patricia M. Wald of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, decided against joining the Administration after being approached on two separate occasions.
 
Pena and Richardson
 Mr. Clinton's comment earlier this week that there was a "definite possibility" that he would appoint another Hispanic to a top post caused a flurry among supporters of Mr. Babbitt, who had been in line to head the Interior Department. He is 54 and ran for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988. He is known for tough talk about the economy and for having a sense of humor.
Reports that Mr. Babbitt might be replaced by Mr. Richardson, who is Hispanic, caused objections from some environmental groups that supported the former Arizona Governor.
Mr. Pena's emergence apparently doomed Mr. Richardson's chances, because Mr. Clinton was able to fulfill his diversity goals without rejecting Mr. Babbitt, who is a longtime friend.
Earlier this week, he dropped Tim Wirth, a political ally who is departing as United States Senator from Colorado, from contention for Energy Secretary in favor of nominating Hazel R. O'Leary, a Minnesota power company executive who is black.
Mr. Stephanopoulos said earlier today that Mr. Clinton had not scaled down his search for the best-qualified candidates to satisfy his desire for diversity.
"This is a subjective call when you talk about best qualified," Mr. Stephanopoulos said. "He wants a diverse Cabinet, he wants a Cabinet of excellent people who are well qualified or strong administrators who have views and expertise in the subjects at hand.
"I don't know that you can come out on any measure and say this person is clearly best, this person is clearly second best," he said.
"It's more important to get the right people than to meet the right deadline," Mr. Stephanopoulos said.
All of the new appointees are Democrats, a move that apparently flies in the face of Mr. Clinton's stated intention to name Republicans to his Cabinet to assure political diversity as well as representation from different sex and racial groups.

HEADLINE: Age Bias Case Cites Brokerage in 17 Dismissals

BYLINE: By SELWYN RAAB

 BODY:
In what Government lawyers said was the first major age-discrimination case against a brokerage and securities firm, a Federal agency yesterday accused Kidder, Peabody of unlawfully dismissing 17 senior executives, all of whom were paid $100,000 or more a year.
The Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission asserted in a lawsuit filed in Manhattan that the executives had been dismissed since January 1990, apparently as part of a youth movement in the firm's upper echelons and to fill their jobs with lower-paid employees. The ages of the former employees, who held the titles of managing director, senior vice president and vice president, ranged from 43 to 60 at the time of their dismissals.
 
 
'Younger, Cheaper Staff'
 "There was a movement at Kidder to open up positions for younger executives," said James L. Lee, the commission's chief lawyer in the New York metropolitan area. "They apparently were trying to get a younger, cheaper staff." 
 Describing the charges as "ridiculous," a spokeswoman for Kidder, Peabody & Company, Helen B. Platt, said the company maintained strict policies against discrimination. Ms. Platt said the company would not comment on the specific individuals but she added that "typically these complaints come from people who are underperforming."
She said the company had 5,000 employees in 46 cities and eight foreign counties and that "lots of them are over the age of 40 and 50." Since January 1990, Ms. Platt said, more than 100 other "professionals" had been dismissed, laid off or resigned from jobs at levels similar to those of the 17 cited in the suit.
A lawyer for the firm, Ronald M. Green, said Kidder, Peabody was being used as a "legal guinea pig" by the commission to determine if the agency has jurisdiction to investigate disputes involving employees who are registered with the New York Stock Exchange. All of the 17, as a condition of employment, had signed agreements requiring them to submit dismissal grievances to binding arbitration, rather than through court action, he said.
The year the Kidder dismissals began, 1990, was one of the most unprofitable for Wall Street, with Kidder itself losing $50 million. Securities firms cut jobs by the thousands to stanch the losses, and many of the companies were accused in civil lawsuits of dismissing the oldest employees, and women, first.
In 1991, Kidder rode Wall Street's return to profitability. The firm earned $119 million that year. And for 1992, Kidder, a unit of the General Electric Company, has had what its executives expect to be one of the most profitable years in securities firm's history. Donald R. Livingston, the commission's general counsel, maintained that under a 1991 Supreme Court ruling, the agency had the authority to pursue age discrimination suits brought to its attention against brokerage companies.
Mr. Lee said the commission had brought age-discrimination suits concerning hundreds of complainants against individual companies but never before a multiple case against a securities firm.
In the suit filed in the United States District Court in Manhattan, the commission said that based on a two-year investigation, it found that the 17 had been discharged "because of their age," in violation of the Age Discrimination in Employment Act of 1967.
Mr. Livingston, at a news conference announcing the suit, said that the number of age-bias complaints made nationwide to the agency had increased by 25 percent since 1990, from 14,526 to 19,350 for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30. He attributed the rise mainly to the economic recession.
"When the economy gets bad, some employers believe they can achieve greater savings sometimes on the backs of older employees," he said.
The vast majority of the complaints are settled through conciliation instead of suits, Mr. Livingston noted.
Mr. Livingston said the commission's inquiry had not turned up evidence of widespread age discrimination in the securities industry. Most of the 17 named in the suit had worked at Kidder, Peabody's main office at 10 Hanover Square in the Manhattan's financial district but several were in the company's Boston branch.
Louis Graziano, the commission's trial lawyer for the case, said that several of the discharged employees, whom he declined to identify, had been asked to retire although they were in their 40's or 50's. One complainant, according to Mr. Graziano, said that before being dismissed, a high management official told him that Kidder, Peabody needed younger bankers.
"The complainant was warned that the company wanted to get rid of gray hairs and dead wood," Mr. Graziano said.
The investigation arose from a complaint by Charles D. Erickson, who was dismissed in June 1990, at the age of 50, as a managing director in the firm's investment banking division. He had been in charge of sales in the utility finance group.
Mr. Erickson, who had been with the company for 25 years, brought his complaints to the commission in November 1990.
In an interview, Mr. Erickson, who lives in Essex Fells, N.J., said he had been selected by the company as its "Man of the Year" in 1986 for the volume of business he had brought to the utility finance group.
He maintained that the four executives ousted in his division were all over the age of 40.

HEADLINE: Czechoslovak Colleges Fight the ABC's: Apathy, Bureaucracy, Communism

BYLINE: By MARLISE SIMONS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PRAGUE

 BODY:
In his history class at Charles University, Karel Kubis befuddles his students with questions like: Was the American Revolution a real revolution? Was the French Revolution? And was the French Revolution devalued by the terror that followed it?
Most perplexing for the students is that there are no longer right or wrong answers: Mr. Kubis wants a debate, an exercise in critical thinking, evidence that history can be analyzed from several points of view. He is pleased when, in response, the class wants to question Czechoslovakia's own "Velvet Revolution" of 1989. 
 Three years after the universities stood in the forefront of protests against the Communist Government, a transformation in learning is under way across the country and educators struggle with the challenge of teaching students how to think and function in an open, critical and competitive society.
 
The Burdens of History
 Their daunting handicap, though, is that the instructors who are supposed to be fostering the new thinking are usually themselves products of the rigid, fixed ways of the past.
Thus, though Czechoslovakia is a pace-setter for educational change in the former Communist countries, it also mirrors how far they still have to go. The reflection is one of acute shortages of libraries, classrooms, money and well-trained, motivating teachers.
After Jan. 1, when Czechoslovakia splits into two nations, the situation may worsen in Slovakia, which is poorer than the Czech Republic.
"We are sclerotic, that's the problem," said Radim Palous, a philosopher and chemist who is now rector of Charles University in Prague, one of the oldest seats of learning in Europe. He speaks of education crippled for more than half a century, beginning in 1939, when Nazi Germany first closed the university, and then in the decades that followed, when Communism cut learning off from the modern world.
"We have to adapt to new sciences, new methods," Mr. Palous said. "We are searching for new standards. But how? Where do we get new teachers?"
 
Books vs. Business Skills
 As a reminder of a proud past dating to 1348, Mr. Palous led the way into the university's medieval Great Hall. He also made a point of showing the ancient ceremonial robe and mace of his office, as though still incredulous to find himself, a philosopher and chemist, at the head of this institution after the years of arrests, of holding clandestine philosophy seminars, of working as a furnace stoker.
Specialists, including foreign economists, say the state of education is a better barometer for durable change than the capitalist arts, which are already blooming in the region.
They also see education as a truer gauge of the complexity and the time required in creating a democratic society, even in Czechoslovakia, which once had strong liberal traditions.
"Our smooth and nonviolent 'Velvet Revolution' of 1989 created the illusion that the transformation from socialism would be swift and easy," said Jiri Musil, the rector of the new Central European University. "In education, that illusion is gone. The core of the problem is that we have an unbelievable scarcity of human resources, of good teachers. And no one can solve this quickly."
Some educators here, even those grateful for the help coming from the West, say they wish the West would stop harping on the glories of business expertise. They believe this shows a misunderstanding of the long-term needs of Central and Eastern Europe.
"Our disaster lies in the way people think, in their closed and passive minds," Mr. Musil said. "It's not the absence of management skills."
 
A New University's Goals
 He says Central European University in Prague is in the forefront of change because it aims at preparing the new intellectual elite. "We want to train future academics, politicians, civil servants," he said, "in the bases of an open society, the people who will build up civil society."
This graduate school in social sciences and humanities is largely financed by the Soros Foundation in New York, which was founded by George Soros, a Hungarian-born businessman, to promote democracy in Eastern Europe. Thus it is privileged compared with local institutes, providing its 110 students with one of the nation's best libraries and an international staff.
Although foreign foundations and governments, including the United States, have sent books, equipment, teachers and money, shortages everywhere are daunting.
Most precarious is the fate of Trnava University, founded in 1635, the oldest university in Slovakia, which had its funds cut back in September. The Government has claimed insolvency, but students and teachers said in angry demonstrations that the Government wants to throttle the school because the rector and others oppose the official Slovak nationalist line.
 
Classic Books, by Xerox
 At the English department at Charles University, a photocopy machine donated by the British Council makes up for missing texts, as long as teachers pay for the paper. An instructor discussing Jane Austen has used it to copy entire novels.
"I only pick essays," an American teacher said. "My courses are determined by the length of a text. If it's more than 20 pages, it will take me too long to Xerox copies."
Yet across the country, a whirlwind of formal changes has already put a great distance between this academic year and the time, just three years ago, when Czechs and Slovaks studied scientific atheism and the legal relationships between state enterprises.
The ubiquitous institutes of Marxism-Leninism have gone, and so have the many compulsory courses spun from its doctrine. The 23 Czech and 15 Slovak institutes of higher education have all overhauled their curriculums. Some changed crucial subjects like law and history; others, particularly technical institutes, tried to end the Communist-style separation between teaching and research, which was reserved for the prestigious, but separate, science academies.
 
New Curriculums Not Enough
 In its soot-covered buildings around town, Charles University has recently revived departments like theology, political science and sociology and opened new studies in economics and computer science.
Monica Vesela, a fifth-year history student, is not impressed. She singled out Mr. Kubis, the history professor, as a man of "modern" ideas, but she said she had not seen much change.
"Seventy percent of our teachers are the same people who talk the same boring way and are just as inflexible as before," she said. Many older teachers, expelled in the past as ideologically suspect, have been reinstated.
Milos Kocman, a law student, said the old-time lecturers have learned the new laws but teach on the old principle of "just copy and learn by heart."
 
First, Purge the Communists
 Except for the former East Germany, no other former East-bloc country has staged a political purge quite like Czechoslovakia's. The reaction has been intense because Czechoslovakia's former Communist bosses gave great importance to controlling all liberal reflexes, dismissing hundreds of scholars and teachers.
In the counterpurge since 1989, hundreds of faculty and staff members have lost their jobs. Many were forced out by students who labeled them Communist Party hacks or police informers, others simply because their specialties in doctrine or central planning are obsolete. Those who remain are a mix of former Communists and their critics, though many dissidents have gone into politics.
The Education Ministry says it has no statistics on these changes, but some specialists estimate that since 1989, perhaps 3,000 people, including 10 percent of the instructors and most administrators, have lost jobs in education. Mr. Palous said Charles University alone dismissed 500 of its 3,500 teachers.
Even libraries have been weeding out their shelves. "People are so allergic, they are rooting out all Marxist material, even Western views of Marxism," said Richard Ayres, a British librarian at the Central European University, who expressed a collector's regrets. "It's disturbing. They're not locking it up but throwing it all away."
 
No Lack of Enthusiasm
 But the thirst for education is impressive. Charles University, which has 30,000 students, this year had 42,000 applicants; only 6,000 were accepted. The crush has been greatest at the law schools, where 7,000 students applied and teachers complain that the 900 admitted far exceed capacity.
Communist governments had kept enrollment low, often responding to the dictates of central planners.
But demand is now high for almost any course. The Czech Republic, which had 89,000 students enrolled in higher education in 1985, has more than 150,000 enrolled today; enrollment in Slovakia has jumped at the same rate, to 60,000.
This puts enormous demands on a Government strapped for cash. Officials say they may start charging for education, which is free, as it was under Communism. Communist spending on education, despite official propaganda, was relatively low.
In 1988, Government spending on higher education accounted for eight-tenths of 1 percent of the gross national product, compared to 1 percent in West Germany, 1.3 percent in the United States and 1.8 percent, one of the highest rates, in the Netherlands. A study of higher education in Czechoslovakia to be published shortly by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development recommends that the Government start looking for private contributions, increase the number of students per teacher and give greater autonomy to schools.
Many educators agree that the battle for education will be slow and hard to win. A glimpse of this can be seen at the Teachers' Training College in Prague. Vlastimil Parizek, a deputy director, said that among the 3,000 students, a growing number have financial problems. "One of my students works half the week in a pizza parlor on Wenceslas Square, one is a night watchman, one is a waiter," he said.
Claire Wallace, a Briton who heads the sociology department at the Central European University, said the greater challenge was to break down the conformism and apathy wrought by years in a mental straitjacket.
"The mindset here is, so Marxism was wrong," she said. "So what shall I do now, where are the new rules? Most students are not looking to think but to get the new recipe. It takes time to revive, to re-open the mind."

HEADLINE: U.S. COURT DELAYS WELFARE CUTBACK

BYLINE: By JANE GROSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 23

 BODY:
A Federal judge has temporarily blocked California from paying lower welfare benefits to poor women and children who move here from other states, a policy that is a linchpin of Gov. Pete Wilson's effort to cut spiraling welfare costs and balance the budget.
Under the two-tiered benefit system, aid to newcomers would be limited for 12 months to the amounts they received in their former states. The policy was approved by the Legislature this fall and went into effect on Dec. 1, when the state received a Federal waiver. 
 But the new system was challenged this week in Federal District Court in Sacramento in a suit brought by civil rights and legal service groups. The court order to restore full benefits to the newcomers was issued on Tuesday by Judge Milton L. Schwartz and will stand at least until Jan. 7, when another Federal district judge, David F. Levi, is scheduled to begin hearing the case.
The results of the California litigation will be closely watched in statehouses around the country, where vast changes in welfare policy are being debated.
 
Some National Implications
 If the law is struck down in the nation's most populous state, whose benefits are the fourth highest in the nation, it will "give great pause to other state policy makers," said Jodie Levin-Epstein, an analyst at the Center for Law and Social Policy in Washington and an author of a recent report on state efforts to restrict Aid to Families With Dependent Children.
In the last year at least 10 other states have considered similar laws to restrict the family aid program, which is operated by the states and the Federal Government. But only in California, Wisconsin and Illinois have the anti-migration measures passed and been signed into law. Like California, Wisconsin has received the necessary Federal waiver but has yet to put its program into effect; the Illinois waiver request is still pending.
Most welfare experts see the anti-migration laws as an expression of public frustration and anger over the nation's welfare system rather than as a meaningful way to hold down costs.
"This is a highly symbolic issue," said David T. Ellwood, a professor of public policy at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government. "But it is a trivial part of the budget, really. And the troubling feature is that it creates an us-against-them mentality."
According to the California Department of Social Services, which administers welfare programs here, the two-tiered benefit system would save $10 million a year -- less than one-fifth of 1 percent -- of a total state budget of $5.6 billion for the family aid program. State officials say that there are now 14,000 women and children on the welfare rolls who have arrived in the last year, and that 2,000 out-of-state migrants are arriving every month.
 
Political Maneuvering
 California's new welfare law passed the Democratic-controlled Legislature as the Governor, a Republican, tried to win passage of a ballot measure that would have made even more far-reaching changes in the family aid program.
To blunt the appeal of the Wilson measure and in deference to rising public concern about welfare, the legislators agreed in September to cut benefits for poor women and children by 5.8 percent. Under this plan, a family of three in California now receives $624 a month rather than $663.
As part of the same bill, the legislators approved the residency provision to help discourage out-of-state welfare recipients from moving here.
Only the residency provision is now being challenged. The plaintiffs argue that it violates the equal protection clause in the Constitution. In support of their argument they cite a 1969 Supreme Court ruling, Shapiro v. Thompson, which held that states cannot deny welfare benefits to newcomers from other states.
 
Mixed Reaction to Ruling
 The decision by Judge Schwartz to grant the temporary restraining order was hailed by Mark D. Rosenbaum of the American Civil Liberties Union of Southern California. Mr. Rosenbaum, a lawyer for the poor, said the law "puts a fence around our state."
Eloise Anderson, the director of the State Department of Social Services, said most of the argument had focused on the treatment of poor people from out of state. "What about the taxpayer?" she asked. "I don't mind helping my neighbor, but what have these people contributed in this state?"
Isabel V. Sawhill, an economist at the Urban Institute in Washington, said California's problem about newcomers on welfare would best be resolved by uniform national benefits.
She said she believed the inequities of the current state-by-state benefits would be part of the discussion when the Clinton Administration tries to enact new welfare legislation.
But Ms. Sawhill predicted that there would be fierce resistance to designing a true national welfare program. "There may be too many gainers and losers, too much disruption of the existing system," she said. "It may not be politically possible."

HEADLINE: Big-Ticket Orders Drop, But Spending Increases

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 23

 BODY:
A huge drop in aircraft sales pushed durable goods orders down 1.9 percent in November, but Americans increased their spending as their incomes continued to rise, the Government reported today.
The Commerce Department said that if the volatile aircraft component was excluded, orders for durable goods -- items like trucks and transformers that are expected to last more than three years -- would have risen. 
 Orders totaled a seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion, down from a revised $125.3 billion in October, the department said. The revision meant that orders in October jumped 4.6 percent, rather than the 3.9 percent advance in the department's initial estimate.
In a second report, the department said personal incomes rose two-tenths of a percent in November, to $5.15 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate from $5.14 trillion a month earlier.
But the report said the November increase was held down by a large decrease in farm subsidies and by several other special factors. Excluding the special factors, incomes rose eight-tenths of a percent, mostly because of an increase in wages and salaries.
The report also said consumer spending increased five-tenths of a percent in November, to an annual rate of $4.2 trillion, up from $4.17 trillion in October. Consumer spending accounts for two-thirds of economic activity and is the main force behind the economic recovery.
But the difference between spending and incomes meant that Americans' savings rate in November fell to 4.2 percent from 4.6 percent a month earlier. It was the lowest since the rate was 4 percent in October 1990.
In October, durable goods orders were helped by a 21.3 percent surge in transportation equipment. But in November, transportation orders tumbled 10.2 percent. The department said the drop in aircraft orders more than offset an increase in orders for motor vehicles. Excluding the transportation sector, overall orders for durable goods rose 1 percent.
Shipments of durable goods increased 1.9 percent, to a record $127.5 billion, and wiped out a decline of two-tenths of a percent a month earlier.
As a result, the backlog of unfilled orders fell 1 percent. It was the 14th decline in the backlog in 15 months and suggested that factories' work forces were having little trouble keeping up with new orders, an indication that hiring for factory jobs will not increase soon.
Excluding aircraft, orders for nonmilitary capital goods edged up three-tenths of a percent in November after declining 1.8 percent the previous month. These orders often are a gauge of manufacturing plans to expand and modernize.
Orders for industrial machinery and equipment rose 4.6 percent after a decrease of 2.7 percent in October. But electronic and other electrical equipment orders fell 3.5 percent, erasing a 2.3 percent gain in October.
Orders for military equipment dropped 6.8 percent after soaring 44.4 percent a month earlier. They had plunged 20 percent in September. Excluding military sales, orders fell 1.6 percent.
In the other report, the department revised the October income gain to 1.1 percent, from 1 percent. In November, disposable income -- income after taxes -- rose a tenth of a percent, after jumping 1.2 percent in October.

HEADLINE: Venture Capital: Looking for Stars

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
Richard Kramlich invests in fledgling companies that he says typically start out as "three guys and a dream." He is one of America's leading venture capitalists, and while the entrepreneurial dreams he backs are risky, the successful ones can be incubators of new technology and new jobs.
When Mr. Kramlich and his colleagues at New Enterprise Associates, a San Francisco-based partnership, put money in a company, it stays there for five years or more. They sit on the boards of the companies they invest in. They help with marketing plans and product designs -- they even interview job applicants. 
 "Our fate is totally tied up with these companies," Mr. Kramlich said. "We are partners with them."
 
 
Proposed Tax Breaks
 To Bill Clinton, this is capitalism working the way it is supposed to, aided by a very different breed of American financier than the Wall Street deal maker of the 80's. The President-elect is betting on people like Mr. Kramlich to help build what he calls a "21st-century economy" filled with high-tech industries and high-wage jobs -- and he is planning tax breaks to ease their way.
Mr. Clinton's proposed new enterprise tax cut would exclude from taxes half the capital gains on investments in new businesses held for more than five years. The idea is to stimulate the entrepreneurial side of the American economy by increasing the rewards for venture capitalists and individual investors in start-up companies, the "angels" Mr. Clinton has praised as "those with the patience, the courage and the determination to invest in new businesses that create new jobs."
"It could open up enormous amounts to seed capital for new businesses," William Wetzel, director of the Center for Venture Research at the University of New Hampshire, said. "And it would be the sort of patient capital that young companies need."
Skeptics question whether the new incentives alone will have the desired effect. The general health of the economy, industry trends, other taxes and regulatory costs are all considerations for prospective entrepreneurs, and could discourage them from starting up despite the tax cut, warns William Sahlman of the Harvard Business School.
 Yet the new enterprise tax cut seems likely to face little opposition. Mr. Clinton's friend, Senator Dale L. Bumpers of Arkansas, has sponsored similar legislation and it has wide support in Congress. It will no longer face a Presidential veto; President Bush favored tax breaks on all investment profits.
The Clinton tax cut, by contrast, is aimed at long-term investment in small business, which creates two- thirds of the new jobs in the American economy. And the Government revenue lost would be slight in the near term because the tax break would only apply to capital gains on investments held for five years or more.
Many economists question the wisdom of this fine-tuning of tax incentives, as did the Reagan Administration, which strove to simplify the system in the Tax Reform Act of 1986. But it has certainly won Mr. Clinton support among the groups that would most benefit -- venture capitalists and high-tech entrepreneurs. About 130 of them, including Mr. Kramlich, gathered at a fund-raising dinner in San Francisco last September that brought in $300,000 for Mr. Clinton.
Other Clinton tax proposals like increasing taxes on high-income individuals and a surtax on millionaires would hurt many of the entrepreneurs and investors. But the overall impact of the Clinton policies would be to take money out of their pockets and put it into their businesses -- a trade-off they welcome.
 
 
'On the Right Track'
 "Clinton is on the right track in putting investment incentives behind the growth sector of the economy," Mr. Kramlich said.
The venture-capital firms are the aristocrats of start-up financing, and big names in the field include Mr. Kramlich's New Enterprise Associates, Venrock Associates in New York, Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers in Palo Alto, Calif., Institutional Venture Partners in Menlo Park, Calif., and Sevin Rosen Bayless in Dallas.
Half of all new companies go under within two years. But the venture funds can improve the odds by being very picky. They are searching for the next crop of rising stars of corporate America, and they have backed success stories like Intel, Apple Computer, Microsoft, Genentech and Federal Express.
Once pools of funds from wealthy individuals -- Venrock, for example, is the venture arm of the Rockefeller family -- the venture-capital industry has grown sharply over the last two decades, thanks to the arrival of institutional money like pension funds. Today, there are more than 600 venture-capital firms with $32 billion invested in thousands of companies.
 
 
'Angel' Investing
 The second tier of start-up financing comes from so-called angels, an estimated 250,000 individual investors who put their personal savings into companies. Where the big venture-capital funds have offices across the country, angel investing tends to be a local or regional affair, a successful entrepreneur taking a gamble on a neighbor's new business or a friend's recommendation. And while a typical venture-capital investment might be $2 million or more, angel stakes are far smaller, from a few thousand dollars to half a million. Yet the total volume of angel investment is estimated at five times the amount of venture-capital funds.
Many investors have a foot in both camps. In 1978, when the start-up hat was being passed among a half-dozen individual investors for a new computer company in Silicon Valley, Mr. Kramlich dipped into his own pocket and put in $22,500. The company was Apple Computer, and six years later his stake was worth $5 million.
The pace of both venture-capital and angel investment fell after the 1986 tax reform took effect, eliminating the lower tax rate on capital gains compared with ordinary income. For example, venture-capital investment fell from roughly $4 billion in 1987 to under $1.4 billion last year, according to Venture Economics, a research group. This year, with the economy improving a bit, venture investments are picking up somewhat, running at a rate of $2 billion for 1992.
Economists debate how much effect tax breaks have on start-up financing, but venture-capital veterans have no doubt that the impact is significant. "The tax code is our industrial policy," said Jon Bayless of Sevin Rosen Bayless. "And you need incentives to encourage people to take the extra risk."
 
 
Pension Funds
 And Congressional tax experts are examining how to extend the proposed tax incentive for start-up investment to tax-exempt pension funds, which supply about half of all venture capital. One proposal is to apply the tax break to pension payouts that result from venture investments held more than five years. For example, if 5 percent of a pension fund's proceeds result from start-up investments, then the retirees would not have to pay income tax on 5 percent of their pension income.
The tax incentives are intended to accelerate the renewal of the American economy, as fast-growing new companies add jobs while big companies continue to cut back. For example, a survey of 428 venture-backed companies by Venture Economics and Coopers & Lybrand, the accounting firm, found that they created 92,500 jobs from 1985 to 1991; over the same period, the big Fortune 500 companies cut their payrolls by 2 million people. And the smaller companies' research and development spending was, proportionately, twice as much as that of the big companies.
Mr. Kramlich, who is 57, had his first brush with the entrepreneurial side of the American economy more than four decades ago, as an 11-year-old selling light bulbs from his basement in Green Bay, Wis. After he graduated from the Harvard Business School, he tried a brief stint in corporate America but he soon departed for the more exhilarating arena of start-ups.
New Enterprise Associates manages venture funds of nearly $700 million invested in 140 companies. Besides San Francisco, it has California offices in Los Angeles, Menlo Park and Palo Alto; it also has offices in Baltimore, New York, Dallas and Cleveland.
 
 
Innovative Products
 Mr. Kramlich is looking for people with innovative products in promising industries like Syed Iftikar, founder of Syquest Technology Inc. That company, based in Fremont, Calif., makes specialized computer disk drives and cartridges able to store vast amounts of data on a single three-inch disk. The Syquest products are used in fields like desktop publishing, where huge capacity is needed for storing computer-generated images. "Syquest has a unique product in a commodity field -- that's what attracted us," Mr. Kramlich said.
Founded in 1982, Syquest received $1 million the following year in venture capital from New Enterprise Associates and $3 million from other venture investors. Later, New Enterprise increased its investment to nearly $6 million.
Over the years, Mr. Iftikar said, Mr. Kramlich has done everything for Syquest from getting in touch with potential customers to interviewing prospective employees.
The attention has paid off. In the year ended Sept. 30, Syquest's profits more than doubled to $13.4 million while its sales rose 52 percent, to $175 million. Today, the company employs 1,061 people, up from 370 a year ago. Mr. Iftikar expects the work force to reach 2,000 a year from now.
 
 
Winning Investment
 New Enterprise Associates made its first investment in the Pyxis Corporation in 1988, when the start-up company's assets amounted to little more than Ron Taylor, the founder, and an assistant working out of a tiny office in San Diego. Over the next three years, New Enterprise invested a total of $2.6 million; the total investment of angel and venture funds in Pyxis is $25 million.
Pyxis -- which makes computerized machines that dispense drugs and surgical equipment for hospitals, and automates inventory management, billing and reordering -- sold its shares to the public in an initial offering earlier this year. New Enterprise's $2.6 million investment is worth about $50 million. By bringing in venture investors, Mr. Taylor, the 45-year-old founder, now owns only 5 percent of his company.
"But without them, I'd have 100 percent of nothing," he said. "My 5 percent is worth $30 million. So I'm going to complain?"

HEADLINE: CONSUMER RATES;
Yields Are Higher for Money Market Funds

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Yields offered by tax-exempt and taxable money market funds were higher in the latest week, pushed up by seasonal factors.
Analysts at IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report, which surveys fund rates, said one reason for the upward pressure on rates at this time of year is that some investors sell holdings for cash. 
 Walter S. Frank, chief economist at IBC/Donoghue's, said another factor was the drop in demand for short-term paper, which forced yields higher to attract buyers.
 In the latest reporting week, which ended on Tuesday, tax-exempt yields rose modestly while assets of tax-exempt funds fell by $743 million, to a total of $99.9 billion.
The average number of days left to maturity of securities held in tax-free-fund portfolios remained unchanged, at 61.
The average seven-day compounded yield for tax-exempt funds rose 24 basis points, to 2.36 percent, while the average seven-day simple yield rose by the same amount, to 2.33 percent. Donoghue's statisticians calculated that over a 30-day period, the compounded yield has averaged 2.20 percent and the simple yield 2.18 percent.
Not assuming state taxes, the taxable bond equivalent of the seven-day compounded yield in the week for someone in the 28 percent tax bracket is about 3.28 percent, and about 3.42 percent for those in a 31 percent bracket.
 
 
Dreyfus Fund Tops Survey
 From its survey of tax-exempt funds with assets of more than $100 million, IBC/Donoghue's said the Dreyfus Basic Municipal Money Market fund outperformed the others, with a 3.09 percent yield.
Assets of taxable money market funds declined by $800 million in the week that ended yesterday, to a total of $477.3 billion. Assets of institutional funds were up by $1.4 billion and retail funds declined $2.2 billion.
Donoghue's analysts said the average days left to maturity of securities in taxable money market portfolios remained unchanged at 59 days as portfolio managers shortened maturities to take advantage of high year-end yields.
The Olde Premium Plus Money Market Series, distributed by Olde Asset Management Inc. of Detroit was the top-yielding general-purpose fund among those with assets of more than $100 million. The fund was yielding 3.78 percent for the week.
In government-only money market funds, United Services Government Securities Savings fund, distributed by United Services of San Antonio, was the leader at 3.81 percent.
As a comparative measurement, bank money market accounts, which compete directly with funds, remained unchanged despite seasonal pressures. They are still at 2.76 percent.

Vehicle Sales 16% Higher In Midmonth

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Sales of cars and light trucks built in North America surged by more than 16 percent for the 10 days in mid-December compared with last year's period, auto makers reported yesterday. But analysts cautioned against reading too much into the year-over-year comparison, because sales last December were so sluggish.
Nevertheless, the improvement in sales, which was much more pronounced for light trucks than for cars, continues an upward trend that began more than a year ago. 
 "Sales are in the 15th month of a moderate recovery," said Ronald A. Glantz, an automotive analyst at Dean Witter. "Since the first 10-day selling period in October 1991, sales have grown at a 17 percent compound annual rate. I'll take that."
The improving auto sales figures came on a day when the Commerce Department reported that new orders for durable goods had fallen 1.9 percent in November, mostly from a decline in aircraft sales.
 
Ford-Honda Competition Intense
 Mr. Glantz and other analysts said they expected sales to get a big boost during the last 10 days of the month, due in large part to intense competition between the Ford Motor Company and Honda Motor Company for boasting rights to the top-selling car in America.
Ford is reportedly offering discounts of as much as $2,600 on its Taurus models, which currently run a close second to Honda's Accord.
Honda has extended a promotion that allows customers to lease Accords for as little as $199 a month for five years.
Ford, which typically releases a model-by-model sales breakout every 10 days, did not do so yesterday. But its car sales were up nearly 40 percent from the comparable period last year.
Honda's domestic car sales dipped by a slight three-tenths of 1 percent.
The fight between Ford and Honda "is adding to the sales picture at the end of the year, and there certainly will be some payback in January," said Harvey Heinbach, an analyst at Merrill Lynch & Company. "But we still think this is an improving trend."
Car sales during the period totaled 6.2 million at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, compared with 5.3 million during the period a year earlier. But the sales rate dipped a little from the 6.48 million recorded during the first 10 days of December.
Cars considered to be domestically built include those assembled in Canada and Mexico, as well as those built in North American plants by Japanese companies.
 
Sales of Light Trucks Are Strong
 Big Three manufacturers reported strong sales of light trucks during the period. During the middle 10 days of December, light trucks, which include pickups, mini-vans and sport utility vehicles, sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 5.3 million.
Gains were particularly robust at Chrysler, where light-truck sales increased by more than 40 percent from a year ago, according to estimates from Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication. General Motors and Ford both saw truck sales rise more than 16 percent.
But General Motors was less successful in selling its cars, as sales dipped 2.6 percent, to 49,222 units. Continuing a trend that began last month, during the middle 10 days of December, combined sales of Ford and Chrysler cars exceeded General Motors' total.
"General Motors is losing market share to Ford and Chrysler," Mr. Heinbach said. "That trend is apparent in the truck market as well, and we think that will continue to be the case as G.M. consolidates and concentrates on profitability."
Car sales at the Chrysler Corporation were 14,400 units, up 21.7 percent from a year ago, according to estimates by Ward's Automotive Reports, an industry publication. Chrysler does not report 10-day sales figures.
The 10-day period was mixed for for transplanted foreign auto makers.
At Toyota USA, sales of domestically built cars fell nearly 14 pecent, to 5,828 units. But sales at Nissan USA were up nearly 50 percent, and Mazda USA reported a gain of 45 percent.

HEADLINE: Donations to Neediest Cases Running Behind Last Year's

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund passed the $2 million mark yesterday, but it is still falling significantly behind last year's record campaign, which raised more than $5 million. Despite numerous donations from people like Emanuel A. Sprung of Manhattan, who sent $10 for his 47th contribution in a row, the fund has taken in about $200,000 less than it had by this date in 1991.
Arthur Gelb, president of The New York Times Company Foundation, which administers the fund, said he was hopeful that a surge of post-holiday donations would make up the shortfall before the campaign ends on Feb. 28. But officials at the seven charities assisted by the fund fear that if contributions do not pick up, they may have to curtail or even eliminate programs that are helping thousands of people who lack food, clothing, shelter and health care. 
 The officials said their own fund-raising campaigns, which they run independently of the Neediest Cases, were also facing difficulties. They added, though, that it was too early to predict how their appeals would end because the last two weeks of the year often bring a burst of donations.
One of the seven charities, the United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, has received several million dollars less than last year, said Stephen Solender, its executive vice president. Mr. Solender attributed the decline to two factors: a sharp drop in donations from executives in the depressed real-estate industry and a decrease in donations from middle-class people affected by the recession.
 
'People Are More Insecure'
 "It is more difficult for the middle class to maintain their quality of life, so they are more conservative in their charitable giving," he said. "People are more insecure about the future."
Philip Coltoff, executive director of the Children's Aid Society, another Neediest Cases charity, said that many people had expected the economy to pick up this year and were discouraged when there were few signs of growth, particularly in the New York region.
"There is the sense that maybe this economy is not going to turn around," he said. "And when people read about how many layoffs I.B.M. is planning, that sends shock waves. It's very frightening and people become a little more nervous."
Donations to the Children's Aid Society's general fund are down about 6 percent, Mr. Coltoff said. The Brooklyn Bureau of Community Service took in about 20 percent less at a recent fund-raising dinner than it did last year, said Donna Santarsiero, its executive director.
"We're worried in terms of the coming months," Ms. Santarsiero said. "I think as our government revenues continue to fall behind, there is going to be a need for all social services agencies to put more and more pressure on all the existing sources of private support. We're all tapping from what is not an infinite pot of resources."
But Ms. Santarsiero she said she believed that donations would rebound. "In tough times," she said, "people feel that if they can give at all, they will."

HEADLINE: New York High Court Upholds Tax on Other States' Residents

BYLINE: By DENNIS HEVESI

 BODY:
New York State can continue to tax out-of-state commuters at a rate based on their total family income, rather than just on what they earn in New York, the state's highest court has ruled.
A New Jersey couple, Lawrence and Barbara Brady of Aberdeen, had filed suit, contending that it was unconsitutional for New York to tax them at a rate based on the family's joint income because Mrs. Brady works in New Jersey. 
 But in a 4-to-1 ruling written by Judge Judith S. Kaye, the Court of Appeals said: "Plaintiffs' real quarrel, in the end, is with the graduated tax. A system of progressive taxation apportions the tax burden based on ability to pay -- higher income taxpayers can pay more and are, therefore, taxed at a higher rate than lower income taxpayers. This system does not implicate the State or Federal Constitutions so long as the rates are applied, as here, in a non-discriminatory manner and only to taxable New York income."
The Bradys' lawyer, David Weinstein, said he was considering an appeal to the United States Supreme Court.
"The claim that we think the Court of Appeals did not properly address," he said, "is that New York taxes one individual's income based on a rate fixed by that person's total income and that person's spouse's income, even though New York courts have held that it's unconstitutional to compel a nonresident spouse to file a joint return." But New York's Commissioner of Taxation and Finance, James W. Wetzler, said: "In a progressive tax system, it appears fairer to us to look at the taxpayer's overall economic condition. Otherwise, a millionaire can end up being treated the same as a middle-income taxpayer."
Mr. Wetzler added that when New York adopted the system in 1987, "There were vehement objections from both New Jersey and Connecticut, threats of retaliation."
Pointing out that Connecticut included the same system when it adopted its income tax last year, and that the New Jersey Assembly passed a bill last week mandating use of the system, Commissioner Wetzler said, "I think it's ironic that vehement protest has turned to imitation."

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Manages Advance, With Trading Desks Quiet

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar advanced in a dull session yesterday, with the trading desks quiet because of Christmas holiday vacations and the financial markets closed in Japan for the Emperor's birthday.
Gold rose slightly. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery was up 70 cents an ounce to close at $332.90. At the Republic National Bank of New York, gold was quoted at $332.85, up 55 cents. 
 The latest Commerce Department reports on durable goods orders and personal income trends in November ignited little excitement on currency trading desks, said Hugh Walsh, assistant vice president at Algemene Bank Nederland in New York.
Corporate economists said the reports that durable goods orders fell 1.9 percent in November while personal incomes rose two-tenths of 1 percent were within expectations.
But the dollar was buoyed by anticipation that Germany might cut interest rates in the coming months. On Tuesday, the president of the Bundesbank said Germany's long-term bond rates could fall a full percentage point in the current environment of declining rates worldwide.
Some currency traders say a cut in German rates will only encourage further buying of the dollar, which they view favorably in light of the improving United States economy.
In Europe, the dollar closed at 1.5945 German marks, up from 1.5875 late Tuesday. Later in New York, the dollar closed at 1.5950 marks, up from 1.5895 marks late Tuesday.
Otherwise, traders described very thin dealings.
In London, the dollar was quoted at 123.85 yen, up from 123.13 at Tuesday's close in Tokyo. At the closing in New York, the dollar was quoted at 123.85 yen, up from 123.75 yen late Tuesday.
The British pound fell to $1.5260, from $1.5365 late Tuesday. In New York, the pound closed at $1.5265, less expensive than $1.5370 late Tuesday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Tuesday's rates, included: 1.4440 Swiss francs, up from 1.4415; 5.4415 French francs, up from 5.4205; 1,423.00 Italian lire, up from 1,422.00, and 1.26025 Canadian dollars, down from 1.26195.
Late dollar rates in Europe, compared with late Tuesday, included: 1.4415 Swiss francs, up from 1.4350; 5.4405 French francs, up from 5.4175; 1.7935 Dutch guilders, up from 1.7858; 1,428.00 Italian lire, up from 1,421.00,and 1.2600 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2605.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Doing Well By Doing Good

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
MESSAGE to Bill Clinton: Looking for an easy $40 billion to $50 billion a year to pay for expanded health insurance coverage, or perhaps all those ambitious plans to increase productivity? Look again at tobacco taxes.
That is what a coalition of antismoking groups led by the American Medical Association is likely to advise the President-elect when it meets next month in Washington. And while the economic case for a radical increase in tobacco levies -- say, to the Canadian level of more than $3 a pack -- is a bit problematic, the politics and, arguably, the morality are alluring. "It's a case of doing well by doing good," concludes Kenneth Warner, an economist at the University of Michigan's School of Public Health. 
 Why a monster tobacco tax? Start with the money. The Advocacy Institute, a nonprofit lobbying group in Washington, estimates that adding $2 a pack on top of the 46-cent average tax collected in 1991 would bring in $35 billion a year. And while the tobacco industry is obviously prepared to fight, the success of big tax initiatives in California and Massachusetts in recent years suggest its power is on the wane.
Then, too, there is the fact that tobacco is taxed relatively lightly. The average price at the checkout counter has tripled since 1979, topping $1.80 a pack. But Jeffrey Harris, an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a practicing physician, notes that only about 25 cents of the increase went to state and Federal coffers. The rest was pocketed by manufacturers and wholesalers, as competition within the highly concentrated tobacco industry apparently failed to check a stampede for higher profits.
Were revenue the only consideration, it would be just as effective to tax bread. What makes tobacco different, of course, is that it is a health hazard. And in both the California and Massachusetts tax initiatives, much was made of the financial burden smokers place on others.
This "externalities" argument is not cut and dried. Smokers do get sicker earlier than non-smokers: Tom Hodgson, the chief economist at the National Center for Health Statistics, estimates that smoking will add $500 billion to the current generation's health insurance bill.
But smokers also die younger, and thus effectively subsidize the pensions of nonsmokers. Willard Manning, an economist at the University of Minnesota's School of Public Health, calculates that on balance smoking costs nonsmokers about 15 cents a pack -- less than the current average tax.
Mr. Warner believes the Manning estimate greatly underestimates this external cost because it uses too low a figure for death and illness caused by secondary inhalation.
In any event, many economists who follow the smoking debate think the externalities question is a diversion from the more fundamental moral issue of deterring addictive, self-destructive behavior.
Cigarette taxes are apparently a very effective way to induce people to quit smoking, or never to become addicted in the first place. In Canada, the near-tripling of prices over the last decade (to a whopping $5.75 a pack) helped to reduce the number of cigarettes smoked by about 40 percent. And the recent experience in California, which raised the tax by 25 cents in 1989, has also had an impact. Theodore Keeler, an economist at the University of California at Berkeley, estimated that the resulting 23 percent price increase would ultimately reduce consumption by 10 to 12 percent.
Not surprisingly, low-income individuals in general and teen-agers in particular are most easily deterred by high prices. A variety of studies suggest that a 10 percent increase in price reduces teen-age smoking by about 10 percent.
That is good news if the objective is to prevent children from getting hooked. But the tobacco industry has made much of the inequity of further taxing relatively poor adult smokers.
The poor and near-poor do indeed spend a disproportionate share of their incomes on cigarettes. Dr. Harris does not, however, think it follows that low-income Americans would be hurt by higher taxes. If the smoking tax is regressive, he points out, the financial benefits of inducing people to quit must be progressive. And the fate spared those induced to quit is especially dire. "Being sick is bad," argues Dr. Harris; "being sick and poor is much worse."
A Federal cigarette tax increase beyond the token 4 cents a pack scheduled for next month would not be simple to push through Congress. But, then, neither would any other revenue measure. Moreover, a big cigarette levy might be made palatable by earmarking the revenue. The money might, for example, be used to subsidize health insurance for those not quite poor enough to qualify for Medicaid.
The economic link between smoking costs and health insurance may be fuzzy. But with the Treasury empty and Mr. Clinton scrambling to fill it, a little fuzz might be just what the doctor ordered.

HEADLINE: South of Marrakesh, A New/Old Casbah

BYLINE: By FLORENCE FABRICANT

DATELINE: TAMADOT, Morocco

 BODY:
AN invitation to Luciano Tempo's casbah is not a line out of an old grade B movie. But a visit to Kasbah Tamadot, a splendid villa in the mountains south of Marrakesh, is an opportunity to experience the richness of Moroccan style and hospitality.
Casbahs are to Morocco what castles were to medieval Europe: fortified dwellings for nobility, with high, crenelated walls, towers and interior courtyards. Ruined casbahs, some deserted and some inhabited by squatters, dot the landscape, especially here in southern Morocco. 
 But unlike medieval castles, casbahs are still being built. New ones, or clusters of casbah-like dwellings often made of adobe, the sun-dried clay suited to a hot dry climate, are constructed alongside old, crumbling ones that have not withstood time and the elements.
Mr. Tempo's casbah is an exceptional example, a highly individualistic indulgence in comfort and luxury. Every room and surface is a feast for the eyes. While the ensemble pays homage to traditional Moroccan style, the details are pure Luciano Tempo.
The tall, aristocratic-looking Mr. Tempo, 56, is a native of Venice who has been a designer and antiques dealer in Carmel, Calif., for 30 years. His personal style is restlessly eclectic, ready to juxtapose antiques and artifacts in dizzying profusion, but always with a sense of proportion rather than of mere clutter.
In his casbah, the dining-room ceiling is bordered with 17th-century Burmese prayer books. Silver Berber wedding-belt buckles adorned with the auspicious hand of Fatima are used as napkin rings. A pair of enormous bronze Thai fish stand guard at the edge of a reflecting pool in the central courtyard, a playful response to the golden carp swimming in it.
About four years ago, Mr. Tempo decided to live in Morocco, a country he had once visited briefly. "I had just lost the companion of my life," he said, "and I needed a radical change." He tried Bali but could not tolerate the tropical heat and humidity and the insects. Morocco was next on his list.
In Tamadot he has no telephone and no fax. He has a manager to run Luciano's Antiques, his business in California.
While he was in Marrakesh, he drove out to Asni, a town about an hour south, in a river valley at the edge of the high Atlas Mountains, an area popular with tourists. In Tamadot, a village nearby, a house that was beautifully set on a promontory caught his eye.
"I saw this typical flat-roofed adobe house, surrounded by olive trees and red earth, that had been built at the turn of the century and was now abandoned, in ruins," he said. "I have a deep affection for things that are crumbling. Within two hours I bought it." He said he paid considerably less than the nearly $200,000 it eventually cost him to bring in electricity and to dig three wells.
"I hired an architect from Marrakesh, who took one look and advised me to tear it down and start from scratch," Mr. Tempo said. "I paid him for the day and proceeded to do the work myself, actually designing the house as I went along."
He calls the original structure the "soul of this house," and used as much of it as possible, shoring it up with concrete pilings and solid posts two feet square. Instead of adobe, the weatherproof exterior is cement, colored the same reddish shade as adobe and carved, while still wet, with fanciful interpretations of typical geometric Berber motifs.
The multilevel house has several living rooms, a vast dining room, two kitchens, the central courtyard with the reflecting pool, another courtyard with a fountain, a tower for storage and another fitted with exercise equipment, and many terraces. The house has a number of small domes decorated with spires with metal prayer balls of the kind seen on minarets.
Mr. Tempo lives alone, but he built 12 bedrooms. "I made it this large because I have a lot of friends who can't afford to stay in fancy hotels," he said. "I bring them here, and they enrich my life."
His hospitality is thoroughly Moroccan in its lavishness. Morocco is a country where there's always enough couscous on the platter to share with unexpected guests and where the typical living room or dining room, lined with couches, can easily become impromptu guest quarters. But in Mr. Tempo's casbah, guests are likely to be served excellent ravioli mastered by his Moroccan cook and to spend the night in an exotically decorated bedroom. Dennis Hopper, the actor, was a recent guest.
One bedroom ceiling is adorned with hundreds of small round, oval and rectangular Berber metal-and-enamel boxes, the kind that are routinely sold in the souks for about $2 each to those who can bargain well. "I could not find an old painted ceiling suitable to install in this room, so I decided to use the boxes," Mr. Tempo said. "I bought 1,500 of them."
The beds are covered with quilts that Mr. Tempo had made in India from strips of discarded saris. The wall behind one bed is punctuated with richly sculptured Moorish-style niches. The niches accommodate not one but a collection of rich green jugs, some antique, some modern, from Tamgrout, in southern Morocco.
And everywhere, there are bronze wall sconces and holders for fat beeswax candles. "Even though there is electricity, at night I prefer candlelight," Mr. Tempo said. The electricity is used to operate the VCR that plays movies for entertainment and to run the pair of General Electric refrigerators in the kitchen.
The decorative bronzes are typical of the designs by Mr. Tempo that mix styles and materials. They are sold in Luciano's Antiques; in Marco Polo, an antiques shop in Marrakesh that he helped establish, and through designers. They are made for him in a foundry in Thailand.
The casbah took a mere seven months to build, an accomplishment that required 120 workers. The project included doing several rooms more than once, and redoing some decorations that did not work out as planned. "When they laid the tile around the pool, they set it in plaster, not cement, and the first time it rained the tiles came off the walls and the ceilings below collapsed," he said. "I wound up employing so many people that the economy of the little village of Tamadot boomed. In fact, there were an unprecedented number of weddings that summer because so many people had steady jobs. Now there are a lot of babies named Luciano."
To a certain extent, Mr. Tempo has adopted the village, helping to repair the school and building a house to attract a nurse to the village. "I send one of my people, and he does the job," he said. "That way, if I spend a dollar, I get a dollar's worth."
His staff of 15 runs the house and tends the gardens on his two acres of land, the maximum a foreigner is allowed to own in Morocco. But the view, from 4,500 feet, is stunning and vast, uninterrupted by window coverings. "I used mirrored glass so no one could look in," he said.
Because winter in the mountains can be harsh and summer stifling, Mr. Tempo now spends about half the year at Kasbah Tamadot, three months in the spring and three months in the fall. "I did everything I wanted in this house," he said.

HEADLINE: Washington Awaits Era of a Hotter Date

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
DEBBIE COHEN realized on election night that young Democrats would soon flood into Washington, and it pleased her. Not only would the economy improve, she reasoned, but she might also finally get a good date.
"People my generation can relate to are coming to town," said the 24-year-old staff assistant to Senator John Glenn (D-Ohio). "I mean, these are the people who played Fleetwood Mac at their convention." 
 Democrats will now control the White House, Congress and singles bars, and even conservatives begrudgingly admit that this development may pump life into what most consider one of the toughest dating scenes in the nation.
"My dating life under Bush has been pretty lousy," said David Bohley, 24, a law fellow for the Senate Commerce Committee, over lunch in the Dirksen Senate Office Building on Capitol Hill. "I can only hope that this change will be for the better."
Sure, there will still be plenty of lawyers who talk tort over dessert. But there will also be tree huggers, idealists and perhaps a cajun cook or two. Not unlike the first day of high school, January will bring new and younger faces, and with them, phone numbers.
"It is very difficult for people to date in D.C.," said Laurie Handlers, the manager of Georgetown Connection, a dating service here. "People are very busy, and it is hard to maintain relationships. It is kind of like you're on a plane and you're trying to have a relationship, and by the time you've landed, that person is engaged to someone else."
Women have the toughest time. Their complaints about the slim pickings among Washington men are second only to everyone's laments about the dearth of good pizza.
And complain they do. About the lawyers. (A Washington joke: 1 in 20 of the residents is a lawyer. One in 5 is dating one). About the "polichat" (one part small talk, one part public-policy debate). About the stuffiness and self-importance of Washington men and the monogamous relationship many have with their careers.
This situation, of course, will not not be so easy to change as the curtains in the White House salon. It is more a question of atmosphere, many say. "Bill and Al are sexy," said Lisa DePaulo, 31, who until recently was a senior editor at Washingtonian magazine, where she monitored the dating scene. "Washington men need role models. You look at the campaign staff and you hope the whole Administration will be like that. Those sunglasses, the convertibles, the Elvis thing! How can you compare that to horseshoes and fishing?"
Ms. Handlers, the matchmaker, said that the recession put a heavy damper on dating. People are less likely to invest funds in risky dates, she said. And the tired and frustrated are likely to stay home and watch "Fried Green Tomatoes" on their VCR's, which keeps them forever out of the loop.
"There is a real seriousness here about dating, and the economy influences how much they are willing to spend," Ms. Handlers said. "Now, maybe people will be less fearful about their incomes. I have also noticed a general lightening up since the election, which may help."
Even Republicans can't argue against a fiscally sound fling. "This Administration will bring the cheap date back into fashion," said Sarah Brown, a receptionist and self-proclaimed Republican. "I think barbecue. I think Arkansas. I think of people being more laid back."
Other Republicans agree, at least on the menu change. "Things will probably be less formal now," said Rebecca Escobales, 21, a staff assistant to Representative Michael Bilirakis, Republican of Florida. "People will be doing Southern restaurants instead of, say, nouveau Italian."
Ms. Escobales, who will continue to vote to the right, said that nonetheless she found this political polarity to be "sparky."
In some ways dating may now reflect the best of the campaign's debates. "People on dates will be talking about the issues now," said Charlie Peters, editor of the Washington Monthly and a Washington resident for 31 years. "They will be talking about health-care reform, things like that. People will be looking to find intellectual common ground."
Dan (Gunga) Langley, a bartender at LuLu's, one of the most popular singles bars here, has a slightly more visceral take. "There's fresh flesh in town," he said. Mr. Langley notes that the dating scene in Washington is different from that in other towns, mostly because people tend to frequent the bars with friends of the same sex, and leave with them.
If nothing else, people may begin dressing down for cocktail hour, and there is something inherently sexy about that. "When you see Bill Clinton the morning after he wins with his jeans on, it's like the 'Big Chill,' " Ms. DePaulo said. "It changes the spirit in Washington, makes it more relaxed. Jimmy Carter was relaxed, but he was like your favorite uncle. Bill Clinton is more like your hot cousin."
Not everyone in Washington is quick to agree that Democrats make the best dates. "People have the stereotype that Republicans are stuffy and that Democrats are swinging," said John Dutton, a 26-year-old legislative aid to Representative Rod Chandler, Republican of Washington. "There may be some truth to it, but I'm not really sure."
When Mr. Dutton was told that another young Republican in town thought the era of the budget date had come again, any trepidations about liberals at the helm seemed to fade.
"Really!" he said. "What's her name?"

HEADLINE: ON BASEBALL;
Leyland Is Not Bitter Over Drain of Talent

BYLINE: By Claire Smith

 BODY:
When you get right down to it, Jim Leyland didn't really ask for a lot. All the Pittsburgh Pirates' manager really wanted for Christmas was his two front-line players.
But a wickedly competitive baseball economy left little more than lumps of coal where Barry Bonds and Doug Drabek used to be. And as everyone knows, in Pittsburgh and points east in Pennsylvania the bottom fell out of the coal and steel markets there a long time ago. 
 To Leyland's credit, though, the manager isn't sitting around moping or wishing a pox on the houses of the San Francisco Giants and the Houston Astros. Times changed, as did the financial backing of those two teams, and so Leyland watched the talent pool of the Pirates, a team that either cannot or will not spend gargantuan sums for ballplayers, be drained substantially.
"It's a touchy subject for me, but I do want to say I'm happy for the players," said Leyland from his Pittsburgh home as he wished one more bit of fortune for the likes of Bonds, who signed a $43.75 million, six-year contract with the Giants. "I wish him well. And I'm happy for the managers who get those kinds of players."
As Leyland speaks, both magnanimity and reality mix and shape the opinions of the manager left behind. High finance, baseball style, Leyland insists, is not his business. Nor is it good practice to mourn the talent lost. After all, Bonds and Drabek aren't the first players he has seen come and go in his 18-year managerial tenure at both the minor league and major league levels.
But Leyland is not going to pretend that he is all that unaffected. Three weeks after witnessing Houston sign Drabek to a $19.5 million, four-year contract and then watching Dusty Baker & Co. inherit the services of Bonds, Leyland does wonder aloud more than ever about the business of baseball.
"It's a little frustrating and I might say even more confusing," Leyland said. "That's because there's a lot of talk in baseball, but the talk and the action haven't gone hand in hand. That's what confuses me."
The talk, of course, is of pleas of poverty and impending doom. It's basic-agreement-renegotiating time for management and the players union. And it does seem that baseball officials are more than ever talking out of both sides of their mouths, spending capriciously on the one hand but talking about needing a new way of doing business with the players so that somehow, someone will save them from themselves.
As ball clubs committed to over $225 million in salaries in a three-day period during baseball's recent winter meetings, one had to wonder facetiously just which clubs are going broke, again? On the other hand, one has to recognize the downsizing and salary dumping going on in places like San Diego and Pittsburgh and Milwaukee. Free agents are being let go by those teams for financial reasons, underlining all the more the "boy who cried wolf" claim that these teams cannot compete.
The Pirates must have some ability to spend; witness the continuing presence of veteran center fielder Andy Van Slyke. But, as Leyland said, no one was surprised to see Bonds settle into the low $40 million range on his multiyear contract.
"And I knew we would not be able to do that," Leyland said. Just as they were not able to keep Bobby Bonilla last winter, nor Sid Bream the winter before. All told, Pittsburgh's major losses these last three winters -- Bonilla, Bonds, Drabek, Jose Lind, Sid Bream, John Smiley, R. J. Reynolds -- were players who carried off contracts or later signed deals worth approximately $100 million.
Even with the slow drain of veterans taking the star power out of Pittsburgh, the Pirates could proudly say they were able to more than manage. The three consecutive National League Eastern Division championships and Leyland's capturing of managing honors this season attest to the extent of the successes. The overriding question for Pittsburgh faithful, for Leyland, for the rest of the division, is whether there is one more special season of magic and enough talent to survive and surprise again?
"We're not down to the bare cupboard," Leyland said. "I'm eager for spring training because I think that we do have some outstanding young kids coming, if their play last September was any indication."
"But," Leyland added, again with admirable realism, "I don't think that anybody in their right mind would pick us to win. We're a long way from where we were last year."
So Leyland will spend the rest of the off season thinking about retooling more than he did after the losses of Smiley and Bonilla and Bream. He knows this time will be different. Leyland, as talented a manager as there is in the game, vows to cope.
"Sure, you miss the players, but you know you have to go on," said Leyland. "Besides, I know they're better off financially. They're O.K. You don't have to feel bad for them. You feel bad for the minor leaguers you have to tell that their careers are over or the major leaguers you have to release. Guys like Doug and Barry, though, they're all right. I mean, they could probably buy a hamburger or two if they had to, right?"
A string of hamburger chains, no doubt. Unfortunately for Pittsburgh, they'll just be doing the buying elsewhere.

HEADLINE: Where to Learn White House Organization

 BODY:
To the Editor:
President-elect Bill Clinton has let it be known that he intends to avoid Jimmy Carter's error of overloading the Washington policy agenda and to emulate Ronald Reagan in pressing for a few initial major accomplishments. But the early signs of how he intends to organize his associates for such purposes suggest he may be in danger of reliving the failures of previous Presidents. His offhand promise to cut the White House staff by 25 percent suggests he has given more attention to the symbolism of White House operations than to the record. 
 The modern American Presidency is profoundly affected by the personality of its incumbent. A White House organization that works for one President might not work for another. A John Kennedy or Bill Clinton would not sit still for an Eisenhower staff system. A Richard Nixon would experience meltdown in the freewheeling contexts in which a Kennedy or Clinton might thrive. Still, White House structure makes a difference.
The underappreciated Gerald R. Ford took office in a glow of approval. Jettisoning the hierarchical Nixon staff system of Watergate infamy, he looked back to Harry S. Truman and attempted to be his own chief of staff. Promptly and without adequate staffing, he pardoned his predecessor, and his support plummeted. Absorbing the lesson, he installed a chief of staff and otherwise perfected an advisory system that contributed to his near victory in the 1976 election.
Kennedy, like Bill Clinton, entered office exhilarated by electoral experience and without national executive experience. Replacing a chief executive two decades his senior, and promising change, he took it for granted that there was little to be gleaned from the governing experience of his predecessors. Before his first 100 days were over, he made a catastrophic decision, authorizing the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba.
The Bay of Pigs fiasco, as Theodore Sorenson later recollected, left Kennedy "aghast at his own stupidity" and "angry at having been so badly advised." One of Kennedy's first postinauguration actions had been to abolish the National Security Council machinery that Dwight Eisenhower installed to assure the President of the collective wisdom of the experts in his executive agencies. By the end of Kennedy's Presidency, he and his aides had begun to create the kinds of operating procedures that might have served him well from the start.
Valuable lessons in organizing the executive office are to be found even in improbable modern presidencies.
Take Mr. Clinton's proposed Economic National Security Council. Such a body existed, and performed well, in the executive office of President Ford. The able administrator of the Ford Economic Policy Board, Roger B. Porter, is assistant to the President for economic and domestic policy in the Bush White House, where his efforts appear not to have had much effect.
President Bush's domestically passive Presidency proves it is not enough for a President to employ first-rate staff aides. Squabbles over economic policy of the sort that the Ford Economic Policy Board was designed to bring to a head so that they could be resolved in the Oval Office plagued the Bush White House and contributed to President Bush's incoherent re-election campaign.
There are no inexorable laws of White House organization, but there is a body of lore, which, if intelligently used, can help prevent Bill Clinton from making all of his mistakes right away.

HEADLINE: Companies Reducing Benefits Promised for Their Retirees

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
At least 23 large companies have abandoned the health benefits that they were providing to thousands of retired employees. Dozens more have announced that they will not provide coverage for future retirees, and most employers who still offer the benefits are reducing their share of the costs, which have been climbing steeply.
 The companies are rushing to shrink these obligations before Jan. 1, when a new accounting rule goes into effect. The rule forces employers to subtract from their profits the future costs of providing benefits to retirees. 
In the latest such action, the Primerica Corporation, a financial services concern previously known as the American Can Company, set yesterday as the deadline for 7,800 retirees to agree either to pay the full cost of continuing coverage or go without it. The retirees learned of the deadline only three weeks earlier.

 
A Jolt to Retirees
 Groups of retirees from some of those companies, including Primerica, McDonnell Douglas, the aerospace concern, and Unisys, the computer maker, have initiated class-action lawsuits contending that the changes violate the terms of the companies' retirement agreements. A ruling in the Primerica case could come by late January.
 Some retirees were shaken by the turn of events. "They told us, 'Either you take it by Dec. 23 or you drop out and cannot be reinstated,' " said Marie Esposito, a 68-year-old retired American Can executive secretary in Brooklyn. "Was it a scare tactic? If it is, they're doing a good job on me. I'm single. I live alone. I have no one I can turn to."
 Ms. Esposito, who worked at American Can for 19 years, until her department was shut down, said medicine to treat her blood pressure and stomach ulcers costs $177.67 a month, of which she currently pays $17.77. Continuing this coverage would now cost $144 a month, swallowing most of her $240-a-month pension. "I can't swing the $144 for medical coverage, which I desperately need," Ms. Esposito said.

 
Valuing Future Health Costs
 Under the new accounting rule, Financial Accounting Standard 106, employers must put a value on future retiree health costs and combine them with current medical costs as an expense. Previously, companies were required to recognize only the cost of benefits they had actually paid.
 Although the cash expenditure does not increase, the resulting annual expense must be subtracted from income in a company's financial reports. This expense can rise sharply under the new rule, often quadrupling the reported health-care costs for industrial companies that have many older employees or whose retirees were promised generous benefits. The new rule thus has the effect of reducing a company's annual income, a figure that is closely watched by securities analysts and investors. The new accounting rule was intended to make a company's health care liabilities clear to investors. It allows companies to take a single charge against earnings before the first quarter of 1993, or to spread the charges over 20 years.
 As a result of the rule, the Ford Motor Company recently said it would take a $7.5 billion charge against its earnings this year. General Motors has estimated that it must account for $16 billion to $24 billion of benefits.

 
'The Weakest Excuse'
 Advocates for retirees have accused employers of using the new rule as an excuse to shirk their obligations. "Companies have had several years' notice that they would have to comply with the accounting rule," said Cathy Ventrell-Monsees, a workers' rights manager at the American Association of Retired Persons. "To come out in this last quarter of 1992 and say, 'We are compelled to eliminate benefits because of F.A.S. 106 accounting' is the weakest excuse for hurting people just to save money."
 Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who is a member of the House Select Committee on Aging, has asked the General Accounting Office to investigate the cancellation of retiree health benefits. "My sense is that we're going to see more and more scheming to use F.A.S. 106 and other accounting sleight of hand to dump seniors and get out from under paying health benefits."
 Alain Enthoven, a health economist and professor of management at Stanford University, said that curtailing retiree benefits was "a very unfortunate consequence of costs being out of control." The cutbacks underline the urgency of fixing the health care system, he said.
 Unisys announced in November that it would phase out contributions to the medical plans of its retirees over the next three years, and McDonnell Douglas said in October that it would pay health benefits for salaried retirees from surplus pension funds, but only for the next four years. That will cut in half the approximately $1.2 billion accounting charge that McDonnell Douglas would have had to take.
 In the Primerica case, retirees were told in October that they had to decide whether to accept any of three benefits packages the company had arranged, to take advantage of a group rate. But even under the most expensive of those plans, retirees' medical coverage will be reduced. Instead of $10,000 in free life insurance, they can buy a $2,000 life insurance policy. A Primerica spokeswoman conceded that the new policy would be "expensive."

 
Less Than Chief Was Paid
 Primerica, which is based in New York, has not said how much it would cost to continue to pay retiree benefits, but that had not been a major expense in the past. In 1991, it spent $8.7 million for medical benefits for 7,800 retirees, including the American Can group. That is less than the 1991 compensation package of Primerica's chief executive, Sanford I. Weill, which Graef S. Crystal, the compensation expert, estimates at about $10.2 million in stock options and $2.2 million in salary and bonuses. It is also less than 2 percent of Primerica's profits last year of $478 million on revenues of $6.61 billion.
 Large companies spent $2,345 for each retiree, on average, for health costs in 1991, said Patricia Wilson, a principal with A. Foster Higgins, a benefits consulting firm. That is more than double Primerica's costs, which averaged $1,115 a retiree.
 Like other companies, Primerica had previously tried to shift part of its medical costs to retirees. It began asking retirees to pay more for benefits shortly after Mr. Weill acquired the company in a 1988 merger with his Commercial Credit Group Inc.

 
Raised Monthly Premium
 Primerica raised the monthly premium paid by the American Can retirees to $50, from $5, in January 1989. Trying to block the increase, the retirees and a group of former executives, headed by William F. May, who was American Can's chairman from 1965 to 1980, filed a class-action lawsuit in Federal District Court in Newark charging that they had been assured of receiving the $5-a-month medical package until they died, when their heirs would then get $10,000 in life insurance.
 But Primerica said the terms of the agreement allowed it to change the benefits, and now to terminate them. A booklet describing the health plan said the company "expects to continue this Plan indefinitely, but necessarily reserves the right to amend, modify or discontinue the Plan in the future in conformity with applicable legislation."
 Jack McGoldrick, a retired American Can executive who helped prepare the plan descriptions, said the clause meant only that changes might be made if required by new laws. The next paragraph said that "full consideration will be given to appropriate modification" if the Federal Government changed the Medicare program.
 The company argued that the wording allowed unrestricted changes. In July 1991, Judge Alfred J. Lechner Jr. ruled in Primerica's favor in United States District Court in Newark. He dismissed the retirees' case, citing other court decisions that have invalidated retiree health benefits when an employer has clearly reserved the right to do so. But on June 25, a three-judge panel of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia unanimously reversed the dismissal, ruling that the clause in the booklet was ambiguous. The appeals court sent the case back to Judge Lechner and told him to determine the facts "as to whether the company promised lifetime fixed-cost benefits to its retirees."
 In early December, after Primerica announced the Dec. 23 deadline for retirees to choose among the three plans to pay their own benefits, lawyers for the retirees asked Judge Lechner to act in the case.

 
Asked for More Time
 The Primerica lawyers said they needed more time to deal with the 28 affidavits submitted by the retirees' lawyers. Saying the request for a hearing on short notice was "outrageous" because of the lengthy documents and legal arguments involved, Judge Lechner scheduled the hearing for mid-January. "Perhaps Christmas Day, you want me to come in here?" he said.
 The retirees appealed to the court in Philadelphia "to order the district judge to take action or to restrain Primerica from making any changes in the plan until the district court acts," said Robert D. Towey, a lawyer with Riker Danzig Scherer Hyland & Perretti in Morristown, N.J. But the appeals court ruled against the retirees last week, leaving the scheduling of the hearing to Judge Lechner.
 Mary McDermott, a spokeswoman for Primerica, said yesterday that 55 percent of the company's retirees had responded by Monday. Primerica sent them a reminder letter this week, she said. Unless the courts rule against Primerica, those who did not respond by the deadline will lose their coverage.

CORRECTION-DATE: December 24, 1992, Thursday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Dec. 24 about employers that have been terminating health benefits for retirees misstated the number of people who would be affected at the Primerica Corporation. On Jan. 1, the company stopped contributing to health benefits for 1,600 retirees of the American Can Company, as Primerica was formerly known. A spokeswoman said the company had a total of about 7,800 pensioners, of whom only the American Can retirees were receiving company-subsidized health coverage before Jan. 1. Primerica disputed the figures in a letter dated Jan. 13; this correction was delayed for clarification of the background.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton Completes Cabinet And Points to Its Diversity: Corporate Lawyer, a Woman, Gets Justice Dept.

BYLINE: By GWEN IFILL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LITTLE ROCK, Ark., Dec. 24

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton finished assembling his Cabinet today, appointing more women and blacks to his inner circle than any previous chief executive and straddling his party's ideological fault lines.
In selecting Zoe Baird, a 40-year-old Connecticut corporate lawyer, to be the the first woman to serve as Attorney General, Mr. Clinton concluded a sometimes hectic selection process in which he named four blacks, three women and two Hispanic men to Cabinet jobs. Two other women were named to positions that Mr. Clinton has pledged to elevate to Cabinet level. 
 "They come from all across America," Mr. Clinton said of his nominees. "From the state capitals and the U.S. Capitol, from the city halls and the board rooms, and the classrooms. They come from diverse backgrounds and we will all be better and stronger for that diversity. I can say with pride that I believe this Cabinet and these other appointees represent the best in America."
 
Delicate Juggling
 The delicate juggling of competing interests that characterized Mr. Clinton's selection process was evident in the group he introduced today. Representative Mike Espy of Mississippi, 39, the choice for Secretary of Agriculture, is black. Bruce Babbitt, the 54-year-old former Governor of Arizona chosen to be Secretary of Interior, was championed by environmental groups. Federico F. Pena, 45, the former Mayor of Denver who would be Secretary of Transportation, is of Mexican descent.
Mickey Kantor, 52, a Los Angeles lawyer who was his campaign chairman, was picked to become United States Trade Representative and Dr. M. Joycelyn Elders, 59, the Arkansas health director, is to become Surgeon General in June when the current Surgeon General, Antonia Novello, steps down.
And John H. Gibbons, the executive director of the Office of Technology Assessment, will be Mr. Clinton's science adviser.
Mr. Clinton's nominees rounded out a selection of advisers who generally prefer a larger role for Government than the country has seen under Republican rule, but who are also less enamored of many Federal spending programs that Democrats have favored in the past.
 
Never Handled a Criminal Case
 Ms. Baird, senior vice president and general counsel of Aetna Life and Casualty in Hartford, began her career in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in the Carter Administration. At Aetna, she supervises 120 lawyers and $90 million in legal business. She has never handled a criminal case.
"If confirmed by the Senate, I will do everything within my power to be sure that this department will be firm in its prosecution of crime, will be guided by the rule of law and will be committed to the principled and deliberate advancement of civil rights, environmental protection and economic fairness and I pledge to promote the highest standards of excellence and integrity within the department," Ms. Baird said today.
Mr. Clinton and some of his aides acknowledged that the appointment process turned into something of an ordeal as he searched for unconventional appointees who represented an array of ideological and political points of view and background.
The aides said Mr. Clinton's tendency to closely manage decisions that bear his stamp played a crucial role in what seemed a rocky course as Mr. Clinton sought to complete his Cabinet by Christmas.
"If one lesson is to be learned from this process, it's that he will be involved," said Harold Ickes, a Clinton transition aide.
Other Clinton advisers said the process seemed more helter skelter than it actually was. They contended that candidates for a variety of Administration posts misread the President-elect's signals, prematurely making it known that they expected jobs that were later given to others. Senator Tim Wirth of Colorado, for example, told friends he would be Secretary of the Energy, and Brooksley E. Born, a Washington lawyer, expected the Attorney General's post.
 
'We Worked Very Hard'
 "I don't think it's anything they hear," said one Clinton adviser. "It's what they don't hear. Sometimes it's sort of circular. They hope it, people reinforce their belief. As the process goes along, they believe it's true because they read it in the press."
Advisers maintained to the end that the only people who were actually privy to Mr. Clinton's thinking were a small circle that included his wife, Hillary; his new chief of staff, Thomas F. McLarty; his friend and adviser, Bruce Lindsey, and Vice President-elect Al Gore.
Mrs. Clinton attended today's news conference.
"We worked very hard," Mr. Clinton said. "I mean, the President is only one person. Much of this Administration's life will be lived out through the actions of the people that you see on this stage and those that have preceded them. So I thought it was worth the time."
Toward the end of the selection process, a number of organizations representing women, environmentalists and Hispanic groups lobbied Mr. Clinton to include their representatives in the Cabinet.
 
Critics Become Supporters
 "The one thing I think probably concerned him was the interest groups believing that unless they put pressure on him that he wouldn't do what he said he would do," said one adviser who was close to the decision-making process. "The testiness that people noted was a sort of frustration at the prejudgement."
Today, some of the critics became supporters. Eleanor Smeal, the president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, who had led earlier criticism of Mr. Clinton's pace in selecting women, praised his final choices.
In a statement, Ms. Smeal said the composition of Mr. Clinton's Cabinet constitutes "a step forward for women in breaking the glass ceiling in public leadership."
Mr. Clinton also won praise from environmental groups who had campaigned for Mr. Babbitt, a lawyer who is president of the League of Conservation Voters. Fred Krupp, the executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, called him the "ideal nominee" and the National Audubon Society called him a "champion of the environment."
 
Pushing Teamwork
 Mr. Clinton said today that the input from the special interest groups was less energetic than he expected and that he considered the last-minute lobbying no more than a request for "a hearing."
But earlier this week, he was more critical of these efforts, saying that demands that he add more women to his Cabinet came from "bean counters" who were interested in forcing him to abide by quotas.
Mr. Clinton said he expected his group to be "more teamwork-oriented" than in past Administrations.
"What I thought about all along the way is how all these people would relate to one another, not just what their individual strengths are, although they are very impressive, but whether they would be able to fit into the economic team, the domestic policy team, the foreign policy team," he said.
Such criteria torpedoed some candidates who thought they had jobs on Mr. Clinton's team. Ms. Born, the Washington lawyer who had told associates on Wednesday that she would be Mr. Clinton's Attorney General, faded as the Clinton investigators began to inquire more about Ms. Baird. One Clinton adviser said Ms. Baird "got stronger and stronger" upon close inspection while other candidates grew weaker.
"She is tough, tenacious and gifted," Mr. Clinton said of Ms. Baird today.
He added, "We concluded we really needed to try to get somebody in there who could put together a team of excellent lawyers, lift morale, solve problems and restore a sense of movement to it within the proper boundaries, and I think she'll be able to do that."
Mr. Clinton failed in one of his stated goals. He was unable to find a Republican for his Cabinet. He said today that one Republican candidate, who aides later identified as John Young, the Hewlett-Packard chairman who was asked to be Secretary of Commerce, decided against joining the Administration.
If confirmed by the Senate, Mr. Clinton's Cabinet would also be made up of a number of people who started their ascents in the political and business world at relatively young ages.
Mr. Pena, who would be Transportation Secretary, was elected Mayor of Denver at age 35, after he had already served two terms in the State Legislature.
And Ms. Baird became associate general counsel to President Jimmy Carter in 1980 when she was 28. Four years later, she became a partner at the Washington office of O'Melveny & Myers, the Los Angeles-based law firm headed by Warren M. Christopher, who has been selected as Secretary of State and was Mr. Clinton's transition director.

HEADLINE: Old Weapons Are Plants' New Work

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHILADELPHIA

 BODY:
The steel hulls of 12 big Chinook cargo helicopters on the assembly line of the Boeing Company's helicopter factory here have been sanded and burnished so that the silvery metal looks new. But small numbers stenciled in black on the hulls tell a different story. "O22," one says, documenting that this was the 22d Chinook ever built, in 1961. None of the hulls is less than 15 years old.
Like so many military contractors, Boeing Helicopter is increasingly en gaged in the rebuilding and upgrading of old weapons instead of building more expensive new ones. The conversion of old weapons into more modern versions -- rather than simply overhauling them periodically as the Air Force does with the B-52 bomber -- now appears to account for more than half the military hardware manufactured in America, and the percentage keeps growing. 
 But as the numbers grow, so do the questions about whether the economics of such an approach make sense. With military budgets shrinking, rebuilding a Chinook so that it can carry more cargo, or an M-1 Abrams tank so that it is a more deadly weapon, is good business for weapons contractors, especially if it is a question of selling 20 improved weapons rather than only 6 new ones.
 
 
Improvements Are Costly
 The improved weapons, however, sometimes end up costing the Pentagon almost as much as a new weapons system. And while the practice saves money in the short run, weapons experts say it could bring on a crisis in a decade or so when Chinook and Abrams tank hulls -- and the hulls of many other rebuilt weapons -- are too old for yet another upgrade.
"You get in the bind where the oldest model costs so much to run and maintain that you have no money to buy a new system," said Maj. Peter Keating, an Army spokesman.
Congress would then have to choose between raising military spending to purchase new weapons or letting the weapons inventory shrink as worn-out weaponry is scrapped. Neither the Bush Administration nor President-elect Bill Clinton has addressed these issues.
"But right now, we have a lot of existing platforms with years of life in them, so we are looking for upgrades, and that trend will continue," said Robert Hall, a Defense Department spokesman.
The pressure to rebuild weapons has intensified because the cost of new weapons has kept rising. The Pentagon, in effect, covers a weapons maker's costs, negotiating ever-higher amounts to be covered, and then adds a profit on top -- as it has for more than two decades. As a result, the Pentagon has increasingly chosen to rebuild, say, 30 existing weapons rather than purchase 15 more expensive new ones.
The practice has gathered steam since 1987, when spending on weapons procurement began to shrink, after reaching a record $100 billion. Adjusted for inflation, the annual outlay today is about $80 billion.
For Boeing Helicopter, as for many other weapons makers, upgrading weapons has kept factories open. At Boeing's complex along the Delaware River, with its huge gray and blue buildings, upgrading the twin-rotor Chinooks keeps more than 4,000 workers employed. A brand new Model D comes off the assembly line only rarely, and usually for a foreign customer. Most of the four Model D's completed here each month are overhauled Chinooks, which first carried soldiers and supplies into battle in Vietnam.
Since the late 1980's, Boeing has been working on a contract that is costing the Pentagon more than $5 billion to rebuild 538 older Chinooks into the Model D. The Chinooks are flown here intact. Their rotors and engines are removed. The wiring, cockpit paneling and electronics gear are gutted. The paint is sanded off the hulls. The Model D's can carry more weight a longer distance.
 
 
Looking to Foreign Sales
 The last copter in this process is to be returned to the Army by mid-1995, and after that the hope is to sustain the production line with foreign sales. "We have people girdling the globe, trying to sell new Chinooks," said Stuart D. Dodge, director of Boeing's tandem rotor helicopter programs.
Anticipating that foreign sales will not be enough to keep the factory open, Boeing is now arguing that the Persian Gulf war demonstrated the need for another upgrade: Model D's should be rebuilt into the more powerful Model F, still in the design stage.
In a carpeted conference room at the headquarters building here -- a room with huge backlighted photo transparencies on every wall that show Boeing helicopters in action -- Mr. Dodge offers to a reporter the Model F sales pitch that he gives regularly now to people at the Pentagon and members of Congress.
The Model D, Mr. Dodge explained, was everywhere in Saudi Arabia and Iraq during the Persian Gulf crisis, carrying troops, drums of fuel, artillery and the injured. But fully loaded, the Model D's two engines and fuel capacity could travel only 100 miles without refueling -- half the range of the proposed Model F.
"On the first day of the ground fighting, that 100 miles took troops and supplies only halfway to Baghdad on the Euphrates from the Saudi border," Mr. Dodge said. "The Model F could have gone all the way to the Euphrates nonstop." And Mr. Dodge suggested that the Model F might have gotten American troops to Baghdad quickly enough to surprise Saddam Hussein and capture him.
 The Persian Gulf experience is frequently invoked to justify the expense of upgrading old weaponry in the post-cold-war period. The deployment of American troops in Somalia is the latest such experience.
But rebuilding older weapons rather than buying new ones raises issues that have not been adequately debated in Congress or by the public, according to Representative Andy Ireland of Florida, the ranking Republican on the House subcommittees for military procurement and for investigations of weapons contracts.
"If the threat is no worse than Saddam Hussein's Republican Guard, do you really need to spend so much on upgrading weaponry?" Mr. Ireland asked. "I know in my gut that upgrading weapons is a growing trend, although still not fully measured. Accountability is necessary to head off overcharging, which is just as likely with an upgrade as with a new B-1 bomber. Most important, is this an overlooked area for cutbacks in defense spending?"
One issue is whether companies like Boeing are rebuilding too much -- replacing too many parts -- and overcharging in the process. The rebuilding of Chinooks into Model D's, for instance, costs the Pentagon $11 million a copter, compared with $15 million to $17 million for a new Model D. In the early 1980's, when the Pentagon first began to convert earlier versions into the Model D, the cost per copter was $7 million.
In addition, the profit that Boeing earns from building a new Chinook or rebuilding an old one is roughly the same, says B. Dan Pinick, president of Boeing's Defense and Space Group. "The skills and capabilities that go into rebuilding a helicopter from the bare shell involve the same skills and capabilities that are necessary to build a new plane," Mr. Pinick said.
The source of much of the increase in costs since 1980 appears to be the new electronics systems and computers wired into the stripped-down Chinooks on the line here, or into the F-14 fighter planes that the Grumman Corporation is upgrading at its Calverton plant on Long Island, or into the older Abrams tanks that General Dynamics wants to rebuild at its Lima, Ohio, plant into the M1-A2 model. Among other upgrades, the M1-A2's have a new digital electronics system capable of detailed communication with other battle units.
In any modern weapon, the electronics gear is the costliest element and the source of the highest profit, said Peter Oram, president of Grumman Aircraft Systems. "You don't replace landing gears or wings or fuselage, and this air frame is maybe $500 a pound for aluminum and steel," Mr. Oram said. "But electronics go for $2,500 a pound installed, and if you are replacing 3,000 pounds of electronics, that is expensive."
The 18 stripped-down F-14's that Grumman has been upgrading at Calverton with new radar, new engines, new electronics and new missile-firing ability are costing the Pentagon $37 million a plane, compared with a $50.8 million price tag for an F-14, newly built.
"They don't have to do so much; they are making work," said Seymour Melman, a retired Columbia University engineering professor and a weapons industry expert.
 
 
Overhauls Without Upgrading
 Alternatively, these 10-year-old aircraft could remain in operation without becoming more powerful weapons, their lives extended through periodic overhauls at Air Force depots every year or two, at a cost of only $1 million to $2 million for each overhaul, Grumman officials say.
The Army faces a similar alternative for Abrams tanks. The new M1-A2 outperformed earlier models in the Persian Gulf crisis, with its more powerful cannon, its new electronics and a turret that offered the crew protection against chemical warfare. Until the Berlin wall came down in 1989, ending the rivalry with the former Soviet Union, General Dynamics had sought a contract to build 3,000 new M1-A2's.
But the company has switched strategies, bidding instead to upgrade 1,000 older tanks for $3.1 billion, compared with $4.6 million for a new M1-A2. A contract has not been signed, but the Army has endorsed the General Dynamics bid. It is seeking Defense Department approval to upgrade the first 260 tanks over the next five years, guaranteeing in the process the survival, until at least 1997, of the Lima plant, the nation's only tank assembly factory.
"You want to send soldiers into the field with the best equipment, even if it is an overmatch for the enemy," said Major Keating, the Army spokesman. "You want to have the best tanks up front."

HEADLINE: Marines Reach Bardera, But Not Famine Victims

BYLINE: By DONATELLA LORCH

DATELINE: BARDERA, Somalia, Dec. 24

 BODY:
In the early morning, the only sound in some feeding centers here is the uninterrupted crying of children. Some just sit on the ground, covered with flies and so thin that their skin falls in wrinkles around their bones.
As meal time approaches, they are joined by hundreds of women with their children, plastic bowl or soot-blackened kettle in hand, who wait in line for their morning handout of steaming, high-protein gruel. Once served, they squat in the dirt, scooping up their gruel with their hands. 
 Six hundred American marines arrived here today, tired and caked with dust after a 12-hour ride through desert and scrub from Baidoa, 120 miles to the northeast. The marines set up roadblocks at the entrance to the town and took control of the airstrip, but on their first day here none of them saw the scenes in the refugee camps a mile out of town.
 
Marines Outside Hunger Zone
 Some of the newly arrived marines wondered whether starvation, disease and malnutrition even existed here.
"We've seen all these pictures in magazines that show the horror of Somalia," said Staff Sgt. Michael McClung, 32, of the 7th Engineers Support Battalion. "We've been to Mogadishu, Baidoa and now Bardera. People look definitely poor, but they're not lying around lethargically dying. We were wondering where these people were."
Bardera, a dirt road lined by bullet-pocked buildings and shanties of corrugated tin, is the second major famine relief center that the marines have secured. On Dec. 16 they entered Baidoa and began escorting food convoys to outlying villages.
Military officials have considered the Bardera operation much more difficult logistically. It is more isolated than Baidoa, reachable only by ramshackle roads or a dirt airstrip that becomes impassable whenever it rains. And mines are a problem in Bardera, a legacy of bitter fighting between rival Somali factions. The town has changed hands twice this year.
 
Hungry Cluster in Camps
 Bardera's fortunes have declined steeply from a decade ago, when it was at the heart of a fertile region. Today it is dusty and tattered. But the butchers in the market sell slabs of camel and beef, and merchants have cloth and firewood for sale. The only hints of famine in the town are the skeletal beggars who walk the streets and are regularly turned away from food stalls.
Images of famine take over in the refugee centers, and in the outlying villages.
"There are 186 villages we'd like to reach," said Bob Allen, who heads the Bardera operations of CARE, the American relief agency. "We'd like to see the Americans stay up to such time as the economy picks up and the harvest kicks in."
In September, war between clans emptied the countryside, and 16,000 refugees settled on the outskirts of town. Four months ago more than 300 people were dying each day, many of the weakest and most vulnerable among them. Since then the situation has improved considerably, said Katherine MacArthur, a CARE nurse in Bardera. The daily death toll is down to about 60.
But warehouses have been looted regularly and relief agencies keep only a few days' supply of food in town for fear that it will be stolen. Relief agency officials say they hope the American presence will end the threat from looters.
 
Weariness, but Little Cheer
 The tactics the Americans used for Bardera were similar to the approach they took in Baidoa and Kismayu. Leaflets announcing the marines' arrival were dropped on the town on Tuesday, and on Wednesday Robert B. Oakley, President Bush's special envoy to Somalia, visited with town elders and clan leaders.
The Bardera operation produced the first American death of the Somali operation on Wednesday when an American was killed and three others were injured when their car ran over a land mine. [The Pentagon identified the dead man as Lawrence N. Freedman, 51, of Fayetteville, N.C.]
The first American troops here were 64 marines in 12 vehicles from the First Combat Engineer Battalion, whose job was to sweep the roads between Baidoa and Bardera for mines. Trucks decorated with hand-lettered "Merry Christmas" signs pushed huge steamroller wheels and chains to detonate mines. They encountered none.
The rest of the troops arrived by 3:30 P.M., caked in dust. Many asked reporters where the starving Somalis were.
"We're not planning on going into town,' said Lieut. Col. Rod Getz of the First Battalion, 7th Marines. "We're trying first just to have a presence here, to create a good feeling."
The crowd that turned out to watch the Americans was quiet and calm, appearing awed by the heavily armed marines as they went about their chores, sweating profusely in the 100-degree heat.
Aside from the holiday signs, there were few signs of Christmas cheer among the weary marines in these depressing surroundings. They settled into digging foxholes at the airport or just collapsed onto cots.
"I'm trying not to think about Christmas," said Sgt. John Manoni, 28, of Elmwood, Ill. "I try to think of it as just another day."

HEADLINE: For Connecticut, the Stakes Are Not Just on the Tables

BYLINE: By GEORGE JUDSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HARTFORD, Dec. 18

 BODY:
By proposing casinos for Hartford and Bridgeport, two large companies, Mirage Resorts and Harrah's Casino Hotels, are asking Connecticut to bet on legal gambling as a growth industry for the 90's.
The state's decision, in the end, is likely to come from the gut, like a poker player's when a long night comes down to a final hand. Like it or not, Connecticut already has such a large stake in legal gambling that rejecting casinos will almost certainly bring financial pain, though allowing them will not add greatly to the state's revenues. 
 In the fiscal year that ended June 30, $1 billion was wagered on state-sanctioned games: on the state lottery, in state-operated off-track betting parlors and at jai alai frontons and a dog track. Despite a conservative image conjured from equal parts Yankee industrialist, Greenwich preppie and Hartford actuary, the state ranks sixth in the nation in per-capita wagering, says Gaming and Wagering Business magazine.
One certainty is that some of that action, and some of the state's take of $250 million a year, will decline in this decade if Connecticut spurns casinos and nearby states welcome them. Another is that a Connecticut casino would cut into lottery sales and could put the frontons and dog track out of business. And while some of the opponents of casinos have raised the specter of organized crime, the debate has largely turned on economic issues.
"A lot of lawmakers seem to think they can balance their budgets with casinos, and that's a fantasy," said Eugene Christiansen, a gaming consultant whose company, Christiansen/Cummings Associates, recommended the limited licensing of casinos in Connecticut in a study for the State Division of Special Revenue.
Mirage and Harrah's are offering Connecticut a chance to get in early on their industry's expected spread across the country in the 90's as states scrape for new sources of revenue and as Indians force the issue by opening casinos on reservations, as the Mashantucket Pequots did in eastern Connecticut in February.
"By the year 2000," Mr. Christiansen said, "casinos will be as widespread as lotteries are today."
Even if Connecticut did gain revenue by licensing a casino, some people ask, what would happen when other states followed suit?
"When parimutuels started in this state, they were the only game in town, and they did exceedingly well," said Robert W. Werner, executive director of the Division of Special Revenue. "Now we're talking about how to save them. I think it's likely to see the same thing with casinos."
 
Governor Is Opposed
 In any case, slot machines are not the kind of technology that Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. wants to attract to Connecticut to preserve its manufacturing base, skilled work force and high quality of living. Last month the Governor bluntly restated his opposition to casinos.
"I don't see a state that has such a reputation for integrity of its politics and quality of its businesses mucking around in the business of gambling," he said. "You lay down with dogs, you get fleas.
"I'm going to have a terrible time getting legitimate business into the State of Connecticut if it knows that our budget is going to be based on gambling, or that they're going to be sitting physically cheek to jowl with casinos."
The strength of the sentiment for casinos will become clear in January, when a legislative task force will make its recommendation before the General Assembly convenes. The Greater Hartford Chamber of Commerce, with its own task force, will also take a position next month.
A task force for the Bridgeport Regional Business Council has already recommended that its organization endorse up to two casinos for Bridgeport, where both Mirage and Harrah's have proposed $300 million developments on the waterfront.
 
The Lure of Development
 The casinos counter Governor Weicker's objections by pointing to his administration's difficulty in stanching the state's loss of industrial jobs and by describing what they could do for its largest cities.
Mirage Resorts, for example, has proposed spending up to $350 million to build a casino, convention center, restaurants, shops and theaters in downtown Hartford, which has lost several department stores and hotels. Mirage says the complex would employ 6,000 people and pay up to $100 million a year in state and local taxes.
Mr. Christiansen's company, in an estimate based on three casinos operating in Fairfield County, projected revenues of $49 million a year for the state and $20 million a year for the localities.
Casinos would also allow Connecticut to capture some of the estimated $150 million a year its residents now spend in Atlantic City, Nevada and Caribbean casinos.
The casinos have sought to make themselves more attractive by promoting their plans as developments that include casinos but represent much more to their host cities: a convention center for Hartford, which wants but cannot afford one, or a huge family-entertainment center in Bridgeport.
Even if a casino complex were built around entertainment, critics say, unskilled jobs like maids, busboys and waiters are not what the state needs to pull itself out of recession and rebuild its manufacturing base.
"The Governor has much more ambitious employment goals for the people of this state than the kinds of jobs that are available in a casino," Mr. Weicker's spokeswoman, Avice Meehan, said.
 
Image Is Cited
 The administration and other opponents are also concerned that the insurance companies that gave Hartford its reputation as a financial center, which are undergoing great changes themselves, will not care to share a skyline with a casino.
"It will affect our reputation as a conservative business community," said the Rev. Christopher L. Rose, pastor of Grace Episcopal Church in Hartford, who has lobbied against casino legislation.
He is also distressed that some people are willing to take a chance on gambling as an economic enterprise.
"I can't believe we're still making the same mistakes, that we haven't learned the lessons of the 1980's," he said. "We fell in with Colonial Realty on all of those great real-estate deals, we had four or five skyscrapers promising to be the salvation of downtown Hartford. The reason our recession is so deep is because of all the money taken out of the economy by that speculation."
Colonial Realty, forced into bankruptcy in September 1990, had attracted as many as 6,000 people, who invested $350 million.
Still, it remains difficult to measure how the legalization of gambling affects the soul of a state. Many people look to New Jersey, where the unredeemed slums of Atlantic City stand to them as a symbol of failure.
Professor James W. Hughes of Rutgers University, the co-author with George Sternlieb of "The Atlantic City Gamble" in 1983, said the driving force behind any state's legalizing gambling is almost always "economic desperation."
New Jersey voters approved Atlantic City casinos in 1976, after a harsh recession, but its ambivalence showed in its strict regulation of the industry through the 1980's. The return of tough times is changing that. The state now allows 24-hour gaming. There is pressure to legalize sports betting.
"As the economy has weakened and the state's fiscal situation has weakened, the state has essentially become a much stronger partner," Professor Hughes said. "It now has a vested interest in the success of gambling."

HEADLINE: Mulroney Calls for Naval Blockade of Haiti

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: OTTAWA, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Prime Minister Brian Mulroney said an international naval blockade should be set up around Haiti to bring down the military dictatorship, according to a television interview transcript released today.
Mr. Mulroney has become increasing frustrated with a lack of effort to help restore a democratic government in Haiti, and the failure of a limited economic blockade to be effective, his spokesman said today. 
 "There should be a naval blockade, by Canada, the United States, France and Venezuela to name but four to bring that Government down," Mr. Mulroney said in the transcripts of a CTV television network interview to be broadcast on Sunday.
The democratically elected Haitian President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, was overthrown in a Sept 30, 1991 military coup.
Canada has many Haitian immigrants, particularly in Quebec, and has supported the Organization of American States blockade of Haiti.
"If you really want to shut these guys down, you have to put a stranglehood on them," said Mark Entwistle, Mr. Mulroney's spokesman.
Mr. Mulroney has continued to raise the issue with President Bush, and will try to persuade President-elect Bill Clinton to support a more effective blockade.

HEADLINE: Jamaica's Coffee Makes Japan a Jealous Lover

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MAVIS BANK, Jamaica

 BODY:
On the steep mountainsides overlooking Kingston, the afternoon air is renowned for two things: the coolness that reliably descends the slopes while the capital still swelters below, and the aroma of roasting coffee beans.
While other developing countries may rue the economic "cures" from Washington that urge them to produce ever more of their commodities, seemingly forcing prices inexorably downward, Jamaica has happily established its Blue Mountain coffee as one commodity that seems always in demand across the world. 
 Through intense attention to quality, heavy investments in marketing and considerable luck with geography, production of Blue Mountain coffee is booming. So are prices.
Able to command $7.50 a pound, 10 times the price of run-of-the-mill varieties, Jamaicans have thrown themselves with gusto into coffee cultivation in the last few years. The beans must grow at high altitudes in the Blue Mountain range near Kingston in order to be legally marketed with the prized brand name.
Growers in the range, which rises from the blue Caribbean to an apex of 7,500 feet in the space of a scant 12 miles, are hoping to quadruple their production in the next five years or so, to 16 million pounds.
Seated in his small, smartly appointed Kingston office, Mitsuo Seyama, an executive of Japan's Ueshima Coffee Company, is a major reason for Jamaica's recent success with coffee. His company is the biggest importer of Blue Mountain in Japan, which alone imports 90 percent of Jamaica's crop.
"Elsewhere we have to breed coffee to get just the right acidity and flavor balance," said Mr. Seyama. "But we consider that Blue Mountain is naturally perfect -- medium acid with just the right sweetness."
The combination of high quality and aggressive marketing by Ueshima has resulted in a willingness by Japanese consumers to pay $8 to $10 a cup in restaurants for his Jamaican brews, versus about $3 a cup for regular coffee.
After Hurricane Gilbert hit Jamaica in 1988, leaving much of the island looking like a plucked chicken, prices soared on the Japanese coffee market. In a gesture that left a lasting impression, Jamaican growers say that Japanese importers were on the telephone in the first days after the storm offering whatever help they needed in restoring their operations.
Now the Japanese have a near lock on the market, and little genuine Blue Mountain coffee reaches American consumers, although it can be found in gourmet shops selling for $20 to $40 a pound. Seeking to cash in on the cachet of Jamaica's beans, many retailers in the United States sell coffee that has little or no Jamaican content under deceptive names like Blue Mountain blend, or style.
Keble Munn, the 73-year-old managing director of the Mavis Bank Central Factory, the biggest processor of Blue Mountain coffee in Jamaica, said he would like to make more of his coffee available to the American market.
"We have Americans and Europeans who call up all the time and say, look, we'll pay you $11 a pound," Mr. Munn said. "Well that's fine for one shot, but what do you do four years hence, when the next hurricane hits? That's when you remember the Japanese, and the lesson for us has been taking care of clients like that first."

HEADLINE: Ontario's Socialists Falter After 2 Bitter Years

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TORONTO

 BODY:
In elections a little over two years ago, the 10 million people of Ontario, Canada's richest and most populous province, voted for their first taste of democratic socialism.
Trade unions, social-action groups and other supporters on the left of the political spectrum rejoiced at the surprise victory of the New Democratic Party and proclaimed Ontario a leader in fashioning a more just society, economically and socially. 
 But the taste of power, so sweet on Sept. 6, 1990, has turned sour. Almost nothing since then has gone right for the Government and the former labor lawyer, Bob Rae, 44, who became the province's first Socialist Premier.
A recession forced him to make especially painful decisions in cutting spending, for example, on provincial schools, hospitals and municipalities. And his administration has fallen victim to a seemingly unending series of political scandals.
After a bartender said that the Minister of Tourism, Peter North, a 32-year-old father of two, had offered her a $45,000-a-year Government job during a relationship that he wanted to become sexual, Mr. North resigned.
The Premier's press adviser, John Piper, 49, a former executive with the giant public relations firm, Hill & Knowlton, quit after trying to discredit a woman who was charging sexual misconduct by a former Cabinet minister. Mr. Piper had offered to leak the woman's criminal record to a reporter from The Toronto Sun.
Carlton Masters, who heads Ontario's United States trade office, an operation employing 57 people in six cities with an annual budget of $7.5 million, resigned after being accused of sexually harassing female employees in New York and Boston.
Mr. North, Mr. Piper and Mr. Masters have declined to explain their actions and have avoided of the press.
The opposition is rejoicing as opinion surveys show the New Democratic Party's popularity plummeting. The most recent Gallup poll showed Ontario New Democrats at 22 percent, the Liberals at 46 percent and the Conservatives at 29 percent.
The Liberal Party leader in Ontario, Lyn McLeod, said Mr. Rae had a "reverse Midas touch." The Progressive Conservative leader, Michael Harris, described the Government as "just sort of wallowing in the ocean."
Adding to the Premier's discomfort are the standards he set. "We must at all times act in a manner that will not only bear the closest public scrutiny but will go further and insure public confidence and trust in the integrity of government," he said when elected.
Lawrence LeDuc, professor of Canadian politics at the University of Toronto, said, "Bob Rae set some pretty straight guidelines, and now he's stuck with them." But he also said that the Government had been hurt by the recession and the unpopularity of some of its policies.
Mr. Rae, who has not been implicated in any of the scandals, has acknowledged disappointment, but he tends to take a more philosophical view than his critics and is convinced the tide will turn. Legally, he does not have to call elections until 1995.
Although he is ideologically an adversary, some of the arguments Mr. Rae now uses echo those of the Conservative Prime Minister, Brian Mulroney, whose popularity has been skidding over an even longer period.
Both have found the Liberal Party a convenient scapegoat. Mr. Mulroney has frequently blamed spending excesses of earlier Liberal governments in Ottawa for the economic retrenchment that he has imposed nationally.
Now Mr. Rae is blaming 1985-90 spending increases by Liberals, while they were running the province, for compounding his Government's difficulties in fighting the recession.
Like Mr. Mulroney, Mr. Rae is also saying that he expects the economy to improve and that this will enhance his political fortunes.
But Professor LeDuc and other analysts note that Mr. Rae is in danger of being too closely identified with Mr. Mulroney. Many New Democratic core supporters see the Government they worked so hard to bring to power now behaving just like a Tory Government in cutting back or delaying programs for students, hospitals and women.

HEADLINE: Clinton to Focus on Helping U.S. Airlines

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Helping the nation's airline industry recover from its $8 billion tailspin since 1990 is a top priority for both President-elect Bill Clinton and the new Congress, according to Government and industry officials,
Proposals under study, they say, include tax incentives, regulatory relief, global partnerships and revisions of the bankruptcy laws to bolster the troubled industry. 
They also hope to persuade foreign governments to provide greater access to American carriers that seek to increase their lucrative international routes. That issue led to the abandonment this week of a plan by British Airways to invest $750 million for a 44 percent stake in troubled USAir, the nation's fifth-largest carrier.
The deal fell through because the United States and Britain were unable to agree on steps to open their airline industries to greater competition. Its failure was cited by some as an example of how the industry and the Federal Government should have been able to work more successfully.
"There is a sense that many of the international carriers are working in partnership with their respective governments, and that kind of partnership does not exist here in the United States, where our carriers are left to their own devices as they compete globally," said Federico Pena, who is chairman of Mr. Clinton's transition team on transportation and was nominated today to be Secretary of Transportation.
In a telephone interview before his nomination was announced, Mr. Pena predicted that under the new Administration, "There's going to be much closer attention on the part of the Federal Government to the U.S. airline industry, to assure the ultimate survival of the industry."
The industry went from a $1.7 billion profit in 1988 to a $4 billion deficit in 1990, and $2 billion deficits in 1991 and 1992, according to the Air Transport Association, which represents the major airlines.
Mr. Pena envisions more of a Government partnership with the airline industry and less of an adversarial relationship. He supports tax incentives "to allow the industry to thrive, something that foreign governments do all the time."
"We're all concerned about the thousands of people who have lost their jobs, and have to make sure that that doesn't continue to be the trend in the future," he said.
Similarly, Representative Norman Y. Mineta, the incoming chairman of the Public Works and Transportation Committee, said that the airline industry would be "a top priority" of his committee, as well as the new Congress.
The California Democrat said that he had already discussed some specific measures with Mr. Clinton, including a reduction in the $3 charge that some localities charge airline passengers. To remain competitive, airlines sometimes elect to pay the fees themselves, at a cost last year of $1.2 billion to the industry.
Patricia Goldman, USAir's senior vice president for corporate relations, cited these "passenger facility charges" as an example of "an enormous number of regulations that have significant costs attached and significantly impact our bottom line."
Most industry experts believe that the airlines have been a primary victim of the faltering economy. "We are very much slaves to the economy," said Jim Landry, president of the Air Transport Association, which represents the major airlines. "A great many of our seats are being filled at below-cost prices. If there is an economic recovery, we'll get a return to a more normal traffic demand."
Mr. Mineta's prescription follows similar lines. "First," he said, "the economy has to be turned around. Then you go to the specific problems -- too many seats chasing too few passengers."
Most experts cite overexpansion as a major cause of the airlines' woes. Last month, only 58.4 percent of airline seats on domestic routes were filled, compared with 62 percent of the seats on international routes.
"I don't know if there's anything to be done until that overexpansion has ended and the economy has recovered," said Alfred E. Kahn, who championed deregulation as chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board during the Carter Administration.
Mr. Kahn believes that international alliances could be the savior of America's airlines. "I'm terribly disappointed by the failure of the British Airways-USAir deal," Mr. Kahn said. "We don't see anything wrong with the British owning banks, insurance companies and hotels. It's good for American consumers to get that capital."
But Mr. Mineta was leery of the 44 percent stake in USAir's equity and 21 percent of the voting stock that British Airways had sought in exchange for the $750 million it had offered the ailing airlines. And Lee Howard, president of Airline Economics, an aviation consulting firm, said that "these deals ought to be structured so that control remains with the American carrier."
 
 
Tougher Bankruptcy Laws Urged
 Many industry experts urged tougher bankruptcy laws. At present, T.W.A., Continental and America West are in Chapter 11. Previously, Pan Am, Eastern and Braniff were in Chapter 11.
John V. Pincavage, a partner at the Transportation Group Ltd., a New York firm that specializes in financing airlines and airplanes, said: "We should not allow airlines to go into Chapter 11 and dissipate creditor assets while they continue to operate and not have to pay their bills. That's what has led to continued overcapacity in the industry. The day a company declares bankruptcy we should padlock the doors and put it out of business. This would help reduce excess capacity and help the remaining airlines, which would get the traffic from the bankrupt airlines."
Mr. Mineta said that under the bankruptcy law, an airline that does not have to pay its creditors sometimes becomes "the tail that wags the dog." He noted that several weeks ago, when one airline (American) announced a fare increase, another airline, in bankruptcy (Continental), decided to cut fares. "They didn't have to pay their creditors," Mr. Mineta said.
Most industry experts agree with Ralph Nader, the consumer advocate, who said, "There's no quick fix; there's no unscrambling the egg." But they disagree with his diagnosis: "They screwed up their own system of deregulation." They also do not like his remedy: "Go back to the old days and make the airlines a public utility."
 
 
'Unfair Trade Practice'
 Mr. Nader supports creation of new airlines, new airport slots, the ending of abuse of computerized reservation systems and the ending of Frequent Flier programs, which he believes are "an unfair trade practice."
Mr. Howard of Airline Economics also blames the airlines for some of their woes. "The airlines should discipline themselves with regard to fares, and gear them more to stability in the future than short-term cash," he said.
Mr. Landry of the Air Transport Association offered a list of tax incentives intended to promote economic growth, including investment tax credits. He noted that the industry would replace 2,600 older aircraft by the year 2000, at a price of $130 billion. He also urged a modification of the alternative minimum tax law "which has carriers suffering operating losses borrowing money to pay taxes."
Mr. Landry was among several experts who urged overhaul and modernization of the air traffic control system.

HEADLINE: Jobless Claims Rise for Week

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
The number of Americans filing new claims for jobless benefits rose a surprising 12,000 in mid-December to the highest level in three weeks, the Government said today.
The Labor Department said first-time applications for unemployment insurance totaled 360,000 in the week that ended on Dec. 12, up from a revised 348,000 a week earlier. 
 It was the highest level of new claims since 362,000 were filed in the week that ended on Nov. 21. Many analysts had expected the number to fall.
Still, it was the 12th straight week that claims remained below 400,000, which many analysts consider the threshold between an improving or deteriorating job market.
The department said earlier this month that the jobless rate dipped to 7.2 percent in November from 7.4 percent a month earlier; the recent peak was 7.8 percent in June. At the same time, it said 105,000 jobs were created last month.
The four-week moving average of regular weekly claims also fell during the period that ended on Dec. 12, to 348,750 from 352,250 a week earlier. It was the lowest level since the moving average was 345,750 for the period that ended on May 26, 1990, and the 10th straight week that it remained under 400,000.

HEADLINE: Law;
At the Bar

BYLINE: By David Margolick

 BODY:
Come what may over the last decade, Bruce and Nancy Young of Minneapolis have tithed -- that is, given 10 percent of their income to their church. They gave in the good times, when business at their electrical contracting business was brisk. And they gave in the bad times, when Mr. Young's heart attack and the recession led them into bankruptcy.
But when the Youngs mark Christmas today at the Crystal Evangelical Free Church in nearby New Hope, they may reflect on Federal judges as well as the Wise Men, statutes as well as the Star of Bethlehem. The Book of Deuteronomy has run right into the Federal Bankruptcy Code. 
 Chief Judge Robert J. Kressel of the United States Bankruptcy Court in Minneapolis recently had to decide whether the Crystal Church could keep the Youngs' money, or whether the money should go to the banks and credit card companies to whom they owed money. That required Judge Kressel, in turn, to answer a more puzzling theological question: whether Mr. and Mrs. Young got their money's worth for their contributions.
An intensely devout couple, the Youngs learned of tithing from their reading of the Bible, which first mentions the tradition in Deuteronomy 14:22. They immediately began donating to the Crystal Church 10 percent of their gross earnings, contained in 52 weekly offering envelopes. They made their donations, Mr. Young said, "come feast or famine"; in 1991 their largess amounted to $13,450 even though, as of last Jan. 14, Young Electric was officially insolvent and, as of Feb. 3, the Youngs filed for bankruptcy. All told, they were at least $150,000 in debt.
As provided for under Federal law, the court appointed a trustee to collect the couple's remaining assets and distribute them among their creditors. The trustee was Julia Christians, but she showed little reverence for the donations to the Crystal Church. Citing Section 548(a)(2) of the Federal Bankruptcy Code, she argued that the church had to disgorge the funds.
The Youngs said they were thunderstruck by her determination -- the result, they felt, of an overly zealous young lawyer out to make a name for herself. Ms. Christians said the bankruptcy code authorizes trustees to "avoid," or rescind, all donations made by an insolvent party within a year of filing for bankruptcy when the donee "received less than a reasonably equivalent value in exchange," and made no exception for churches.
What constitutes something of value? Can one put a price tag on succor? The Youngs contended that they had received considerable value for their contributions, largely in the spiritual and psychological realm.
Mrs. Young said in an affidavit that her attendance at Sunday morning services and weekly Bible study classes "was valuable because it nourished my spiritual needs." Mr. Young was a bit more explicit. "The spiritual nourishment I received from my attendance at Crystal Evangelical Free Church helped keep me stable during stressful business times," he wrote.
But Ms. Christians maintained that the bankruptcy code does not place a value on such intangible things. "Value," she argued, meant "property," and whatever else they might have received for their good deeds, the couple received no property in exchange.
Enter Judge Kressel, whose analysis of the problem was as much etymological as legal. After poring through Black's Law Dictionary and Webster's Third New International Dictionary for the definitions of "property," "thing," "ownership" and "rights," he concluded that everything the Youngs had received -- "feelings of association, comfort, affection, companionship, love" -- were "mere gratuities," without the economic value the law required.
Rejecting two other court decisions that good will and religious services constitute property, Judge Kressel ruled that the Crystal Church had to refund the money, to be picked over by various creditors. "While I am not  thrilled about making a church return contributions," he wrote, the law permitted no other result. "The voice of Congress is loud," he wrote. "Property is value, charitable contributions are not."
Judge Kressel's decision, made public on Dec. 17, constituted a rude Christmas present for Mr. and Mrs. Young, who are now back on their feet financially and continue to tithe.
It was bad news as well for William Sisterson, the pastor of the Crystal Evangelical Free Church, who said he is contemplating an appeal. He is also pondering the changing relationship between the churches and courts, one which, he said, have left churches far less sacrosanct than they were 20 years ago, when he was ordained.
"Good will toward churches has eroded, and this case is symbolic of that change," Mr. Sisterson said. "Churches are in more of a free-fire zone than they used to be, and we're just joining the club."

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS: Merry Christmas to The Donald;
Here's an Investment Scrooge Would Love

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Martin Mittlemark may win the prize for the most original holiday gift idea for 1992: tax liens on property owned by Donald Trump.
Mr. Mittlemark, president of Municipal Liens Inc. of Tinton Falls, N.J., isn't joking. 
 The liens are certificates comparable to other types of securities, backed by the properties as collateral. They can pay the equivalent of double-digit interest rates, far better than Treasury bonds or bank deposits.
In Mr. Trump's case, the liens are against taxes that the flamboyant New York financier has not paid on his Atlantic City casinos. The gaming parlors have all been restructured under bankruptcy protection laws and now seem to be doing substantially better, which makes the tax liens on them worth even more.
"Each one comes with a full title search showing how Donald overextended himself and how the banks rushed in to save him, heaping one mortgage upon the next," Mr. Mittlemark writes in an industry trade journal.
The former municipal bond trader and commodities market trader is an aggressive promoter of tax liens as an alternative to stocks and bonds.
"It's really one of the safest investments around," he said. Before the property can be sold, the property owner or the mortgage lender must pay off the tax lien, and any associated penalties.
Tax liens have priority over other claims, which provides a measure of investment security typically found in government bonds, Mr. Mittlemark said.
What isn't commonly understood is that private investors can buy the tax liens from city, county or state governments. Depending on the local government rules, the liens can yield anywhere from 6 percent to 25 percent, Mr. Mittlemark said.
Investors need to carefully sort out the specific laws on tax liens, which can vary by municipality. Mr. Mittlemark's company plows through the dense tax records and advises pension funds, former bank directors and others about the best deals.
He hopes to develop a cottage industry of "tax liens of the rich and famous," but concedes only the liens on Mr. Trump's Atlantic City properties qualify for star status.

HEADLINE: Fed, in Mid-November, Favored Easing of Rates

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Federal Reserve policy makers decided at a mid-November meeting to maintain a policy leaning toward lower interest rates if the economy began to sputter, according to minutes released today.
Members of the Federal Open Market Committee reviewed information that "suggested that economic activity had been expanding at a moderate pace," the minutes said. At the same time, wage and price data suggested "a continuing trend toward lower inflation." 
 As a result, all but 3 of the 12 members agreed to maintain a policy that would include "some bias" toward easing interest rates, if needed. As it turned out, the Fed did not act.
 
 
Greenspan in the Majority
 In the majority were Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve chairman; Wayne D. Angell, Edward W. Kelley Jr., Lawrence B. Lindsey, David W. Mullins Jr. and Susan M. Phillips, who are all Fed governors, and E. Gerald Corrigan, Thomas H. Hoenig and Richard F. Syron, who are regional Fed bank presidents.
One Fed governor, John P. LaWare, and a regional president, Thomas C. Melzer, disagreed. They said the bias toward lower interest rates was unnecessary because of the strengthening economy.
One regional president, Jerry L. Jordan, also dissented because of a desire for faster growth in the money supply.
The committee adopted the current policy leaning toward lower interest rates, if needed, in midsummer when the economy appeared to slump. It voted to continue that policy at meetings in August and October, although it agreed to a stronger, "marked bias" toward easing at the latter meeting.
 
 
Met Again This Week
 The committee met again this week. Its meetings are closed to the public, but minutes of the proceedings will be released in early February.
Analysts believe the committee decided against any immediate action because of signs that the economy continues to strengthen gradually. They added, however, that the Fed could push interest rates higher by mid-1993 if the economy appeared to be overheating and building inflationary pressures.
The Fed has not cut rates since Sept. 4, when it allowed the Federal funds rate to drop to 3 percent, from 3.25 percent. The funds rate is the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans. The rate has been cut 24 times over the last three years to help stimulate the economy.
The committee comprises the seven governors, including Mr. Greenspan, and the presidents of the 12 regional Federal Reserve banks. Only the governors and five of the regional presidents are voting members.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
You May Call It Art, But Some Call It Dessert

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: EAST HANOVER, N.J.

 BODY:
WHEN you're trying to build something as colossal as a castle, it takes an incredible amount of drawing and planning, not to mention real inspiration. It takes careful staging of all the materials. It takes vision and an artisan's touch. And it takes an awful lot of icing. Also cookies, crackers and cardboard. And an oven preheated to 350.
"Any time you begin something of this scale," warns Walt Wanner, "you've got to be very careful and creative." You've also got to have a spouse blessed with saintly patience. 
 Mr. Wanner is one of nearly 20 artistes des nourritures whose oeuvres a manger are on display these days here at the sprawling headquarters of Nabisco Brands U.S.A. It's called edible art. There are castles and cottages and towers, even a mosque and a church. And they are open for public viewing every day from noon to 4 P.M.
So this morning as soon as you find part M for the plastic race track, and the 3/8-inch lug nut for the red wagon with the missing bolt and 16 more D batteries for the Galactica robot that ran over the cat's tail, you might want to scoot on over and catch a little sugar culture. But Please Do Not Eat the Exhibits!
This is probably the most delicious art show Nabisco has ever sponsored in the lobby of its divisional headquarters. In recent years a fair number of large corporations have moved from the city, where few people know their neighbors, to the suburbs, where few people still know their neighbors but most keep close track of them (you know, property values and all).
When Nabisco bought a bankrupt golf course here in 1976, it not only dropped a huge corporate presence into a residential neighborhood, it closed down the best sledding hill for miles around (you know, insurance liability and all).
But it also opened its doors, trying to establish a kind of good-neighbor policy for anyone who could survive the climb up the hill. Since Nabisco doesn't actually make anything here and since there really isn't that much exciting about three floors of office space, even suburban office space, Nabisco executives devoted the long lobby hallway to rotating exhibits of art that might interest their neighbors and 1,000 employees.
The exhibits, under the tasteful eye of Mary Chandor, Nabisco's art consultant, stress New Jersey artists who, like other Garden State residents, often feel themselves laboring in Manhattan's long shadow. "Good art space is hard to find in New Jersey," she explains with an accent that sounds suspiciously Canadian.
"We've exhibited -- and sold -- watercolors and rugs, photographs and oils," Ms. Chandor adds. "Last spring, when planning our Christmas exhibit, we thought, 'Why not have a little fun with this one?' "
Fun, you say? Have you ever tried to make a gingerbread turret topple-free? Have you ever tried to make a sidewalk out of Snackwell's cheese crackers and a sturdy cottage roof out of Mini-Oreos while your husband finished his Ph.D. thesis on animal behavior and your two cats eyed this special dessert you were making them on the dining room table of the usual tiny apartment in Queens? And don't forget to paint sweaters on each Teddy Graham cookie playing in the partially hydrogenated margarine snow.
See, that was the catch of this contest. Each edible art submission had to use at least five Nabisco products. Peggy Schmidt used 11 in her cottage, which consumed two 20-hour days. That apartment has smelled sweet for three weeks. But, hey, she took third place.
Mr. Wanner, a retired West Orange construction worker and veteran gingerbread-baking grandpa, won second with his castle featuring a cheddar Zing fence, Mini-Oreo path and Fruit Stripe gum bridge. (The little Christmas trees were festooned with Life Saver Holes.)
Charles Petretti of Spotswood, N.J., captured first prize with his 25-inch-tall bubble gum tower, although, truth be told, his girlfriend, Kiersten Dahlquist, unwrapped the 110 packs of Bubble Yum. That's a lot of bubble gum, even if you don't glue each piece in like a brick. (Much of the structural weight, however, is carried by beams of diet Stella D'oro breadsticks.)
"The idea just came to me," explained Mr. Petretti, a part-time liquor-store clerk and unemployed architect who hopes to use his edible art fame to acquire a job designing real buildings. "I'm psyched now!" he said.
Mr. Petretti blew his entire $500 prize on Christmas presents. Ms. Schmidt, a restaurant-arts student, will spend her $100 entering other contests. And Mr. Wanner has put his $300 toward next summer's vacation at the shore. One question remains for when the exhibit closes Jan. 11.
Since the edible art market is somewhat limited, what does one do with a well-planned but stale castle?

HEADLINE: Dow Shows A 12.70 Gain In Short Day

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Blue-chip stocks closed higher yesterday in a pre-Christmas rally fueled by a recovery in shares of I.B.M. and new highs for A.T.& T.
The Dow Jones industrial average was up 12.70 points at 3,326.24. Volume in the shortened session was only 95.2 million shares, the lightest of the year, compared with 234 million shares Wednesday. Advances led declines, 954 to 705. 
 The stock market closed two hours early, at 2 P.M., for Christmas Eve. It will be closed today for Christmas.
Analysts said the American Telephone and Telegraph Company was becoming the new blue-chip market leader, replacing the International Business Machines Corporation, which sank recently to an 11-year low. A.T.& T. jumped 1 1/2, to a record high of 52 3/4. I.B.M. also rose 1 1/2 to close at 52 3/4.
"There's a new leader here on the Street and it's called Ma Bell," said James Andrews of Janney Montgomery Scott.
"There is leadership here that's encouraging the rest of the market," a Bear, Stearns analyst, Jack Solomon, said. "The tone was set by the recovery in I.B.M. and the new highs in A.T.& T."
Bear, Stearns repeated a buy rating on A.T.& T., saying disappointment in other blue chips helped move the stock higher.
Analysts said the market largely ignored disappointing news that weekly jobless claims rose by 12,000, to 360,000, in the week ended Dec. 12. It was the second consecutive week that jobless claims rose, reversing several weeks of decline.
The latest total was above Wall Street's expectations of a decline to 342,000 claims on a seasonally adjusted basis.
"The data reinforces the point that the improvement in the labor market will be gradual," said Marilyn Schaja, economist at Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette.
The market gains were expected to continue into next week, analysts said.
Yesterday's session "bodes well for the rally to extend into the new year," Patrick O'Malley, managing director at Needham & Company, said.
 
Traditional Year-End Rally
Analysts said bargain-hunting ahead of the market's traditional year-end rally also helped stocks.
"People want to jump on the bandwagon early," said Robert Walberg, an analyst at MMS International. "The market usually gets its biggest boost in the last week of December and the first week of January." Mr. Solomon at Bear, Stearns noted that the Dow index was showing a recovery, closing at its highest level since Oct. 9, when it closed at its low for the year, 3,137.
Among individual issues, shares of Bell Atlantic lost 3/4 at 53 after Josephthal, Lyon & Ross downgraded the company.
Novell topped the Nasdaq most active list, gaining 1 3/8, to 27 1/2, and rebounding from recent losses.
Ventritex surged 4 1/8, to 35 1/4, after the company said it had received an "approvable" letter from the Food and Drug Administration for its Cadence implantable defibrillator system for patients with irregular heartbeats.
Medicine Shoppe fell 1, to 25 1/2, on a downgrading by A. G. Edwards.
The Standard & Poor's composite index of 500 stocks rose 0.74 point, to 439.77. The American Stock Exchange index was up 1.38 at 394.17.
The New York Stock Exchange composite index of all listed common stocks rose 0.23, to 241.23. The average share was up 4 cents. The Nasdaq index rose 2.92, to 665.88.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Bonds Are Mixed in Light Trading

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury bonds ended mixed yesterday, with many participants already out of the market for the Christmas holiday.
Volume was light, and the market closed early at 2 P.M., Eastern time,for the holiday. 
 The price of the Treasury's closely watched 30-year bond was down 3/32 point, or 94 cents for each $1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which rises when prices fall, was 7.36 percent, up from 7.35 percent late Wednesday.
 
 
3-Month Yield Unchanged
 Yields on three-month Treasury bills were unchanged at 3.22 percent, as the discount held steady at 3.16 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 3.39 percent, as the discount rose a basis point to 3.30 percent. Yields on one-year bills were unchanged at 3.59 percent, as the discount held at 3.46 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The market disregarded a Labor Department report that initial claims for unemployment insurance rose a surprising 12,000 in mid-December to the highest level in three weeks. Many analysts had expected the number to decline.
Paul Kasriel, an economist at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago, said the jump was not large enough to persuade traders that the economy was recovering. He noted that the four-week moving average of unemployment claims, a more widely respected measure, was down.
Mr. Kasriel said investors were increasingly convinced "that the recovery is for real, that we are unlikely to lapse into another period of stagnation -- in fact, that we are more than likely to start building a stronger forward momentum in the economy."
He added, "And with that, the Federal Reserve is likely to keep policy on hold, but the odds will favor that their next move will be to push rates up." He added that a tightening of credit would probably not happen until the second quarter of next year.
 
 
Inflation May Rise
 Not only is the economy improving, Mr. Kasriel said, but the low inflation rates that the market has been enjoying are beginning to be viewed as unsustainable.
"With those two factors, interest rates would have a tendency to creep up from here," he said.
Interest rates tend to rise, and bond prices fall, if market participants anticipate that the economy will heat up enough to reignite inflation, or if they believe the Federal Reserve is likely to tighten monetary policy.
The Federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was 6 percent, unchanged from late Wednesday.
In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds closed at 9719/32, down from 9720/32 on Wednesday. The average yield to maturity was unchanged at 6.40 percent.

Wheat Contract Prices Rise On Fears of a Crop Freeze

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: CHICAGO, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Concerns that freezing temperatures would damage the developing crop lifted wheat futures prices today on the Chicago Board of Trade in light pre-holiday trading.
Although the winter wheat crops are dormant under moist soil conditions, fears of winter crop kills lingered as temperatures dipped below zero in Chicago and across the Midwest and western plains. 
 The freezing temperatures also lifted cattle and hog futures at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. The cold weather could cause another setback in the rate of weight gain for livestock.
Live cattle futures for February closed up 0.125 at 76.375 cents a pound and February hogs also closed 0.125 higher at 43.675 cents.
The deferred July and September wheat contracts, in particular, were supported by the adverse weather. The spread widened between those contracts and the nearby March contract.
The March contract was also bogged down by another round of Russian defaults on American credit loans. United States banks filed 20 default notices today ahead of the extended-holiday weekend, bringing the outstanding debt to $95.7 million.
"The market right now has the understanding the Russian debt situation is more than just an economic problem," said Joe Victor, director of marketing at Allendale Inc. in Northbrook, Ill.
Wheat for March delivery closed off 1/4 cent at $3.58 1/2 a bushel, while March corn ended steady at $2.19 3/4 and soybeans closed up 1 3/4 at $5.77 1/4 a bushel.
Sugar prices ended marginally higher on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange, with the March contract 0.02 cent higher at 8.21 cents.
Barrett Lewald, senior futures market analyst with Lind-Waldock in Chicago, said sugar was restrained by local trading, which dominated the market ahead of the holiday.
Copper futures also finished higher on the Commodity Exchange amid trading driven by technical factors. The March contract rose 1.25 cents, to 102.40 cents.

HEADLINE: BASEBALL;
A Most Extraordinary Fella

BYLINE: By IRA BERKOW, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEWPORT BEACH, Calif.

 BODY:
One looks for turning points. How is it that he has come this far, this way? Maybe it was the time when Jim Abbott was 5 years old and came home from school, angry and tearful, and held up the steel hook a doctor had recommended he use for a right hand. "I don't want to wear this anymore," he told his parents.
Other children were afraid to play with him and, in the way that small children can be cruel, called him names like "Mr. Hook." Even then he struggled not to appear different. He never wore the hook again. 
 Or maybe it was the time when he saw that his parents had learned to tie a shoe with one hand so they could teach it to him. He, unlike them, was born with just one hand, his left.
Or maybe it was when his father in a park in Flint, Mich., taught him to throw a baseball and then remove the glove ever so smoothly and swiftly from his right wrist and place it on his left throwing hand in order to catch his dad's quick throw back, and then switch the glove back again in order to throw.
He developed the technique so skillfully that when he was pitching in high school, the story goes, the first nine batters on an opposing team tried to bunt for hits. He threw the runners out each time.
"That story has grown out of proportion," Abbott said. "It was only five or six batters."
 
As Normal as Any Other Kid
 Or maybe for Abbott, the 25-year-old pitcher recently obtained by the Yankees in a trade with the California Angels, there was no single turning point. Maybe it was simply the concept that his parents, Mike and Kathy Abbott, had come to live by, that Jim, except for the strange fate of having been born with one hand -- there is a stub with one small finger-like protrusion where the right hand would be -- was as normal as any other kid, and should think of himself that way.
Four years ago, Abbott became the first and only one-handed pitcher in baseball history, and one of the elite who can throw the ball at speeds of up to 94 miles an hour. Abbott also accomplished something else that, while not singular, is rare. He went from the campus of the University of Michigan to the Angels, their first-round pick in the amateur draft. He has never spent a day in the minor leagues.
Abbott's parents were married at 18 and had Jim when they were still 18. There was a time early on when they felt sorry for themselves, but they soon overcame the shock and influenced Jim not to feel sorry for himself, either.
Kathy Abbott recalled that occasionally Jim drew stares from people. "Oh, yes, because of Jim's hand," she said. "I'd forgot about it."
"I never heard Jim ask, 'Why me?' " said his father recently. "And as he grew up, I watched the way he handled himself around people. He's always had a lot of friends, always laughed. Even when some people have said insensitive or cruel things. Like a reporter asking, 'Is anyone else in your family deformed?' But Jim is always a gentleman. I don't understand how he does it. His dad is now taking lessons from him."
"My parents kept me in the mainstream; they never shielded me," Abbott said, sitting recently with his wife, Dana, on a stuffed white couch in their ground-floor apartment here. Outside, near the window, stood a palm tree. Inside, there was a small, decorated Christmas tree. Abbott said he felt blessed. "When we moved into a new neighborhood, my father said, 'Jim, go out and meet the kids. Say, I'm Jim Abbott. Ask to play in their game.' "
 
'I Look Back With Admiration'
 One can somehow still picture Abbott, now 6 feet 3 inches and 215 pounds and looking husky in a short-sleeve blue shirt, blue jeans and worn running shoes, as that blond-haired, open-faced, seeking boy. He recalled that his parents always supported him but never pushed him, that they emphasized he should do whatever came naturally, and that he could just about realize whatever dreams he had, including, eventually, pitching in the major leagues.
"I will always be thankful to my parents for how they dealt with it," he said. "They were young. They were alone. There were no support groups. Really, I look back with admiration."
Pitching for a mediocre Angels team that, as it happened, often didn't play well behind him or hit well for him, he managed to post commendable statistics. Last season, for a team that tied for fifth place in the American League West, Abbott compiled a 2.77 earned run average, fifth best in the league, although his record was 7-15. The year before, he was 18-11, with a 2.89 e.r.a. In his two previous seasons, his records were 12-12 and 10-14 (and in those 14 losses his team scored a total of 15 runs).
"He pitches his heart out every time," said Rod Carew, the Hall of Famer and the Angels' batting coach. "But he pitched with incredibly bad luck. He could win 20 games for the Yankees, easy. I'd put him in the category with Catfish Hunter and Nolan Ryan, some of the greatest pitchers I faced. And he's a terrific guy to be around. I hated to see him go."
On the bench, Angels players laughed among themselves how Abbott, with his cutting fastball and hard slider, broke five or six opponents' bats a game. And they would take pleasure in observing other players watch Abbott field a shot through the box, handling his glove so fast that it was nearly sleight-of-hand. "Did you see that!" players in the other dugout exclaimed. "Did you see that!"
Why, then, did the Angels trade Abbott? A contract dispute seems at the crux. Abbott was at the end of a one-year contract with an option. The Angels offered a four-year contract at $16 million. Abbott's agent, Scott Boras, had asked for a four-year deal for $19 million but made it clear that this was negotiable. At this point, it seems, Jackie Autry, who runs the team for her husband, the old troubadour-cowboy Gene Autry, and the general manager, Whitey Herzog, decided they would show Abbott and Boras who was boss and traded the pitcher for three Yankee minor league prospects.
"I was surprised," said Abbott. "I just thought I'd spend my whole career with the Angels. It's kind of easy to get it into your head that you're indispensable. And then suddenly I was traded and felt a real sense of rejection. And there were the concerns about coming to New York -- just a big, looming city. As great a city as it is -- and I've always loved to visit there -- I wasn't sure. You hear a lot of horror stories. And I was concerned about Dana making the transition because she was born and raised in Southern California. But she seemed excited about it."
Dana Douty lettered in basketball and earned a degree in economics from the University of California at Irvine last year, shortly before she and Abbott were married.
"Jim's such a fierce competitor that going to the Yankees will just be another challenge for him," she said. "He even hates it when I beat him in gin rummy."
"But I'm getting better," Abbott insisted.
"You are," she assured with a smile, "you are."
Despite his boyish looks, Abbott hardly seems one to be intimidated, even by New York City.
"I like the team the Yankees are putting together," he said. "I like the players they've recently picked up, like Jimmy Key and Wade Boggs and Spike Owen and Paul O'Neill, and plus, of course, it's a privilege to play with guys like Mattingly -- or should I call him Don?" He smiled. "Or Mr. Mattingly?" He was half serious.
"And I have no problem with anything I've heard about George Steinbrenner. I mean, it sounds to me like he wants to have a winner in the worst way. I love that."
Abbott spoke about a phone call from Yankees Manager Buck Showalter. "You'll like the fans," Showalter told Abbott. "They stay for the whole game and hang on every pitch, and they know baseball. They'll cheer you when you do well and boo when you don't. But there's an excitement at Yankee Stadium that's different from Anaheim."
"The call pumped me up," said Abbott. And while he didn't want to say anything bad about the Angels, a team that "gave me a chance," he was nonetheless upset when he read something an Angels executive had said: "Oh, people are unhappy to lose Abbott only because he's a one-armed pitcher."
"I have an arm," said Abbott. "I don't have a hand."
Abbott is not the only one-handed player in major league history. There was Pete Gray, the one-armed outfielder for the St. Louis Browns in 1945. "I didn't grow up wanting to be another Pete Gray," said Abbott. "I grew up wanting to be another Nolan Ryan."
From a Scholarship
To Sullivan Award
Abbott was always a good athlete, and sports has helped give him a sense of stature that he might not have had otherwise. He became a high school pitching sensation and then got a scholarship to Michigan, where he majored in communications and was so brilliant a pitcher (and a capable batter, too) that in 1987 he was named amateur baseball player of the year. In 1988, he won the Sullivan Award as the best amateur athlete in the country.
With all that, he is not pleased when, for example, people have come to him to autograph a baseball that Pete Gray had signed. While Abbott admires Gray, he doesn't want to be thought of as an oddity.
Gray, for all his remarkable achievements and ability, was still kind of a sideshow in the major leagues, a wartime player used primarily to draw crowds, a player who would be introduced last to the fans in pre-game introductions. Gray batted .218 in his one year in the big leagues. Abbott is one of the finer pitchers in baseball, and, after four seasons, an established one.
"I just don't think all of this about me playing with one hand is as big an issue as everyone wants to make it," said Abbott. "I don't try to run from the attention about it, I just accept it."
Abbott received so much mail with the Angels -- as many as 300 letters a week -- that the public relations department regularly piled it into shopping carts when he was on the road. Many of the letters were from children who were physically handicapped or disabled, or from parents of such children.
"Some of the stories are unbelievable, so tragic," said Abbott. One letter came from an 8-year-old girl who had been attacked by a mountain lion and lost an arm. Another boy had lost an arm when fireworks exploded.
"I try to write them all back. But sometimes there's really not much I can say. I don't really believe in this stuff about ballplayers as role models. But if I can be of help to anyone, if anyone can take something from the fact that I'm a baseball pitcher, then fine.
"But when I'm out on the mound pitching, I'm pitching because I love it, because I like the challenge of trying to get people out. I'm not pitching because I want to prove anything to anyone."
In every city he travels to, parents bring their children to meet him. "There was this one boy, about 7 years old, who came into the clubhouse with his parents," Abbott recalled. "He had only parts of two fingers on one hand. He asked me if kids were mean when I was growing up. He said they called him 'Crab' at camp. I said, 'Yeah, they used to say that my hand looks like a foot.' I said to him, 'Do you think that teasing is a problem?' He said, 'No.' I said, 'Is there anything you can't do?' And he said, 'No.' And I said, 'Well, I don't think so either.'
"Then I looked around the room and said to him, 'Look, I'm playing with guys like Dave Winfield and Wally Joyner and Dave Parker. I'm playing with them and I'm just like you.' I'd never said that before, that I was thrilled to be here and it didn't matter if I had two good hands. But I put myself into his shoes and remembered what I was like at his age. And I'm sure that kids need someone to relate to. But so do their parents. Most of the time I think it's my parents these people should be talking to, not me."
While there were surely grim moments in his background, much of it, he says, he has blocked out. Like, perhaps, his feelings of self-consciousness as he tried to hide the stub of his hand from view. Even now, perhaps subconsciously, his father said, he still sometimes does.
But Abbott, meanwhile, tries to look forward, not backward, which is why he has turned down numerous movie and book offers.
"I'd hate to be held to what I said or thought when I was 21 years old," he said. "But anyway, a book on me would be boring. Like, 'Oh yeah, he pitched a great game.' Or, 'When he was losing with the Angels he got booed.' Not great literature."
It was near the end of day, the sun was setting behind the palm tree and the Christmas tree, and the Abbotts rose to get in some late Christmas shopping.
They entered the apartment garage, where a set of his golf clubs in a red golf bag leaned against the wall. Abbott climbed behind the wheel of his cream-colored minivan. He was asked: Is there anything he can't do that he wished he could?
"Yes," he said, after a moment. "I'd love to play the piano."

B7); Jim Abbott, born without a right hand, was taught his unique fielding technique by his father. During his delivery, he rests the pocket of his glove on his right wrist. After he releases the ball, he completes his follow-through by slipping his left hand into the glove, leaving him ready to field any ball hit back to him. After fielding, he swiftly tucks the glove under his right arm, grabs the ball from his glove and throws. How good is he? In high school, a team began a game with one batter after another trying to bunt against him. He threw out each one. (Photographs by Barton Silverman/The New York Times) (pg. B9)

HEADLINE: On Stage, and Off

BYLINE: By Bruce Weber

 BODY:

Looking for the Brass Ring
The thunderous success of "Carousel" at the National Theater in London was the catalyst of nearly all the Christmas-week buzz in the theater world. What will happen to Nicholas Hytner's production when it closes at the National's Lyttelton Theater on March 28? 
 Whether a commercial production opens first in New York City or in London seems to be a matter of when an appropriate theater will be available on Broadway. "Carousel" needs a deep stage and would best be served by a house with an intimate feel, but it's a big musical -- the cast numbers 36 -- and economics demand a lot of seats.
The same economics is what has created the Broadway logjam. Big musicals have to run and run and run to pay for themselves, and it is unlikely that "Carousel" can displace, any time soon, any of the shows now in theaters where it would fit -- "Les Miserables" at the Imperial, for example, or "Jelly's Last Jam" at the more modern Virginia. Indeed, neither the Shubert Organization nor Jujamcyn Theaters has an available venue this spring, and many people believe that the two available theaters owned by the Nederlander Organization -- the Minskoff (1,621 seats) and the Gershwin (1,933) -- are too cavernous to serve "Carousel" in a befitting manner.
"It's playing at a modern theater in London," said Ted Chapin, the executive director of the Rodgers and Hammerstein Organization, which controls the rights to the show, referring to the 890-seat Lyttelton. "But the big, modern houses on Broadway are not emotionally friendly."
It would be difficult, in any case, to move the show to Broadway before the Tony deadline (the first week in May), particularly since there will be the added complication of satisfying union requirements for a largely British cast. Mr. Chapin said the possibilities included an immediate commercial run in London (although it's far from clear where the show could be put on to advantage in the available West End houses, either) or a hiatus, with the company reconstituting itself, perhaps in the fall, when some other theaters may come available. He also said that Cameron Mackintosh had the inside track as the producer for a commercial run, but he didn't know what Mr. Mackintosh, who is spending the holidays at a phoneless retreat in Scotland, had in mind.
 
A Clash of Performing Cultures
 Part of the charm of "Orpheus in Love," the witty operatic update of the Orpheus myth running at Circle Rep through Jan. 3, is in the collision of theatrical and musical cultures, and the almost riotous discomfort it has engendered in its audiences. With its atonal score by Gerald Busby and its half-slapstick, half-literary libretto (the Orpheus character is a viola teacher at a community college) by Craig Lucas, it's an odd duck of a piece, especially at Circle Rep, where more conventional theater has long been cozily received.
"Theater people don't seem to like it, but music people do," said Bradley Garvin, the bass who sings the central role, much of it lying in bed.
"You can feel their dismay; it's palpable," Mr. Lucas said of some regular Circle Rep attendees who have arrived unprepared. "There was a clear sense of 'I didn't buy my subscription to go to an opera.' " At one intermission, Mr. Lucas said, a man stood outside the theater exhorting people to leave. "He was on the sidewalk, shouting: 'Set yourselves free. You don't have to go back in.' "
Mr. Lucas spoke with an air of humor and resignation; not everyone goes to the theater to be surprised or challenged, after all. And besides, he acknowledged, the piece, weird in its execution, was weird from its inception. It began as a collection of individual, unrelated songs that he and Mr. Busby wrote and later rewrote and knitted together into a loosely connected dream sequence, suggestive of love and loss. The Orpheus rubric was Mr. Busby's idea, and Mr. Lucas embraced it, at least in part for its symbolic value.
"You don't have to have been awake during the AIDS epidemic to find it in the opera," he said. "It is about someone who has love cruelly taken away from him."
Tanya Berezin, Circle Rep's artistic director, spent about $200,000 mounting the show, about twice what is typical, largely because of a longstanding relationship with Mr. Lucas, whose previous Circle Rep productions include "Reckless" and "Prelude to a Kiss." She admitted that the board had been "very reticent and nervous" about taking on the project, and that casting for singers who could act was particularly difficult, but said that ultimately everyone was pleased by the stretch.
For their part, the performers have also found some perplexities in crossing over from the operatic stage. "Most operatic arias are sung standing up, not lying on your back," Mr. Garvin observed.
Diane Ketchie, a soprano and a pianist, said the singers had to teach the theater people about "the concept of vocal rest. When we saw the schedule -- two Saturday shows and two Sunday shows every week -- I nearly went into cardiac arrest."
Ms. Ketchie said she has been enjoying the intimacy of the Circle Rep space, but she sympathized a bit with the audience. "I wonder, when we're singing full-throttle high notes, what kind of experience it is listening to that."
 
Tap: Past, Present, Future
 "I remember when Duke Snider retired," Gregory Hines said. "I figured, that's it for centerfield. Then along came Willie Davis."
Mr. Hines was using baseball's Dodgers to make a point about his own place in the world of tap dance, a place emphasized by "Ted Levy and Friends," the evening of tap he directed on Monday night at the New School. Featuring, among others, Jimmy Slyde, 67; Mr. Hines, 46; Mr. Levy, 32, and the prodigiously athletic 19-year-old Savion Glover, the show illustrated the art's line of descent, and its current red-hot flame. "Gregory Hines is the Pied Piper of modern tap," Mr. Levy said afterward, "but the torch is always being passed."
Mr. Levy, who said he was moved to make tap his career when he saw the movie "White Nights," which starred Mr. Hines and Mikhail Baryshnikov ("I said, this cat is dancing with a ballet dancer?"), pointed to Mr. Glover's recent television commercial for Chevrolet as a sign that tap is on the verge of going mass market.
Mr. Hines agreed it's tap's time -- and Savion Glover's time. The two of them, who share the stage in "Jelly's Last Jam," have a movie project in the works.
"When I was 14," Mr. Hines said, "I looked up to Honi Coles and Sammy Davis and Bunny Briggs. Those men were 25 or 30 years older than I was. When Savion was 14, he looked up to me. The 14-year-old dancers now look up to Savion. There's a wave going to come, with Savion in the lead."
 
 
 
FILLING ANOTHER SISTER'S SHOES
 Next Friday, Christine Estabrook will replace Frances McDormand as Pfeni, the youngest of "The Sisters Rosensweig" in Wendy Wasserstein's play at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater. Ms. Estabrook, who appeared in Ms. Wasserstein's "Heidi Chronicles," will join the rest of the original "Sisters" cast when the show moves to the Ethel Barrymore Theater on March 3.

HEADLINE: A Nostalgic Look At Fun and Games

BYLINE: By ANDREW H. MALCOLM

DATELINE: KATONAH, N.Y.

 BODY:
PARCHEESI, it can now be revealed, causes stomach flu.
I know this because in my childhood every single time I stayed home from school because I had turned green, the Parcheesi board was found next to my bed, plus crackers, warm ginger ale, at times tepid tea and sufficient Kleenex to blip the stock of the Kimberly Clark Corporation. (Never mind the battered pot always within emergency reach.) 
 To be fair, some bedside blame for my flus, measles, mumps, chicken pox and other childhood maladies should also fall on Chinese checkers, Snakes and Ladders and perhaps poker, which my father taught me when Mom was out. (When Dad was away, she tried tutoring me in bridge. But I fell asleep.)
As youngsters, we have the most wondrous way of unconsciously soaking up indelible intellectual associations. Say New Year's Eve today, and I instantly picture little-boy pajamas with the seat flap and built-in slippers, because that's what I was always wearing when roused to watch Ben Grauer watch the next year arrive in Times Square. (Why, by the way, does every new year start with those same two men climbing that light pole and removing their shirts at midnight to celebrate Dick Clark's growing one year younger?)
Likewise, the slightest scent of cigar smoke today makes me think of yesterday's baseball games, which may explain that sport's declining attendance.
So, now you say Parcheesi, and I think of retching. No offense to Milt Bradley.
That explains the absence of a closetful of battered game boxes in our house, each with the traditional one piece missing. (All right, there is a game of rabblSce, but words are my profession and a triple-word score can make an entire day.) And it explains my initial reaction to news that the Katonah Museum of Art has opened a new exhibition titled "The Board Game: America at Play 1845-1945." Even with free admission in tree-strewn Westchester County, who wants to wax nostalgic about nausea?
But Skip Hospital and Go Directly to Museum. For many, this exhibition about what I once thought were called bored games may well be more fun than the games themselves. Certainly more informative.
Of course, it's not so much the myriad games on display here through Feb. 28. (Did anybody with the slightest sign of brain activity ever really buy and then play a game called Bobby and Betty's Trip to the New York World's Fair?) What's compelling is what the games tell us about the contemporary society that produced and played them, its passions, priorities and prejudices, and how our country and its values have changed since. "Our games mirror our society," says William C. Ketchum, the show's guest curator, who also writes about folk art.
 
Reflecting Their Times
 What a mirror! Early board games were flat morality plays with players spinning a wheel (dice, you'll recall, were associated with gambling and the devil) to move through Frugality and Diligence to a pictorial Heaven bearing a remarkable resemblance to the suburbia in promotional brochures for modern housing developers.
In the faddish 1890's, when bicycling swept the land like nothing until Hula Hoops, there was the Bicycle Race: A Game for Wheelmen. In expansionist turn-of-the-century days, families could sit around with jingoistic pastimes like the Rough Riders Game and the Philippine War Game: Crushing the Rebellion in Luzon. (The ultimate goal was Manila, of course, but the landing came at a place called Subic Bay, which the United States just lost.)
By the Roaring 20's, American consumers were consumed by Keeping Up With the Joneses. (Wouldn't it be interesting someday to peruse the checkbook of the original ostentatious Joneses?) Then came Monopoly, of course, which Mr. Ketchum and his siblings played all through their father's long unemployment, and Cabby: The Game With Rules Made to Be Broken. Of course.
In 1939, before the enemy could be properly identified, there was Flying G-Men: Dynamiting the Lid Off the Foreign Spy Menace, followed in 1942 by Dave Dawson's Pacific Battle Game, then the Ration Board Game and Air Raid Warden ("Unexploded Bomb on Broadway Between Union and Main"). And just imagine the excitement of the Let's Go to College Game (1944).
 
Evolution of a Pastime
 Some form of board game existed 4,000 years ago. (That's a good question for Trivial Pursuit. Here's another: In what country was Trivial Pursuit invented?) But modern games have typically required a middle class with sufficient size, disposable income and time to play.
Not surprisingly, different cultures produce different games. Board games were popular in 17th- and 18th-century Europe. To this day Europeans like chess along with cheese, wine and car races full of finesse turns. Americans prefer Monopoly, beer, chips and the Indianapolis 500, which entails 2,000 very fast left turns. Other popular American games involve vaporizing aliens with electron guns or smashing a mallet on the heads of gophers who pop up from holes in a table. (The mallet, thank goodness, is chained to the table.)
Games -- video, athletic and board -- have become an integral part of American culture. In fact, someone could argue that thanks to opinion polls and television, modern American life is like one big board game with few players and millions of spectators. Win New Hampshire. Pass Iowa. Capture California. Enter the White House. Add some rich competitors, and you can see Barry Bonds Break the Bank, Ivan Boesky Land on Insider Trading (Go to Prison) and Donald Trump Buy the Plaza, Mortgage Boardwalk, Lose Wife, Sell Airline, Enter Bankruptcy and Refinance Casino.
Historically, the growth of American board games was greatly hindered by the enduring Puritan ethic of the Cotton Mather crowd (picture them sitting around in those immense collars saying, "Go Fish!") and the lingering belief that leisure time was a fertile field for the work of you-know-who from you-know-where. Few frontier homes had time or space for parlors or drawing rooms.
The 1840's, however, witnessed the start of drastic changes in the lives of Americans, and their games. Instead of being merely extra farmhands, society began seeing children as future adults, who required training. And how better could conscientious parents train offspring than through educational games, which reinforced and rewarded the same virtues society professed to value in real life?
 
A Certain Kind of Progress
 No accident that early game producers were book publishers and mapmakers. No accident that games' popularity grew with the advent of labor-saving machinery and socially acceptable leisure time in the post-Civil War Industrial Age. (No accident, either, that the painful Civil War -- and Vietnam too, come to think of it -- did not immediately produce games.)
However, the spread of the nation's transportation network provided game possibilities for competitors to cross the country and ostensibly learn geography en route, as did Lucky Lindy's trans-Atlantic flight and the newspaperwoman Nellie Bly's successful bid to circle the globe and beat Jules Verne's 80-day record by one week. (Ponder the commercial sophistication in that one: an 1890 board game of a newspaper's circulation stunt to beat a fictitious travel record.)
The advent of radio and the mass media in the late 1920's opened a new spectrum of commercial game possibilities, from Superman and Little Orphan Annie to games built around a dummy called Charlie McCarthy and a rodent named Mickey Mouse. As a sign of progress, millions of Americans chewing dinner each night can now yell "Jeopardy" answers at their deaf television sets.
But imagine the impact of board games on values and aspirations before the mass media, back when 8 of 10 Americans lived in the country. They might spend one hour a week in church, but many more spinning the wheel on Mansion of Happiness, the Chequered Game of Life, Shall I Marry? or Errand Boy, which turned Horatio Alger into a game.
 
Shifting Values
 In Mansion (1843), players moved through five dozen spaces from Piety and Charity (move ahead) to Audacity and Immodesty (lose one turn). The European edition showed a topless woman for Chastity, an image deemed contradictory to players in North America, where she received a robe and torch. Over the years other changes crept in: Poverty became a vice, along with Sabbath Breakers (baseball players), and Prudence (a woman sewing) became a man banking money.
In Chequered (1863), the point was to acquire the most points (5 for landing on Honesty or College, but 10 big ones for Government Contract). Fat (political) Office was a major goal.
Shall I Marry? (1890) was another in the Old Maid genre suggesting women could be fulfilled only through marriage. Interestingly, however, many other games like Nellie Bly reflected women's liberation long before even suffrage. Although American Indians were generally portrayed as wily foes, other games like Watermelon Patch (1896) played to racial stereotypes and prejudices.
With no national media, each game's box had to sell itself. This produced colorful and imaginative lithography, which still excites collectors like Mary Lou Alpert, who spent nearly two years assembling this exhibition. Many collectors have made a game out of acquiring old games at auctions for thousands of real dollars.
Congratulations! You have reached The End. The answer to that Trivial Pursuit question is: Canada.

HEADLINE: Sounds Around Town: On New Year's Eve

 BODY:

POP AND ROCK
 
Dr. John 
 Dr. John, Tramps, 51 West 21st Street, Chelsea, (212) 727-7788. When Dr. John comes to town, he brings with him an air of fantastic New Orleans decadence: as he sits at the piano, tossing off blues, funk and honky-tonk riffs, an exotically outfitted snake dancer enters the stage and puts his music in motion. Her pet is a long, thick, heavy reptile that she wears around her neck like a boa; she preens, dances with it and occasionally allows its tongue to graze Dr. John's ear. All the while he keeps playing, aloof and unfazed by this parlor trickery. His repertory runs from the Louisiana standard "Iko Iko" to his own hits like "Right Place, Wrong Time," and his gruff voice is as lazily entrancing as his effortless piano style. Dr. John plays one show from about 11 P.M. until 1 A.M.; the zydeco accordionist Rockin' Dopsie, who likes to dress modestly in a royal crown and robe, performs a set before and after, around 9 P.M. and 1:30 A.M. A table reservation with four-course dinner, Champagne toast and party favors costs $110 a person; general admission, which includes just Champagne toast and party favors, is $50. KAREN SCHOEMER
 
Punk Party
Lunachicks and the Vacant Lot, CBGB, 315 Bowery at Bleecker Street, East Village, (212) 982-4052. New Year's Eve at CBGB is a kind of case study in antifestivity. The celebrated punk dungeon has grimy, graffiti-encrusted walls; crowded tables that wobble but don't fall down; a string or two of colored lights (if you're lucky), and onstage at midnight, the abrasive, angst-and-estrogen-charged Lunachicks. Also on the bill is the Vacant Lot, whose three-chord guitar jive is awfully reminiscent of former CBGB kings the Ramones; the Vacant Lot's new single "Just One Night" is loaded with retro-pop positivity. Other bands include the psycho noisemakers Karen Black and heavy-metal buffoons Rawg. Show starts around 10 P.M. The $15 admission includes Champagne toast and party favors. K. S.
 
Old-Style Crooning
Howard Hewett and After Seven, Apollo Theater, 253 West 125th Street, Harlem, (212) 749-5838. A bunch of love men up there telling the audience -- mostly women -- who, what and where. Howard Hewett is an old-style crooner, and After Seven, a vocal group, is retro old-style, all slick harmonies and smooth moves. Shows are at 7 and 11 P.M. Tickets are $30 to $40 for the first show and $35 to $45 for the second, which includes a Champagne toast. PETER WATROUS
 
Brash Iconoclast
Chaka Khan, the Roxy, 515 West 18th Street, Chelsea, (212) 307-7171. Extravagance personified, Chaka Khan has been on a roll recently. She has been singing songs from her almost 25-year career, and audiences have been going wild, appropriate behavior for New Year's Eve. She has become an institution. The doors open at 10, with an appearance by Ms. Khan at 2 A.M. Tickets are $30. P. W.
 
Thoughtful Funk
Kid Creole and the Coconuts, Webster Hall, 125 East 11th Street, East Village, (212) 353-1600. August Darnell, alias Kid Creole, leads New York City's most literary funk band, working out questions of desire, ego and cultural identity with the help of a wise and sassy chorus line, the Coconuts. The band performs at midnight. Tickets are $40 in advance or $50 at the door, including a Champagne toast and party favors, or $100 for V.I.P. tickets, including an open bar. JON PARELES
 
Cajun and More
Beausoleil, Lone Star Roadhouse, 240 West 52d Street, Manhattan (212) 245-2950. Based in Lafayette, La., Beausoleil started out as Cajun-music traditionalists, then broadened its mandate. Now, its fiddle and accordion and rhythm section look to the Caribbean and beyond for good-timey hybrids. Opening: the Pinballs, a New York Cajun band. The show starts at 9:30 P.M. Tickets are $20, $35 and $65. J. P.
 
Soukous and Soca
Diblo Dibala and Matchatcha, with Black Stalin, Harambee, 127 West 43d Street, Manhattan, (212) 819-1133. Diblo Dibala's gleaming, coiling, tickling guitar lines helped define modern soukous (a light rumba rhythm garlanded with guitars) with Kanda Bongo Man's band and with Loketo. His latest group, Matchatcha, is as buoyant as ever. Black Stalin, from Trinidad, is a soca singer who slips political comment into his double-entendres. Doors open at 8 P.M. The live show starts sometime after 11 P.M. Three disk jockeys will play dance music until 7 A.M. Admission is $70 a person or $130 a couple with dinner and a Champagne toast; $30 a person and $55 a couple with just a Champagne toast. J. P.
 
A Soulful Voice
Joan Osborne, Wetlands, 161 Hudson Avenue, at Laight Street, TriBeCa, (212) 966-4225. Like a younger Bonnie Raitt, Joan Osborne applies the lessons of blues and soul music -- directness, economy and a voice that can flirt and sob and sigh -- in songs about what she sees now, from lowlife to true love. Doors open at 9 P.M. on New Year's Eve; admission is $20. J. P.
 
Old Favorites
Elliott Sharp Trio, Nick and Eddie, 203 Spring Street, at Sullivan Street, SoHo, (212) 219-9090. Elliott Sharp on tenor saxophone and guitar, Dave Hofstra on bass and Bobby Previte on drums usually perform with downtown jazz and improvisational groups, including Carbon, the Microscopic Septet and the New York Composers Orchestra. For their annual New Year's Eve job, they relax with standards, rhythm-and-blues tunes and other non-avant-garde material. Show starts at 9:30 P.M. A four-course dinner with a Champagne toast is $75; reservations are required. At the bar, there is no cover or minimum. J. P.
 
Flo and Eddie
The Turtles, featuring Flo and Eddie, the Bottom Line, 15 West Fourth Street, at Mercer Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6300. Although the Turtles had pop hits like "Elenore" and "Happy Together," they never took rock too seriously, which may be why their singers, Howard Kayland and Mark Volman, nicknamed Flo and Eddie, moved on to work with Frank Zappa. They're likely to mix the oldies with jaundiced parodies of recent hits. On New Year's Eve, tickets are $25 for the 10 P.M. show, $16 for the 1 A.M. show. There are also shows on Wednesday, next Friday and Jan. 2 at 8 and 11 P.M.; tickets are $16. J. P.
 
Avant-Garde Fury
Diamanda Galas, the Village Gate, 160 Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-5120. The Persephone of avant-garde music continues her reports from the underworld with a show that includes excerpts from her recent composition, "Judgment Day." If you thought heavy-metal singers could howl, you've never witnessed the fury of Galas. A very serious way to usher in the New Year. Show starts at 12:30 A.M. Tickets, at $30, include an open bar and buffet from 10 P.M. to 2 A.M. and are available at the box office or through Ticketmaster: (212) 307-7171. ANNE POWERS
 
Upbeat Diva
Ce Ce Peniston with Marky Mark and the Funky Bunch, the Palladium, 126 East 14th Street, East Village, (212) 473-7171. Ce Ce Peniston, a sunny-spirited diva, broke through with "Finally," a dance-floor smash that showed off her bright vocal tones against an irresistible, optimistic beat. Her show will probably be short (she's a diva, after all) but fun. As for Marky Mark, if you've walked past a billboard or bus-stop ad lately, you know what you'll get. This hip-hop pinup's music is secondary to his floor show, which isn't bad. Tickets are $40 in advance or $50 at the door and are available at the box office or through Ticketmaster: (212) 307-7171. Doors open at 9 P.M. The show starts at 12:30 A.M. A. P.
 
From the Clash
Big Audio Dynamite and Moby, Roseland, 239 West 52d Street, Manhattan, (212) 249-8870. The Clash's funkiest member, Mick Jones, grew out of punk rock into a love for British dance music, and he's making swell sounds out of what he's learned. B.A.D. II plays with techno but stays centered in sparkly guitar pop. Moby, the show's opener, is one of rave's pioneers, moving these days toward an ambient house sound that gives his creativity some breathing room. Doors open at 9, and the show starts at 10 P.M. Tickets are $35 in advance, $40 the day of the show, available through Ticketmaster: (212) 307-7171. A. P.
 
Anarchist Rock
The Mekons, Maxwell's, 1039 Washington Street, Hoboken, N.J., (201) 798-4064. A party with these British dance-hall punks and anarchist intellectuals always brings a tear to the eye and a new idea to the brain. The last few years have been hard for the Mekons, between record-company problems and personal differences among members, but the band has a new album coming out soon and, one hopes, a new lease on life. Anyway, they're always good for a drinking song. Doors open at 9:30 P.M., and the show starts at 10:30. Tickets are $30 and include a buffet and a Champagne toast; they can be purchased through Ticketron: (212) 307-7171. A. P.
 
Hard Rockabilly
Belmont Playboys, Louisiana Community Bar and Grill, 622 Broadway, at Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 460-9633. With slicked-back hair, tattoos, a bass painted with flames and an Elvisocentric attitude, the Belmont Playboys (from Belmont, N.C.) pump out high-powered rockabilly songs that never stop twanging. The show begins at midnight. A $30 dinner package includes a Champagne toast. Show tickets only, at $10, include one drink. J. P.
 
Sixties Excess
Blues Travelers/Chris Whitley, the Paramount, Seventh Avenue at 33d Street, Manhattan, (212) 465-6741. Like a bad acid flashback, Blues Traveler recreates the jejune excesses of 1960's blues-rock. While barefoot fans twirl, John Popper sings in a nasal whine, then spews hundreds of harmonica notes in endless, aimless jams. But Chris Whitley, sharing the bill, has learned the economy, pain and enigma of the blues; he sings in a hard-won voice and plays slide-guitar lines that make every note count. The Mad Hatters open at 9 P.M.; tickets are $30. J. P.

 
 
JAZZ
Acoustic Corea
Chick Corea, Hilton Ruiz and Koko Taylor, Blue Note, 131 West Third Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 475-0049. What a strange show! Chick Corea will be performing acoustically, and perhaps he'll show some of the musical ability for which he is best known. Koko Taylor is a blues shouter without a bit of subtlety, raw and overdriven, while Hilton Ruiz is a fine pianist who knows the difference between a mambo and a bossa nova, rare in jazz. The New Year's Eve shows are at 6 and 9:30 P.M. and 1:30 A.M. Tickets, including a four-course dinner, are $110 for the first show and $175 for the second; the third, which includes breakfast instead of dinner, is $90. P. W.
 
Piano Man
John Hicks, Bradley's, 70 University Place, Greenwich Village, (212) 228-6440. John Hicks, one of jazz's best pianists, will be joined by an exceptional rhythm section: Ray Drummond on bass and Idris Muhammad on drums. Expect absolutely refined, interactive music. The music starts at 9 P.M. Admission, including a five-course dinner, is $115. From 1 to 4 A.M., there is a $20 cover charge. P. W.
 
New Orleans Jazz
Dr. Michael White, Village Vanguard, 178 Seventh Avenue South, at Perry Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 255-4037. It's hard to imagine anything more festive than Dr. Michael White's band, which specializes in the raucous sounds of New Orleans polyphony. This is where one of the sounds of joy comes from in American music, and Dr. White does it better than most. Shows are at 9:30 and 11:30 P.M., and the cover is $40, with a $20 drink minimum. Cajun snacks are provided. P. W.
 
Trumpet Trip
Nat Adderley, Sweet Basil, 88 Seventh Avenue South, above Bleecker Street, Greenwich Village, (212) 242-1785. Nat Adderley, a gifted, smooth-toned trumpeter, always leads a fine band. He'll travel between elegance and intensity, and explosions are part of the musical landscape. The show starts at 9 P.M. and includes dinner and Champagne for $99. The last show starts at 1 A.M.; there is a $20 cover charge. P. W.
 
 
 
CABARET

 
Black Tie
 The Rainbow Room and Rainbow and Stars, 30 Rockefeller Center, 65th floor, (212) 632-5000. For those who can afford it, the complex of nightclubs atop Rockefeller Center offers the kind of Manhattan glamour that recalls a dreamy Astaire-Rogers fantasy of the Emerald City. At the Rainbow Room, Tommy Tune will perform in an evening of festivities that begins at 9 P.M. and includes a seven-course dinner and dancing to the Rainbow Room Orchestra, featuring Steven Davis and Claudette Sierra. At midnight, the debonair dancing star with the eternally boyish smile will lead a parade through the entire 65th floor of the complex. The price is $375 a person, not including tax, tip or beverages, and black tie is required. Rainbow and Stars will present "Make Someone Happy! The Jule Styne Revue," an uneven cabaret show featuring Ann Hampton Callaway, Gregg Edelman, David Garrison, Kay McClelland, Jay Leonhart and William Roy. The high points are Ms. Callaway's bravura performances of two songs from "Funny Girl." The evening, which starts at 9 P.M. and includes a five-course dinner, is $300 a person, not including tax, tip or beverages; black tie is required. At the Rainbow Pavilion, the Impalas, a late-50's doo-wop group, will perform. The evening, which includes a five-course dinner and continuous dancing, starts at 9 P.M. The cost is $300 a person, not including tax, tip or beverages. Black tie is required. STEPHEN HOLDEN
 
Jelly Roll Salute
"Vernel Bagneris Presents Jelly Roll Morton: A Me-morial," Michael's Pub, 211 East 55th Street, Manhattan, (212) 758-2272. Vernel Bagneris has created several shows saluting musicians from his native New Orleans. In the latest, he portrays the pioneering jazz pianist and composer, quoting from tapes that Morton recorded in 1938 for the Library of Congress and singing some Morton songs. The Norwegian pianist Morten Gunnar Larsen plays Morton's music beautifully. Shows are at 8:45 and 11:30 P.M. The cover charge is $25 for the early show and $35 for the late show, with a two-drink minimum at each. There is also an alternative prix fixe, dinner-and-show package at $65 for the early show and $85 for the late. S. H.
 
A Romantic
Andrea Marcovicci, the Oak Room at the Algonquin Hotel, 59 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 840-6800. Nobody embodies the modern woman as a romantic nostalgist -- and all the contradictions that implies -- more engagingly than Andrea Marcovicci, who is performing her special seasonal show, "Home for the Holidays," on New Year's Eve. Dinner is at 8, and the show is at 10 P.M. The price for dinner, the show and a Champagne toast is $160 a person, not including tax, tip and other beverages. S. H.
 
Torch Songs
Amanda McBroom, Russian Tea Room, 150 West 57th Street, Manhattan, (212) 265-0947.

Shows are at 10 P.M. and 1 A.M., and there is a $45 cover charge and a two-drink minimum. Earlier in the evening, at 7:30 P.M., Blossom Dearie, the jazz singer, pianist and songwriter, with a delicious wisp of a voice and an impeccable sense of swing, will perform.

Joined by Sam Greenfield as guest comedian, the troupe will look back at the year in skits inspired by audience suggestions. Expect nasty parting shots at the Bush Administration. New Year's Eve shows are at 8 and 10 P.M. Tickets are $20 for the early show and $30 for the late. There will be Champagne and a post-performance party for ticket holders to either show. S. H.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton's Last Selections for the Cabinet Reflect His Quest for Diversity

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR

 BODY:

Bruce Babbitt
Secretary of the Interior 
 Bruce Babbitt, the man President-elect Bill Clinton has chosen to be Secretary of the Interior, inherited his interest in the outdoors.
His forebears were frontier merchants in the canyon country of northern Arizona, and he is now president of the League of Conservation Voters.
Environmental groups rejoiced today at the selection of Mr. Babbitt, saying they could think of no one better qualified to serve as custodian of the nation's natural resources.
 
'Excellent Relationship'
 In Arizona, where he was Governor from March 1978 to January 1987, business executives spoke highly of Mr. Babbitt. Wayne M. Kaplan, a spokesman for the Arizona Public Service Company, the state's largest utility, said, "We've had an excellent working relationship with him."
Mr. Babbitt, who was also considered for the job of United States Trade Representative in the Clinton Administration, is fluent in Spanish and often expresses his concern about Washington's neglect of Latin America. His wife, Hattie, serves on the board of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. They have two sons.
Fred Krupp, executive director of the Environmental Defense Fund, said: "As Governor of Arizona, Bruce participated in a real campaign to crack down on the copper smelters. Few governors would have been so concerned about air pollution, the emerging acid rain problem, to make sure that modern technology was installed on each and every copper smelter. That removed a million tons of sulfur dioxide that would have been pouring into Western air every year."
Mr. Krupp described Mr. Babbitt as "a new-style leader who understands that economic and environmental concerns must be integrated."
 
Less Popular With Labor
 But Mr. Babbitt is less popular with organized labor, which harshly criticized his decision in 1983 to send the National Guard to a Phelps Dodge plant during a strike by the United Steelworkers union.
Mr. Babbitt, 54, graduated from the University of Notre Dame, where he studied geology, and from Harvard Law School. He sought the Democratic nomination for President in 1988 and was praised for discussing difficult issues, but his style was too thoughtful for most voters. He withdrew from the race after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses and sixth in the New Hampshire primary.
As a Presidential candidate, Mr. Babbitt provided a detailed accounting of his plans to reduce the Federal budget deficit. He had no use for political orthodoxy, and often stated his intention to impose a national sales tax, limit the deduction for home mortgage interest and eliminate some farm subsidies.
Mr. Babbitt is a partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, which has offices in Phoenix and Washington.

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton's Last Selections for the Cabinet Reflect His Quest for Diversity

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER

 BODY:

Mickey Kantor
Trade Representative 
 Mickey Kantor, President-elect Bill Clinton's choice to become the next United States Trade Representative, will be the latest of several people who have taken the job with very little background in trade issues.
Mr. Kantor, a longtime friend of Mr. Clinton, was the chairman of Mr. Clinton's election campaign and had been widely expected to receive a Cabinet position as a political reward.
His views on trade, if any, are a mystery to people who have worked with Mr. Kantor, and his brief speech at a news conference in Little Rock, Ark., today was devoted to thanking friends and political supporters.
Robert M. Strauss and Bill Brock, who took the job after successful tours as party chairmen, as well as Carla A. Hills, the former Secretary for Housing and Urban Development who currently holds the job, also had modest experience in trade issues when they took the office.
 
Partner in Law Firm
 Mr. Kantor, a partner at Manatt, Phelps, Phillips & Kantor in Los Angeles, heads a small group of lawyers who specialize in representing corporations before state and local regulators of air quality, transportation and other issues. George D. Kieffer, a partner at the law firm, said Mr. Kantor had done little if any work for foreign clients.
But Manatt, Phelps has registered with the Justice Department as a paid lobbyist for the NEC Corporation, based in Tokyo. NEC is one of the world's largest electronics companies.
Mr. Kieffer said he did not know of any work Mr. Kantor had done for NEC, which is a client of the firm's Washington office. Facing a comparable situation, Mrs. Hills removed herself for one year after taking office from all issues handled by her former colleagues at the law firm of Weil, Gotshal & Manges.
One of the first trade issues to face the Clinton Administration next year will be a review in March of whether Japan has met a target of buying 20 percent of its semiconductor chips from foreign companies. If Mr. Kantor removes himself because of NEC's position in the semiconductor industry, his deputy would have to make what is sure to be a politically sensitive decision on whether to retaliate if Japanese purchases fall short.
Mr. Kantor will enter an Administration with no shortage of trade experts. Laura D'Andrea Tyson, Mr. Clinton's choice to head the Council of Economic Advisers, and Robert B. Reich, who has been named Labor Secretary, both advocate a greater role by the Government in helping high-technology industries that face subsidized foreign competitors.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Zones Of Freedom

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
Now that Bill Clinton has his foreign policy team in place he owes himself, the country and the world one thing more: a foreign policy that will strengthen and extend the zones of freedom.
It is in the zones of freedom that people can walk free, talk, worship and vote free. That condition of life would be sufficient reason for the United States to adopt more and stronger zones of freedom -- also known as human rights and democracy -- as its foreign policy goal. 
 All right, idealism. Americans often act as if they were embarrassed by the word. But, put to them plainly and in embraceable cause, they accept it. Else, why the long fight against fascism and Communism -- and why in heaven would American marines now be in Somalia?
But there is another important reason. Zones of freedom usually are zones of peace -- a phrase recently used at Yale by outgoing Under Secretary of Defense Paul D. Wolfowitz.
Nations living under the protection of democracy and human rights do not go to war with each other. Idealism plus self-interest equals democratic realism -- the equation for liberty and peace.
In the 1992 campaign the Presidential candidates did their best to convince Americans that jobs, jobs, jobs were more important than freedom, freedom, freedom. Yes, the economy is essential and of course an economically weak America can't help the world.
But those truisms became puffed up to a moral philosophy. They are neither moral nor a philosophy. Economic policy can cost or save jobs. Foreign policy costs or saves lives. History knows the difference, as do mourners.
Here on the desk is a fat pile of statements and speeches that show Mr. Clinton knows too -- his comments on Communist Chinese brutality, Haitian refugees, the genocide in Bosnia, tyranny in the Middle East, arms control, Somalia, so on.
They are sophisticated and compassionate comments; interesting how often the two are inseparable. But they are a foundation, not a building.
The very fact that Mr. Clinton is untested in foreign affairs makes his own imprint and leadership essential. Neither America nor the world will jump to attention to a fax from the State Department.
Going in, Mr. Clinton has one great advantage -- the fall of Communism. Now all he has to do is devise a policy that will deal with outbreaks of genocide, starvation, religious massacres, the breakup of the Soviet empire into nationalities bound by mutual detestation, international terrorism, militant Islamic fundamentalists and the approaching acquisition of nuclear power by Mideast dictatorships.
In all this, the American people have more than a glancing interest. But diplomatic and intelligence specialists already warn him against candor.
Diplomatic secrets are important -- occasionally. But secretiveness is something else -- a distorted mind-set that comes out of distrust of the public and a conviction that diplomats, unlike other human beings, have the right to cover up their actions and mistakes.
Like, for instance, the buildup of Iraq and Iran and the current itch to make Syria respectable.
Mr. Clinton knew the public could understand economic policy. It is time for him to let some fresh air into foreign policy.
To start with, a public roundtable on foreign affairs, chaired by Mr. Clinton, would help the country understand where it is going and why.
Democratic realism does not mean automatic intervention. The idea is to win ground, not lose it in senseless or doomed action.
The country, for example, has the right to hear from Mr. Clinton and his appointees precisely how far they are ready to go in Yugoslavia. Is the goal to save Bosnian lives, which is morally imperative, or also the current boundaries of Bosnia, which is not?
Inside the State Department, the Bureau of Human Rights needs a chief who has already made a name in the field -- like Joshua Muravchik, who wrote the important book "Exporting Democracy." And it has to be involved in the economic and political policies that decide whether human rights flourish.
The Inauguration Day speech approaches. Now, that would be a fine time for Mr. Clinton to begin fulfilling as President the hope he held out as candidate -- to nourish the zones of freedom.

HEADLINE: Ask Episcopal Church About Women Priests

 BODY:
To the Editor:
My old friend Rembert Weakland, Roman Catholic Archbishop of Milwaukee, seems to read the Catholic Church amiss in "Out of the Kitchen, Into the Vatican" (Op-Ed, Dec. 6), his plea for admitting women to the priesthood. I suspect this is due to his overweening romanticism regarding modern culture -- political, academic, economic, journalistic. The program he advocates for his church is to embrace this culture, learn from it and follow it. 
 Mainline Protestant churches have tried this program for years, including ordination of women, egalitarian diversification of ministries and genial regard of the Zeitgeist. All these churches find themselves in moderate to steep membership declines. There is no evidence that this program would have different results in the Catholic Church.
If the Episcopal Church is any model, ordaining women has not checked the slide in membership. Women's ordination has increased the number of members of the clergy, who minister to parishes that are getting smaller.
This may create a new sort of clericalism, a malaise that seems to follow when the clergy becomes overnumerous in relation to the laity. Having less to do, the clergy engages in make-work that ends in driving everyone crazy.
God knows that the Roman Catholic Church has its problems. But it does not need to add problems like these. Such distractions would lead a church deeply aware of an ecumenical mission with the Orthodox and other Eastern Churches, a mission rooted in the core of the Gospel, very far afield.

HEADLINE: INVESTING;
Hedging Currency Risk In World Income Funds

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
CONSERVATIVE investors fleeing their low-yielding certificates of deposit and money markets discovered this fall that foreign bond and income funds make flimsy shelters once the currency wars begin to rage. In several funds, European devaluations wiped out the year's income. But can those willing to brave some monetary skirmishes still capture generous foreign yields and the gains that are likely as those yields fall?
The key might be to find a fund that hedges some of the exchange risk, or invests in the most stable currencies, without giving away all the higher returns. 
 Foreign yields remain impressive: the overnight German Government rate is about 8.75 percent; the Federal funds rate in the United States is 3 percent. The gap narrows at most longer maturities but remains significant.
Money managers and economists generally agree that the dollar will strengthen next year -- against European currencies most of all -- because the yield differences will diminish. The recovery's progress in the United States will keep interest rates from falling even as recessions abroad, especially in Europe, cause central banks to lower their interest rates.
Foreign bond prices would rise where yields fall, but investors would respond by seeking higher yields in other countries. The resulting currency weakness could destroy capital gains in bond funds, or cause net losses in the short-term income funds where any capital gains would be slight.
"Real yields are at their best when the currency is at its most vulnerable," said Robert Beckwitt, who runs the Fidelity Asset Manager Fund.
Bearing him out, those funds that paid the highest yields the last 12 months also tended to have the lowest total returns. Many invested in the riskiest, highest-yielding currencies or failed to hedge their exchange rates.
In the Lipper Analytical Services ranking of 34 short-term world income funds, the top five in total returns, averaging 7.59 percent, had an average yield of 7.52 percent. The bottom five had an average yield of 9.3 percent, but suffered losses averaging 9.34 percent. Same as in the United States, the highest yields carry the highest risks.
Traders and money managers have a full repertory of tricks for protecting themselves against such currency losses: swaps, options, forward contracts and so forth.
But just as most skiers who watch hot dog films of grinning showoffs plunging over cliffs and turning flips shouldn't try these stunts themselves, playing the currency markets is only for professionals. Even if you guess the trends correctly, the transaction costs will be as bruising as a bad fall.
The problem is that even for the pros, the cost of totally hedging a fund's returns back into the dollar would consume the foreign currency's yield advantage. Most managers therefore use only partial, imperfect hedges to lower their costs, hedging weaker currencies against stronger ones rather than against the dollar.
How partial? Anyone who can readily figure that out deserves a job managing a foreign income fund. "It would be very difficult for an outsider to judge," said John Markese, president of the American Assocation of Individual Investors.
Those funds that don't hedge at all usually say so. Most foreign stock funds are fully exposed to local currencies, figuring that for steady, long-term investors the monetary bumps will matter less than the direction of the stocks.
Income and bond funds wisely give themselves some latitude. Bond funds do somewhat less hedging than income funds, because bonds often appreciate enough in value to offset the currency losses resulting from lower interest rates.
But even a close reading, calculator in hand, of prospectuses and annual reports might leave doubt about what a fund is doing at the moment.
Mr. Markese supplemented his reading with telephone calls to the funds and still came up with only general descriptions of hedging practices in many cases. Some Fidelity funds said they would hedge only up to 25 percent; some T. Rowe Price funds up to 50 percent.
A bulletproof vest, though heavy on the back, might prove its value in a riot zone, and likewise a fund bears some burdens to deflect currency market crossfire. For such protection, Thomas J. Berger, manager of the Blanchard Short-Term Global Income Fund is spending more than 2 percent. His $1.3 billion fund has still delivered returns of 3.76 percent this year, eighth best out of 34 on the Lipper list.
Some funds shield themselves instead by concentrating in currencies that have been fairly stable or buying foreign securities denominated in dollars. Others -- often called asset-allocation and global, rather than international, funds -- have the authority to balance foreign holdings with investments in the United States.
The $3.2 billion Fidelity Asset Manager Fund uses all these methods. It currently has only a 32 percent share in bonds, stocks and money market instruments in foreign currencies, another 10 percent in foreign securities denominated in dollars.
Mr. Beckwitt, the fund's manager, is hedging 80 percent of his European currency exposure and concentrating the rest of his foreign investments in countries, including Mexico and Japan, that he believes present little exchange-rate risk. In the 12 months through Nov. 30, the fund delivered a healthy total return of 15.31 percent.
Most individual investors balance their foreign and domestic holdings themselves. But when the shooting starts in currency markets, it can pay to have some battle-hardened protectors.

'Maxed' Charge Cards And Other Red Flags

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
"DO you know what the No. 1 sport in America is?" Jerry Mason, a professor of consumer economics at Texas Tech University in Lubbock, likes to ask.
"Football," says one student. "Baseball," says another.
"No, it's going to the mall," Dr. Mason replies. "People want that lift they get from buying something." 
 He has another question. "How many people do you know who have a two-car garage who actually have both cars in the garage?" His point: Americans are acquisitive; closets and garages are full of impulse purchases, many unused. For many "credit cards are maxed out," and creditors are demanding payment -- particularly during the holidays.
Scott Simpson, a financial consultant for Minneapolis-based Employee Advisory Resources, which serves 550 corporate clients with 950,000 employees, confirmed the trend.
"Bankruptcies are up, and the size of credit-card debt has gone up," he said. "It used to be $30,000 or $40,000 was high. Now we are seeing people with $60,000 -- even $100,000 on 10, 20 even 30 credit cards from all levels of employment -- managers and vice presidents of companies down through the rank and file."
They and other experts interviewed cited a number of reasons for consumers' growing debt. Layoffs and salary freezes have left many short of cash, worsened in many cases by big home mortgages taken out in better times. But fundamentally, they said, people simply lack the knowledge for handling ready credit and get overextended, often to salve emotional needs.
"Financial literacy is very low," said Prof. Tahira K. Hira of Iowa State University in Ames. "The point is not how much money you have; it is how you manage it. I have seen highly educated people -- lawyers, doctors, top executives -- and they are spending more than they earn."
Dr. Mason, at the request of the Association for Financial Planning and Counseling Education, has developed a program to certify financial counselors who can help people get back on their feet financially. He listed 10 financial danger signs:
*Making only minimum payments on credit cards.
*Getting cash advances on your credit cards to pay off other debts.
*Buying groceries on credit.
*Having no money left after paying the month's bills.
*Going shopping if you're bored or depressed -- particularly on credit.
*Requesting higher credit card limits regularly.
*Seeking a debt consolidation loan.
*Not opening creditors' letters.
*Drawing repeatedly on a home-equity line of credit.
*Having wages garnished.
Professor Mason also suggested several steps for people who glimpse themselves in this profile. "The first step is to log credit cards like checks," he said. "If you don't know the balance in your check register or what you've charged, then you can pretend there's not a problem, the old head-in-the-sand approach."
Once people list their charges, "if you can see you are not going to be able to make a payment, talk to your creditors beforehand and work something out -- an extended deadline or a reduced payment," he said. "It is so much better than to miss the payment and have them come after you."
Many people will need help, he noted, either professional help from a counselor or support from a group like Debtors Anonymous, P.O. Box 20322, New York, N.Y. 10025-9992. Telephone (212) 642-8220.
Dr. Hira warned, however, that people should avoid so-called credit repair services that charge high fees. Employee assistance programs and nonprofit counseling services are good sources of help.

Second-to-Die Policies
 
Q I have heard that it is possible to convert a life insurance policy into a survivorship policy for a much larger sum and not add much to the premium. Is this true and what are the advantages of such a policy?
 
 GEORGE FOWLKES, MANHATTAN. 
 A With a survivorship life insurance policy, also known as second-to-die life insurance, you can generally buy more insurance for the same premium than you can with a policy on one person's life, said Jerome Trupin, an insurance consultant with Trupin Insurance Services in White Plains. The reason: The risk to the insurance company is reduced because proceeds are due only on the second death. "However, if you want to provide funds for your survivors to live on, you are gambling that they won't need it until the second death," he added.
 According to Mr. Trupin, survivorship insurance may be appropriate when a husband and wife are concerned about their estate tax situation.
 "Because of the unlimited marital deduction, there is no estate tax due on the death of the first spouse to die if everything passes to the other spouse." he said. "On the death of the second spouse, though, an estate tax will be due."
 
Foreclosure and Eviction
 
Q What is the difference between foreclosure and eviction?
 
 RANDI PORTNOY, QUEENS.
A "An eviction is an action taken by a landlord to require the removal of a tenant," said Irwin Landes, a partner in the New York law firm of Bower & Gardner. Such an step is usually enforced by a sheriff or marshal when a court orders it.
 On the other hand, a foreclosure is an action brought by a lender against an owner of a property, generally for failure to pay money due under a mortgage. "After a foreclosure is completed, the usual result is an eviction by the new owner who bought the property at the foreclosure sale, who is very often the lender," Mr. Landes noted.
 
Review Your Exemptions
 
Q When will the reduced withholding of Federal income taxes that started this year end?
 
 DAN WEIL, HOBOKEN, N.J.
A On March 1, 1992, the Federal tax tables were revised to more closely reflect the actual tax of many lower- and middle-income wage earners. David S. Rhine, a partner at BDO Seidman, a certified public accounting firm, said that "the purpose was to give many taxpayers more money up front, rather than have to wait for their refund. It was not a reduction of taxes, it was a reduction of money withheld."
Mr. Rhine pointed out that this withholding change does not really end, in the sense that it does not have a cutoff date. "It will be an ongoing procedure, although the withholding will be adjusted on Jan. 1, 1993, to reflect the inflation adjustments that take effect as of that date, such as the deduction for personal exemptions," he said. At any rate, year-end is always a good time to review the number of exemptions you take on your W-4 Form in relation to your anticipated refund or tax liability.

HEADLINE: As Foreign Investment Rises, Vietnam Wants the U.S. Back

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HO CHI MINH CITY, Vietnam

 BODY:
At a meeting in November with a delegation of American Senators, Vietnamese officials interrupted the conversation to offer their guests a glass of what is now Vietnam's most popular soft drink: Coca-Cola. The Senators took small sips. The Vietnamese gulped it down.
In a sign of how the free market has begun to take hold here -- and of the willingness of Vietnamese to embrace even the most potent symbols of American capitalism -- Coca-Cola, Pepsi, 7-Up and Sprite are being sold openly almost everywhere in Vietnam, north and south, city and countryside, smuggled in across the porous border from Cambodia. 
 Far from discouraging the purchase of American-brand soft drinks, the Vietnamese Government has begun buying them by the caseload for official celebrations.
"Why don't the Americans come back?" asked Tran Dien, who hawks American soft drinks on a street corner of Ho Chi Minh City, still known by its residents as Saigon and now the bustling if decrepit center of Vietnam's increasingly free market. "The war is over. The Vietnamese want the Americans to return."
If the 17-year-old American trade embargo is lifted, foreign economists and bankers say, Vietnam could be on the verge of an economic boom that will end its sad distinction as one of the world's most impoverished nations.
[In a significant easing of the embargo, the Bush Administration said last week that it would permit American companies to sign contracts to do business in Vietnam. The move came after Vietnam pledged to expand its cooperation in determining the fate of Americans still listed as missing from the Vietnam War.]
 
Economic Boon Possible
 Vietnamese leaders appear to understand that the transformation of Vietnam into something other than an economic basket case will take years, and in a demonstration of utter pragmatism by a group of aging men who spent much of their lives at war with the United States, they are now eager for American trade and investment.
Impressed by Vietnam's commitment to the free market and by the diligent, well-educated and low-wage work force, foreign investors from outside the United States who had once been intimidated by the American embargo are now simply ignoring it.
In the first eight months of 1992, the total value of new foreign investment projects was $1.8 billion, more than in all of last year, with Taiwanese and Hong Kong investors in the forefront.
The Japanese Government announced in November that it would resume development aid to Vietnam, which some large Japanese corporations took as a signal that they could begin long-delayed investments. All nine of Japan's major trading corporations have opened offices in Vietnam in recent years.
 
Fear of Being Shut Out
 What frightens American business people is the thought that the Vietnamese economy might take off so quickly -- even before the embargo is lifted -- that they would be left behind, forever shut out of a market of about 70 million people that many consider the last great business opportunity in Southeast Asia.
"We think the American embargo should be lifted right now," said Frank Martin, president of the American Chamber of Commerce in Hong Kong. "One of our major concerns has been that other countries might get into Vietnam before we did and would get a foothold. Well, the fact is that the other countries are there."
Increasingly American business people like Mr. Martin seem willing to press for an end to the embargo even if that means a public feud with the families of American troops still unaccounted for from the war.
A number of families believe that the embargo is the only way of insuring Vietnam's cooperation in determining the fate of the 2,265 Americans still listed as missing, and they say they are not convinced that Vietnam will live up to a recent pledge to open up its war archives to Pentagon investigators.
 
Non-U.S. Companies Active
 "In some areas, it's already too late for the U.S. companies," said Eugene A. Matthews, an American lawyer who lives in Hanoi. Although officially listed in Government records as a Vietnamese-language student, Mr. Matthews spends much of his time outside of class working as a business consultant for foreign clients interested in Vietnam. He pointed to Vietnamese telecommunications contracts and offshore oil leases that had already been locked up by non-American companies.
John Brinsden, the country manager for Vietnam for the Standard Chartered Bank of Britain, said that even if the Americans investors were to rush in now, "they would face a daunting challenge in Vietnam -- they are a long way behind."
Mr. Brinsden said American businesses should nevertheless take heart from Vietnamese history, which suggests that the Vietnamese will do what they can to prevent domination of the economy by Japan and other Asian nations.
"The Vietnamese have survived by playing big powers off against each other, and I believe they look at the United States as the only power capable of preventing a Japanese juggernaut," Mr. Brinsden said. He said the Vietnamese might have set aside some promising business deals for American investors.
 
Effect of Embargo
 The embargo, imposed after North Vietnamese forces defeated the Saigon Government in 1975, cut off not only the legal supply of American goods but also aid from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund and other international lending agencies.
Coupled with decades of incompetent centralized planning, the embargo had the effect intended by Washington, and Vietnam's war-shattered economy has only now begun to recover.
The per capita annual income in Vietnam today is estimated at less than $200. Malnutrition remains severe in stretches of northern and central Vietnam, and whatever the sudden wealth of many residents of Ho Chi Minh City, visitors to the city are often swarmed by families of homeless beggars.
In 1986, the Vietnamese Government introduced a series of economic changes that were devised to promote private enterprise while keeping Vietnam's authoritarian and still avowedly Marxist Government in place. The reforms had much in common with those begun earlier in China.
Six years later, the Vietnamese economy is now sufficiently resilient that it managed to show modest growth in 1991 -- slightly more than 2 percent -- despite the cutoff of hundreds of millions of dollars a year in assistance from the former Soviet Union, long Vietnam's chief benefactor.
 
Record Rice Crop Expected
 The Government also appears to have tamed hyperinflation. After years of near-famine condition, this year's rice crop, the staple of the Vietnamese diet, is expected to set records.
Investment in Vietnam remains a enormous risk, not least because of the nation's crumbling infrastructure and because of extensive corruption among Government officials. "What once could be had with a fifth of Chivas Regal now takes a bribe of $5,000," a Western businessman said. Thousands of Government workers and Communist Party cadre have been jailed in recent years on corruption charges.
Under rules set by the Bush Administration, American companies can send representatives to Vietnam to make contact with Government officials, but with very limited exceptions, the Americans cannot invest or sell their products here.
The representatives are not even permitted to use American credit cards to pay their hotel bills, forcing them to enter the country with stacks of $100 bills, since virtually all large cash transactions must be carried out in American dollars.
Several American corporations have been aggressively courting the Vietnamese in the hope that they will eventually be allowed to do business here.
Last spring, Delta Air Lines played host in the United States to the general director of Vietnam Airlines, Nguyen Hong Nhi, a former MIG-23 fighter pilot who was credited with shooting down several American jets in the war.
He was taken to Atlanta, where he toured Delta's headquarters, and to Orlando, Fla., where he visited Disney World. Delta, United and Northwest Airlines are also thought likely to bid for Vietnamese routes if the embargo is lifted.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company is one of a handful of companies that are being allowed to do business with the Vietnamese. In November the company was permitted by the Bush Administration to sign an agreement to establish direct telecommunication links between Vietnam and the United States.
 
Billboards Light the Rive
 Along the shore of the languorous Saigon River, which snakes through the center of Ho Chi Minh City, brightly lit billboards advertise the names of companies that are already in Vietnam in force -- Sony, Panasonic, Aiwa.
"The signs are very useful because they light our path on the river at night," said a 42-year-old fisherman, a former South Vietnamese soldier who was placed in a Communist re-education camp for four years after the North Vietnamese takeover. He asked that his name not be used because "I don't need more trouble."
"The Americans companies should put up their signs, too," he said as his boat passed another billboard along the river bank, this one for Toshiba.
"Everybody wants to forget the war," he said. "Americans should come to Saigon and try to think of Vietnam without always thinking about the war."

HEADLINE: Jordan Feels Change Within As Muslims Pursue Agenda

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: AMMAN, Jordan

 BODY:
Haifa Melhes, the highest-ranking woman in Jordan's Education Ministry, sits in her large office with not much to do except light one cigarette after another.
In 1989, after Mrs. Melhes's 23-year career brought her to the position of the ministry's director of cultural affairs, the Muslim fundamentalist who had been named to head the ministry gave her job to a male colleague because, he told her, he opposed "women holding leadership roles" in society. 
 The official, Abdallah al-Akayra, a leading figure in Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood, has since been replaced.
But during Mr. Akayra's six-month tenure as the Education Minister, he also segregated men and women in the ministry and boys and girls in schools. He banned fathers from school functions involving girls, including their own daughters, Jordanians say, and ordered that veils be drawn on women portrayed in children's textbooks. And although some of those edicts have lapsed, dozens of Mr. Akayra's appointees are still managing curriculums, textbooks and other administrative sectors.
Jordanians say that though Mr. Akayra's tenure was brief, the effects of his stewardship are likely to reverberate through the nation's education system for a considerable time, showing how Jordan's fundamentalists are changing the face of the nation from the schools right up to the office of King Hussein, the Jordanian leader.
And, Mr. Akayra's decisions illustrate another point: While many Egyptian and Algerian Muslim fundamentalists are engaged in a daily all-out armed confrontation with their Governments, Jordan's Muslim strategists have taken a different tack, building abroad economic, educational, political and social edifice they hope will "ripen" until the nation falls into their lap as peacefully as a fruit off a tree.
Leading that effort is the Muslim Brotherhood, known by its Arabic name, Al Ikhwan Al Muslimin. The group was founded in Egypt in the early 1930's and has grown to be the largest pan-Arab fundamentalist group, an organization active in Egypt, the Sudan, Algeria, Tunisia, Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, as well as in the United States and Western Europe.
By far the group's biggest success to date with the politics of accommodation rather than confrontation appears to be in Jordan. Without firing a shot, Jordan's Muslim Brotherhood, a large umbrella group, has won control of 34 of the 80 seats in Jordan's Parliament, to become the biggest bloc in the legislature.
When Jordan's voters decided to express such support for fundamentalist candidates in the election in November 1989, they reflected two trends common in other Arab countries: first, a loss of faith in those who have ruled over the last three decades, and second, the hope that men of the Muslim Brotherhood, who present themselves as men of religion, may prove more committed to social justice and the more equitable distribution of wealth, ending official corruption that has reached epidemic proportions in many Arab countries, rich or poor.
 
Groundwork Laid Long Ago
 The Muslim Brotherhood in Jordan, as elsewhere in the Islamic world, has always portrayed itself as the mainstream, reasonable branch of Islamic fundamentalism, as opposed to a wide range of newer Islamic groupings, many of them with younger members, who took hostages in Beirut or legitimized killing Christians in Egypt.
The fundamentalist movement in Jordan has two main strains: the Brotherhood, which has always advocated establishing Islamic governments that would rule according to Islamic law, and Hamas, which works with the brotherhood but is primarily concerned with the Israeli role in the occupied territories and draws its strength from Jordan's large Palestinian population.
The electoral gains are only part of the brotherhood's accomplishment. Throughout this country of 4 million, the Brotherhood is running some 20 Islamic clinics, one of Amman's largest hospitals, well over 40 Islamic schools, some 150 Koranic studies centers and other elements of what anti- fundamentalists call "the infrastructure of an Islamic republic."
The brotherhood has worked hard to keep those institutions independent of the Government or of outside aid. For example, the hospital severely restricts the amount of charitable service it gives, insisting on full payment from patients who are able to pay, in the interests of preserving its solvency and profits.
Fundamentalist schools, likewise, draw on the strength of the middle class rather than reaching out for the poor, making them, like other Islamic institutions in Jordan, able to withstand even crises like the withdrawal of support from rich fundamentalist Arabs in the wake of Jordan's decision to side with Iraq during the Persian Gulf war.
While the first strong display of the group's power came in the elections in 1989, the groundwork had been laid long ago.
"It is not a secret that the Muslim Brotherhood started charitable works in Jordan as far back as 1965 with medical, educational and social services," says Ziyad Abughneima, a spokesman for the Brotherhood. Ibrahim Ghosha, from Hamas, estimates that hard-core Muslim fundamentalist group members range from 15,000 to 20,000, making fundamentalists the best-organized group in the country, with their considerable political support shown by the voting.
Further, over the years, the Brotherhood has succeeded in placing many of its people in the ministries of education, social development and public services. And although the King replaced the Cabinet that included Mr. Akayra and several other fundamentalist ministers after a few short months, largely because of the growing outcry about fundamentalist influence, those officials' legacies live on.
"Jordan to us is the center of many hopes in the future," said Hamza Mansour, a member of the Islamic bloc of 34 deputies in Jordan's Parliament.
Not too far from where Mrs. Melhes sits in the Ministry of Education office, Dr. Ali Hawamdeh, director of the Islamic Hospital of Amman, a man with the look of a harassed executive, manages a smile when he ticks off statistics: 200,000 admissions in 1991, compared with 2,000 in 1982, when it opened; 53,000 births in 1991, compared with fewer than 300 in 1982, and more than half a million patients treated last year, compared with a few more than 1,000 when the hospital got started.
Dr. Hawamdeh, who is a senior official of the Muslim Brotherhood and a member of Parliament, said: "My hospital is full. My schools are many. But still every day we must win more friends, more clients and more acquaintances."
 
Tricky Situation For Jordan's King
 While Jordan's other political parties have been banned since the late 50's, the Brotherhood, registered as a charitable organization, has been free to organize its followers with nearly unrestricted access to mosques that serve it as political pulpits.
Muslim brothers say they agreed to play by democratic rules, but they do not hesitate to say that theirs is the rule of God and cannot be confused with the rule of man.
Mr. Abughneima, who is a senior administrative official of the Islamic hospital, said: "We believe Islam represents the true order of things and anything else is a sin. At the moment, we approve of multi-partyism because we don't want anyone to say 'we didn't have room to work and only the Brotherhood could work.' "
One factor in the apparent success of the fundamentalist enterprise here is the role of King Hussein.
"The King sees Islamic democracy as the future," a senior Western diplomat said. "He no longer believes secularist governments have much future in the Arab world. So, the future lies in modernizing Islam."
While the King has voiced support for some Islamic role in Government, especially since the Persian Gulf war, it remains to be seen whether his embrace of some aspects of a fundamentalist role in politics have been motivated by genuine convictions or by self-preservation.
"If you repress, you cause paralysis in the society, which is what is happening in Algeria," said Mohammed Nazzal, a senior member of Hamas. "So the King knows that hitting fundamentalists will not lead to stopping them but may aggravate the crisis."
The social structure of Jordan also plays a role. In a small country where most people know each other or know about each other, the movement's leadership here is made up of aristocrats and rich businessmen, differing sharply from fundamentalist leaders in Algeria, Egypt and Tunisia, who tend to come more from the working classes.
That is so partly because Jordan has a higher standard of living than those other countries. Further, fundamentalism satisfies the deep frustration of many Palestinians and others who have felt impotence over Israel's role in the occupied territories.
The leaders' relatively high social status has many effects. One Western diplomat here noted that reactions by security forces to fundamentalists are not predictable under those circumstances.
"It is harder to shoot someone who went to school with you," the diplomat said.
 
Ripple Effect Of Muslim Moves
 Among foreign diplomats here, those of the older generation generally take the attitude that fundamentalism is a cancer that the King is moving too slowly to tackle. Younger diplomats argue that perhaps the West can co-exist with Islamic fundamentalists.
"They come in many stripes, you know, and quite a few are reasonable folks," said a first secretary at a Western embassy who insisted on not being identified.
Such talk sends shock waves through secularist middle classes, particularly among Jordan's 300,000 Christians. Some of them wonder if tolerance for them is running out and, as a result, are beginning to immigrate.
There is little doubt among many of the elite that Islamic fundamentalists will threaten the nation's relations with Israel and other nations who are also nervous about fundamentalism, as well as worsening Jordan's economic problems by expounding xenophobic, anti-Western attitudes that are expected to reduce the foreign aid on which the nation's economy depends.
But to turn the tide of fundamentalism means suspending the limited democracy practiced in Jordan, adopting a martial-law rule and arresting arbitrarily the entire leadership of the fundamentalist movement, steps that the King appears most reluctant to even consider.
And so, Mrs. Melhes, a Muslim woman who shuns the veil, still sits at her desk in the Education Ministry, lighting cigarette after cigarette. While her door stands partly open, hardly anyone consults her about anything, and her solace is to pour out her bitterness about fundamentalists. She has been given back her salary and an office, as well as the title of consultant to the minister, but she does not have much of a job.
"There is a multiplier effect to these changes," said Mrs. Melhes, explaining that the ripple effect of the ouster of her and her subordinates brought fundamentalists or their sympathizers about 15 jobs on down the line from hers. "The Ministry of Education is the first line of defense in any country because it graduates people who go on to be army officers, security officials and other leaders of society. If you organize the schools along fundamentalist lines, you are already directing society."

HEADLINE: Tickets? Supply Meets Demand on Sidewalk

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
Ticket scalping has been very good to Kevin Thomas, and he makes no apologies. He sees himself as a classic American entrepreneur: a high-school dropout from the Bronx who taught himself a trade, works seven nights a week, earns $40,000 a year, and at age 26 has $75,000 in savings, all by providing a public service outside New York's theaters and sports arenas.
He has just one complaint. "I've been busted about 30 times in the last year," he said one recent evening, after making $280 at a Knicks game. "You learn to deal with it -- I give the cops a fake name, and I pay the fines when I have to, but I don't think it's fair. I look at scalping like working as a stockbroker, buying low and selling high. If people are willing to pay me the money, what kind of problem is that?" 
 It is a significant problem to public officials in New York and New Jersey, who are cracking down on street scalpers like Mr. Thomas and on licensed ticket brokers. Undercover officers are enforcing new restrictions on reselling tickets at marked-up prices, and the attorneys general of the two states are pressing well-publicized cases against more than a dozen ticket brokers.
But economists tend to see scalping from Mr. Thomas's perspective. To them, the governments' efforts make about as much sense as the old Communist campaigns against "profiteering." Economists argue that the restrictions inconvenience the public, reduce the audience for cultural and sports events, waste the time of the police, deprive New York City of tens of millions of dollars of tax revenue, and drive up the cost of many tickets.
"It is always good politics to pose as the defender of the poor by declaring high prices illegal," said William J. Baumol, the director of the C. V. Starr Center for Applied Economics at New York University. "I expect politicians to try to solve the AIDS crisis by declaring AIDS illegal. That would be harmless, because nothing would happen, but when you outlaw high prices you create real problems."
Dr. Baumol was one of the economists who came up with the idea of selling same-day Broadway tickets for half price at the TKTS booth in Times Square, which theater owners thought dangerously radical when the booth opened in 1973. But the owners have profited by finding a new clientele for tickets that would have gone unsold, an illustration of the free-market tenet that both buyers and sellers ultimately benefit when price is adjusted to meet demand.
Economists see another illustration of that lesson at the Museum of Modern Art, where people wait in line for up to two hours to buy tickets for the Matisse exhibit. But there is an alternative on the sidewalk: scalpers have been selling the $12.50 tickets at prices ranging from $20 to $50.
"You don't have to put a very high value on your time to pay $10 or $15 to avoid standing in line for two hours," said Richard H. Thaler, an economist at Cornell University. "Some people think it's fairer to make everyone stand in the line, but that forces everyone to engage in a totally unproductive activity, and it discriminates in favor of people who have the most free time. Scalping gives other people a chance, too."
 
Moved Out of State
 The more interesting question, economists say, is why scalping is considered so abhorrent. Other businesses can resell products for whatever the market will bear. Airline executives do not get arrested for charging hefty premiums to customers who buy tickets at the last minute.
But state lawmakers have driven the ticket brokering business out of New York City by limiting brokers' surcharges to either $5 a ticket or 10 percent of the face value. The restrictions, which were strengthened last year, have sent most scalpers to two refuges: the black market and the suburbs beyond the state line.
The black market includes scalpers who operate out of their homes, using newspaper advertisements to sell tickets, and perhaps 200 regular street scalpers like Mr. Thomas. He said that he buys some tickets from the box office and licensed brokers, and some from players on professional sports teams and other insiders with house seats, but most often from fans on the day of the event.
"There's always people with extra tickets," he said. "I work the sidewalks and the parking lots. I got to watch for the plainclothes cops, too. If you see one around, you can't make a sale -- that would be disrespectful. You got to show respect."
 
At Least $100 a Day
 Mr. Thomas said that he made at least $100 a day for three hours' work. At a sold-out event, he typically sells tickets for two or three times their face value. He said his most profitable work was at the United States Open tennis championship, where he once sold a $40 ticket for $800.
"Scalping is a good living," he said, "but you got to remember that we take risks and provide better service than the box office. If you've got bad seats, we'll upgrade you. Sometimes when the game's not sold out, we're selling seats for less than the box office -- I'll buy a $15 ticket for $5 and sell it for $10. And sometimes I get stuck with tickets I can't sell."
Some licensed brokers operate in New York, ignoring the state limit on mark-ups, but most brokers prefer the suburbs of New Jersey and Connecticut. There they have evaded New York's law, as well as similar anti-scalping laws in New Jersey and Connecticut by using mail services and messengers to deliver tickets to out-of-state customers. They insist that such interstate commerce is not subject to state regulations.
"It's a stupid situation," said Keith Levinson, a broker in Greenwich, Conn. "I live in New York, I sell tickets to New York customers for events in New York, but I have to commute to Connecticut every day to do business. Ticket brokering is estimated to be a $300 million-a-year local business, and New York is passing up the chance to collect sales taxes and wage taxes on it."
 
Cracking Down
 Operating in Connecticut, Mr. Levinson has not been safe from the authorities. This year New York and New Jersey independently began trying to enforce laws against out-of-state brokers who sell tickets to their residents. Mr. Levinson's company, the American Ticket Exchange, was 1 of 11 companies charged with violating New Jersey's law against marking up tickets more than 20 percent.
The cases in New Jersey were brought an undercover investigator for the State Division of Consumer Affairs bought $28.50 tickets to Bruce Springsteen concerts at prices ranging from $50 to $350. In announcing the prosecutions, Attorney General Robert J. Del Tufo vowed to "bring down the price of tickets to New Jersey events by stopping the unfair pricing structure caused by ticket scalpers."
Last summer Attorney General Robert Abrams of New York announced suits against two brokers from New Jersey and Connecticut who were accused of illegally marking up sports and concert tickets. In October a similar suit was filed against another Connecticut broker.
The New York cases are pending, as are all but 2 of the 11 in New Jersey. The two New Jersey brokers settled by paying fines of $30,000 and $35,000. As they await trial, the brokers argue that they are being persecuted to satisfy popular prejudice.
The prejudice reflects a basic mistrust people have for the free market -- a distrust that seems at least as prevalent in New York as in Moscow, said Robert Shiller, an economist at Yale University. In a recent survey of residents of both cities, he asked them whether allowing speculators to buy up supplies of grain would make shortages of bread more common.
To economists, the answer is clearly no: New York, unlike Moscow, has plenty of bread available because grain speculators' pricing brings supplies in line with demand. But in the survey New Yorkers were even more likely than Muscovites -- 66 percent vs. 45 percent -- to say that the speculators would cause shortages.
"Ticket scalping is a form of speculation," Dr. Shiller said, "and people oppose speculation without having thought about it very much. Economists know that speculators prevent shortages, and we don't see why the government should regulate ticket sales. I'd like to see more scalping. But to the public -- and also to theater owners who want to control prices -- it seems as if the speculators are disrupting things."
Politicians commonly argue that without anti-scalping laws, tickets would become unaffordable to most people, but California has no laws against scalping, and ticket prices there are not notoriously high. And as much as scalpers would like to inflate prices, only a limited number of people are willing to pay $100 a ticket.
Last summer, for instance, while the authorities were trying to outlaw any "unfair" prices for Bruce Springsteen concerts, the market was accomplishing that goal far more effectively. Mr. Levinson said that he got stuck with $5,000 worth of Springsteen tickets he could not sell.
And even if there were enough people for some events to fill a hall at $100 a ticket, there is another reason that promoters or entertainers would not allow all the tickers to be sold at that price. Economists call it the "good will factor": A smart business person will not take a quick profit if it means sacrificing the long-term good will of customers.
This good will factor explains why the highest box-office price for "Guys and Dolls" is $65 even though the show is consistently sold out and some brokers charge $120 a ticket.
"Even though we could sell tickets at $100, we'd be cutting our own throats because it would be a P.R. disaster for Broadway," said Rocco Landesman, president of Jujamcyn Theaters.
An alternative system that appeals to economists would be something akin to what the airlines do: sell some tickets at "affordable" prices to customers willing to stand in line or order months in advance, thereby maintaining public good will and tapping the budget-minded market; then allow the rest to be sold -- and resold -- at whatever the market will bear.
Economists say this system would bring in larger audiences and more revenue, giving producers the incentive to stage more events. Some consumers would pay higher prices than they do now, but they would have more opportunities to see more events. And the prices would probably be lower than what scalpers currently charge, because more tickets would be available for resale and it would be easier to conduct business.
 
Looking Ahead
 Scalpers would not have to worry about evading the law or paying fines. Nor would they have to rely on the complicated strategies they use for getting tickets: sending teams of "diggers" to stand in line, taking out season subscriptions under fake names, making clandestine purchases of house seats, or paying bribes -- called "ice" in the theater business -- to box-office employees.
Legalized scalping, however, would not necessarily be good news for everyone. Mr. Thomas, for instance, fears that the extra competition might put him out of business. But after 16 years -- he started at age 10 outside Yankee Stadium -- he is thinking it might be time for a change anyway. He said that he was studying for his high-school equivalency diploma, and that he planned to use his $75,000 in savings to go to college.
"I want to take some business courses," he said. "I know a lot about selling, how to talk to people and move things, but there's things about business I don't know. I wonder if maybe some professor could explain to me why scalping is so bad."

HEADLINE: Stressing the Lighter Side of Jesus;
A Bronx Church Seeks to Combine Laughter and Salvation

BYLINE: By DAVID GONZALEZ

 BODY:
The Gospel of St. Matthew holds that some two thousand years ago three wise men cast their eyes to the sky and with a star as their guide made their way to Bethlehem, to pay homage to the infant Jesus.
On Christmas Eve, some parishioners of St. Ann's Episcopal Church also looked heavenward for guidance as they filed into the landmark South Bronx church for Mass. Instead of spotting a shining star, they looked no farther than the steeple and beheld a drawing of Christ -- the long hair and beard were familiar, but the hearty laugh and smile that creased His face were not. 
 "You ever see Christ laughing?" asked the Rev. Luis Barrios, the pastor of the church in Mott Haven. "We hadn't. We thought it was about time people did."
Most Christians, Father Barrios explained, envision Christ as a somber figure who died for their sins, and some see their own travails as one route to salvation. If suffering were salvation, Mott Haven -- a neighborhood where drugs, crime and death have snared countless souls -- would be sacred.
Not content to preach a heavenly reward for enduring earthly misery, Father Barrios wants his church to look at its human face and tend to the area's social problems. Heaven can wait while St. Ann's runs a soup kitchen, self-help meetings for addicts, youth sports and arts groups and a needle exchange for heroin addicts. In a season when Christians celebrate the day God became man, Father Barrios wants to remind his parishioners that while Christ cried and died, He also lived and laughed.
"It's going to destroy the medieval myth that suffering is what helps you get into heaven," said Father Barrios. "We need to get in touch with that part of Christ that was human. We need to humanize the theology. We also have to destroy the myth that allows things to remain as they are."
The way things are in Mott Haven dictated that what for other congregations is a midnight Mass was being held at 7 o'clock in the evening. The narrow streets around the church are often abuzz with heroin and crack dealers who zestfully hawk their illicit goods to out-of-town drivers and gaunt pedestrians. The competition over the frenzied trade has turned nearby Beekman Avenue into a block-long killing ground that is among the city's bloodiest.
AIDS has claimed other lives, while a less tangible but persistent decay silently eats away at the vitality of people trying to survive amid poverty, hunger and joblessness. More akin to Calvary than Bethlehem, this was the world encountered by Ralph Burkhardt, a new parishioner who dreamed up the idea of showing the Lord's lighter side.
 
Inspiration From Playboy
 Mr. Burkhardt was a native of City Island who was searching for a parish that embraced the world rather than endured it. He came to St. Ann's as a volunteer, applying his expertise as a construction superintendent to chores that needed to be done.
During the summer when he and his brother-in-law were painting the steeple, Mr. Burkhardt remembered that he had a drawing of Jesus stashed in his basement. He had done the drawing in 1983, taking inspiration from a drawing in Playboy magazine in the early 1970's that was part of a feature on popular images from the magazine. Weeks later, the drawing was hanging in the steeple.
"Nobody thinks of Jesus laughing." said Mr. Burkhardt. "There's sorrow and pain. But here He is laughing. He must've laughed at the wedding at Cana. Turning water into wine made everybody cheerful."
Such an interpretation comes easily to Mr. Burkhardt, whose childhood religious upbringing included double duty in church and temple. His mother was an Episcopalian who took him to Grace Church on City Island, while his Jewish grandmother took him to temple on holy days.
"Let's not get too complicated," he said. "I believe in God. Period. The main thing is that everybody believe in God."
 
Hope Into Action
 That's fine with Father Barrios, whose sermons are peppered with references to the the plight of the South Bronx and the hopes for renewal. In his church, pictures of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X hang in the sanctuary besides more traditional images.
During Masses, the music can alternate between bluesy-piano hymns and exuberant Puerto Rican-style songs during which members of the congregation swings their arms and stomp their feet to the accompaniment of twangy guitars and the rhythmic scratching of gourds.
"You look up and see Him looking up with a lot of pride," Father Barrios said of the laughing Jesus. "That transforms hope into action. We were losing the real sense of why Jesus came into the world."
He acknowledged that some other priests have questioned him suspiciously about the drawing, but locally it has been accepted, even if the laugh's meaning is as enigmatic as the Mona Lisa's smile.
"That smile is philosophical and mystical," said Juan Castro, the church's junior warden and the unofficial historian and poet laureate of Mott Haven. "That He became human and is still human. He is not a dead God. He is giving hope and does not want people to cry."
Some see it as a challenge.
"This laugh is sarcastic," said Judith Rivera, an artist at Pregones Theater, a troupe based at the church. "In reality there's not much to laugh about. But sometimes we have to reach out to laugh."
Her colleague, Rosalba Rolon, saw it as a bit of divine encouragement.
"Jesus was a visionary," she said. "He must be seeing something good to smile about."
Bob Buel, who came to St. Ann's after leaving the Catholic church in what he said was a protest over the church's stance toward gay men and lesbians, found comfort in the laugh. "He did everything we did," he said. "He partied, He drank and had good times."
Despite hard times, Mr. Buel, who is unemployed, came to church with a smile. "Up by me, at 156 Street and Jackson Avenue, we got no heat for a week and we still laughing. You still got to laugh; life goes on."
Of course, some are not exactly sure who is in the drawing.
"I never seen Him laugh," said Ivette Morales, a 33-year-old mother of two. "But I guess I never seen Him anyway."
Ms. Morales, who travels from her High Bridge neighborhood each week for Mass at St. Ann's, said the message behind the laughing Jesus was typical of what attracted her to the parish. "Father Barrios teaches us, he gives us the Mass in a way we can understand it," said Ms. Morales, who was raised a Catholic. "I never liked to go to church, but when I came in here something entered me spiritually. You come here and they don't look at you like an embarrassment."
A homey warmth filled the church on Christmas Eve as about 60 worshipers slowly came inside from the dark, cold streets, past the small knots of men who stood on the corner. The Mass was typical of Father Barrios, who likes to surprise his parishioners with new ways of worship. Instead of a sermon, he turned over the church to a youth group who pantomimed their way through "Christmas in the South Bronx," a hip-hop morality play about the evils that lurked outside the church and the hope that lives within.
Near the end of the Mass, Father Barrios turned to the congregation and reminded them of the season's sentiment.
"I hope some place you can do something to continue this type of joy," he said with a smile. "Shake your body, or at least put on a radio."
With his arms outstretched, he blessed the crowd.
"Remember, you reign in joy," he said. "Lord, as you smile, I pray we awaken smiling too. Go in peace to transform this society."

 The Economy
The economy is staggering out of the recession, but people who are getting jobs again tell a sobering story. The good jobs of the past, with strong wages and benefits, are largely giving way to unstable and mediocre positions. That makes this recovery different from any other. And with corporate giants like G. M. and I.B.M. planning to shed tens of thousands of workers next year, the resilience of the recovery is in some doubt. [Page 1.]
Most merchants' holiday business improved this year despite ups and downs caused by unusually nasty weather and more layoffs and revampings among top companies. "People have shopped this year like there really is a Christmas," an analyst said. While retailers will not post holiday sales numbers until Thursday, a few experts estimate sales grew 8 or 9 percent from a year ago. [1.] 
 The nation's financial system is still coping with the huge, and in many cases unexpected, consequences of the dismantling 10 years ago of the last controls on interest rates. Bank customers received higher interest rates, but banks raised fees on accounts and made riskier loans as they looked for ways to lift revenue to pay for the higher rates. [37.]
New York and New Jersey are cracking down on ticket scalpers and ticket brokers. Undercover officers are enforcing new rules, and the attorneys general are pressing cases. But economists tend to the view espoused by one scalper: "I look at scalping like working as a stockbroker, buying low and selling high. If people are willing to pay me the money, what kind of problem is that?" [1.]
 
 Companies
New Jersey Bell is facing a new challenge after it was cleared to install a $1.5 billion fiber-optic network. Can it persuade residents to buy a host of new services to help pay for the network? These may include services enabling people to take classes, as well as providing almost instant access to a library of TV programs. [37.]
 
 International
A bank established to invest in fledgling enterprises in the former Soviet bloc is gaining respect from government officials and business executives for making the most of its money. The respect comes despite what experts say may be too grand a vision for the bank espoused by its president, an ebullient 49-year-old Frenchman, Jacques Attali. [37.]
Japan's electronics industry is suffering, after a period of enormous growth. The industry's main trade group said output of electronic equipment fell 10.6 percent in 1992 from 1991, the first double-digit decline since World War II. Slack demand in its home market, a lack of innovative products, technological changes and rising competition have battered the industry. [37.]
 
 Your Money
Nearly a quarter of those who drove off in new cars this year had lease contracts in hand -- and, for a few more years, more money in their wallets. Are they making a wise long-term choice? There are some quick answers, and one key piece of advice is: read the fine print carefully, then read it carefully again. [35.]
Foreign bond and income funds can be flimsy shelters during currency wars, such as occurred this fall. The key may be to find funds that hedge some of the exchange risk, or invest in the most stable currencies, without sacrificing all the higher returns. [35.]
Ten credit-card danger signs have been developed to help people who think they might be overextended. Many cardholders have reached the limits of their credit lines, and creditors are demanding payment. A jump in this debt is tied partly to layoffs and salary freezes that left many people short of cash. [36.]
A professional home inspection can save grief. The cost is minor compared with other closing costs, and a professional engineer or architect can pinpoint critical flaws that neophyte home buyers can miss. [35.]

Reality Destroys a Fairy-Tale Image

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE

 BODY:
Reindeer farms and petting zoos lure tourists. A pet reindeer, Star IV, won the designation "official civic attraction," and leads two children's parades each year. But Alaskans also enjoy their reindeer in snack form: reindeer-burgers are popular at luncheonettes, and pizza parlors substitute slices of reindeer for pepperoni.
In a state that depends on wildlife for sustenance and as a mainstay of the tourism economy, reindeer are regarded in much the same way as whales, walruses or wolves. A hedge of laws and regulations protects them much of the time. But this is no fairy-tale land. Reindeer can cause problems. And when that happens, the solution is not always pretty. 
 The scene is Hagemeister Island, a 24-mile-long uninhabited wildlife refuge in Bristol Bay, 300 miles southwest of Anchorage. Reindeer, which are not native to Alaska, were introduced to the area from Siberia a century ago. A herd brought to the island in 1965 by a Yupik Eskimo has now grown out of hand and is eating all the native lichen. The Federal Government surveyed the island in 1991 and estimated that 800 reindeer had starved to death in 1990 and that the lichen, which takes 75 years to grow back, was 95 percent gone.
The Federal Fish and Wildlife Service sent a team of marksmen to the island last month. They killed 790 reindeer. But only 172 carcasses were removed, dressed and distributed to native villages; the rest were left to decay.
Maybe it was the approaching Christmas holiday, maybe it was the pictures of maimed animals struggling in the snow. Or maybe it was just that the marksmen ran out of ammunition. In any case, on Nov. 29 the Government suspended what it had labeled a "mercy killing."
An Eskimo doctor from Nome, Donald Olson, paid for another team to go to the island and rescue reindeer. It captured 120 animals and airlifted them to the mainland, where they were taken to an abandoned dairy farm. But then severe weather forced the rescuers to abandon their mission.
One hundred ninety-three reindeer remain on the island. The lichen is going fast, and the Government is threatening to renew the shooting. At a meeting in Togiak, a village near Hagemeister Island where residents subsist on hunting and fishing, officials told villagers to submit alternative plans by Jan. 4.
Villagers are angry at the way the Government handled the first round of shooting. "It's the worst wanton waste case since the buffalo," said Moses Kritz, a member of the tribal elders.
Aaron Archibecque, who led the reindeer slaughter team, said the villagers could not take more carcasses because the pilots refused to come back after a propeller accident. "One turn of events and two storms and we're left holding the bag," he said.
As the Fish and Wildlife officials see it, they have few choices. The National Reindeer Industry Act of 1937 limits ownership of reindeer here to Alaska natives. Federal regulations bar introduction of the semidomesticated herds to any region where they might interbreed and weaken the genetic stock of their wild caribou relatives. And state officials worry that the herd on Hagemeister Island might harbor bacteria that could infect Alaskan sheep. In addition, Federal conservation law means alien vegetation cannot be introduced into a wildlife region.
"That means no hay or pellets," said Walter O. Steiglitz, regional director of the Fish and Wildlife Service.
The Eskimos' immediate goal is to extend the deadline for proposals, which comes just before the celebration here of Russian Christmas on Jan. 7 "We have no time," said Robin Samuelson, a member of the Bristol Bay Native Association from Dillingham. "Every request we made they had some new objection. They made no suggestions to help us."
Mr. Steiglitz warned that an extension was unlikely, and he emphasized that his concern was for the lichen.
"We have a mandate not to let any naturally occurring species, plant or animal be eliminated," he said. "Harsh as it may sound, the reindeer are, frankly, dinner. They are cattle with fancy antlers. If I have to choose reindeer or lichen, I have to chose lichen. It's tougher to grow back."
He admitted it was an awkward time of year to be the man signing death warrants for reindeer. "If my grandchildren were real little, it would be hard to explain, I imagine," Mr. Steiglitz said. "But still, these reindeer are, after all, not those reindeer."

HEADLINE: Japanese Electronics In Slump

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 25

 BODY:
Japan's electronics industry, once considered nearly unstoppable, is now suffering from its worst slump since World War II, according to new figures released by the industry's main trade association.
Production of all electronics equipment in Japan fell an estimated 10.6 percent in 1992 from 1991, the first double-digit decline since World War II, the Electronics Industries Association of Japan said in a report released this week. The trade group also predicted that the industry's output would grow a scant 1.5 percent in 1993. 
 The organization's annual assessment painted a surprisingly gloomy picture of an industry battered by slack demand in its home market and a lack of innovative new products, technological changes and rising competition from lower-cost manufacturers in East Asia.
 
 
Painful Restructuring
 Indeed, the slump affects virtually all products made by the Japanese, including televisions, video recorders, computers, calculators, semiconductors, telecommunications equipment and scientific instruments. And it is forcing Japan's once vaunted companies to undergo painful restructuring.
The decline in 1992 Japanese electronics production to 22.6 trillion yen, or about $180 billion, was unexpected. A year ago, the industry association had projected that output in 1992 would grow 5.6 percent.
The results contrast with the United States electronics industry, in which at least some products, including semiconductors and personal computers, have seen strong growth. The data suggest that American companies are gaining worldwide market share at the expense of the Japanese.
While the main cause of the production downturn is the recession in Japan, the report indicated that there are several factors that will continue to hurt the Japanese industry even after the economy improves.
 
 
Needed: New Demand
 Consumer electronics companies, for instance, are suffering not only from recession but from the fact that most homes already have a videocassette recorder or a television set. New products are needed to fuel growth, but none have emerged. While some electronics companies have placed their hopes on high-definition television and on new digital audio recorders like Sony's mini-disk system, the electronics association said these products would not make an impact for years, if at all.
"It is not expected that recently introduced products, including high-definition television equipment, will spur significant new demand," the report said.
In computers, Japan's industry, particularly the producers of large mainframes, are starting to feel the effects of the same shift toward smaller machines that has devastated the world's biggest computer company, the International Business Machines Corporation.
The widespread electronics industry slump has already led to at least one-time losses at leading companies like Fujitsu, NEC, Sony and Oki Electric. The problems are forcing the companies to jettison some marginal businesses and to reduce their work forces by thousands, though most companies are doing this through attrition rather than layoffs. Executives are now preparing for a decade in which growth will be far slower than in the past.
 
 
Slow Recovery Expected
 "We won't see a high growth rate like in the 70's and 80's," said Shigeru Yoshinaka, electronics analyst with Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities. And with companies reluctant to lay off people, he said, the recovery in profits "will be prolonged compared with the United States companies."
Japan's electronics industry had seen almost continuous growth for several decades, sometimes as much as 30 percent a year. In the last two decades, there have been only two other years in which production shrank -- in 1975, after the first oil shock, and in 1986, after the strengthened yen made Japanese products more expensive abroad.
Worst hit in 1992 was the consumer electronics sector, perhaps the industry for which Japan is best known. Production of audio and video equipment is estimated to have plummeted 17 percent, to 3.9 trillion yen, or a little more than $30 billion. Another decline of 3.5 percent is projected for 1993. Exports fell 13.1 percent in the first nine months of the year.
Measured in units, Japanese production of color televisions dropped 10.7 percent, videocassette recorders 22.8 percent and video cameras 23.6 percent. But production of compact disk players rose 7.9 percent, although output of other stereo equipment fell.
The report shows that consumer electronics is becoming less important here, accounting for 17.2 percent of total electronics production in 1992 compared with 30.7 percent in 1982.
 
 
Offshore Manufacturing
 Part of the decline in production in Japan results from the fact that Japanese companies have shifted their manufacturing offshore. Much of the movement has been to Southeast Asia, which offers lower manufacturing costs and is helping the Japanese companies compete with low-cost suppliers in South Korea, Taiwan and other areas. In other cases, production has shifted to the United States and Europe to be closer to markets. For color televisions and tape recorders, production by Japanese companies outside Japan now exceeds production in Japan.
Computer production also had a steep drop of 10.2 percent, to 5.46 trillion yen, or about $44 billion, as Japan's hard pressed banks and securities companies have scaled back on their investments in automation. Even sales of personal computers, which should be a fast-growing field, fell about 10 percent in 1992, analysts said.
Weak sales of computers and consumer electronic equipment in turn led to an estimated decline of 9.8 percent in integrated circuit production in 1992. Some market research figures show that American semiconductor companies have now regained the lead in overall computer chip production from the Japanese.

HEADLINE: For Maloney, a New Arena, but the Same Style

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The day could not have been drearier. Gray skies. Intermittent rain. Chilly winds. Yet Carolyn B. Maloney was bouncing around like a teen-ager on spring break. "Can't you just feel your heart beating faster around here?" she said, heading toward the Rayburn office building for a quick lunch between meetings.
This was Ms. Maloney's first day in Washington after nearly a week attending seminars at Harvard for new Democrats in Congress. A member of the New York City Council for 10 years, she was the upset winner last month over Bill Green in New York's expanded Silk Stocking District to join the 103d Congress in the House of Representatives, and now the spoils of victory were all about: the majestic Capitol, the Mall, the Washington Monument and the one-bedroom apartment less than three blocks away that she rented for a song, compared with New York prices. "I can walk to work," she said. 
 But there was little time to gawk or discuss the impact of the next two years, commuting between New York City, where her husband, Clifton, and two daughters will remain, and a new life in Washington as a member of the largest Democratic freshman class in Congress in 18 years. This was a day for contacts, bridge building and learning that being effective in a House of 435 members is quite a different thing from getting notice in a City Council of 51.
 
Concentrating Energy
 In a style that became familiar in the City Council, it was accomplished at fevered pitch in a series of meetings.
At each stop, Ms. Maloney engaged her hosts in rat-a-tat-tat questioning, focused on how she could concentrate her energy on her areas of interest, as she had in the City Council, where she pushed the city to computerize its awarding of contracts and monitoring of contractors, as well as for child care, health care and women's rights.
She ran against Mr. Green, a 14-year incumbent, by running as a Clintonesque Democrat and emphasizing both her accomplishments in the City Council and Mr. Green's support of Republican positions under Presidents Reagan and Bush that she said cost New York jobs and programs. She scored a victory by 2 percentage points, barely 5,000 votes, capitalizing on margins in the new sections of the district, Greenpoint in Brooklyn and Astoria, Queens.
 
Committee Selections
 As her day of engagement unfolded, however, it became evident that not even her pugnacious New York City style would gain her all the positions she wanted. In the House, where members serve on no more than one major committee and only a few freshmen get their first choice, Ms. Maloney was appointed to Government Operations and to Banking, Finance and Urban Affairs.
She said she was reasonably satisfied, saying those assignments could produce benefits for New York City and accommodate her interests in finance and the governmental process.
In a meeting with an aide to Representative Robert T. Matsui of California, Azar Kattan, Ms. Maloney hammered away, asking questions until she finally heard something that sounded like a path to another pet issue. "Join the women's caucus," Ms. Kattan told her. "Use that as a tool, too. It's bipartisan, but it gets into the Economic Equity Act each year."
"That is great advice," said Ms. Maloney, as if it were the key to solving E=MC<2>.
Ms. Maloney, 44 years old, is a teacher by training. A 1968 graduate of Greensboro College in North Carolina, her home state, she had intended to be a lawyer and spent a year in law school at the University of North Carolina. But a summer trip to New York City changed everything.
"I went up to see a friend and never left," she said. "I just fell in love with the place. My father was furious."
She found work as a teacher in the city school system but quickly moved into administrative positions with the Board of Education. They led to jobs as an aide in the State Assembly and later, the State Senate. In 1982 she ran for the City Council for the first time and defeated the incumbent, Robert Rodriguez, by a 2-to-1 margin.
 
Vallone's View
 As a Council member, she forged an image as a legislator who appeared somewhat unfocused until she found an issue she was interested in. Several members, who asked not to be identified, described her as "a little spacey," but only until she had found an issue to champion. Then, they agreed, she became a dogged advocate. One member described her as a "pit bull."
"I would have said the same thing if I didn't get to know her," said Peter F. Vallone, the Council Speaker from Queens, who played a major role in Ms. Maloney's campaign success in Astoria. "Unless you're working on a specific committee, you might not know what's happening on other committees. I'm one of the few people who know what she did."
It was not long after her arrival in New York City that she met her husband, an investment banker, and had two daughters, Christine, now 12, and Virginia, 5.
Their lives, as much as her own, will be affected by her election to the House. She plans to spend two, maybe three nights a week in Washington when Congress is in session, leaving Mr. Maloney and the girls in New York.
"My older daughter is like a lot of 12-year-olds, very independent, with her own friends and her own agenda," Ms. Maloney said. "She understands the importance of the position, the challenge of the position, that Mother is voting on pressing problems of the country. For my younger daughter, it's very hard. When I was at Harvard, my husband told me she was kissing my picture and asking, 'When's Mommy coming home?' "
Mr. Maloney was reluctant to discuss the implications of her job on the family, or anything else, for that matter. During the Harvard seminars, he attended a lunch for spouses, where each of them received a bit of advice, in the form of a letter once written by Dennis Thatcher, the husband of the former British Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher.
"He said the No. 1 cardinal rule is never talk to the press," Mr. Maloney said in a telephone interview. "I think that's appropriate."
 
Feminist Leaders
 The final meeting of the day, with feminist leaders in Arlington, Va., was a highlight of sorts for Ms. Maloney. A strong advocate of women's issues for years, she gave her first child the middle name Paul, after Alice Paul, the suffragist who wrote the first equal-rights amendment proposal, nearly 70 years ago.
"It's funny," Ms. Maloney told the women around the table, "usually when I come to Washington, it's to march." They laughed, and recalled some of their more memorable moments pressing their issues with the Republican administrations of the last dozen years. "Now," she said, "I've got to get us some visibility."
Visibility for women's issues might not be the problem she imagines, once Congress opens. The new Congress will include a record number of women, 54, including 48 in the House. "We just have to figure out how to undo the damage of the 80's," said Eleanor Smeal, president of the Fund for the Feminist Majority, as the meeting was ending.
After a round of goodbyes, the other women left, leaving only Ms. Smeal and Ms. Maloney, who had planned to have dinner at a nearby restaurant. Old friends, they left the building as if the meeting had never adjourned. "So, Elly," Ms. Maloney said as they made their way out of the building. "How are we going to pass the E.R.A.?"

 FREE MARKET IN ACTION OR CRIME?
Ticket scalping has been very good to Kevin Thomas, and he makes no apologies. He sees himself as a classic American entrepreneur: a high-school dropout from the Bronx who taught himself a trade, works seven nights a week, earns $40,000 a year, and at age 26 has $75,000 in savings, all by providing a public service outside New York's theaters and sports arenas. But he has been arrested many times. But while New York and New Jersey officials are cracking down on scalpers, economists tend to see them as performing a valuable function. Page 1.

 TEAMSTER HEAD SEEN AS BOUNCING BACK 
 The allegations against Barry Feinstein, one of New York City's top municipal-employees union leaders, looked overwhelming when they were made public in September. Bluntly put, he was accused in noncriminal charges of embezzling and misusing $500,000 in union funds to finance a lavish personal life style. But three months later, labor and political experts say, Mr. Feinstein has emerged relatively unscathed and remains a potent union official and political figure. Page 25.
 CONSTRUCTION UNIONS MOVE TO INTEGRATE
Construction unions in New York City that have long been criticized for excluding members of racial minority groups have agreed to recruit 25 percent of their new apprentices from the overwhelmingly black and Hispanic graduating classes of the city's vocational high schools. Page 25.

The principal of an elementary school in Hartford's North End testified in Superior Court this week that of his 580 pupils, only 17 don't qualify for free lunches. As civil-rights lawyers complete a portrait of Hartford's public schools as institutions overwhelmed by the poverty and racial isolation of their students, such details sometimes seem to fill the courtroom with the feeling of hopelessness that teachers say suffocates their classrooms.

 THE $700-MILLION-DOLLAR QUESTION
A malpractice insurance fund set up by New York State in the 80's has collected a huge pool of money. In the last six years, while more than $1 billion has been paid into the fund, less than $2 million has been paid out in awards. The unused money has already been used twice to help balance the state budget. Now, with more than $700 million in the fund and the state's ailing largest insurer, Empire Blue Cross and Blue Shield, looking hungrily at it, the question is: why does the fund exist at all?

HEADLINE: A Vision of Capitalism In the Ex-Soviet Bloc

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
As president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, Jacques Attali has a grand vision for financing the emergence of vibrant capitalist economies in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, leading eventually to a vast pan-European market.
"We should be a go-between between East and West," the ebullient 49-year-old Frenchman said in an interview at the bank's headquarters here. 
 His aspirations strike some diplomats and business executives as outsized if not pretentious, given the European Bank's record so far. The institution, established 20 months ago by Western European nations and the United States to provide loans and investment funds to fledgling enterprises in the old Soviet bloc, has completed only about 50 transactions and committed $1.5 billion of capital.
 
Starting to Gain Respect
 The European Bank may never be as big or as influential as Mr. Attali envisions. But with other sources of financing in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union extremely limited, the bank is starting to gain respect from government officials and business executives for making the most of its money. Its sponsors have committed $3.75 billion of capital through 1996.
Certainly its efforts have not gone unappreciated by the companies it has financed. For instance, Konspol-BIS, a poultry-processing company in Poland, said a $16 million loan from the bank was essential to getting an additional $9 million needed to build a new plant that will create 300 jobs.
"The European Bank's involvement in the project was absolutely crucial to putting the deal together, and in that respect the bank is fulfilling the mandate given to it to promote and develop industry in Eastern Europe," said Maciej Raczkiewicz, who owns 22 percent of Konspol. "From my point of view, the European Bank is essential because at this point the private banks are still reluctant to commit themselves to Poland."
Mr. Attali, a French socialist philosopher-politician with no training as a banker, who was pushed for the job by President Francois Mitterrand of France, said he recognized the impatience felt by Eastern European nations as well as the Western governments financing the bank.
"We are still in the takeoff period at a time when people wish we were at full speed," he said.
He said the institution faced some deep-rooted biases, among them the European Community's reluctance to help build economic competitors in the East and then open up trade with them. Mr. Attali said, for example, that the Western nations should provide more financial assistance to help the East get its exporting industries up and running.
 
Several Projects Under Way
 Nonetheless, Mr. Attali said, the European Bank's accomplishments so far are not inconsiderable. It has financed a venture to provide better international telephone service in Moscow. It has backed an Italian-Polish joint venture setting up a jeans-production plant in Poland, provided capital to a Romanian bank to make loans to farmers and agriculture-related industries, and lent money to a company setting up Burger King franchises in Hungary.
It helped finance a deal under which General Motors set up a plant in Hungary. Along with Air France, it took a stake in CSA, the Czechoslovak state airline. In the last several weeks it has approved loans to a new Hungarian company to build a plant that will supply tire and rubber companies in Europe with carbon black, and to a company in Poland that makes turbo generators.
Mr. Attali himself also seems to be finding his stride. He initially alienated some members of the bank's board, who are appointed by the nations that have contributed the institution's capital and who have final say over all of the bank's transactions. They said they saw him as publicity hungry and headstrong. For example, Mr. Attali has issued news releases offering his help in resolving the war in Yugoslavia.
Mr. Attali was in most ways an unconventional choice to head an institution devoted to creating democratic capitalism in Eastern Europe. As a close adviser to President Mitterrand in the early 1980's, he helped develop a program, later reversed, of nationalizing key industries in France.
And while no one doubts that he is well read in economics -- he wrote a book several years ago on the threat of a decline in manufacturing in the United States -- his energies over the years have been diffused among a wide variety of interests and projects, ranging from writing novels to studying the changing conceptions of property rights.
Mr. Attali was firmly rebuked earlier this year by the United States Treasury Secretary, Nicholas F. Brady, for pushing a plan to make cut-rate loans in support of long-term economic changes to Eastern European governments and to the states of the former Soviet Union.
The United States, the largest contributor to the European Bank's capital, with a 10 percent stake, held that such a program would have violated the bank's charter to operate by commercial bank standards and concentrate on providing help to the private sector.
"Let Mr. Attali say whatever he wants," Mr. Brady said at the bank's annual meeting in Budapest in April. "I want him to understand what we think. We've had our differences before, and I assure you we're very determined about this."
But Mr. Attali in recent months has patched up his differences with the United States and concentrated on transactions that provide financing directly to private enterprise, or that help provide the infrastructure -- the roads, the telephone systems and the like -- that are essential to the development of competitive market economies. In the process he is winning praise, even from the United States, for having instilled in the institution a sense of energy and urgency.
 
Keeping Up With Attali
 "There is an understandable push from Attali," said William Curran, the United States representative on the bank's board, "to want to use the bank as a platform for him to give his views, which are intelligent and very innovative on a variety of subjects, whether he's talking about a pan-European market from Lisbon to Vladivostok, or the problems of nuclear safety.
"I'd much rather have to steer someone as a member of a board than to push somebody, and with him you have to run to stay up."
Bank officials said their main strategy was not to try to finance deals completely on their own, since the bank's capital was so limited. Instead, they said, they try to put together financing packages that would not be possible without their help.
"We have to be very efficient in multiplying our resources," said Ron Freeman, who heads the institution's merchant banking operation. "For every penny we invest, we need to mobilize three or four pennies from other sources."
To that end, the bank looks for partners, often Western companies (more often than not from the United States), that are interested in joint ventures with Eastern European companies. In the case of Konspol-BIS, the Polish poultry-processing company, the loan from the European Bank was accompanied by an additional $9 million in equity and other financing from partners including Mr. Raczkiewicz and A. Epstein & Sons, a construction and engineering company based in Chicago.
 
Financing for G.M.
 In some cases the European Bank has invested its funds as capital in other financing organizations seeking to make loans in its territory. Last year it agreed to a deal with the NMB Postbank Group N.V. of the Netherlands under which it will provide $40 million and NMB $60 million to small and medium-sized private enterprises in Poland and other countries.
Critics of the bank have contended that the money it provides often is not needed since most Western investors already have access to sufficient financing. Some critics questioned, for example, why the bank agreed to help finance General Motors's new plant in Hungary, since G.M. has far more resources at its disposal than the bank has.
But Mr. Freeman said that the bank's participation in a deal provided other investors a sense of confidence that they would otherwise not have, a contention that G.M. and other investors agreed with. And in some cases, the bank's participation has bottom-line implications: commercial banks that lend in deals involving the European Bank share its preferred-creditor status, a legal nicety that permits them to minimize the risk provision they must normally make on loans in economically weak nations.
Most of the deals done directly with private enterprises have been in Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the three most economically advanced of the Central and Eastern European nations. But with the collapse of the Soviet Union, the bank has increasingly focused on ways to help the former Soviet republics, where there is still little private enterprise.
Most of the lending being done in the former Soviet Union is therefore going toward telecommunications and other infrastructure projects. But ultimately the bank would like to concentrate on the oil industry, which could provide significant foreign-exchange earnings, and help establish banks and other financial institutions within the republics to provide financing to the emerging private sector.
"If we concentrate on what we do best," Mr. Curran said, "which is to help develop a private sector, help develop a banking system and a semiprivatized energy sector, and to help create an atmosphere in which small and medium-sized businesses can develop, then we can have a big role to play in the former Soviet Union. The mistake we might make would be to wander too far into the huge black hole of infrastructure."

HEADLINE: A SHARP REBOUND IN CHRISTMAS SALES

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
It was a hair-raising holiday season for many of the nation's retailers: sales started out strong, dropped off precipitously and finally skyrocketed the last weekend before Christmas.
Most merchants say their holiday business improved this year despite the ups and downs caused by unusually nasty weather and news of more layoffs and revampings among America's blue-chip companies. 
 "People have shopped this year like there really is a Christmas," said John J. Schultz, president of the National Retail Federation.
 
Sales May Be Up 9%
 So much for the notion that Christmas was dead. While retailers will not release hard and fast numbers on how they fared during the holidays until Thursday, a few experts are even estimating that sales may be 8 or 9 percent higher than those of a year ago. Most believe sales will have risen around 5 percent.
"We couldn't ask for much better this season," said Myron E. Ullman 3d, co-chairman and chief executive of R. H. Macy & Company. Sales have exceeded expectations at stores like Bloomingdale's, Sears and Tiffany & Company, that were punished for the last three years by penurious shoppers. Macy expects sales to be 2 to 3 percent ahead for the season; although its sales were much stronger in New York City and Washington as well as Georgia and Florida, that success was tempered by weak sales in California.
Discount stores were less of a destination for shoppers this year. Kmart struggled the last few days before Christmas to meet its projections for the season, and analysts expected Target to match its sales performance last year but not exceed it. And even though Wal-Mart raised its estimates for sales growth in December by 2 percent, it still did not plan to post its usual monthly double-digit sales gain.
Strict inventory controls at several big chains virtually guaranteed a more profitable season even if sales did not notch up.
Mr. Schultz noted that the calendar this year was almost ideal for retailers. He estimated that the two more days between Thanksgiving and Christmas this year could mean as much as 4 percent more sales for some merchants.
What is more, Christmas fell on a Friday this year, which gave people today and Sunday to go back to stores to return gifts and clear out leftover merchandise.
Retailers are trying to squeeze as much out of Christmas 1992 as possible, since they do not expect the windfall to persist into the new year. Many merchants and analysts believe the first quarter of 1993 will be weak, because consumer spending has recently outpaced income growth. Credit-card companies have reported strong increases in transactions, and some shoppers may be shocked when they get their bills next month. Also, this year had a strong start, which will make it tougher to squeeze out gains in the start of 1993.
"The fear a little bit is that a lot of the energy is being sucked out of the quarter by the strength of Christmas," said Carol Sanger, a spokeswoman for Federated Department Stores, which operates Bloomingdale's, Abraham & Straus, Burdines and several other chains.
For the holidays, Federated's sales exceeded its cautious expectations. Analysts expect its sales in stores open at least one year, the best measure of a retailer's performance, to increase somewhere between 4 and 6 percent.
For Federated and several other chains, improvement was achieved in fits and starts as the holiday season progressed. Inclement weather kept shoppers in some regions of the country at home, and Californians, in the midst of a statewide recession, were stingy spenders. A few retailers said news of corporate layoffs at I.B.M., General Motors and other companies also might have dampened the giddiness produced by the election of Bill Clinton and speculation about the impact of his Administration.
 
Up, Down, Up Again
 The Christmas and Hanukkah selling season started with a frenzy resembling the heady holidays of the 1980's, as shoppers jammed stores in the week after Thanksgiving. Intoxicated by the excitement, some analysts and retailers rushed to revise their sales forecasts and began predicting sales that would soar 9 percent beyond those registered in the same period last year.
Then sales trailed off in the second week of the season and in some cases nearly died as vicious storms pummeled the Atlantic Coast and froze parts of the Midwest. The two extra days of selling time between Thanksgiving and Christmas also allowed shoppers to postpone spending they would have done in the third week until the fourth week, leaving retailers to gnaw their nails and hope.
Analysts returned to their original estimates of sales growth around 5 or 6 percent, a moderate improvement but sparkling when compared with last year's sales growth of less than 2 percent.
The Johnson Redbook Service, the retail industry monitor published by Lynch, Jones & Ryan, calculated that sales grew 6.9 percent in the first week, rose just 1.4 percent the second week, then picked up their pace to increase 5.9 percent in the third week, largely because of accelerated momentum last Saturday.
Hermes, the exclusive luxury goods chain that sells ties for $110, silk scarves for $225 and handbags for as much as $14,000, sold more than $500,000 worth of merchandise that Saturday in its New York store alone.
Customers lined up outside Toys "R" Us in Herald Square in Manhattan and fought for position in check-out lines at Macy's flagship store there. Cars cruised the jammed parking lots outside Wal-Mart stores across the country, searching for available space.
Retailers reported that the fast pace continued through Wednesday, though last Saturday will probably stand out as the biggest day of Christmas sales 1992. Tactical Retail Solutions Inc., a retail consulting firm in New York, estimates that merchants took in $4 billion that day, or roughly 4 percent of total estimated sales of $71 billion for the holiday season.
"Now we're hearing guesses that they'll see 25 to 50 percent increases in the fourth week," said Edward Johnson, the analyst who compiles the Johnson Redbook. Based on that, he is sticking to his estimate of 8 to 9 percent sales growth this month.
 
Last-Minute Shopping Grows
 A sales explosion in the final week -- which may not be retailing hyperbole given that sales surged 20 percent in the last week of the weak 1991 holiday season -- would support what is becoming a new tenet in the retail handbook. Consumers are last-minute shoppers, making the holiday sales season a perennial cliffhanger.
"The unfortunate part of the Christmas season is that we don't know so much about how it's going until after it's over," said Orren F. Knauer, director of investor relations for the Kmart Corporation.
"The election was over, and suddenly the media is making it out to be the best Christmas in four years," he added. "Maybe it will; maybe it won't. We just don't know until Christmas Eve."
Clark A. Johnson, chairman of Pier 1 Imports Inc., a specialty-store chain that sells home furnishings, decorations and gift items, said that for merchants this season was something like riding a roller coaster, although he expected his stores would exceed his projections of 5 to 6 percent comparable-store sales growth.
"It's been tricky," he said Wednesday. "But this last week will be the largest week of sales in the history of the company."
Retailers were also heartened by unexpectedly strong sales of big-ticket merchandise like furniture and appliances. Sears in particular benefited from its selection of home and office furniture, computers, fax machines and appliances. "What it's telling us is that customers are finally willing to make longer-term commitments," said Matthew A. Howard, senior vice president of marketing for Sears.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Bell's Future Linked to New Services

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
For New Jersey Bell, winning approval this week from state regulators to install a $1.5 billion fiber-optic network and operate with new competitive freedoms may turn out to be the easy part.
A new struggle looms larger: Can the phone company persuade New Jersey residents to sign up for a host of new services to help pay for the new network? The offerings are expected to include so-called interactive video services like educational networks that would enable people to take classes, as well as video services providing virtually instant access to a library of television programs. 
 "Clearly the marketing challenge is the bigger challenge," said Jack Grubman, an analyst at Paine Webber, who follows Bell Atlantic, New Jersey Bell's parent. "The question is: Is anyone going to buy anything?"
 
An Adventuresome Deal
 Industry analysts point to many factors they believe will ultimately reward the unusually adventuresome approach of the telephone company and its state regulators, which clears the way for New Jersey to become the first state with border-to-border fiber-optics telecommunications. "Everything is in place to make this a success," said Charles W. Schelke, an analyst at Smith Barney.
In broad terms, the arrangement with state regulators should enable the phone company to earn greater returns on services for which it faces or may face competitors. In return, New Jersey Bell has agreed to freeze rates through 1999 for the basic telephone services on which the company has a monopoly.
Investors have signaled their support of the plan, pushing up the stock of Bell Atlantic this week to levels last reached in early 1991. Although many telecommunications stocks are doing well these days, the ruling on Tuesday gave a special push to Bell Atlantic, whose shares hit their high for the year on Wednesday at $53.875 before receding slightly in lighter trading Thursday to close at $53 on the New York Stock Exchange.
The initial phase of the New Jersey fiber-optic network is to be operational by 1999, and the entire network is to be completed by 2010. Fiber-optic cable, which can transmit millions of pieces of information each second, is equally adept at carrying voice, data and video signals.
Anticipating the capabilities, New Jersey Bell forged an agreement last week with Future Vision of Doylestown, Pa., to provide cable television service to some New Jersey residents through the phone line.
With the enormous capacity of the fiber-optic network, New Jersey Bell may be able to market so-called video-on-demand, giving consumers greater choice in watching what they want at the moment they want it.
 
Selling Other Services
 More salesmanship may be required to make a success of other services, like transmitting lectures over the network into homes, or receiving some medical attention through a two-way video link, or scrolling through a video version of classified advertising.
Although the population of New Jersey is among the most affluent in the nation -- giving residents at least the financial ability to dabble in the new services -- many industry observers are skeptical about how attractive the interactive services will be to consumers and businesses.
New Jersey Bell helped set up a trial educational network using fiber optics that is operating in Bergen County. But no other examples of the technology exist because of the limited use of fiber optics in telephone networks around the country.
Under Federal law, New Jersey Bell is prohibited from originating the services, but because the company will earn money from others supplying the services, it has a stake in making them a success.
 
Added Costs Minimal

 
 To a degree, the business implications of installing the fiber-optic network mitigate the riskiness of the new service. Over a period of years, the relative cost of installing the fiber-optic cable compared with copper wire is largely the same, according to New Jersey Bell executives, because the maintenance costs of the more durable fiber-optic cable are much lower.
And once the initial phase is operational by 1999, the company plans to use revenues from new services to complete the project.
Although the company said it might raise money through the capital markets to help pay for the cable, New Jersey Bell will more likely allocate part of its yearly profits. New Jersey Bell's capital expense budget averages between $500 million and $600 million a year. This year, the company anticipates it will earn $444 million on revenues of $3.1 billion.
There are also more indirect benefits to the phone company for upgrading its network. As New Jersey shifts increasingly from a manufacturing economy to a service-based economy, a high-technology phone network will be a boon to New Jersey economic development officials.
 
Beset By New Competitors
 New Jersey Bell faces tough competition from companies like Teleport Communications Group of Staten Island, which operates fiber-optic networks in a dozen metropolitan areas, including New York City. Teleport's main business is linking corporations in downtown business districts with their long-distance carriers. But the company, which was jointly acquired earlier this year by cable giants Tele-Communications and Cox Communications, is increasingly seeking to compete head-to-head against local telephone companies on a full range of services.
In September, the Federal Communications Commission voted to encourage competition in local telephone service by permitting companies like Teleport to sharply expand their use of the networks operated by the regional Bell companies and other local phone carriers.
Also, cable television companies like Comcast of Philadelphia are aggressively trying to compete with telephone companies by investing in technology to build wireless telephone networks using their existing cable.
"New Jersey Bell is being attacked by competitive access providers that require Bell Atlantic to have the most modern infrastructure," said Berge Ayvazian, an analyst at the Yankee Group, a market research firm in Boston.

HEADLINE: Schools Can Build on Apprentice Programs

 BODY:
To the Editor:
By describing the experience of two Boston students in Project ProTech, you present a convincing case for apprentice programs in your "Finding What Works" series (front page, Nov. 26). As an educator who coordinates an apprenticeship program for high school students, I concur about the value of a supervised work experience. However, I am concerned that such an expensive program (Project ProTech costs the taxpayer $8,000 a student per year) has the limited goal of "placing people in particular jobs." I regard this approach as a missed opportunity. 
 Your article illustrates how apprentices gain motivation when they have a credible role in the workplace with a committed supervisor. At this age, students are sensitive to the need to plan for their future. From my own observation, it is apparent that they gain confidence from being treated as responsible colleagues, especially if this is new to them. They also discover the value of academic credentials. Why not build on this opportunity by providing school classes that complement, rather than compete with their work experiences?
 Two supplemental activities come to mind. The first is more instruction in a relevant academic subject, such as biology or chemistry for apprentices in medical labs. Why are the students uninterested in physics, as you are at pains to emphasize?
The second activity is workshops to develop communication skills and cognitive strategies. In such workshops, apprentices would spend a few hours each week in discussion with peers, in writing about their experiences at work and devising new ways of learning on the job. If the apprentices make oral presentations about their progress, they will gain insight about the demands of the workplace and their own ability to succeed.
Why do the Project ProTech designers fail to recognize the potential for apprentices to gain such marketable career skills, as well as competence in a specific job?
Would industry be prepared to sponsor programs with this wider focus? To suggest that industry is interested merely in recruiting employees underestimates the goals of participating employers and supervisors.
In practical terms, it is difficult to predict where students will look for work, and those who acquire transferable skills will contribute more both to their apprenticeship and the economy.

HEADLINE: Schools Can Build on Apprentice Programs;
A New York Project

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Apprenticeship programs for high school students are more than "a tonic for the nation's ailing economy" (front page, Nov. 26). They are a tonic for the country's ailing schools. The comment you quote by the mother of one student tells it all: "I'm shocked. This is the first time I've ever seen a school program work." 
 The Boston school system's Project ProTech is only one of several similar programs in the country. In Arkansas, Oregon and Maine, pilot programs are under way to provide occupational training for high school students. In Philadelphia and Chicago, partnerships between employers and schools are preparing students for the world of work.
 In the fall of 1991, Cornell University sponsored a youth apprenticeship demonstration project for 25 high school juniors in Broome County, New York. And next February, a pilot apprenticeship program called Project GROW (Getting Real Opportunities for Work) will be initiated involving seniors from Norman Thomas High School in Manhattan.
This project is the brainchild of a volunteer group of former executives from business and education, the Business and School Collaborative. They have devised a plan for high schools seniors to hold full-time jobs while earning school credit.
"The concept is simple," the group's prospectus states. "The best place to train students for work is at the work site. The best trainers are working people. The problem is to provide this training at the workplace and still insure that the student completes his or her education."
With the cooperation of the New York State Department of Labor and the New York City Job and Career Center, students in this project will be given pre-employment training in social skills and attitudes valued by business people. They will then be offered a selection of jobs where they will be trained by mentors for six months. School guidance personnel will monitor student progress. After six months, students will be tested and, if successful, will receive a certificate of completion. They can then choose continued employment or enrollment in college.
Unlike Project ProTech in Boston, Project GROW has operated without public financing and practically without cost. Incidental expenses have been covered by a small contribution from a local corporation. The volunteers in the Business and School Collaborative are donating their time and expertise in the hope that this project can be expanded and become the prototype of a successful apprenticeship program for the students of New York City high schools.
Then, perhaps, we shall see an end to the drift and aimlessness, the bouncing around from job to dead-end job, that characterizes so many of our high school graduates. Then, perhaps, students will find new meaning and value in their schooling, which for too many has seemed to be marking time with no goal in sight.

HEADLINE: Ex-Rep. Richard Ichord, 66, Dies; Led Un-American Activities Panel

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Former Representative Richard H. Ichord, a fervent anti-Communist who crusaded against the peace movement during the Vietnam War and served as the last chairman of the House Un-American Activities Committee, died yesterday at a hospital in Nevada, Mo. He was 66.
He died of complications from a heart attack on Dec. 18, said his daughter, Pam Ichord Ehlers. He had divided his time in recent years between Washington and a cattle ranch in Waynesville, Mo., she said. 
 A conservative Democrat who represented a district in central and southern Missouri, Mr. Ichord (pronounced EYE-cord) spent 10 terms in the House of Representatives before retiring in 1981. He earned a reputation as a man preoccupied by the spread of Communism abroad and at home, where he feared radicals were trying to undermine the Federal Government.
His critics accused him of engaging in smears and witch hunts similar to the activities of Senator Joseph R. McCarthy, Republican of Wisconsin, in the 1950's.
"The kooks of the right and the left say that nobody in Congress should be dealing with such problems, but I think they're wrong," Mr. Ichord said in 1974 when asked about the Un-American Activities Committee. The Communist Party in the United States, he added, "could be a real threat if the country has an economic depression of the 1930's type."
The Un-American Activities Committee earned notoriety in the 1940's and 1950's, when it investigated Alger Hiss and others accused of being Communists. Richard M. Nixon, a little-known Representative from California in that time, gained national attention from the committee's hearings.
After Mr. Ichord was named chairman of the committee in 1969, he used his position to campaign against antiwar protesters. He published a list of "radical orators" at colleges around the country, including Muhammad Ali, Angela Davis, Abbie Hoffman and Dr. Benjamin Spock. Other lawmakers said it represented an effort to stifle dissent.
Mr. Ichord also introduced a bill banning travel to countries with which the United States was at war. The bill was prompted, he said at the time, by Jane Fonda's trip to North Vietnam at the height of the war in Southeast Asia.
The committee was disbanded in 1975, a few years after it had changed its name to the House Internal Security Committee. Mr. Ichord fought to save it, maintaining that it was needed to fight terrorism, crime and other activities.
Mr. Ichord was born on June 27, 1926, in Licking, Mo. He enlisted in the Navy Air Corps in World War II and later earned his undergraduate and law degrees from the University of Missouri.
When he was 32, he became the youngest speaker in the history of the Missouri House of Representatives. In 1960 he was elected to Congress, where he was known for his folksy wit. He also served as a member of the Armed Services Committee.
After he retired, he worked as a lawyer and lobbyist in Washington and served on several corporate boards. The Pentagon awarded him the Distinguished Civilian Service Award, the Army's highest honor for civilians.
Besides his daughter, he is survived by his wife, Millicent, his son Richard and three grandchildren.

HEADLINE: Jobs Without Hope -- A special report;
Solid Jobs Seem to Vanish Despite Signs of Recovery

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MEMPHIS

 BODY:
The nation's economy is staggering out of the recession, say most of the gauges that measure it, but people who are getting jobs again tell a sobering story.
 Many good factory jobs and white-collar office jobs with good wages and benefits are giving way to unstable and mediocre jobs. That makes this recovery different from any other. 
Trends that started in the 1980's have produced a new look to working in America. Part-time jobs, temporary jobs, jobs paying no more than the Federal minimum wage of $4.25 an hour, jobs with no more benefits than a few vacation days are displacing permanent regular jobs that people would lose in layoffs in past recessions and reclaim when business picked up.
 
An Empty Promise
 Now, with corporate giants like General Motors and I.B.M. announcing plans to shed tens of thousands of workers next year, the resilience of the recovery is in some doubt. Retraining for better jobs is proving an empty promise for many workers because the better jobs are not there.
 The problems posed by this kind of feeble recovery can be seen in three very different communities: Brockton, Mass., an old industrial town that was all but flattened by the recession; Wichita, Kan., whose bad luck may be starting only now, and Memphis, which, like most of the South, has suffered in recent years but with a little less unemployment than the national average.
 "What is the definition of a job?" asked Mayor Winthrop H. Farwell Jr. of Brockton, whose worries are shared by officials and residents in all three cities. "Is it to meet expenses and nothing else? That's not good for our long-term interests. The definition of a job is having expendable income to travel, put an extension on the house, make a big purchase."
 With workers in Brockton earning too little to pay for such things, Mr. Farwell sees little hope for the merchants that sell to them and thus for the local economy. "President-elect Clinton has a challenge to meet here," said the Mayor, who, like Mr. Clinton, is a Democrat. "And he won't meet it in four years unless he has some extraordinary powers and a magic wand."
 Some people expect more of Mr. Clinton. Robert Earl Evans, a 35-year-old construction worker here, said he could buy half as much this year -- with his pay of $7.50 an hour until he was laid off a few days ago -- as he could a decade ago. "I made good money until Reagan and Bush got in," he said. "Clinton might sweeten the deal by putting jobs out in the streets for people. Things can't get no more worse."
 In these cities, the disappearance of factory jobs poses sociological questions. "That's the way semiskilled workers move into the middle class and minorities get high wages," said John Gnuschke, head of the Bureau of Business and Economic Research at Memphis State University. "Now there's no real hope of acquiring a single job that will allow them to move up."
 No one can know how strong these trends are. Typically, as businesses come back from a recession, they push employees to work overtime before they commit to more hiring. And in this recovery, they may be using part-time and temporary workers to see how well each fits in. Those who do can be offered full-time jobs as business picks up.
 Employment in factories could recover, too, with more and more American businesses trying to regain a competitive edge over foreign industry.
But one trend that seems to be taking root is a proliferation of jobs in which the old commitments of both sides, worker and employer, are fading. "American employers fill in the first paragraphs of their annual reports with statements like, 'Our employees are our most valuable assets,' " said Tony Redwood, director of the Institute for Public Policy and Business Research at the University of Kansas. "But it's a big lie.
 "They don't treat them as assets. They treat them as an expense."
 And they do so at their peril, Mr. Redwood said, because "to have a quality work force, to compete with Japan and Germany, they'll have to treat them as assets."
 
Brockton
There Is Nowhere To Go but Up
 In Brockton, once the shoe-making capital of America, downtown looks as wasted as any in Appalachia. Most big stores are long gone, leaving Main Street strewn with their carcasses. The working people of this worn and brutal city of 93,000 describe how a responsive economy in the 70's and 80's that had the strength to lift them from their reversals has become a mean economy that drives them to ruin.
 For a while in the 80's, Richard Wolfe, 49, and his wife, Mary-Ann, 54, had two cars and earned about $35,000 a year, sufficient to rear their six children. For 20 years, Mr. Wolfe worked in a warehouse at the General Dynamics shipyard in Quincy; he lost the job in 1985, while the yard was closing down.
 The Brockton Water Department picked him up as a laborer and paid him the same $11 an hour he earned before. A year ago he lost that job in a city budget cut.
 Mrs. Wolfe worked at a sandpaper factory in the early 80's but lost the job when the company left town. She became a data-entry clerk for a shoe wholesaler, earning $6.50 an hour. She was laid off from that job three years ago.
 She took nine months' training in office work -- word processing, filing, typing. Still, neither has had a single offer.
 A big problem is transportation. The Wolfes' last car broke down two years ago. "It cost too much to fix," Mrs. Wolfe said. "My husband sold it for junk. He got $30."
 
Benefits Running Out
 The family lives on Mr. Wolfe's unemployment benefits checks of $502 every two weeks. They expect them to expire in January. Mrs. Wolfe lost her benefits two years ago. Losing the benefits means that the Wolfes will have to turn to the unemployed worker's last resort, the welfare system.
 Some things hint that Brockton's economy is beginning to thaw. In October, unemployment slipped to 9.1 percent after nearly two years above 10 percent. Joseph Notini, Brockton area director for the Massachusetts Department of Employment and Training, said stores added more Christmas workers this year than last. He said he was called out to counsel workers at failing and fleeing businesses once a week now, compared with as often as four times a week last year.
Yet for people who are finding work, these few signs of recovery say little about the pay, benefits and job security. For the first time in Brockton, employment officials there say, most new jobs are temporary or part time, with wages of $5 to $8 an hour.
 For nearly five years, David French, 49, was a machinist-mold maker, earning $10 an hour. He lost the job in June 1991, when the company closed its machine shop. He has found two temporary machine shop jobs, one for 43 days, one for two weeks, and the last ended six months ago. "Every job that's permanent -- there's 10 or 12 people applying," he said.
 
Restaurants Closing Up
 George Bouchard, 34, went to the University of Montana, where he learned hotel and restaurant management. He ran a restaurant in Brockton for seven years, until it closed a year ago. "I was making 40 grand a year," he said. Mr. Bouchard says that he stays in Brockton to be near both his girlfriend, who works in a convenience store, and his father, who is terminally ill in Rhode Island.
 "Here in Brockton alone," he said, "two restaurants have closed in three weeks and a third is up for sale." So Mr. Bouchard has been taking temporary jobs at little more than the minimum wage tending bar and cooking in a fast-food restaurant.
 The one big merchant still downtown, Alexander Rysman, owner of Romm's Jewelers, says his sales, like the nation's economy, have perked up. But he doubts that the trend shows that people are working and earning more. "People buy on the basis of their feelings of hope," said Mr. Rysman, who has a doctorate in sociology from New York University.
 Mayor Farwell said, "If the economy is recovering, I haven't seen it yet."
 
Wichita

 No Longer Recession Proof
 This city never saw the recession. Anyone who really wanted a job had one. Boeing, Beech Aircraft, Cessna, Learjet, the aircraft companies that power the economy here the way steel once drove Pittsburgh, had enough advance orders to go on working as the nation's economy sank. About 25 percent of the jobs here are in manufacturing, in the aircraft plants and the hundreds of job shops that service them. That is well above the national rate of 17 percent.
 But aircraft customers far beyond Wichita that were hit by the recession -- the airlines and corporations that buy executive jets -- have slowed or canceled orders for two years. Military contracts, a smaller part of Wichita's business, slowed, too. Four thousand well-paid aircraft workers of the city's nearly 64,000 in 1990 have lost jobs. With companies like Boeing's biggest customer, United Airlines, mired in losses and talking of canceling orders, more will be laid off in 1993.
 Sylvia Williams had one of the good jobs. She was a member of Wichita's blue-collar aristocracy, an aircraft factory worker. She worked at Boeing. Her father works at Cessna. Her mother, now supervisor of the electrocardiogram department at St. Francis Hospital here, once worked at Beech. Ms. Williams is 26 and has two years of college.
 "I started out there five years ago at $5.60," Ms. Williams said. "I was a mail clerk. I was salaried. They have that line at Boeing. Your're salary or you're hourly. Salary didn't have the union. They kept voting it down. Hourly has the union. Entry level for hourly was $9.60."
 So she decided to quit the mailroom and apply for the higher paying factory job. "I went for the money," she said.
 Eventually Ms. Williams was earning $13 an hour. That meant $26,000 a year, $3,000 more than average for workers in Wichita. Her fiance earns $29,000, so they expected to begin their marriage already rooted in the middle class.
 Then on June 2, Ms. Williams was laid off, one of 2,000 workers Boeing let go in Wichita this year. She collects $231 a week in unemployment benefits, less than half her former pay.
 With the job losses in aircraft, Wichita's unemployment rate has been creeping up to 4.5 percent this fall, from 4 percent a year ago, while the nation's rate has been falling, to 7.2 percent in October, from a peak of 7.8 percent in June. The state's economic forecasters see Wichita's jobless rate rising a little more next year.
 At those levels, Brockton would be a boom town. But the economists say the low unemployment in Wichita masks a troubling trend. The city, with 300,000 people, is becoming a center of low-wage retail and service businesses that depress the standard of living. The biggest new employers are telemarketers, among them reservation clerks for Best Western hotels and order takers for Sears catalogue customers.
 At Boeing, the average factory wage is $17.84 an hour, or $35,700 a year. The state employment service here lists offers of $4.25 to $4.50 an hour for telemarketers, stock clerks, cashiers, fast food workers and an auto mechanic with four years' experience. And many of the jobs are temporary or part time.
 "We're replacing good manufacturing jobs with part-time service jobs that don't provide any benefits," said Pat Lehman, an officer here of the machinists union. "So people still qualify for food stamps."
 She asks Wichita's civic boosters, "Explain to me how that's a boon for the economy?"
 Boeing, the city's biggest employer, provides uncommonly rich benefits for workers. "They have the best you could ever get," Ms. Williams said. Under its contract with the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, Boeing helps people who were laid off and is paying for Ms. Williams to go to Wichita State University for three years. By studying through her summers, she plans to get a master's degree in social work.
 But few of Wichita's service, temporary and part-time workers have patrons like Boeing and the union. Tony Frazier, 35, was laid off from his job as a cook at one of Wichita's better restaurants where he was paid $7 an hour. After that he could only find jobs in fast food outlets, which paid even less.
 "So what I decided to do was get some retraining to learn meat cutting," he said. The father or two children, 3 and 9, and the husband of a part time nurse's aide, Mr. Frazier spent $2,000 to go to butchers school for four months. He wanted a job in a meat packing plant for $10 an hour. Then he found that plants nearby were hiring immigrants from Mexico. "They're willing to take $6 or $7 an hour," he said.
 For many the heaviest burden is health care. Daryl Donaldson, 23, works for a temporary employment service. It assigned him to a company where for $5 an hour, 50 hours a week, he built cold storage equipment. He lost the job when he caught pneumonia.
 "I had it in the Army," he said. "It was just the same." But without health insurance, he said seeing a doctor was out of the question. For four days he stayed in bed at home, a trailer he shares with his father.
 Jon Weaver, owner of Bud's Mower and Saw near Wichita in Hayesville, says he worries about the moral dilemma that the cost of health care poses for his business and his workers. His own monthly insurance premium has risen from $155 to $300 in four years. Providing similar insurance for his one full-time, $5-per-hour employee would force him to raise the prices of his mowers, which he said would scare customers away.
 
Memphis
Low Paying Jobs In the Services
 David Smith, 47, stops by the Ablest temporary help agency to inquire about his paycheck. In his crisp, navy blue windbreaker, button-down plaid shirt and steel-rim glasses, in the confidence of his handshake and the assertiveness of his speech, Mr. Smith could readily pass for a big-time lawyer.
 "I was a land man for oil and gas companies for 10 years," he said. When a company smelled oil on someone's land, Mr. Smith found the owner and acquired exploration and drilling rights. He earned $50,000 to $75,000 a year. Then the industry collapsed. His last day as a land man was June 19, 1990. The Denver office of the oil company he worked for shut down then, putting him and 500 people on the street.
 Mr. Smith went to Louisiana and became a reporter for a small newspaper for $500 a month. This fall, for a little more money, he became an adjuster there for an insurance company helping homeowners file claims after Hurricane Andrew. That work dried up, so he moved to Memphis, where he heard there was work. Ablest found him some in a printing shop on the night shift.
 
Older Men Losing Jobs
 "These are the men we're hearing about through downsizing," said the manager of the Ablest office, Malinda Dawson. "I have seen more older gentlemen, 40 to 60, than I have ever seen before. We've always had older ladies but not that age group of men. They're accountants and vice presidents for finance."
 Like Atlanta, Raleigh, Charleston, Birmingham and Little Rock, Memphis is a hub of the new South that attracts job losers from other regions. In terms of unemployment, Tennessee and the eight states that touch it suffered far less from the recession than the big population centers of the Northeast and California. Their unemployment rate was a little above 6 percent when the nation's was hovering close to 8.
 Memphis, with a population of 600,000, flourished in the 1980's as a city built on services. It is a huge distribution and transportation center, with a port on the Mississippi River, scores of truck lines and the nation's busiest airport at night because of all its freight traffic then.
 Federal Express, a giant of the services industry, sets the wage standard here. Steve Priddy, vice president for personnel administration, says the starting wage for a package handler is $7.51 an hour. In major urban centers, he said full-time couriers earn an average of $15.
 Other services pay less. "In Memphis you can get itty-bitty jobs," said James Savage, 26, who has been laid off from his $4.55-an-hour job as a cook at a company that makes potato chips. He lives with a woman who earns $6.25 as a cook at the Peabody Hotel. "She has a daughter," he said. "The daughter has a baby."
 According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average annual pay in Memphis last year was $23,042, about $2,500 below the national average, $3,600 below Atlanta's average and $12,000 below New York City's. Living is cheaper here, too, but one reason for the lower wages is that Memphis has already landed where Wichita could be heading.
 Big manufacturers -- International Harvester, Ford, RCA, Firestone -- have left town in recent years, and no big newcomers have replaced them. Manufacturing represents only 12 percent of Memphis area jobs now, down from 18 percent before the exodus. As such a small part of the economy, factories do not have to scramble for skilled workers and bid up their wages. So many factory workers earn little more than service workers.
 
Problems of the Urban Poor
 The recovering economy also illuminates the difficulties that the nation's millions of urban poor, in Memphis primarily black, face in finding and keeping jobs.
 Tennessee does little to help prepare people for jobs. The state spends less on education per capita than nearly any other state, it has one of the nation's lowest high school graduation rates, and it has one of the highest poverty rates. Some job seekers visiting a state's employment service offices seem to have learned little of what the employers requires, like getting to work on time. But employers can also treat them severely.
 Ronald Wooden, 30, stopped school in the seventh grade. He said he was dismissed from one job and then another, both paying the minimum wage. "They said I was being late," he said. "It was usually my fault, but when I got there I would work."
 He said he will keep trying. "A man's got to work and make his own wage," he said. "I don't want to sit back and wait on them food stamps."
 David Smith, has at least escaped those problems. The printing company he works for makes display signs that stores use to call attention to things on their shelves. "I help the pressmen operate the printing press," he said. Business is brisk this holiday season, so he is working 12 hours a day, starting at 7:30 P.M., and eight hours on Saturdays.
 His pay? "Five dollars an hour," he said. "I don't like admitting it. It's pitiful. But I'll do anything. I'll dig ditches."
 Without an Ablest to take him on and steer him into a job, he might have no work at all.
 "The thing that is really shocking," he said, "is when a guy like me walks into a McDonald's or a Wal-Mart looking for a job. They look at you like you're crazy."

HEADLINE: A World From Scratch

BYLINE: By G. John Ikenberry; G. John Ikenberry, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, is author of the forthcoming book, "Moments of Creation: The Rebuilding of International Order, 1815, 1919, 1945 and 1990."

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Will the new era be dominated by regional alliances and economic pacts or by a renewal of global and multilateral institutions? The 1990's are shaping up as a struggle between these rival international orders. So far, regional relationships -- in Europe, North America and elsewhere -- have the upper hand. The emerging world order looks like an old house: new rooms, windows and doors have been added, but the foundation, plumbing and wiring remain in dangerous disrepair.
There is a need to make regional economic experiments complement, not compete, with multilateralism. This requires agreement among the major nations about a blueprint of a new world order. 
 Most creative foreign policy in recent years has been directed at regional economic integration, particularly in Europe, North America and Asia. These efforts need not compete with the larger global order. Most studies of European and North American integration conclude that it will create more trade than it diverts. Nor are regional agreements necessarily incompatible with the global regime of GATT: Pulling down internal walls without raising external ones is good for the world economy.
The real danger of regionalism lies elsewhere. Regionalism is difficult to shield from domestic and trans-national political pressures and disputes. The European Community's hard line against Japanese imports suggests how regionalism deepens fault lines. European and North American regionalism also diverts attention from GATT and other multilateral institutions. The "promise" of European unity and the North American free-trade agreement has reduced the political costs should the current round of multilateral trade negotiations fail. In this real sense, regional and global institutions compete.
The task is to fold regional experiments into global institutional reform. Key will be the relationship among the industrial democracies -- the Group of Seven. Some suggest a Group of Seven declaration on the limits and responsibilities of "good regionalism." This would ease fears in Asia and elsewhere about the ultimate aims of recent regional agreements. It would also push the Group of Seven countries to use their next summit to discuss the basic structure of world order. Helmut Kohl and John Major are not Bismarck and Palmerston, and President-elect Bill Clinton certainly has none of the pretensions of Woodrow Wilson, but these leaders must be strongly encouraged to be global architects.
The Group of Seven should also focus on its own inadequate process. The annual summit meetings of heads of state are overly formal, scripted events that produce little more than bland official communiques. Experts -- nicknamed "sherpas" -- do the real work in the months leading up to the meetings. Coordination must be strengthened by turning the summits into informal discussions, while formalizing meetings of ministers and experts.
Global institutional reform must also extend to traditional multilateral organizations -- the United Nations, International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Without a new mission, they look increasingly like relics. Security Council seats for Japan and Germany are inevitable. Negotiations over this issue should be broadened into an effort to make the U.N. more relevant in international disputes. The 50th anniversary of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank in 1994 and of the U.N. in 1995 will be moments of symbolic opportunity. American officials need to articulate a vision of how these global institutions serve our interests and strategy for shaping the emerging order.
Recession and election-year politics have inevitably obscured the big issues of foreign policy. After World War II, Americans were more worried about the economy than in building a new international order. Stalin provided the jolt to the West for united action. Today there is no such stimulus. Leadership and vision will have to make the difference if we are to put our global house in order.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN THE ARTS: ARCHITECTURE/1992;
Barcelona Up, Louis Kahn Down, Philip Johnson Redux

BYLINE: By Herbert Muschamp

 BODY:

All This and Gaudi, Too -- Barcelona played host to the Olympics and captured the gold in architecture with dozens of new parks, squares and streetscapes that expand the possibilities of public space.
 
Department of Landmarks Preservation -- Philip Johnson, 87, parted company with his longtime associate John Burgee and launched a new solo career with projects in Texas, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Germany. 

 Book of the Year -- In "The See-Through Years," Joel Warren Barna offered architecture's answer to "Den of Thieves" -- a sober, morning-after look at Texas architecture in the 1980's.
 
Goodbye, Blue Collar; Hello, Green Necklace -- The New York City Planning Commission's Comprehensive Waterfront Plan, which outlines development along the 578-mile shoreline, highlighted the city's continuing transformation into a post-industrial metropolis.
 
Last Boat for Post-Modernism -- Robert Venturi and Denise Scott Brown, the architects whose ideas launched the now-capsized post-modern movement, won a competition to design the Manhattan Terminal of the Staten Island Ferry, their first New York building.
 
Kahn Watch '92 -- The Salk Institute for Biological Studies in La Jolla, Calif., moved closer to disaster with its proposal for an addition that would compromise the integrity of Louis Kahn's masterpiece, though after a ground-breaking ceremony the institute announced it would restudy the plan.
 
Club Gug -- With projects for new museums in Salzburg, Austria; Venice, and Bilbao, Spain, the Guggenheim Museum seems determined to become the Club Med of the art world, though unless the museums' architects are willing to accept pop-it beads in payment it remains uncertain whether these artistic resorts will fly.
 
Wake-Up Call -- With the force of a sociological earthquake, the riots in South-Central Los Angeles provoked a long-overdue recognition that privatization, laissez-faire and social Darwinism do not an urban policy make.
 
Street Smarts -- Bill Clinton's symbolic walk down an inner city street on his first visit to Washington as President-elect sent a signal that the new Administration will not regard cities as alien territory.

HEADLINE: THE YEAR IN THE ARTS: DANCE/1992;
Russian Flair, Danish Dazzle, Domestic Diamonds

BYLINE: By Jack Anderson

 BODY:

Big Bold Revival -- The Kirov Ballet presentation of Leonid Lavrovsky's "Romeo and Juliet" confirmed that this version from 1940 -- the first Russian staging of the Prokofiev ballet -- remains unsurpassed for dramatic pace and musical sensitivity.
 
Tiny but Terrific -- When it was restaged this fall, "Epic," Paul Taylor's 1957 solo made up of ordinary gestures to recorded time signals, proved an unnerving study in quiet desperation. 

 Transatlantic Fireworks -- The Royal Danish Ballet's spring Bournonville Festival in Copenhagen dazzled the eye with August Bournonville's buoyant 19th-century choreography and prompted scholarly discussions about preservation and revivals.
 
Talking Points -- Despite some unevenness, the New York City Ballet's Diamond Project brought together several stimulating new works in various idioms of the balletic language.
 
Curiosity Arousers -- Dances -- serious and comic, crisp and quirky -- presented on New York stages by such choreographers as David Allen, Nils Christe, Sean Curran, Alonzo King, Tim Martin, Meg Wolfe and Ed Wubbe made one long to see more of their output.
 
Curiosity Quencher -- With its dull choreography and pallid dancers, the Florence Dance Theater of Italy made a decidedly premature New York debut.
 
Awesome Eloquence -- Carmen de Lavallade revealed her remarkable artistic range when she performed Geoffrey Holder's uplifting "Creation" with the Trisler Danscompany and John Butler's harsh "Portrait of Billie" at Jacob's Pillow.
 
Reason for Worry -- Churning out dance after dance, as he did this year, Mark Morris too often confused glibness with inventiveness.
 
Reason to Rejoice -- Although many companies are burdened with debts, managerial flair has enabled Tulsa Ballet Theater in Oklahoma to remodel a former elementary school into an impressive new headquarters and to cross the threshold with the premises paid for.
 
A New Year's Wish -- That all troupes everywhere will solve their economic problems and go on to new artistic achievements.

HEADLINE: FERRY TERMINAL;
A Timely Civic Symbol

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his essay "For Staten Island, a Ferry Terminal Rooted in the Past" [Nov. 22], Herbert Muschamp expresses a limited view of what he thinks a modern ferry terminal should be and goes on to shortchange the design, by Venturi, Scott Brown & Associates in conjunction with Anderson/Schwartz. 
 In writing "the designs of the six finalists ran heavily toward nostalgia" and that the jurors were left to decide only "which nostalgia would be best," he failed to note that during deliberations, the jury's discussion roamed freely over a wide range of functional, technical, social and esthetic issues. The selection of a winning scheme was based on a consideration of all these factors.
Lost in the controversy over the now-famous clock is the fact that the selected scheme features a spectacular waiting room that will rival the great space of Grand Central Station and a plaza that is certain to become one of lower Manhattan's finest public open spaces. Most important, in its operational characteristics, this design addressed the functional aspects of the terminal better than the other proposals.
We also find disturbing Mr. Muschamp's statement that "the whole building has lost track of the time" -- a cute reference to the clock. His superficial view of the building and his mistaken perception of a "nostalgia bias" in the competition program is unfair to the architects as well as the competition sponsors, the New York City Economic Development Corporation and the Department of Transportation.
Throughout the competition, our goal was to develop a ferry terminal that would serve the people of New York for generations to come. From the city's substantial reinvestment in this terminal as the anchor of a revitalized lower Manhattan business district to the technical requirements for energy conservation, the project looks to the future in every way.
Workers and tourists of the next century will be well served by a terminal that accommodates new ferries and provides better passenger movement, more commodious waiting areas and easier connections.
Finally, we are puzzled by the statement that "in calling for architects to create a civic symbol, the program sets forth a notion of civic identity rooted in the past." Civic symbols, like much else, evolve with culture and time. In this competition, New York expected -- and got -- a scheme for the new terminal that will meet the needs of commuters and tourists and bring life and civic symbolism to the Manhattan waterfront well into the next century.
 
CARL WEISBROD, LUCIUS RICCIO
New York
 
The writers are, respectively, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation and commissioner of the New York City Department of Transportation.
 
 Mr. Muschamp replies: The Whitehall Ferry Terminal competition program did indeed include many good features, and so does the winning design. That is why my review of the project was generally favorable. Mr. Weisbrod and Commissioner Riccio, however, have chosen to ignore both my praise of the design and the substance of my criticism, which focused on what I termed the program's "re tro slant."
In a city of magnificent public works, conceived and built in a vigorously progressive spirit, I find it disheartening that the sponsors of this program do not recognize the difference between forward and reverse. Evidently, they believe that mere mention of the magic words "Grand Central Station" should stun us all into grateful silence.
 They also appear to believe that the competition process insures immunity from criticism. On the contrary, competitions and criticism share the common goal of exposing important public projects to wider public debate.

MOSCOW MEETS MADISON AVENUE
The Adventures of the First American Adman in the U.S.S.R.
By Gary Burandt with Nancy Giges.
Harper Business, $22.50. 
 The idea of a Madison Avenue advertising executive opening a giant agency's first office in what was the epicenter of Communism is one of those fish-out-of-water tales that Hollywood delights in calling "high concept." Even if "Moscow Meets Madison Avenue" never becomes a film or even a television sitcom, Gary Burandt's experiences should gain a wider audience through this wry, frank memoir. Mr. Burandt, an executive at Young & Rubicam, which handles clients like Colgate-Palmolive, Johnson & Johnson and Xerox, had the dubious honor of spending a year and a half, beginning in the fall of 1988, to found Young & Rubicam/Sovero, pioneering principles so alien to their new home that the Soviet Encyclopedia once defined advertising as "swindling." Yet despite difficulties in introducing the concept of choice into a society where scarcity reigns, Mr. Burandt found some foundations on which to establish the precepts of consumerism: Moscow is, after all, "a city where people will stand in line 45 minutes for a handout of a tiny free sample tube of toothpaste because usually they stand in line for hours just for the privilege of buying toothpaste." While the book's detailed recountings of the tribulations of acquiring office furnishings in the former Soviet Union are likely to be of limited interest, its broader insights into economics, geopolitics and human behavior, absorbingly described by Mr. Burandt, now the chief executive officer of Dentsu, Young & Rubicam Partnerships, and his co-author, Nancy Giges, the international editor of Advertising Age, should interest even those whose closest brush with advertising comes when they watch a commercial.

HEADLINE: POSTINGS: Long Search for a Site;
An L.I. Olympus Headquarters

 BODY:
For more than two and a half years the Olympus Corporation, the United States arm of Tokyo's Olympus Optical Company Ltd., tried to find a Long Island site for its headquarters. One after the other, seemingly viable sites fell through because of problems with local zoning boards.
Then the New York State Urban Development Corporation, eager to keep jobs on Long Island, came calling. It offered Olympus a lease on 10 percent of a 540-acre site that once housed mentally impaired people in Melville. 
 The price -- $7.2 million up front, applicable to purchase in 10 years -- was certainly right, as were the $40 million in Industrial Development Agency bonds that Suffolk County floated to help the developer, Parr Development, with its financing for the $49 million project.
In June 1994 some 510 Olympus employees, currently scattered throughout Long Island, will move into a new three-story, 250,000-square-foot building designed by the Spector Group, North Hills architects. A state task force is studying what to do with the rest of the land.
The building's actual footprint will only be about two and a half acres, leaving space for parking and landscaping.
"It was a long, exhaustive, frustrating search, so it was terrific to have this land finally come to us," said Patricia Whitlock, Olympus's vice president of corporate resources.

HEADLINE: Houses of Worship Widening Rentals

BYLINE: By CLAUDIA H. DEUTSCH

 BODY:
ABOUT three years ago, the Rev. Darrell Berger took a close look at the income and outgo of the Unitarian Universalist Church at 76th Street and Central Park West and the balance made him blanch. The landmarked church had deferred needed maintenance for decades, and its physical condition was getting dire. The endowment wasn't large enough to cover routine bills, let alone extraordinary repairs, and the congregation was neither rich enough nor large enough to make up the deficits.
But then Dr. Berger had a flash: If the building is the biggest drain on assets, why should it not also be the biggest contributor to them? After all, the sanctuary was used for worship services only on weekends. The church's main hall, conference rooms, gym and kitchens sat idle much of the time, too. And precedents had been set: Various organizations had rented space from the church for more than 20 years. 
 So Dr. Berger hired Fred Seidler to be the church's director of management and marketing. Mr. Seidler, in turn, sent letters and brochures to businesses, theater groups, members -- anyone who might be holding an event. He advertised in New York magazine, Crains New York Business and The Village Voice. He put a display ad in the Yellow Pages. He even put a sign in the large picture window, between the two front doors, saying "Rental Space," and a number to call.
"Some people in the congregation thought that was tacky," Dr. Berger recalls. "I told them, 'I'll take it down when my budget balances.' ".
Dr. Berger is unusual only in the candor with which he discussesrenting space and the comfort level he feels that no tax officials will look askance at any tenants he might accept. Many other religious institutions, fearful that openness about revenues from commercial enterprises will attract unwelcome attention from Federal, state or local taxing authorities, try to keep a low profile about that side of their activities.
But times being what they are, churches and temples are scrambling mightily to close deficits that seem to get wider with every year the stubborn recession continues. And increasingly, they are doing so by marketing their space to outsiders, even those whose activities seem tangentially if at all to be related to the church's mission.
"Renting space has always been an item on a temple's operating budget, but these days everyone is trying to rent more space to more organizations," said Rhoda F. Myers, president of the National Association of Synagogue Administrators.
Mr. Seidler is more succinct. "This is the wave of the future, and churches have to recognize it," he said.
Religious institutions serving as landlords is nothing new, of course. Several churches, including Rutgers Presbyterian on West 73d Street and Trinity Churchin Lower Manhattan, own buildings they rent to nonreligious groups. The Abyssinian Baptist Church in Harlem even has its own development corporation, which has built buildings.
And most churches and temples have long let other nonprofit groups use their sanctuaries or other spaces for meetings, for nominal rentals, or even free. Nearly all rent space to 12-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous and to nonprofit educational or music groups.
TYPICAL example: St. Peter's Lutheran Church in Citicorp Center, well known for its many jazz concerts and other arts events, also rents its living room and kitchen to AIDS groups and other nonprofits for their own functions and fundraisers. "The thrust of our rentals is to cover costs, to make sure we keep the building in operation," said Sue Dennis, St. Peters's business manager.
But lately, the line between renting to other charitable uses and to for-profit groups has blurred. Several churches and temples are renting space to Weight Watchers, a for-profit group. One Connecticut temple is letting an S.A.T.-preparation group hold classes in its space, for a rental fee.
The Stephen Wise Free Synagogue at 30 West 68th Street rents space to Gymboree, a for-profit group, to set up a children's gym on weekday afternoons. Rodeph Sholom, at 7 West 83d Street, is the site of an antique book fair each year; the temple gets rent for the space and charges admission, the dealers keep revenues from the sales. Jan Hus Presbyterian Church at 351 East 74th Street has dozens of public events each week, including theater performances and antique sales.
Even Temple Emanu-El, New York's preeminent Reform Jewish temple, which has never used its ballroom or auditorium to raise revenue, has been "informally" talking about letting members use the space for receptions, said Mark W. Weisstuch, administrative vice president.
Some institutions are even fundamentally altering their spaces to pursue renters.
Until two years ago the auxiliary chapel on the lower level of the Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola was used primarily for parish gatherings and as a shelter for the homeless. But its sheer size and distinctive gothic design gave it potential for much more.
"You didn't have to be a rocket scientist to see what an underutilized asset this was," said the Rev. Walter Modrys, the pastor.
So the church, on Park Avenue and 84th Street, renovated the hall, which now has 8,000 feet of floor space, a 30-foot-deep stage, a kitchen, sound system, even 20 phone lines, should anyone want to hold a phonathon. The space rents for $750 to $3,000 per event, depending on the day of the week and whether the renter is a charity or for-profit group, plus extra labor, table-rental and high-season fees.
Already, it has had an antiques show, benefit dinners and wedding receptions, while continuing to be used for parish activities and, on alternate weekends, as a shelter for the homeless. Father Modrys hopes to get perhaps $40,000 from the hall this year, more when word gets around.
"We are just now learning how to use the hall as a revenue raiser as well as a community resource," he said.
Outside New York, others are doing the same. Temple Beth El in Hollywood, Fla., has never aggressively sought renters for space, in part because it has a lucrative stream of money coming in from a cemetery it owns. But now, with its deficit growing, it has been advertising for a school to rent space it now uses for storage as classrooms.
"Even the largest, richest, Rock of Gibraltar temples are running deficits these days," said Ralph M. Birnberg, the temple's administrator.
Because of tax fears, church and temple officials tend to speak guardedly about space rentals. In fact, Marvin Myers, executive director of the National Association of Church Business Administration in Fort Worth, Tex., says that what appears to be a trend for churches to seek rental income is not, in fact, happening at all.
"They're afraid to be deemed in competition with other businesses that sell space," he said.
Their pivate-sector clients are doing little to assuage those fears. Chase Manhattan refused to talk about a party it held at the Universalist because it feared alienating bank clients that operate for-profit rental space. Jane Swain, the Gymboree liaison with Stephen Wise, would not take calls, and a man who got on the phone would not give his name and said the company would not discuss the arrangement lest publicity place the temple in an unwelcome tax spotlight.
The fears have a legal basis. Religious institutions, like other nonprofit organizations, are tax-exempt organizations under Section 501C3 of the Internal Revenue Code. Since nonprofts do not pay taxes, their costs are lower, and they can arguably compete unfairly with private companies offering space. And even if their costs were the same, the fact that they need not pay taxes on their revenues means they can offer lower prices.
The problem first hit the spotlight in the late 1940's, when the New York University School of Law bought the C.F. Mueller Company, a macaroni company. The I.R.S., wanting to tax the profits, argued that selling macaroni was unrelated to N.Y.U.'s educational mission and that N.Y.U. shouldn't be able to trade on its tax exemption to kill the competition. N.Y.U. disagreed, arguing that the profits from selling the macaroni should be tax-free because all the proceeds were plowed back into N.Y.U.
The tax court ruled in favor of the I.R.S., and N.Y.U. was ordered to pay taxes on the sales. Although the Court of Appeals eventually overturned the ruling, Congress had already imposed a tax on unrelated business income.
To this day, the law remains vague about when money made on activities related to a nonprofit's mission is taxable -- and, in fact, on what kind of activity is so related. Is a concert, a book fair or a prep school part of a church's mission to serve a community? Or is it a thinly disguised commercial activity?
"That's what's really confusing the charities -- figuring out whether a function they have is related to their charitable activities," said Walter R. Bailey, a partner specializing in nonprofit tax matters at Rogers & Wells, a Manhattan law firm.
"Charging for space is not fatal in and of itself," added Eugene L. Vogel, a tax partner at the law firm of Rosenman & Colin, also in Manhattan. "Since a church's mission is social as well as religious, it's probably O.K. to rent to a local bridge club. But they would undoubtedly be taxed if they gave a year's lease to a restaurant."
So far, with no hard-and-fast rule, debates on tax issues continue among nonprofits of all kinds. Recent court decisions forcing television evangelists to pay taxes on many of their perks -- free housing, for example -- and on much of what they sell has made nonprofits even more nervous. When local sales and property taxes come into the picture, the waters grow even siltier.
"The regulations are so fuzzy that we worry sometimes," said the Rev. Jan Orr-Harter, the pastor at Jan Hus Presbyterian Church.
Actually, many of the fears are moot, if only because the taxing authorities show little inclination to crack down on activities at temples and churches whose basic legitimacy they do not question.
"The I.R.S. simply does not care if a local church rents a room to an aerobics class," said Richard R. Hammer, a lawyer who edits Church Law and Tax Report, a national newsletter published in Matthews, N.C.
Apparently, local tax people also offer benign neglect. "As long as rentals don't become their primary business, they have nothing to worry about," said Jon Lukomnik, an assistant commissioner in the New York City Department of Finance.
Still, worry they do. The minority of church and temple officials who will talk on the record about space rentals still tend to stress how restricted their rentals are and how little money they bring in. Temple Israel in Great Neck, L.I., has a full-time caterer and readily holds wedding and bar mitzvah receptions for members. But Vivian Krasnov, the temple's business adminsitrator, says she draws the line at renting for anything else.
"SURE, we're running at a deficit, but renting out space to outsiders isn't the tack we want to take," she said.
The Rev. John A. Huffman Jr., senior minister of St. Andrews Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach, Calif., is adamant that the rent he is paid for concerts held in his church barely covers the costs of the events.
"In no way do we have money-making enterprises for the church," he said. "We continue to believe that God's people should support their work with their tithes."
Such proclamations are increasingly rare. Perhaps because of the continued laissez-faire attitude of the tax authorities, perhaps because of growing fiscal desperation, religious institutions slowly are becoming more open about their quests for paying renters.
The Church of Saint Ignatius Loyola, for one, is unabashedly looking for corporate functions. "We've sent brochures to caterers and schools, and we're looking for more ideas for where to send them," said Robin W. Zeamer, the church's space coordinator.
The Sisterhood of Congregation B'nai Jacob, in Woodbridge, N.Y., uses direct mail and calls to reporters to get more participants in a crafts fair it has held for several years.
"We've become more sophisticated and knowledgeable about how to do these things," said Ms. Myers, a sisterhood member. "Nothing is left to by gosh and by golly, we make sure the local paper knows."
Even the Stephen S. Wise Temple in affluent Bel Aire, Calif., which says it is not in a cash squeeze, is putting ads for its facilities in its member newsletter and is sending reminders to members planning celebrations that the temple has wonderful space.
"The number of weddings and bar mitzvahs that we do has held constant from year to year," said Norman I. Fogel, the temple's executive director. "But the parties are smaller and less elaborate these days, so they're bringing less money in."
Despite the slow-growing acceptance among religious pragmatists that space should be rented, there are built-in restraints that will probably always keep rentals at a fairly moderate level.
For some -- particularly Roman Catholic churches, which must have approval from the archdiocese for any nonchurch event -- renting space can cause more bureaucratic red tape than it is worth. For others, there is not enough space to accommodate all church-related activities and still leave room for regular outside use. Still others, especially in Manhattan, say competition from local concert halls and ballroom spaces remains too high.
"We keep getting the nonprofit groups like the 12-step programs who can't even pay the $100 an hour we want to charge," said the Rev. Robert Davidson, pastor of West Park Presbyterian Church on Amsterdam Avenue and West 86th Street, which makes about 10 percent of its budget from rentals. "The ones that can afford to pay more can rent out Merkin Hall" -- the concert hall on West 67th near Lincoln Center.
And many potential clients -- particularly corporate ones -- think twice before holding a function in a religious building lest they inadvertently offend clients or shareholders or attendees by seeming to favor one sect over another.
"I don't even try to take clients to church spaces anymore, because the board of directors rejects it every time," said Lore Moser, a Manhattan corporate events planner.
Still, the churches and temples are unlikely to stop trying to get renters outside the nonprofit world. One look at the Universalist Church's success can show why.
The Winston Prep School for learning-disabled students just signed a 10-year lease, with option to renew for five, for classroom space in the parish hall. The Karpales rare-manuscript library pays to occupy the sanctuary, which has movable pews, during the week. Wedding receptions are common. The New York Theater Workshop had a spaghetti-night fundraiser. Manhattan Grace Tabernacle uses the space. Chase Manhattan Bank even held a Teller Appreciation Night at the church in the fall.
All told, rentals -- which average $2,500 for weekend events, $1,000 for weekdays -- now account for more than 85 percent of the church's $460,000 budget.
"We're still struggling," Dr. Berger said, "but at least we don't have to dip into our endowment for expenses any more."

Discounters Resound in the 'Quiet Corner'

BYLINE: By ELEANOR CHARLES

 BODY:
NORTHEASTERN Connecticut has for many years been called "the quiet corner," and some uncharitable souls have gone so far as to tag it moribund.
But the 90's are bringing welcome activity to that quadrant of the state as retailers, particularly discounters, seek new markets and large, reasonably priced tracts. 
 Wal-Mart, the big discount retailer based in Bentonville, Ark., will open three stores there totaling 303,000 square feet by next summer. Last year it dipped its toe into the waters when it opened Sam's Club, a shopping club subsidiary, in Manchester.
"They are doing very well," said Mark Pellegrini, director of planning for the town. Around Jan. 5 a new 116,000-square-foot Wal-Mart will open a half-mile away at 420 Buckland Hills Drive, just off Interstate 84.
A 93,000-square-foot Wal-Mart is scheduled to open in the spring 20 miles to the east in the Willimantic section of Windham, followed in the summer by a 94,000-square-foot store in Putnam, 15 minutes from the Rhode Island and Massachusetts borders. Site work has begun on both projects.
Jeffrey Dunne, first vice-president of CB Commercial brokers in Stamford, acted for the Bank of Boston in negotiating the $1.1 million sale to Wal-Mart of its 75-acre site in Windham.
"Northeastern Connecticut has not been a hotbed of activity," he said, "and these are not going to be Wal-Mart's highest volume stores. But the company is known for locating in rural areas and they are focusing on those areas strongly in Connecticut. We have six or seven other sites around the state that they are looking at."
Wal-Mart operates 1,838 stores nationwide with $43.8 billion in sales, and 256 Sam's Clubs, with sales of $9.4 billion. Jane Arend, a company spokeswoman, said 150 new Wal-Marts and 35 new Sam's Clubs were expected in 1993.
Discount stores, factory outlets and member clubs began proliferating in the state in 1989, when New England was falling deep into recession and discount shopping gained wide acceptance. They sprang up along the shoreline from Fairfield to Mystic and up the central corridor from Milford to Enfield.
Manchester, a town of 27 square miles with a population of 51,500, became the first shopping mecca east of Hartford when the upscale 900,000-square-foot Buckland Hills Mall opened off I-84 in 1990. It is the eastern alternative to the Westfarms Mall, a 15-year-old complex of 1 million square feet in West Hartford, now planning a major expansion.
The Manchester mall created a climate for continuing retail activity along I-84.
"In the past year we acquired a Home Depot, a Builder's Square and a Pace Club," said Mr. Pellegrini, referring to another shopping club, whose parent company is Kmart of Troy, Michigan. "There are no established neighborhoods in the area so we have no classic 'nimby' opposition when commercial development is proposed. We still have 380 vacant acres north of I-84."
In all, 600,000 square feet of retail have opened, excluding the mall, and 600,000 square feet await final approvals by town boards, including a Sports Authority, Office Max, Pier l Imports, and a 430,000 square foot shopping center to be built next year by Melvin Simon Associates of Indianapolis.
The new Wal-Mart in Windham will be opposite Windham Airport on Route 6, a major east-west highway. It will occupy 29 of the 75 acres, with surface parking for 1,200 cars. "Eventually there will be other free-standing stores," said James Finger, Windham's town planner.
Situated between the University of Connecticut at Storrs with 15,000 students, and Eastern Connecticut State University at Willimantic with 5,000 students, a customer base of more than 55,000 is virtually guaranteed when combined with Windham's population of 22,000 and shoppers from a dozen or more outlying rural communities.
Important to Windham is the prospect of almost 200 Wal-Mart jobs opening up. The town lost its major employer and taxpayer in 1985 when the American Thread Company moved south. Plans for developing the vacant mills it left behind have not materialized.
PUTNAM'S population of 9,000 covers 21 square miles, but its Mayor, Daniel Robero, said about 6,500 people live in an area of less than four square miles. "The rest is open country with houses on large tracts of uncultivated farmland," he said. "We were surprised and happy when Wal-Mart applied here. We have the space and we are pushing for new business and industry."
The Wal-Mart store will occupy 15 acres of a 47-acre tract at the intersection of I-395 and Route 44. Wal-Mart bought one of six parcels for an undisclosed sum in a commercial subdivision under development by Putnam Parkade Inc., a division of First Hartford Realty of Manchester.
The 47-acre tract was purchased for $1.79 million last summer from William Moser, a local real estate investor and owner of Wimco Printing Company, which will continue to occupy six acres of adjacent land.
"We see Wal-Mart having a trickle-down effect already," said Mayor Robero. "We have approved plans for a McDonald's, a Kentucky Fried Chicken and an Edwards Supermarket near or on the site." Edwards is a division of First National, the parent of Finast Supermarkets.
Charles Boster, executive director of the Northeastern Connecticut Council of Governments in Brooklyn, a regional planning agency for 7,000 people in 10 towns, bristles at the "quiet corner" designation. "We are a blue-collar industrial area with many fabrication and distribution companies, about an hour from Worcester, Providence and Hartford, and an hour and a half from Boston and New Haven. We have an overall economic development plan to increase our manufacturing capacity and attract jobs."
"Retailing," he added, "has been building our commercial base nicely. We have a number of discount department stores -- Kmart, Ames, Fair from Massachusetts and Big Wheel from Rhode Island. Wal-Mart will be the largest in our region."
These outlying shopping centers are expected to hasten the decline of more business districts in cities and small towns. "Main Street," said Mr. Pellegrini, the Manchester town planner, "needs reinventing."

HEADLINE: 1992: The Year in Style

BYLINE: By WILLIAM GRIMES

 BODY:
QUEEN ELIZABETH called 1992 "annus horribilis." In plain old American English, the year was a royal pain. The recession continued to bite hard. So did Dracula. It was a great 12 months for bondage wear, body piercing and sex with ice picks.
Everything seemed to hurt. Ross Perot, representing a triumph of anti-style, won hearts, minds and votes by offering a deficit-busting plan built on shared pain, a kind of Perot Workout that he said would help the body politic shed $3 trillion worth of unsightly flab. The year's top fashion accessory was inspired by a disease, with Hollywood and Broadway actors displaying red lapel ribbons to show solidarity with people with AIDS. The year's top toy, a Schwarzenegger-size water gun, turned the old-fashioned squirt gun into a brutal assault weapon that sometimes provoked return fire from actual Uzis. 
 Sharon Stone, the ice-pick queen, started things off right. In posters for the movie "Basic Instinct," her nails sliced bloody furrows straight down Michael Douglas's back. Love hurts.
The signs of guilt were everywhere. Evidently we all behaved much worse in the 80's than anyone imagined. We need to be punished. We want to be punished. Gianni Versace showed enough leather and restraint straps to subdue Hannibal Lecter. The New York Post ran a three-part series on the world of dominatrixes and their slaves. The United States is fast becoming a country in which mainstream readers can be expected to know the difference between a seven-inch and a nine-inch patent leather heel.
There was lots of hardware and body piercing in Madonna's book "Sex," which was strong on hype but weak on scholarship. The Village Voice quoted a dominatrix ridiculing Madonna for not knowing the difference between a dominant and a submissive shoe. The book did have an aggressively pierced binding, though.
Not everyone resorted to clamps and needles to make a point. But the pressure was strong to have serious views on serious, preferably planet-threatening issues and to express them loudly and often. Sinead O'Connor ran away with top honors, ripping up a photograph of the Pope on "Saturday Night Live." The audience was befuddled. She later explained that the rip job was a protest against the political power of the Catholic Church.
Less spectacularly, the politically aware, ecologically concerned, multiculturally empowered citizen sported African-accented Cross Colours clothing, a baseball cap emblazoned with a large "X" (in homage to Malcolm X and the Spike Lee movie of the same name), Nike athletic wear trimmed in African kente cloth patterns and a Smith & Hawken canvas jacket with tagua-nut buttons (a renewable rain forest crop).
The heavily trafficked two-way street between politics and fashion took a bizarre turn in the Presidential election, which cranked up the J.F.K. fever all over again, just when Oliver Stone had finally shut up. No sooner had the voters learned to relive the assassination than they were asked to go through the 1960 campaign. It was like watching another movie, "J.F.K.: The Prequel." In a drive called Rock the Vote, assorted pop-music figures urged the young viewers of MTV to get to the polls and, uh, make a difference.
So, cool. The guy with the sunglasses and saxophone actually won. Make way for the 60's generation, now sporting a spare tire around the midriff, two or three kids and interesting personal histories. The baby boomers have grabbed the brass ring of leadership with a certain amount of anxiety over past indiscretions -- things that happened in the 60's and may be a little hard to explain to the children.
Generational anxiety was covertly expressed by Hillary's headband, an attempt to send out reassuring, demure signals that might soften her image as a smart, ambitious boomer with a genuine career. To make doubly sure, she baked chocolate-chip cookies for about a week.
As the baby-boom generation put on its best Sunday school suit (saying, "We swear we're responsible and fully capable of running the country"), something retro, funky, down and dirty was happening to Americans in their 20's. The term is grunge, a potent fashion, music and comprehensive life-style statement involving heavy-feedback guitars, greasy hair and thrift-shop clothing, with special emphasis on ripped jeans and flannel shirts. The attitude is a limp, glassy-eyed numbness. Picture Neil Young cryogenically preserved in 1972 and unthawed 20 years later.
The glamour couple of grunge is Kurt Cobain, lead singer and guitarist of the rock group Nirvana, and his slatternly fairy-tale bride, Courtney Love of the all-woman band Hole. Their admirers can buy $700 grungewear from Marc Jacobs.
The 1970's came back with a happy face, too. Platform shoes, a bit of fashion excess that everyone knew could never be revived, were revived. So were long skirts. "The Brady Bunch" became a very O.K. pop-culture reference.
The postmodernizing of television continued apace. The Saturday morning schedule became clogged with half-hour infomercials in which bouncy spielers and venal stars appeared on fake talk-show sets for in-depth discussions of hair products, vegetable juicers and fat-burning systems. Alarmingly, some programs were more fun to watch than "Arsenio Hall." Likewise, the faux anchors on the Buick commercials looked more authoritative than all the local news teams in New York.
Mr. Perot pulled serious prime-time ratings standing in front of a chart and explaining economic policy. He was definitely more entertaining than "Arsenio Hall," although many viewers felt that a half-hour was a long time to wait for a punch line. Others thought they were watching a pilot for a new series.
Fashion, which once dealt in enigmatic silences, suddenly began to speak. When Cindy Crawford wasn't shaking it all over the place for her exercise video, she took to the microphone in "House of Style," her fashion report on MTV. Christie Brinkley did the same on CNN for a brief shining moment before being canceled.
For some Americans, it was all too much. Fear for the future has brought on regressive symptoms. In New York, the nightclub reconfigured itself as playpen and playground. Marky Mark became the poster child of the baby teens, smiling with sweet innocence in his Calvin Klein underwear from billboards around the country.
Urban homeboys began sucking on pacifiers, the next, regressive step in the hip-hop uniform of backward baseball cap and backward, drooping jeans, suggestive of a 5-year-old who got dressed without his mom around to supervise. Madonna's spanking fetish suddenly began to look prescient, as did Ms. O'Connor's baby-bald head. Semioticians continue to work overtime interpreting the pacifier as a cultural sign, which is undeniably disturbing.
Too many signals, too little time.

HEADLINE: New Health System Must Include Dental Care

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Any overhaul of the health-care system must recognize the mouth and teeth as an essential part of the body. I urge President-elect Clinton to propose legislation that includes oral health care in basic medical care. Consider that at least 21 million work days are lost annually as a result of oral disease. 
 The Department of Health and Human Services, in "Healthy People 2000," issued in 1990, recognized dental services among national health goals for the decade. This should include all Americans who lack access to essential oral health care and preventive services because they do not have employer-provided or individual insurance, have insurance with inadequate coverage, or are ineligible for or do not know how to avail themselves of public health programs for the poor -- the categories of citizens Mr. Clinton proposes to help.
While there has been a reduction in dental disease, primarily in children, dental disease remains a national problem, particularly among lower socioeconomic groups, minorities and the elderly. To use just two indicators, 30,000 new cases of oral cancer occur each year, and 8,000 individuals die from it. Many of these cases would not have occurred if dental health insurance had eased the way to early detection and treatment for the 37 million Americans who are without dental insurance and the 53 million who are underinsured.
Similarly, at any given moment, about half of the United States population experiences untreated gum infection, which can lead to destructive periodontal diseases and permanent tooth loss. To these conditions add chronic facial pain, which is estimated to cost the public $15 billion a year in treatment and time lost. We are confronting a national public health problem of appalling proportions.
Adequate dental coverage should extend to all employees and their dependents; the elderly, for whom Medicare does not provide dental coverage; the unemployable ill and disabled; people between jobs; early retirees, students and the homeless. Dentistry, among all health fields, proves that the best and most cost-efficient health care is prevention and early treatment -- goals at the heart of Mr. Clinton's reform initiative.

HEADLINE: Russian Economic Reform Loses a Friend in Ousted Gaidar

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In "No More Radical Reform" (Op-Ed, Dec. 15), David M. Kotz writes about the ouster of Russia's acting Prime Minister, Yegor T. Gaidar, and the apparent end of Russia's shock therapy approach to economic reform. Professor Kotz judges Mr. Gaidar's term a failure and states that the West should have no regrets over his departure. I believe this appraisal of Russian economic reform is misleading. 
 Professor Kotz attacks a "free-market plunge" that worsened a crisis, resulting in upward-spiraling prices. Russia is experiencing significant inflation, but not because of Mr. Gaidar's economic reforms. The source of the inflation is the Russian Central Bank's decision last spring to open generous lines of credit to unprofitable state-run enterprises.
In essence, the Central Bank began to print money, and the result was a sharp increase in inflation, running at about 30 percent a month. Until last month, the Central Bank was outside the control of President Boris N. Yeltsin, and there was little he or Mr. Gaidar could do to counteract its end run around shock therapy reform.
Professor Kotz contends that under the new Prime Minister, Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, economic change will continue, although "likely to take place more gradually, with greater Government guidance." As scholars of the former Soviet Union know, "gradual" economic reforms have a poor track record in Russia. Innovative schemes were often announced with great fanfare during the Soviet period, only to fizzle out after a year or two (for example, Aleksei N. Kosygin's 1965 reform plan).
Bureaucratic veterans of the Khrushchev and Brezhnev eras learned to make approving noises when reforms were announced. They also learned not to commit themselves to reforms in any profound way, lest they lose their posts when the new approach was abandoned. One virtue of the shock therapy approach is that it signaled bureaucrats and managers of state enterprises there would be no return to old practices.
The removal of Mr. Gaidar represents a serious blow to reform in Russia. Those in the West who want to see Russia integrated into the international community of nations will in retrospect view his departure with great regret.

HEADLINE: Profile/Jiro Yanase;
Selling Cadillacs in Japan

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
TO those who think it is tough to sell American cars in Japan today, Jiro Yanase would like to tell you about 1921, when Japan was so poor that his father, the General Motors dealer, sold only three vehicles all year. Or about World War II, when anyone connected with American cars was considered a traitor.
"Terrorists threw stones at us," he recalled. "But we never took down the Pontiac and Oldsmobile signs in our service center." 
 Long before it became a trade issue, Mr. Yanase (pronounced ya-na-seh) was carrying coals to Newcastle. Yanase & Company has been the main General Motors dealer in Japan since Mr. Yanase's father, Chotaro, started importing Buicks and Cadillacs in 1915. It has also been the dealer for Mercedes-Benz and Volkswagen for four decades. At one time, the company so dominated sales of foreign cars here that people would say they were buying a "Yanase" rather than a Cadillac or Mercedes.
But now, just as General Motors and other American auto makers are making a major push to boost sales here, Mr. Yanase's dominance of the import car market appears to be slipping.
While they still account for only 4 percent of the Japanese market, foreign cars have become more commonplace than they were 10 years ago. And Mr. Yanase, a peppery 77-year-old, is having to adjust to the notion that imported cars should be mass market items sold at low prices, rather than the high-priced luxuries they were in the past.
Volkswagen, which accounted for almost 60 percent of Yanase's automobile sales by units, is splitting from Yanase at the end of this month and setting up its own dealer network because it wants to double its sales in Japan, which Mr. Yanase thinks is impossible. Mr. Yanase, who likens the relationship between manufacturer and dealer to that between man and woman, severed the relationship with the German car company rather than share it with another lover.
Mercedes, while still selling most of its cars through Yanase, has also created its own dealer network -- a "mistress," Mr. Yanase grumbled.
These moves raise questions about the strategy of General Motors, which, if anything, is becoming more dependent than ever on Yanase.
In addition to being the exclusive distributor of G.M.'s North American cars, Yanase in January will become the Japanese distributor for Adam Opel A.G., G.M.'s German subsidiary. Moreover, the desire not to offend Yanase has caused G.M. to balk at an offer Toyota made in January, during President Bush's trip here, to sell 5,000 G.M. cars a year in Japan. G.M. might eventually reach an agreement with Toyota, but only if Yanase is cut into the deal as the importer.
"At least for the foreseeable future, it seems like Yanase and G.M. are getting closer together," said James E. Steinhagen, vice president of marketing, sales and service for General Motors Japan, who said the company is pleased with Yanase. In Japan, where car dealers retain long-term relationships with customers and often visit them in their homes, "the black book Yanase has of customers is very important," he said.
IN October, in fact, G.M. arranged for Mr. Yanase to fly to Washington, where he was presented with a certificate of appreciation from the Commerce Department and a pair of White House cuff links inscribed with President Bush's autograph. "I wear the cuff links every day and make a firm determination to sell more American cars," said Mr. Yanase.
It has taken a fair degree of determination for Mr. Yanase to get to where he is today. Yanase & Company, which still sells one out of three imported cars in Japan, is a privately held firm with annual revenues of roughly $4 billion and hundreds of sales and service outlets. It has 6,000 employees, most of whom he prohibits from driving to work so as to leave crowded roads free for customers.
Having diversified beyond cars, Yanase & Company now gets more than 10 percent of its revenues from importing and selling yachts, fancy clothing, racquetball courts, snow-blowers and even teddy bears. Mr. Yanase owns 10 percent of the company with banks and insurance companies owning much of the rest.
A dapper man with gold-rimmed glasses, bushy white eyebrows and a silver mustache, Mr. Yanase recounts the past like a grandfather who relishes telling the old war stories over and over again.
In the mid-1920's, he recalled, both G.M. and Ford established factories in Japan and quickly came to control virtually the entire market. But in the 1930's, as Japan's Government became militaristic, it began to nurture its own fledgling automobile industry. Foreign car sales were banned in 1939 and the two American companies had to close their factories.
Yanase hung on through the war by servicing American cars already in Japan, many of which were being used by the Japanese military. "Before the war," Mr. Yanase said, "the Navy had nothing but Buicks."
STILL, business was so bad and future prospects so poor that Mr. Yanase's father decided in 1945 to shut down the company. Mr. Yanase urged his father to reconsider. His father did, but turned the company over to his 29-year-old son, who kept the business alive during the American occupation by taking orders for G.M. cars from American soldiers about to return to the States.
In 1960, imported cars were allowed in Japan but with quotas. Mr. Yanase and some others planned the first imported automobile show to be held in Tokyo's Hibiya Park, just outside the Emperor's palace. But after the cars had been lined up for display, an order came prohibiting the exhibit in Tokyo. Mr. Yanase and other organizers drove the cars overnight to a beach several hours from Tokyo and held the show there.
Despite his long history butting heads with Japan's bureaucracy, or maybe because of that, Mr. Yanase now maintains that there are no more trade barriers in Japan. The last of the import tariffs and luxury taxes that once made foreign cars so expensive was eliminated in 1989, he said.
The market is "completely open -- no jacket, no blouse, no brassiere," he said, flinging his arms out as if to rip off his clothes. "Everything is completely open."
To be sure, prices here of foreign cars are still higher than in their home markets because of transportation costs, modifications mandated by Japanese rules and steeper dealer markups. For example, a fully equipped Pontiac Grand Am has a sticker price of more than $22,000 here, compared with $18,000-$19,000 in the United States.
Mr. Yanase also defends his country by noting that Japan imports more American cars than the European Community does, an argument which ignores the fact that G.M. and Ford are major players in Europe through their own factories there.
Mr. Yanase said it is his "dream" to see foreign car market share in Japan rise to 10 percent from its current 4 percent, but he thinks that is unrealistic. "If the share increases to the 6 percent level, that would be a big success." By contrast, foreign cars, including those made in the United States by foreign companies, hold about 30 percent of the American market.
He said he expects little to result from President Bush's trip here in January, because the agreements to sell more American cars were made by people who don't understand the import business.
General Motors missed the imported car boom in the 1980's, as did Ford and Chrysler. Foreign car sales here more than quadrupled over the decade, to a peak of 221,706 units in 1990, before dropping because of Japan's economic slump to an estimated 180,000 in 1992.
But over the same period, General Motors' sales here actually fell from 5,979 in 1980 to 1,265 in 1985 before climbing to 9,261 last year, a level that should remain roughly the same this year. By contrast, BMW and Mercedes each sell more than 30,000 vehicles a year here and Volkswagen/Audi sells 50,000.
Mr. Yanase, who has long driven a Cadillac, said G.M. cars in the early 80's were too big for Japan and the quality was below Japanese standards, which go beyond merely having an engine that works. About 10 years ago, he said, he brought G.M.'s head of quality control to the pier in Yokohama and lined up 20 G.M. cars, fresh off the boat along with 20 Yanase customers. All the customers said they would not buy the cars, generally because the paint was slightly scratched.
"THE quality control man said, 'What does that have to do with the engine?' " Mr. Yanase said. "But customers were paying a large amount of money and they wanted to have perfect cars." Now, he said, G.M. cars have improved in quality and fuel efficiency.
"If G.M. would be willing to export Saturn to Japan, I believe we could sell 30,000 cars in Japan," he said, referring to the new G.M. hit model that was designed specifically to compete with Japanese products. G.M. has not yet modified Saturn for sale in Japan, although it has promised to do so eventually.
Mr. Yanase, who has known generations of G.M. chairmen, is hopeful the new chief executive, John F. Smith Jr., will improve the ailing company's fortunes.
"In the long history of G.M., the chairman and the president have been gentlemen who looked best in dinner jackets or business suits," he said. "But Mr. Smith looks good in a working suit."
At 77, Mr. Yanase needs a plan for a change of management at his own company.
IN 1985, Mr. Yanase turned over the presidency to his son-in-law, Takahide Inayama, the blue-blooded son of a former president of Nippon Steel. But Mr. Inayama did not work out and Mr. Yanase stepped back in in 1987.
While Mr. Yanase still puts in full days at the office, he has become an avid photographer, a hobby he started at age 61.
During Mr. Yanase's trip to the United States in October, G.M. executives were startled when the limousine carrying him suddenly stopped in one of Detroit's more run-down neighborhoods. Out popped Mr. Yanase to take pictures of an old church.
His conference room is adorned with enlargements of photographs. Perhaps fittingly after such a long career, his specialty is sunsets.

The Many Temptations of Chile

BYLINE: By Nathaniel C. Nash

DATELINE: SANTIAGO, Chile

 BODY:
DEEP economic change has been wrought throughout Latin America -- Governments have created balanced budgets, low inflation and real growth, replacing deficits, hyperinflation and recession. No country has produced more change and more results than Chile.
Analysts tout Argentina for its privatization program and Mexico for its free trade agreement with the United States, but Chile is the model of reform and stability. Begun in the early 1980's under the military Government of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, free-market reforms have been continued by the civilian Government of Patricio Aylwin. 
 Housing Minister Alejandro Foxley announced last week that 1992 would be the country's best year in three decades with 10 percent real economic growth, 4.5 percent unemployment, a 5 percent increase in real wages, 13 percent inflation and a 19 percent investment rate. He also said the country has lifted about 700,000 people out of poverty.
Thus, it is not surprising that the Chilean stock market has risen more than 22 percent this year, when other markets in what are now known as emerging nations have fallen by as much as 50 percent.
"The Chile play is one of high growth and stability," said Jose Miguel Barros, director of the brokerage firm Larrain Vial S.A., who added that Chile's market was considered more a mature market than a speculative emerging one. "People who invest here are betting that Chile will be a developed country in 15 years," he said.
But it has not been an entirely smooth year. During the first half of 1992, foreign investment flooded the country, growth averaged more than 11 percent and the market soared 24 percent. Such a heated economy needed adjustments, and the stock market reflected some of that uncertainty in the second half of the year.
To keep growth in check and inflation down, the central bank raised interest rates. Investors left the market worrying that the Government would cut electricity rates and hurt the profitability of energy companies. Also, pension funds sold some of their holdings to avoid overconcentration. These factors tended to depress prices after July, but since November, share prices have recovered much of the losses and analysts say the worst is past.
"Investors will be returning to the market in 1993," said Andres Zabala, general secretary of Citicorp's brokerage house in Santiago. "A lot of the problems were technical in nature. The fundamentals are positive, inflation is down, growth will be strong."
It is critical to the country to maintain a competitive export sector. Therefore, some control will be inevitable over the inflow of investment dollars and holding time for those investments. As dollars flow in, they put upward pressure on the Chilean peso. Since the Government cannot afford to let the peso get overvalued, which would hurt the competitiveness of the nation's exports, investors have to accept some limitations on their activity.
Currently, the central bank requires a 30 percent reserve for foreign investments, and investors here are required to keep capital in the country for at least three years. However, they can remit profits at any time and the Government is expected to reduce the holding time on capital to one year.
Investors who have been here over the last three years have been rewarded for their troubles. Since the beginning of 1990, the 40 largest stocks on the Santiago Stock Exchange have surged almost 400 percent.
The First Boston Corporation, in a recent investment newsletter on Latin America, described the Chilean market as "a solid long-term buy" and noted that despite problems with higher interest rates, "many countries in Latin America would love to have the same problems of overheating that Chile is experiencing."
The stock market here is dominated by Chile's large electricity generating and distribution companies -- Endesa, Enersis, Chilectra and Chilgener -- which make up almost 40 percent of the Ipsa Index, Chile's equivalent of the Dow Jones industrial average.
Other major stocks include Telefonos de Chile, the privatized telephone company; Cervezas, the dominant beer company, and Copec, a large energy concern.
Foreign investors have several options. Three companies trade American depository receipts in the United States: Telefonos, Cervezas and Chilectra.
There are also four closed-end funds with a total asset value of $1 billion that can be used to invest in a broad range of Chilean stocks. The Chile Fund Inc. is traded on the New York Stock Exchange; the other three -- the Five Arrows Chile Fund Ltd., the GT Chile Growth Fund and the Genesis Chile Fund Ltd. -- are traded in London.
At this point, Telefonos de Chile seems to be the pick of many money managers. Although its current price-earnings ratio of 18-to-1 is higher than, say, Telmex of Mexico, there are reasons to justify a higher price.
The Chilean concern has a higher backlog of lines to be installed. Chilean demand for telephone lines is expected to be higher than in Mexico, and Telefonos de Chile also has large segments of unregulated markets, like the cellular phone business here.
Analysts said Chilectra should be considered a play on the future economic growth of Chile, but cautioned that Cervezas, which until recently had a monopoly in the beer market, had lost market share this year to Argentine competitors.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Cashing In Big: The Bad Boys of Currency

BYLINE: By Allen R. Myerson

 BODY:
FORGET about investment bankers. Never mind the arbs. The bad guys this year were the currency traders.
George Soros and his ilk are said to have sailed off with plunder even the pirates at Drexel might have envied. "During the French Revolution such speculators were known as 'agioteurs' and they were beheaded," said Michel Sapin, the French finance minister. 
 Such abuse has provoked a defensive backlash: Next thing you know the currency traders might organize to demand fair representation in the Clinton cabinet. They want respectful language for starters.
"Hey, have you ever noticed how bond and equity buyers are known as investors, and currency buyers are known as speculators?" asked one London trader, who threatened terroristic acts if quoted by name. He plans to continue terrorizing any European central bankers who try to prop up their currencies.
American central bankers want to preserve what's left of Europe's monetary system, but say there's little they can do. With no obligation to defend exchange rates, the Fed intervenes only modestly, firing a few shots over, rather than into, the speculative mobs.
But more and more, the world's currency crises and economic woes have a way of becoming America's. Daily currency trading has risen by half in three years, to a trillion dollars. Foreign exchange managers have become crucial to planning and profitability.
Since 1985, exports have grown 84 percent, from $312 billion to $576 billion. A major reason small stocks are pacing the market is that larger companies depend more on exports or production abroad. An I.B.M. emissary recently in Brussels saw customers scaling back plans for conquering the continent. Their cutbacks in computer orders are a major cause of I.B.M.'s crisis.
Most economists expect the dollar to further strengthen next year, also a potential blow to exports. Last week, it reached 1.60 marks, up from September's low of 1.39. Future gains, many now say, will come more from lower interest rates abroad than higher rates at home.
The long bond yield, which peaked three days after the election, has fallen since then, to 7.36 percent last week. Next year, Bill Clinton's immediate success will depend less on currency than bond traders, another contrary lot.
The President-elect's choice of economic advisers and his avowed willingness to cut spending plans to narrow the deficit have calmed these agioteurs so far.
But if the bond traders suspect Mr. Clinton of overstimulating the economy, they will push interest rates high enough to rob him of his intended effect.
For now, Mr. Clinton shows signs of acting like any sensible new chief executive brought in from the outside: Announce that your predecessor made a bigger mess of things than anyone had suspected, then blame the harsh measures that will quickly follow on him.
A more plausible strategy, perhaps, than importing a guillotine.

HEADLINE: The Executive Computer;
Watching I.B.M., and Wondering Whether to Buy?

BYLINE: By Peter H. Lewis

 BODY:
JOHN F. AKERS would probably agree with Queen Elizabeth II that 1992 was a horrid year. Mr. Akers's International Business Machines Corporation, once the king of the computer companies, has lost more than half its stock value this year and will report a second consecutive annual loss. Its full-employment, no-layoff policy is history; its fat dividend on the chopping block.
The litany of I.B.M.'s woes has been recited to investors many times in recent weeks, in excruciating detail. But what is the outlook for customers? With the corporation in such disarray, does it make sense to pledge allegiance to Big Blue? 
 "If you're an old I.B.M. customer, and you're on one of their mainframe or AS/400 systems, you have little choice. You will stay with I.B.M.," said George F. Colony, president of Forrester Research Inc. of Cambridge, Mass. "This week's news will not cause customers to dump their big systems."
But what about the smaller systems? Is it safe to buy PC's and PS/2's and RS/6000 work stations?
"I don't think what's happening at I.B.M. financially should affect a purchasing decision," said Jim Seymour, a consultant in Austin, Tex., who advises many large corporations. "Of every corner of I.B.M., the ones that are working best are its work station and PC businesses. In the worst case, if I.B.M. craters and is forced to spin off its working groups, these would be the most resilient, stable and profitable entities."
Mr. Colony of Forrester Research is not so sure. "The risk is that you'll be buying today from a company called I.B.M. that will not exist two years from now," he said. "It may be five companies, or a new company that doesn't exist yet, or one under drastically new management, or one that is financially unstable. It's financially unstable today, but it could be more so in a few years."
Others are less pessimistic. At the Comdex/Fall trade show last month, I.B.M. had, hands down, the best array of new and prototype products of any computer maker. The prototypes range from pocket-sized computers that doubled as cellular phones to speech recognition systems that promise to allow executives to dictate a letter and have it appear on screen as a word-processing document. And I.B.M.'s Personal Computer Company has unleashed a barrage of impressive products, including low-cost PC's for the corporate market that are selling faster than I.B.M. can make them.
For all its problems, I.B.M. remains synonymous with corporate computing.
"If you have a humongous network, a lot of iron, I.B.M. still has a lock," said M. Arthur Gillis, a veteran computer consultant in New Orleans. "Top management and company directors like the security blanket. The minute you start getting into vast commitments, that's where I.B.M. excels."
Mr. Colony did observe that the long-time customers "are looking at transition strategies away from I.B.M., what I call exit strategies," adding, "They're looking two or three years down the road to see how they might get away from I.B.M."
The problem isn't that I.B.M. cannot make good mainframes; its newest systems are considered to be the best in years. The problem may not even be technical. Even in the early 1980's, top I.B.M. executives were committing the company to a strategy of doubling in size every five years and building an infrastructure to support that growth.
It is clear, however, that I.B.M. tried for too long to protect its fat mainframe profits by being cautious about small computers, which are replacing mainframes in many businesses.
When a company casts a cold eye on the dollars, and weighs them against performance benefits, it often concludes that it is cheaper and more effective to replace a mainframe with a network that harnesses the power of lots of cheaper computers, and puts the information closer to the people who need it.
Yet I.B.M.'s big systems -- the mainframes and related businesses -- are still crucial to the operation of many large companies. For all the talk of downsizing -- the process of shifting critical company applications from a central mainframe to a network of smaller, cheaper computers -- there are simply some applications that require the storage and processing power of a multimillion-dollar mainframe.
Mainframe computers were the backbone of large companies for decades. Today they are still used for handling large data bases, transaction processing, inventory management, corporate accounting and other enterprise-wide chores. However, just as smaller computers get more powerful, networks of computers are replacing central mainframes for many traditional tasks.
An analogy might be the decline of railroads, the Big Iron of a century ago, which once carried business freight and passengers. Today, smaller vehicles, trucks and cars connected by a network of streets and highways serve businesses far better. There is still a role for railroads, but the emphasis has shifted.
"The idea that you can run a big company on PC's is cracked," said Will F. Zachmann, president of Canopus Research, a consultancy in Duxbury, Mass. "I do think there's a secular change away from mainframes. And the shift will render traditional systems uncompetitive at traditional price levels. But who's to say there won't be a price shakeout in mainframes as there has been in PC's?"
Mr. Zachmann, who warned with uncanny accuracy in 1987 that I.B.M. shares could be selling at their present levels within five years, sounds almost optimistic about I.B.M.'s prospects today. He noted that "the green-eyeshade types" have been unwilling to make multimillion-dollar commitments to mainframe purchases during the current recession, but raised the possibility of pent-up demand for mainframes that will revive the market when the recession ends.
"It's not going to be a growth segment," Mr. Zachmann said of I.B.M.'s future mainframe business, "but it's not going to shrivel to nothingness, either. I have a hard time imagining that I.B.M. is going to wither away and disappear from the face of the earth."
So much for Big Iron, but what about the smaller systems? "Nowadays people realize that, underneath it all, it's either an Intel or Motorola chip, so what's the risk?" Mr. Gillis said. "You'll go for the best price deal."
He added, however: "I still recommend I.B.M. systems in certain aspects. It's still the great hardware company. What they are not, however, is a services and software company, which is what they desperately need to be known as."

THE ECONOMY

 
The Recession That Was -- Now They Tell Us
 

So what about that recession, the one that helped President Bush along to defeat? According to the National Bureau of Economic Research, the arbiter of booms and busts, the recession ended 20 months before the election. Would it have made any difference if the voters had known this earlier? Maybe not. "I don't think estimates of the economy do anything to make people change their votes," said R. David Ranson, president of H. C. Wainwright & Company Economics. "Bush produced no jobs." Besides, the bureau is usually quite late with its assessments. After all, it took until April 1991 -- one month after the slump officially ended -- for the bureau to acknowledge that, yes, one did exist.
 
For President-elect Bill Clinton, the picture is mixed. On one hand, the Commerce Department's final estimate of third-quarter gross domestic product showed that it grew at a 3.4 percent annual rate. On the other, the International Monetary Fund projects that the world economy will grow only 2 percent in 1993. This global slump may depress American exports by $20 billion next year.
 
Whooping It Up at Retail
 
For retailers, it was the old story of the procrastinators who almost stole Christmas. Shoppers waited until the final weekend to do the bulk of their buying. But once they started, they couldn't seem to get enough. Sales are said to have exceeded expectations at stores from Bloomingdale's to Sears to Tiffany. "People have shopped this year like there really is a Christmas," said John J. Schultz, president of the National Retail Federation. Still, shoppers may stay home early next year after the credit-card bills arrive.
 
Ahead of the holiday shopping season, the Commerce Department reported that consumer spending rose 0.5 percent in November, to an annual rate of $4.2 trillion. But consumer income rose only 0.2 percent.
 
Dent in the Durable Goods Data
 
Just blame those volatile aircraft orders for making the news look bad. Because of them, orders for durable goods fell 1.9 percent in November, to a seasonally adjusted $122.9 billion, after rising a revised 4.6 percent in October. But excluding the aircraft component, orders for durable goods would have risen 1 percent in November.
 
Meanwhile, some news was not as good as it seemed. Automakers reported last week that sales of domestically built cars and trucks rose 16 percent in mid-December. But analysts said the increase looked good only because year-earlier period was so bad.

Trouble for Retirees
 
Sometimes, it doesn't pay to get old. At least 23 large companies have terminated the health-care benefits they were providing to retired employees. Dozens more will not provide coverage for future retirees. The reason: on Jan. 1, a new accounting rule will go into effect that will force companies to subtract from their profits the future costs of such retirement benefits. The latest big company to take action is the Primerica Corporation, which required its 7,800 retirees to decide last week whether to pay the full cost of health coverage -- or lose it. A tough choice. "I can't swing the $144 for medical coverage, which I desperately need," said Marie Esposito, a retired 68-year-old secretary who gets a $240-a-month pension from Primerica.
 
Along similar lines, Kidder, Peabody was accused last week of unlawfully dismissing 17 senior executives, all of whom were paid $100,000 or more a year, in what Government lawyers said was the first major age-discrimination case against a securities firm.

Pillow Talk at 30,000 Feet?
 
Does United tell USAir? According to the Justice Department, it does. Moreover, the department believes American, Delta, Northwest, Continental, T.W.A. and Alaska Airlines are all involved in the conversation, via a computerized reservation system in an attempt to fix air fares. As a result, the department filed an antitrust suit against the eight airlines. So far, United and USAir have agreed not to communicate proposed fare increases to each other through the computerized systems -- although neither admitted or denied the accusation.

Japan's Protectionist Drums
 
As far as some Japanese business leaders are concerned, the honeymoon is already over for President-elect Bill Clinton. Worried that the Clinton Administration will restrain the American operations of Japanese companies, a group of Japanese businessmen issued a blunt Government-sponsored warning last week that accused the United States of "self-centered thinking" in trade disputes and urged the passage of "necessary and appropriate emergency response measures" by Tokyo. These measures could include laws that place high tariffs on American and European goods -- or block their import -- if similar actions is taken against Japanese products.
 
Toshiba's Open-Door Policy
 
The word out of Japan was not all hostile. For instance, Toshiba announced last week that it had formed a partnership with Samsung Electronics, South Korea's leading semiconductor maker, to develop flash memories, chips that could one day replace computer disk drives. Indeed, Toshiba has been quite accessible to foreign rivals. A week earlier, it formed a partnership with National Semiconductor. But don't get the wrong idea: Toshiba is still an aggressive competitor. A big reason for these deals is to grab market share from Intel, the leader in this field.

Britain, Insurer of Last Resort
 
What are the British doing to protect themselves from terrorist bombings? They're getting insurance. The British Government said last week that it would help insure buildings against damages from bombs set off by the Irish Republican Army. It said it would act as the insurer of last resort if insurance companies did not cover the bombing losses. Without the Government's move, virtually all office buildings in Britain would be exposed.

No Wings for a U.S.-British Deal
 
The United States and Britain might be great friends, but business is business -- especially when it comes to airlines. Last week, British Airways abandoned its plans to acquire a big stake in USAir after the two nations were unable to agree on steps to ease restrictions on American airlines that fly to Britain's airports, particularly Heathrow Airport in London. The restrictions favor, you guessed it, British Airways. The two airlines held out hope that some deal might be reached. But until then, there are no winners: British Airways cannot gain a much bigger presence in the United States, the world's busiest airline market; ailing USAir is still in need of a strong partner, and the restrictions on American airlines at Heathrow and other British airports remain.
 
And Now, an I.B.M. Recall
 
Plenty of people will be leaving I.B.M. as a result of the computer giant's losses. But two retirees will be coming back. The International Business Machines Corporation recalled Paul Rizzo and Kaspar Cassani, as "counselors and advisers" in an "office of chief executive" as the company tries to recover from a slump in its mainstay mainframe computers. Although there was some speculation whether this unusual move would affect the power of I.B.M.'s chairman, John F. Akers, some analysts noted that the two men come from the same mainframe-dominated era as Mr. Akers. "They may be independent from Akers, but Rizzo and Cassani are I.B.M. hard-liners, reared in the I.B.M. way," said Bob Djurdjevic, president of Annex Research in Phoenix. "It's sort of like bringing back Brezhnev's cronies to reform the Russian economy."

Wal-Mart's Imports
 
Still buying American? That the question that's being asked of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. The giant retailer acknowledged last week that imported clothing had been displayed as domestic merchandise at some of its 2,000 stores. But it denied accusations, made on the NBC News program "Dateline," that some of its Asian suppliers had used illegal child labor. The controversy raised questions about Wal-Mart's import standards and whether the "Buy America" program started by Wal-Mart's late founder, Sam M. Walton, was more an advertising gimmick than a substantial plan to create jobs.

Mr. Abelson's Choices
 
Alan Abelson may have the power to move markets; his bosses can move him. Mr. Abelson, the outspoken editor of Barron's, disclosed last week that the publication's owner, Dow Jones & Company, had asked him to step down from his post, which he has held since 1981. The lost love apparently stems from a disagreement over a proposed redesign of Barron's, but Dow Jones still wants to keep Mr. Abelson's widely read front-page column. Needless to say, Mr. Abelson was not happy and said he would continue the column only if he could pick the new editor. Otherwise, the column will go -- a move that could be quite bearish for Barron's.
 
Farewell to Steve Ross
 
It's the end of an era at Time Warner Inc. Steven J. Ross, who created the world's largest media and entertainment company, died last week at the age of 65. In 1989, Mr. Ross helped put together the $14 billion merger between his Warner Communications and Time Inc. and then proceeded to run the combined company in the lavish style he was used to. But his high-flying style upset many people from Time Inc., who found it difficult to blend their button-down corporate culture with that of Warner.
 
Will It Be Leno or Letterman?

Jay or Dave. Dave or Jay. NBC has two choices in the battle for late-night ratings supremacy and it stands to lose something either way. On one hand, it could match CBS's $16 million offer for David Letterman and give him the "Tonight" show, replacing Jay Leno. But if that happened, Mr. Leno said he would "obviously leave NBC immediately" -- and he might wind up on CBS opposite "Tonight." On the other hand, if NBC fails to match the offer, Mr. Letterman will move to CBS and is likely to steal a good portion of the "Tonight" audience. There were indications late last week that Mr. Leno may ultimately be the big loser in NBC's dilemma. "I am disappointed," Mr. Leno said. "I feel like a guy who has bought a car from somebody, painted it, fixed it up and made it look nice, and then the guy comes back and says he promised to sell the car to his brother-in-law."

HEADLINE: Technology;
Turning a Stew of Old Tires Into Energy

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

DATELINE: HARRISON, N.Y.

 BODY:
OIL companies think of automobile tires as a petrochemical product, but earlier this month, Texaco Inc. tested a process using tires as a feedstock, in a multi-stage process for making electricity cleanly.
The process, which Texaco says is technically viable and, it believes, economically viable as well, recasts tires as an interim stage between crude oil and useful energy. It also gives a starring role to worn-out lubricating oil, thus addressing two headaches. 
 Texaco is one of the last oil companies that maintains a substantial alternative energy program. Much of the effort, including this new machine, is built around gasification. The idea is that cooking hydrocarbon fuels into a gas before burning them results in far cleaner combustion and far more energy than is possible in traditional combustion.
The burning takes place in gas turbine engines, which resemble jet-airplane engines, only bolted to the ground. Most gas turbines today run on methane gas or burn diesel oil, which vaporizes easily. But Texaco has been commercially successful in gasifying less valuable hydrocarbons, notably heavy crude oil that is generally difficult to burn because of its high sulfur content. The company has 40 gasifiers and has sold licenses for 100 more.
With Government subsidies, Texaco has also shown promising results in gasifying high-sulfur coal. Now, making gasification technology more valuable, the company is moving to less attractive fuels.
Recently it signed an agreement with Petroleos de Venezuela, the General Electric Company and the Teco Power Service Company, a corporate cousin of Tampa Electric, to build a 250-megawatt power station in Puerto Rico that will gasify Orimulsion, one of the most abundant and promising fuel resources in this hemisphere, if only someone could figure out how to use it.
"It's perfect for us," said David C. Crikelair, a Texaco vice president who heads the company's alternate energy department. Orimulsion comes from the Orinoco tar deposit, which is more like asphalt than oil. Drillers push water into the ground so they can pump the material to the surface. The product is 28 percent water, which is acceptable, and 8 percent sulfur, which can present difficulties.
Texaco also recently signed a major gasification deal with China, to provide gas for domestic and industrial use in Shanghai.
The tire project is a concatenation of technologies, building a system to produce fuel for the gasifier, which in turn produces fuel for the turbine, which makes electricity.
This chain of processes took a new twist in early December when Texaco successfully tested a device that cooks old tires into a liquid. It does so in a bath of waste oil, like old lubricating or transmission oil or even antifreeze from cars.
At a laboratory in Montebello, Calif., in Los Angeles County (and, appropriately enough, overlooking a landfill), the company built a processing unit that takes chunks of tires and cooks them at 700 degrees Fahrenheit, for half an hour. The system, which the company hopes to sell for about $2 million, handles 1,000 to 2,000 tires a day, the number produced daily by a city of 250,000 to 500,000 people. The machine also requires an equal amount of waste oil, by weight.
The tires have an energy content of about 15,000 British Thermal Units per pound, nearly 80 percent as much as crude oil. That means that a single 20-pound tire has as much energy as 2.5 gallons of gasoline.
One difficulty is that tires are laced with steel belts, which must be removed with a rotating screw. The steel goes to a metal recycler.
In the main reaction tank, the heat not only liquefies the tires, but also breaks down some of the largest, heaviest hydrocarbons, which are the least desirable, into gases, like methane and other light products that can be used in a refinery or burned immediately.
The finished product from the liquefier is energy-rich, containing 85 percent to 90 percent of the energy in the tires and oil, but being heavily contaminated with sulfur and heavy metals, it is not attractive.
One of the strengths of gasification is that dirty fuels can then be cleaned up. In a gasifier, hydrocarbon feedstock is combined with oxygen at controlled temperatures and pressures and broken down into hydrogen and carbon monoxide, which in this case is used as fuel, giving off energy and combining with oxygen as it burns to form carbon dioxide, a clean combustion product that is released into the atmosphere. Molecules of other ingredients, like hydrogen sulfide and heavy metals, are removed before burning with a sieve or by other methods.
The most common use for the cleaned-up gas is a "combined-cycle turbine." The turbine sends its mechanical power to an electric generator and its exhaust gases to a steam generator, which captures much of the heat from the exhaust to boil water. The steam thus produced turns a steam turbine, making more mechanical power, which runs a separate electrical generator. Combined cycle plants have achieved efficiencies of up to 52 percent (meaning that the electricity produced has 52 percent as much energy as the gas did.) Traditional boilers achieve efficiencies of only about 33 percent.
In addition, according to Texaco, its gasifiers, teamed with combined-cycle plants, are far cleaner than required by Environmental Protection Agency standards. They produce two pounds or less of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain, and nitrogen oxides, which cause smog, per megawatt-hour of electricity produced. In contrast, conventional coal burning, even with scrubbers, produces eight pounds. The E.P.A. standard is 12 pounds.
THE gasifier's output of hydrogen and carbon monoxide does not have to go to a power plant. Those gases are also the building blocks of ammonia and methanol, and the free hydrogen is also useful in a refinery, where demand for hydrogen is increasing because of process changes required to make new, cleaner gasolines.
There are obstacles to building tire liquifiers, even if the technology works flawlessly. A key question is commercial structure, which is not nearly so tidy as a vertically integrated oil company.
The raw material, tires and oil, start out as the property of a municipality or a private merchant. At the other end, the power is sold by a utility. In between there is probably an independent power generator, who may or may not own the gasifier; the producer of the liquefied tires might be independent of the other parties, too.
The ownership issues may get sorted out in 1993; Texaco hopes for several sales in the coming year.

HEADLINE: Three Little Words for Bill Clinton

 BODY:
President-elect Bill Clinton faces what some of his advisers regard as a cruel choice. Either he'll have to honor his campaign pledge to "grow the economy" by pumping tens of billions into training and infrastructure. Or he'll have to honor his pledge to cut the deficit in half. He cannot, according to new deficit projections, do both.
Which pledge should he honor? 
 Mr. Clinton indicated last week in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that he'd choose deficit reduction. But that surely would be the wrong way to turn. Investment is the key to economic growth. Deficit reduction, which pumps money into private capital markets, is one way to increase investment. But public spending can be equally valid, even preferable.
To put deficit reduction ritualistically before public investment is to decide that private investment is always more productive. It's not. For proof, consider the reasons Candidate Clinton gave for creating programs to train and educate the disadvantaged workers private markets have left behind.
In a perfect world, Mr. Clinton wouldn't have to choose between his two pledges. Congress would raise enough taxes to pay for important Federal programs and also hit his deficit target. But new projections show a much larger deficit -- almost $100 billion more than previously thought. Congress won't make any painful choices; Mr. Clinton will have to.
Of course, he'll have to control the deficit. When the Government borrows, it siphons money from private capital markets. That leaves less for corporations to invest in new plant and equipment. But what size deficit is right? There's no simple answer. Surely, the deficit cannot be allowed to grow faster than the economy. But that goal -- which can be met by running deficits of about $200 billion -- can be achieved without gutting investment.
Should the deficit be brought much lower than that? That depends, first, on the state of the economy and, second, on how the deficit is lowered. When the economy is operating below capacity -- as is true now -- deficit reduction is fiscal folly. The economy needs more Federal stimulus -- enough to drive it toward full employment. As the economy grows, so too will private investment.
The tougher question is what to do when the economy becomes healthier. Most experts believe that the U.S. saves too little and therefore invests too little. One way to raise savings is to lower the Federal deficit. That's a fine idea as long as the deficit is closed in a way that lowers consumption. To do that, Congress would have to raise taxes and cut middle-class entitlements -- actions that Congress loathes.
The worst way to cut the deficit would be to torpedo Mr. Clinton's program before it was even launched. That would amount to cutting investment to raise savings, which were supposed to spur investment. Said another way, Mr. Clinton threatens to raise investment by lowering investment -- which makes no sense any way you say it.
The proper focus for policy is investment, not the deficit. That means judging Federal programs by their merits. Is the nation better off with tax subsidies for farmers -- or lower deficits? Is the economy better off training workers -- or lowering the deficit? Would laying fiber optic cable to every home be a better use of resources than leaving them in the hands of private investors?
Fixation with deficit reduction answers no such questions. In the end, Congress must pick programs that work and pay for them with a combination of taxes and borrowing. There is, however, one principle that can guide Congress: Borrowing or taxing to pay for productive public investments never hurts the economy. Rejecting productive investments for the sake of deficit reduction surely hurts the economy.
Mr. Clinton promised to be a different kind of Democrat, one who pays attention to the need for investment and growth. But he also said he'd sacrifice his investment program before he'd raise taxes on the middle class. Now he says he'll sacrifice investment to hit his deficit target.
He seems on the verge of ripping out the heart of his program -- the program that attracted many Americans to his cause. Then and now, they reviled George Bush's three little words. Their three words for Bill Clinton, far from "Read my lips," are "Invest in people."

HEADLINE: Formative Years;
Seen, Heard, Even Worried About

BYLINE: By PETER STEINFELS

 BODY:
In Washington and Little Rock, as on the campaign trail earlier, the talk has mainly been about economic recovery, productivity, the deficit, investment and international competition. But churning below the surface of these often technical discussions is a larger unease about social decline, and in particular an anxiety about the next generation of Americans.
For many people, the country's economic difficulties are a sign that its seedbed institutions, the families, schools and religious bodies that nurture character, competence, trust and civic responsibility, are coming unraveled. 
 Talk about productivity, human investment and international competition, for example, translates into questions about the skills of those entering the labor market. Worry about the deficit reflects guilt about saddling children and grandchildren with an unmanageable debt. Plans for renewing cities confront the reality of crime and drug abuse among the young.
Is the nation bequeathing that next generation a formidable accumulation of problems while denying the young the capacity to shoulder the burden? Has a society that always prided itself on youth and the future in fact slighted or stunted the upbringing of its children? And can the needs of children inspire a moral and political agenda that will override the nation's divisions?
Especially at this time of year, children are our images of innocence and hope. In crime-ridden neighborhoods no less than in war-torn or famine-struck lands, children are the most haunting victims.
But increasingly, children and teen-agers also provide images of brutal behavior, wasted lives and social disarray: drug dealers, crack babies, drive-by shootings, dropouts, predatory sex. Adolescent music is as likely to be about rioting and racial clashes as about romance, and not even sophisticated newspapers would print many of the sexual lyrics.
 
The Old Alarms
 Is this all a matter of perception? After all, in the 1950's public anxiety focused on juvenile delinquency and whether students were keeping up with the Russians. In 1965, Daniel Patrick Moynihan, then an Assistant Secretary of Labor, warned that the rising rate of fatherless families among black Americans might soon create a new obstacle to racial progress.
Despite an endorsement by the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., the Moynihan warning was decried as racist. Liberals shied away from questions of family structure for two decades. Baby boomers had other things on their minds -- at least until they had their own children. Weren't alarms about a breakdown in child-rearing only the perennial bursts of nostalgia for a Golden Age of clear-cut sexual mores, intact marriages and bright-eyed, studious darlings?
Increasingly, the answer is "no." Just last week an equally blunt conclusion came from the Council on Families in America, a group of 17 scholars and family experts -- sociologists, economists, lawyers, psychologists, journalists, historians and religious leaders -- who span the ideological spectrum.
"The evidence is strong and growing," they wrote, "that the current generation of children and youth is the first in our nation's history to be less well-off -- psychologically, socially, economically and morally -- than their parents were at the same age."
A fifth of the nation's children are poor, as are almost a fourth of its preschoolers and almost half of its black children. In 1970, 10 percent of the nation's children lived in one-parent households; the figure has more than doubled since then. In 1960, one in 25 children was born to an unmarried mother; now it is one in four.
Reports of child abuse and neglect have increased by 40 percent since 1985. Since 1960, Scholastic Aptitude Test scores have dropped; juvenile crime has more than doubled; rates of teen-age suicide and death by homicide have more than tripled.
In the face of these findings, many are convinced that Americans can be rallied behind the cause of child welfare. They see reinforcement in the longstanding devotion of Hillary Clinton to the Children's Defense Fund (even the name suggests siege and alarm) and its passionately articulate leader, Marian Wright Edelman.
Hopes for a national effort spanning ideological camps also sprang from an emerging consensus that neither the traditional liberal emphasis on government programs nor the traditional conservative emphasis on family stability and moral discipline will do the job alone. Health, education and anti-poverty programs would have to go hand in hand with frank endorsement of sexual and parental responsibility.
This bridging of the gap between child advocates stressing economic deprivation and other groups stressing family structure and cultural factors began with "Beyond Rhetoric: A New American Agenda for Children and Families," the 1991 report of the bipartisan National Commission on Children, headed by Senator Jay Rockefeller, Democrat of West Virginia. The National Conference of Catholic Bishops also yoked the two emphases in "Putting Children and Families First," a pastoral letter released a year ago.
But the fragility of the consensus was revealed when Vice President Quayle and the Republican Party tried to seize upon "family values" as a campaign issue. Democrats renewed their suspicion that "family values" was only a slogan to divert attention from economic problems. Republicans found new proof that Democrats reflexively thought government spending was the key to everything.
So the new Administration begins straddling two schools of thought about child welfare. Both back economic measures like a family leave bill and tax reforms to aid the working poor and families with young children. Both favor expanded child health care and preschool education and vigorous efforts to collect child support from absent fathers. Both oppose strict division of family roles along gender lines.
But one school of thought insists that economic problems, and economic reforms, are only half the story. Family structure and stability, these advocates argue, are independent factors, shaped by cultural forces as well as economics and, indeed, just as likely to be the cause of economic well-being or deprivation.
"The best antipoverty program for children is a stable, intact family," Elaine Ciulla Kamarck and William A. Galston write in "Mandate for Change" (Berkeley, 1992), the handbook of recommendations issued by the Progressive Policy Institute, the research arm of the centrist Democratic Leadership Council, which was once headed by Mr. Clinton.
In this view, a child welfare campaign requires a frank commitment to the goal of sustaining the two-parent family, using Presidential influence on initiatives to combat teen-age pregnancy and out-of-wedlock births, to slow divorce rates and protect children in divorce settlements and to press for media responsibility in influencing children and adolescents.
The other school of thought does not dispute that a stable, two-parent family is beneficial. But it inclines toward the view that other family structures might do roughly as well, given equal economic advantage, and it questions the data suggesting that family structure itself puts children at greater risk for everything from criminal behavior and teen-age pregnancy to mental illness and educational failure.
In this view, issues of family structure are best set aside as amorphous, personal and beyond the scope of government. Focusing on sexual conduct and parental responsibility, these advocates add, only rationalizes unwillingness to pay for necessary government programs.
And what society is willing to pay is unknown. "Mandate for Change" proposes giving parents an $800 tax credit (equivalent to a $5,330 exemption for the average family) for each preschool child and then phasing it down to the equivalent of the current exemption when the child is 11. They also propose an earned income tax credit that would supplement the wages of the working poor and could affect more than
half the nation's poor children.
These two proposals would cost roughly $13 billion a year, and they are only two items on a long list.
But if the school of thought stressing cultural forces is correct, the non-monetary sacrifices may be even more significant. Parents -- and fathers, in particular -- are going to face serious choices about the way they divide their time between work and family, about advancement in their jobs, about "having it all," about determination to make marriages work, about resisting the media sea in which their children swim.
The most subtle sacrifices may be those facing the culture-makers themselves, a generation of political leaders, media executives, scholars, movie makers, musicians, novelists, journalists, advertising creators and purchasers, critics and social commentators. For them the challenges to authority of the 1960's, given legitimacy and perpetuated in causes like racial justice, human rights and feminism, remain formative.
Their own experiences of marriage and family may have now taught them lessons about the importance of social norms and the absurdities of endless quests for self-realization. But they also continue to identify with attempts to "push the envelope" of established conventions, whether in pop music, advertising or television comedies. Breaking taboos remains an index of integrity, cultural exploration and liberation from prejudice. If they recoil from calculated efforts to sell products by enraging public sensibilities, they recoil even more from conservative protests in defense of existing norms.
The idea that a serious national campaign for child well-being might demand self-discipline and restraint raises quandaries about creative freedom -- and painful challenges to the self-image of many who produce or influence mass culture.
No matter what the precise mix of economic measures and cultural initiatives in a national effort to assure the well-being of children, "the basic point is that the way forward cannot be one-sided," said Professor Galston, a political philosopher at the University of Maryland. "We cannot simply replicate the sterile debate of the last generation. We must get to work on both sides simultaneously."

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Whether It's Hunger Or 'Misnourishment,' It's a National Problem

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER

 BODY:
HUNGER blows across America like a patchy fog, lingering in some valleys, drifting past others. Often, the mist settles in late in the month, when the food stamps, disability checks and other government aid is used up. But what is called hunger in this country is a far cry from the enforced starvation that is tearing away at countries like Somalia.
Still, as American soldiers take up arms to help Somalia, relief agencies and anti-hunger advocates in the United States are trying to convince Americans and the incoming Administration that malnourishment in this country grows more widespread and more persistent than it has in two decades. 
 They are succeeding. After a decade of argument, the professionals in medicine and social work, for whom the fight against hunger is a crusade, are reaching some tentative common ground with their politically conservative opponents, who have often dismissed advocacy groups as "problem-mongers."
There is little agreement on numbers. Among the advocates, estimates of the hungry population run from 5 million to 30 million. There is little agreement on definitions. Conservatives avoid using the word hunger, saying that what the country is looking at is "misnourishment" -- bad food, as opposed to no food.
There is little agreement on the causes: anti-hunger advocates emphasize a poor family's lack of resources; conservatives stress the bad judgment of those who spend scarce resources on junk foods. But the disagreements are overshadowed by a growing consensus that the increase in poverty has been accompanied by an increase in undernourishment, particularly in children.
"Hunger in a developed nation is not only more reprehensible, because of ability to end it, but because it is a much more insidious problem," said Dr. J. Larry Brown, director of the Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition Policy at Tufts University. "Most children here have clothes, so you can't tell if that skinny kid is several pounds below the growth curve.
"Hunger in this nation is what the World Health Organization calls 'silent undernutrition,' " he added. "It's a chronic problem that is debilitating from a physical health standpoint, and leads to cognitive deficits. If we deliver children to the schoolhouse door with one hand tied behind their backs, we're never going to get to where we want to be as a competitive country."
How bad is the problem? That's where the consensus collapses. In 1983, after several years of debate about the existence of hunger in America, President Reagan's task force reported that there was hunger, but it was hard to measure.
Some groups argue that since hunger is a function of poverty, measuring the increase in poverty is enough. Others follow a similar strategy, but focus on the use of food stamps, a Federal program designed to aid those whose incomes are less than 130 percent of Federal poverty levels (about $14,000 for a family of four.) As of last July, the Department of Agriculture reported, an average 25.3 million people were receiving food stamps each month; the figures had jumped by 2.5 million people each year since 1990. At the peak of the 1981 recession, the average monthly figure was 22.4 million; the current figure represents an all-time high.
Most recently, the Food Research and Action Center, a Washington-based group issued a study last March estimating that, in any given month, 4.7 million children will have experienced hunger. The study was based on a New Haven project and involved surveys in six other urban, suburban or rural areas, with findings extrapolated nationally.
The Center on Hunger, Poverty and Nutrition Policy at Tufts produced estimates indicating that, at any given time, some 30 million people were hungry, a state Dr. Brown defines as "the chronic underconsumption of nutrients." Dr. Benjamin Caballero, a physician at The Johns Hopkins University's School of Public Health, estimates that the number is half as large -- 15 million.
Gino's yardstick is simple: his stomach. He spends an hour each evening along McPherson Square in Washington, waiting for McKenna's Wagon, the mobile soup kitchen run by Martha's Table, an independent group providing everything from food to child care to Christmas presents. These daily soups and sandwiches anchor his haphazard diet.
It's worse this year. "I've been everywhere," he said. "I've been in Baltimore and Tallahassee, Fla., and it's worse everywhere. But Washington feeds you better."
Dr. Caballero agrees with Dr. Brown and Dr. Brown's assistant, Laura Sherman, that feeding Gino and other hungry people is, by itself, only a start. "It's not enough to increase the number of food pantries and say people should drop off two cans instead of one," said Ms. Sherman. "What needs to be done is helping make people more self-sufficient, extending Federal programs and making food stamps more accessible."
Earlier this year, the advocacy groups in congressional hearings called for both short- and long-term solutions. Among the short-term goals is increasing access to Government aid, which now provides more than $20 billion in food aid. Their longer-term goal is an attack on the causes of poverty.
Despite Americans' heightened concern about hunger as a problem, legislation to increase eligibility for food stamps and other Federal nutrition programs has failed in three successive congressional sessions.
Douglas Besharov, a resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, is among those who disagree with the legislation's thrust. "The vast middle ground of this debate in the 60's and 70's was deeply worried about old-fashioned hunger," he said. "The vast group in the middle now is deeply worried about dietary practices and nutrition.
"The vast middle ground has shifted, and the advocates haven't caught up," Mr. Besharov said. "If the consensus is right, the program of choice is not increased eligibility for government aid. It has much more to do with education and helping people structure their diets."
Dr. Steven Parker, a pediatrician at the Failure to Thrive Clinic of Boston City Hospital, said the problem is not simple anymore. "Given a choice, food is a simple solution," he said. "It's concrete. You can give people food, and that's great.
"But it doesn't solve the misunderstanding about what's nutritional," Dr. Parker added. "It doesn't solve the problem of the roots of poverty causing behavior disorders and feeding disorders in young children. If you want a child to develop normally, you have to feed him first, and supplement that with environmental stimulation and enrichment."
In seven years at the clinic, he said, the waiting list for new patients has never been as long. And instead of children coming in at the age of 2 years or 18 months, 9-month-olds are showing up with unnaturally slow growth rates.
Elsewhere in the country, Dr. Brown said, the issue is simply resources -- enough money for food. "What you see in Iowa and places like that are people for whom there is no question at all of pathology," he said. "These are typically white, intact families with one or two kids. Maybe they lost the family farm and rented it back. They can't grow crops or eat the animals because they've been repossessed. If you sit in a farm living room and hold a malnourished child on your lap, you don't forget."

A Tighter Belt for Europe's Welfare States

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

DATELINE: PARIS

 BODY:
AFTER the Los Angeles riots last April, President Francois Mitterrand of France irked Americans by suggesting that the violence was the price the United States had to pay for putting profits before compassion. "These riots show that the social needs of any country must not be neglected," the President opined with an unmistakable hint of Gallic smugness.
His remarks reflected a general conviction here that the United States practices a callous kind of capitalism by the standards of Europe, where social safety nets, developed after World War II, are elaborate. 
 The fact, for example, that 35 million Americans have no health insurance strikes many Europeans as unconscionable. Bill Clinton has also expressed outrage and promised change.
But as the President-elect considers European models for extending basic health coverage to all Americans, Europe's welfare systems are under unparalleled strain. "The state can no longer guarantee everything to everybody," Prime Minister Giuliano Amato of Italy said recently as he announced budget cuts of $75 billion, largely in pensions and public health care.
A combination of aging populations, rising unemployment, budgetary crises, increasing medical costs and economic stagnation is obliging countries from France to Sweden to rethink costly social programs.
This is a delicate, politically charged process. The single, frontierless European market, which comes into being next month, was supposed to be synonymous with improved living standards rather than retrenchment.
The treaty on European union, signed last February in the Dutch city of Maastricht, calls for "the promotion of employment, improved living and working conditions and proper social protection." But it also imposes austerity by insisting on balanced budgets by 1997 as the precondition for a planned single European currency.
Many countries are therefore tightening controls over costly welfare systems.
In the Netherlands, the Government has targeted the 900,000 people -- out of a total population of 15.2 million -- who receive disability payments under the General Disablement Benefits Act.
This law allows people who successfully claim disabilities to receive 70 percent of their salary from the time they lose their job to the age of 65. The money, currently totalling about $17.6 billion a year, is paid from a fund to which employers and workers are obliged to contribute. The most common disability is "stress," accounting for about one-third of claims. Government officials suspect it is often used by people who merely have scant motivation to work.
The Dutch Government has proposed legislation that would impose stringent standards for disability, cut payments and impose a review of the supposed disability every five years. It is being fiercely contested in Parliament, mainly by left-wing parties close to unions. The aim is to lower the number of "disabled" to no more than 760,000 and cut costs by $2.6 billion a year.
Italy, facing an annual budget deficit of $125 billion that is incompatible with the Maastricht treaty, has set about dismantling a welfare system that was so inefficient that it often amounted to a state-subsidized program for freeloaders who gave their votes to the governing Christian Democratic Party. Many southern villages dominated by the Christian Democrats, for example, had populations living almost entirely on pensions and other handouts.
Among the measures adopted earlier this year were the imposition of some limits on free medical care for people with higher incomes and a raising of the pensionable age for men to 65 from 60. For women, it was raised to 60 from 55.
Even in Sweden, once the paradigm of the welfare state, a budgetary crisis has forced reform. Legislation this fall raised the pensionable age to 66 from 65 and cut pension payments by about 2 percent. Sick pay was eliminated for the first day of work missed through illness to dissuade people from staying home for 24 hours when it suits them.
Swedish officials insist, however, that it is not the principle of the welfare state that is being attacked. "On the contrary," said Carl Anders-Isvarsson, the Under Secretary of State for Social Affairs. "We are trying to restore the strength of the economy in order to be able to maintain our welfare system."
Throughout Europe, the emphasis is indeed on tighter management and greater efficiency rather than any wholesale dismantling of safety nets whose existence is supported by a broad political consensus. Elizabeth Duskin, an economist for the 24-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, added: "Governments feel that too many people are spending too much time out of the labor market and that sick pay and disability systems have to be changed. But politically there is no possibility of really sweeping reform."
 
Pressures in France
 Moreover, the cuts are being applied to systems that remain generous by United States standards. For example, irrespective of her family's revenue, a French mother of three receives almost $300 a month from the French Government until the children are 18. This is supposed to encourage family values and child-bearing, two things dear to centrist and right-wing political parties. If she has a fourth child, the benefit goes up to $450. Other benefits are likely to supplement this.
Some people now argue that this must change. Longer-lived pensioners, earlier retirement and falling revenue as a result of economic stagnation are all pressuring France's $320 billion annual social security budget, whose deficit could swell to $6 billion next year from just over $1 billion this year. Two laws have been submitted to Parliament to cut pensions and sick pay, but they face stiff opposition.
Even as they examine reform, European countries seem to have some lessons to offer the United States. While United States spending on health care, dominated by the private sector, grew at an annual rate of almost 6 percent from 1960 to 1990 and now amounts to 12.1 percent of gross national product, Europe's comprehensive, state-dominated health systems have managed to hold spending to an average of about 8 percent of G.N.P.
The Europeans have achieved this largely through centralized budgetary control, obliging patients to share some costs and placing limits on what physicians can charge and deliver. There has, however, been a price: more complaints about the quality of service, particularly in Britain.
"The U.S. is a good example of what not to do on health care," said Ms. Duskin. "In America, there's a system that writes blank checks, whereas in Europe there has been a gradual improvement in efficiency over the past decade."

Toy Makers Meet The Inner Child, Ages 21 and Up

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
MANY children are confronting a new frustration. Their parents are buying toys -- for themselves.
More and more adults are joining a trend that toy makers and students of pop culture say reflects the aging of baby boomers -- a generation loath to grow old and searching for new ways to escape the stresses of the workplace. 
 It was Dorothy Parker who once said: "The only difference between men and boys is the cost and number of their toys." Were she alive today, Miss Parker might want to broaden that, considering the rising number of men and women buying toy cars, Barbie dolls , stuffed animals and electronic video games for themselves.
This month's issue of American Demographics magazine reports that nearly half, 45 percent, of 20,000 adults surveyed nationwide said they had bought a toy or game for themselves or an adult friend in a typical year. The survey, conducted by Mediamark Research, also found that adults who are young, affluent, educated and have children are more likely to play with toys. And toy makers are adjusting their advertising accordingly.
"This age group is trying to deny that they are getting older, and they are looking for props such as toys to continue their youthful vigor," said Robert R. Butterworth, a Los Angeles-based clinical psychologist.
Brian Sutton-Smith, professor emeritus of psychology at the University of Pennsylvania, said society is only now recognizing that adults play as much, if not more, than children. "For decades there has been this assumption that children played and adults didn't. That's rubbish," Mr. Sutton-Smith said. "Adults spend $500 billion on games and leisure activity each year, and some adults lament that kids get $15 billion for toys."
Adults buy 90 percent of all toys, but there are no statistics on what percentage they buy for their own use. Toy makers say that anecdotal evidence and consumer surveys suggest that fewer are ending up in children's rooms.
"We make the majority of our toys for children," said Lisa McKendall, a spokeswoman for Mattel, the nation's largest toy manufacturer, "but we believe that some of our products definitely have an adult appeal, and that has meant extra gravy in terms of sales."
Mattel's dolls based on the popular "Ren and Stimpy" cartoon series on Nickelodeon were originally for children. But the dolls, a crazed, scrawny chihuahua and an obese cat that Ms. Kendall said make "under-leg noises," have achieved cult status among young adult fans of the show.
Of course, many adults buy dolls like Barbies or miniature cars like Hot Wheels purely as collector items and never let them out of the box. Mattel's limited-edition Barbie dolls sell for as much as $250 each, including one wearing an elaborate bridal gown designed by Bob Mackie. The company also markets $600 limited-edition baby dolls by Annette Himstedt, a well-known German doll artist.
The video game has perhaps the greatest adult appeal. Nintendo makes Game Boy, a portable spinoff of its larger Nintendo video system, said its warranty cards indicate that 51 percent of Game Boy users are more than 18 years old, 17 percent are between 25 and 34, and 14 percent are between 35 and 44. About 44 percent are female.
William White, director of marketing for Nintendo of America, said the company has now focused most of its advertising on the 25- to-34-year-old age group in magazines like Time, People, Rolling Stone and GQ.
"Look at the number of hours people are working today," Mr. White said. "That has led to more stress and anxiety, and people need ways to relax and get away from work quickly, which these video games provide."
Mike Jensen, chief financial correspondent for NBC Network News, is hooked on Nintendo's Super Mario Brothers video game, which he spends an hour playing every weekend. "After a week of interviewing economists, Government officials and captains of industry, it's very therapeutic spending an hour on the weekend trying to rescue the princess," he said. He bought the game as a family Christmas present last year for anyone to use, but so far only Mr. Jensen, who is 58, plays.
Sega, another video game company, recently introduced a video game system that uses compact disks for the adult market. Sales of the $300 system have been strong, the company said. The unit works in conjunction with a $99 Sega Genesis video game; cartridges cost $29 to $64. The compact system is touted as having superior graphics when compared to its earlier version and those of other competing systems.
Cuddly plush animals have become more popular in recent years, especially among young single women, toy industry experts say. The stuffed toys are popular gifts from men to women for Christmas as well as birthdays and Valentine's Day.
Gund, one the nation's oldest and largest makers of such animals, said that about one-third of its toys are designed for adults. Its self-described "collectors' items" cost $300.
"We redid our consumer advertising to focus on an adult theme that the only place you can find unconditional love is with a soft toy," said Shari Meltzer, who is director of communications at Gund. "The comfort and love of a soft toy is excellent therapy for lonely single people."
Some toy experts say many adults have become more interested in children's toys as a way of relating to their children.
"When I go to Toys 'R' Us and buy a lot of building blocks and video games, I justify my guilt by saying I am getting them to play with my kids or to help understand my patients," said Dr. Butterworth, most of whose patients are children. "But there are days when I come home and turn on the video games and play all by myself, and it's quite fun."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSTION;
DEMOCRATIC RIFTS MAY HURT CLINTON ON FOREIGN TRADE

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Deep divisions in the Democratic Party over how aggressively to confront other nations on trade issues produced unusual infighting during President-elect Bill Clinton's search for a new United States Trade Representative and could stymie his efforts to push sweeping trade agreements through Congress next year.
The party's many fissures could undo the results of the Bush Administration's North American Free Trade Agreement, a pact that, if approved by Congress, would eliminate import taxes and other trade barriers among Canada, Mexico and the United States. Also at stake are the still-pending 108-nation trade talks, which are intended to reduce trade barriers around the world and stimulate a stagnant global economy. 
 During Mr. Clinton's deliberations on the trade appointment, Democrats with different views on trade matters worked furiously behind the scenes to undermine the others' candidates for the job of Trade Representative. The efforts included attempts to plant unfavorable reports about opponents in the news.
 
Who Did Not Make It
 Among those shot down for the job were Paula Stern, a former chairman of the International Trade Commission, known for her reluctance to protect American companies facing low-priced foreign competition, and Clyde Prestowitz Jr., a former Reagan Administration Commerce Department official and outspoken critic of Japan, whose work Mr. Clinton praised during the Presidential debates this autumn.
Mr. Clinton finally awarded the trade job on Thursday to his campaign manager, Mickey Kantor, giving a political plum to a neutral choice who has no clearly defined views on trade.
 
Big Internal Struggle
 "The party is divided -- certainly the unbelievable internal struggle to fill the position, within the transition, is an indication of the divisions," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution.
To be effective, Mr. Kantor will have to heal those divisions, said Representative Sander M. Levin, a Michigan Democrat on the Ways and Means Committee. "His job will be to try to, out of bitter controversy, find a meaningful consensus," he said. "It will be difficult, but it's doable."
For example, Robert B. Reich, the Harvard public policy lecturer whom Mr. Clinton has picked to head the Labor Department, opposes subsidies for particular industries, arguing that the Government should try to boost the economy as a whole through public investment. But Laura D'Andrea Tyson, picked to head the Council of Economic Advisers, advocates subsidies to specific industries to counter foreign subsidies.
Besides policy disputes, bureaucratic turf fights are to be expected within the Administration. How, for example, will Mr. Reich share with Mr. Kantor the job of negotiating a side pact with Mexico on labor issues, which Mr. Clinton has demanded before he will allow the North American Free Trade Agreement, which needs Congressional action, to take effect?
Four factions within Congress are pushing different agendas, and each will have allies in the Clinton Administration, where trade experts with different viewpoints have been appointed to Cabinet and White House jobs. The following are their agendas:
*To help American workers in declining industries through restrictions on imports -- the most protectionist stance with the highest risk of international confrontation.
*To subsidize exports by American high-technology companies -- a policy that could ignite foreign retaliation.
*To expand Government programs for training workers and for building up transportation and communication links -- a position that would also try to avoid disputes with trading partners.
*To protect the environment and jobs, by requiring that America's trading partners meet certain environ-mnental standards and prohibit low-cost production by factories that do not pay for pollution-control equipment.
 
'Party Is Truly Divided'
 "The party is truly divided," said Representative Robert T. Matsui, a California Democrat who is a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee's trade panel and is close to the Clinton transition team. "It's not just free trade versus protectionism any longer, you've got the concepts of managed trade and reciprocity, and environmental issues."
Each group also includes those who worry that the Federal budget deficit will widen if new trade agreements require money for environmental cleanups in the United States and overseas or the retraining of workers.
Tracking Democrats' trade positions is like playing three-dimensional chess: a position depends not only on how far forward a politician has moved toward free trade, but also how far to either side on environmental concerns and how far up on the scale of budget concerns. The result is that fiscal conservatives and ardent environmentalists, for example, may oppose trade agreements even though they may support free trade principles.
Yet one or more of the factions must lose, because trade agreements cost money and require sacrifices to foreign countries in some areas to win concessions in others.
 
During the Campaign
 Mr. Clinton was able to finesse these issues in the campaign. For example, he called for more protection for the environment and American workers in connection with the North American Free Trade Agreement, but never outlined how much this would cost or what he would offer Mexico in return.
While Mr. Clinton was building his Cabinet, the attacks by factions on candidates for the Trade Representative job became downright nasty. For example, a lobbyist with many foreign clients called a reporter a week and a half ago and, after insisting on anonymity, suggested a story critical of Mr. Prestowitz.
The lobbyist claimed that Bruce Smart, a former Under Secretary of Commerce for International Trade who supervised much of Mr. Prestowitz's work, had dismissed Mr. Prestowitz for incompetence.
An influential Democrat, after also insisting on anonymity, volunteered the same story about Mr. Prestowitz later the same day.
 
Stories About Official
 But Mr. Smart denied both versions in a telephone interview, saying that Mr. Prestowitz left voluntarily to write a book. Mr. Smart added that Mr. Prestowitz was "very bright, speaks Japanese well, understands the Japanese situation and was more hawkish on policy toward Japan than was the policy of the Reagan Administration."
Advocates of a more confrontational trade strategy have been equally aggressive. Opponents of Ms. Stern circulated a memo criticizing some of her rulings at the trade commission that hurt some domestic industries.
The search for a Trade Representative was made more difficult because during the campaign, both Mr. Clinton and his opponent Ross Perot criticized the practice in which former officials capitalize on their Government expertise by lobbying for foreign companies and governments. Yet Mr. Clinton ended up filling his Administration's top two trade jobs with men who have ties to Japanese businesses and may be barred by ethics rules from participating in certain decisions.
Mr. Kantor comes from a law firm that represents the NEC Corporation, an electronics multinational that makes everything from semiconductor chips to cellular telephones. And Ronald H. Brown, who has been tapped to head the Commerce Department, has represented the Japanese electronics industry on high-definition television. Their deputies may have to make politically sensitive decisions on basic issues where the Clinton Administration may be ideologically divided.
 
Trade Policy May Be Messy
 While trade policy in the Administration may be messy, Congressional Democrats are even more divided. Mr. Matsui and Representative Sam Gibbons, the head of the Ways and Committee's trade panel, have tended to oppose restrictions on imports and other confrontational approaches, for example, while Mr. Levin and Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt have tended to favor them.
The North American Free Trade Agreement has made the debate even more complicated in the last two years by bringing budget and environmental issues to the forefront of trade policy.
In the past, Administrations have been able to buy off opposition to free trade agreements by promising money to the losers. Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, pointed out at a recent hearing that Congress opened America's markets to the world in 1962, only after the Kennedy Administration agreed to a program assisting workers who lost their jobs because of imports.
But the program ran out of money helping laid-off auto workers in the early 1980's and was only partially replaced with other programs. Reviving it now would be expensive and difficult, given the government's enormous deficits of recent years, Mr. Moynihan said.
At the same time, environmental groups have become increasingly interested in trade. Early last year, environmental groups began seriously complaining that American pollution laws were being evaded by goods from heavily polluting factories overseas.
The clearest example of how politicians maneuver to reconcile trade, environmental and budget issues lies in the evolving positions of Senator Max S. Baucus, the Montana Democrat who heads the Finance Committee's trade panel.
Mr. Baucus led Senate efforts last year to give President Bush the necessary legal authority to negotiate the North American trade agreement. But this year he has refused to endorse the pact, devising instead the idea of taxing cross-border trade so as to pay for an environmental cleanup along the border.

HEADLINE: Clinton Job Plan In Manufacturing Meets Skepticism

BYLINE: By SYLVIA NASAR

 BODY:
Over and over, President-elect Bill Clinton has said that creating more manufacturing jobs was at the top of his agenda. But even staunch supporters in the economics profession say he is doomed to frustration on that score.
For example, Mr. Clinton told a small group of economists last August that he was concerned about creating more factory jobs, and he asked what his Administration could do about it. Paul Krugman, an expert on international competitiveness at M.I.T., replied, "Basically, nothing."
And "that's still the correct answer," Professor Krugman said recently. 
 Richard Freeman, a labor economist at Harvard University who has studied blue-collar employment, added, "The best you can do is maintain the absolute number of manufacturing jobs."
 
Hiring Focused in Services
 To be sure, factories are apt to recall some furloughed workers, and a few growth industries will surely add to their head counts. But beyond a cyclical uptick, economists say, it is the sprawling services -- everything from auto-repair shops to brokerage firms to schools -- not manufacturing, that will be hiring.
That view is shared by forecasters at the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Data Resources/McGraw-Hill, who see no net additions to the 18 million or so total manufacturing jobs before the end of the century despite more than 20 million new jobs in the economy as a whole. If these projections pan out, manufacturers will employ less than 15 percent of the work force by 2005, compared with slightly less than 20 percent now.
The reason is not that American manufacturers are not competitive enough to get the business. In fact, it is pretty much the opposite. The forecasters expect industrial production to grow at a healthy pace, but enormous strides in efficiency -- new products, new processes, better organization and growing automation -- are allowing manufacturers to produce more goods with the same or fewer hands and a shrinking share of total employment.
Last year, output per hour in manufacturing grew faster in the United States than in Germany and even in Japan. And for the past six quarters, factory output has grown at nearly a 4 percent annual rate, twice as fast as productivity elsewhere in the economy.
There is nothing new about this pattern -- and that is one reason to think it will persist. Productivity growth in factories has outpaced services for virtually the entire stretch since World II, probably because it is inherently easier to automate the production of steel than the performance of a symphony.
Today, American factories produce five times as much as they did in 1946. Yet, the number of workers on the assembly line -- 12.3 million -- remains virtually the same.
"The long-term trend in manufacturing is recapitulating the long-term trend in farming," Professor Krugman said. "During the past century, we've had rapid productivity growth in farming, and the result is fewer farmers. Over the past 40 years, the end result of rapid productivity growth in manufacturing is relatively few manufacturing workers."
Some Clinton policy proposals intended to lift productivity, like an investment tax credit to spur equipment investment or certain kinds of infrastructure spending, are more apt to reinforce the trend than to turn it around. And others, like proposals to promote specific high-wage industries, would likely have no effect on the mix of jobs just because high-wage industries buy lots of goods and services from low-wage industries. So unless productivity gains in manufacturing unexpectedly peter out or the appetite for manufactured goods grows at improbable rates, manufacturing's share of total jobs is likely to keep shrinking.
 
'Cutting Edge of Employment'
 "Just like in the 1960's, 1970's and 1980's, the cutting edge of employment expansion in the 1990's will continue to be private, nongovernmental services," said Erich Heinemann, chief economist at Ladenberg Thalmann. Virtually all of the 67 million new jobs created since World War II have sprouted in the services.
Would that be awful for American workers, especially the ones without college degrees, as Mr. Clinton and his team seem to think? Probably not, many economists say.
For starters, one basic reason that manufacturing jobs are regarded as superior is that the average paycheck is a bit bigger. But the difference is smaller than most people realize, in part because factory pay had been growing more slowly than pay in services for much of the 1980's. The average factory wage (with overtime) is $11.55 an hour; in comparison, jobs in construction pay $14.17, transportation $13.66, wholesale trade $11.55 and finance $11.07.
More important, most good jobs in the economy -- including for people without college degrees -- are not in manufacturing anyway.
 
'A Misleading Notion'
 "There's a misleading notion that services consist of investment bankers and lawyers on the one hand and fast-food employees on the other," said Marvin Kosters, a senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, "but both are small fractions of service jobs."
Kevin Lang at the University of Boston and Bill Dickenson at the University of California at Berkeley studied the proportion of good jobs and bad jobs in different industries. They suggest that roughly three times as many good jobs are found outside of manufacturing as inside manufacturing. Good jobs are those where pay is relatively high and rises with experience and schooling. Bad jobs are ones with low starting pay and no wage growth over a career.
Service-producing industries have on average, they found, a lower proportion of good jobs and a higher proportion of bad jobs. Even so, the proportion of good jobs is fairly high in most broad service sectors and, more important, there are nearly five times as many service-producing jobs as factory jobs: "Our big finding is that there's no industry that's really heavily bad jobs."
There is no necessary link between the growth of service jobs and sluggish pay increases, although both were true of the 1970's and 1980's. But in the 1950's, service-job growth was relatively slow, but productivity and pay surged. And in the 1920's, service jobs boomed, overtaking manufacturing, and so did pay and productivity.
 
Enthusiasm for Job Training
 What is often overlooked is that there is no economic law that says the benefits of rapid productivity growth in one segment of the economy, like manufacturing, will necessarily be captured by the businesses and workers in the high-productivity industries. "Productivity growth is good wherever it occurs," Professor Krugman said. "It's good for the standard of living." Despite stellar efficiency gains in farming, farmers don't have especially high incomes, and most of the benefits have flowed to consumers in the form of lower food prices, which directly increase people's ability to buy other things, services included.
Economists are more enthusiastic about another Clinton concern: job training.
"The notion that trying to beef up the manufacturing base so you can beef up manufacturing jobs says that we have to try to develop more demand for less-skilled workers," said Mr. Kosters of the American Enterprise Institute. "What we should try to work toward is a better trained, better schooled workforce. That's where we as a country have a comparative advantage."

HEADLINE: THE TRANSITION;
Clinton's Cabinet Choices Put Him at Center, Balancing Competing Factions

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 25

 BODY:
The most striking thing about President-elect Bill Clinton's Cabinet is not so much the jobs he has assigned others, but rather the jobs he has reserved for himself.
The way that Mr. Clinton has constructed his Cabinet is in keeping with how he ran his campaign: he has included representatives of many views rather than choosing between rival schools of thought within the Democratic Party. And instead of naming conceptualizers to important economic and foreign policy posts, he has chosen competent musicians and reserved the roles of composer and conductor for himself. 
 "What that means," said Thomas E. Mann, director of governmental studies at the Brookings Institution, "is that the success of the Clinton Presidency rests squarely on the President and less on the rest of his Administration. If there is a unifying theme to this Cabinet, it is Bill Clinton at the center -- someone who will have to be, and clearly intends to be, very active, not passive."
By the nature of his Cabinet choices, Mr. Clinton has in effect assigned himself the main roles of chief policy architect, articulator and arbiter.
Others before Mr. Clinton have played all three roles, but this has not been the standard in recent years. Ronald Reagan delegated large areas of responsibility to others, and often let rival factions fight it out. George Bush relied on important aides, including Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d or Housing Secretary Jack F. Kemp, to provide the "vision thing" for domestic and foreign affairs.
 
'Working Things Out'
 "I think the way Bill Clinton picked his Cabinet says a lot about how he will make decisions," said Stan Greenberg, a poll taker for Mr. Clinton. "He did not rely on some committee to make recommendations. It was Bill Clinton working things out in his own head, in his own living room, mostly by himself. That is how he will run the Cabinet. He will reach out for diverse points of view, bounce ideas off of them, but ultimately the decision and the articulation will come out of him."
The arrangement will put pressure on Mr. Clinton to signal clearly which path he wants to follow out of the many approaches his Cabinet choices reflect, Mr. Mann said. He will personally have to mediate the disputes he has set up by the diverse nature of his team, and he will have to provide the vision in both economic and foreign affairs.
 
Preview of Things to Come
 The way that Mr. Clinton managed -- or did not manage -- the tensions involved in building a Cabinet "that looked like America," as he put it, could be a harbinger of his Administration. He had to negotiate a minefield of demands from environmentalists, women's groups and minorities to get a Cabinet of the proper mix, while at the same time not appearing to be a captive of special interests.
During his search for an Attorney General, organized women's groups, who were determined to reserve that post for a woman, lobbied publicly and privately for their favorites and coalesced around Brooksley E. Born, a Washington lawyer. Although her selection appeared all but assured on Wednesday night, Mr. Clinton suddenly chose Zoe Baird, whose name had not appeared on any of the lists of women's groups. Her selection won high praise from legal experts, but it is not clear whether it resulted more from her qualifications than from Mr. Clinton's desire to demonstrate a degree of independence from the special-interest advocates.
"Like most successful politicians, Clinton has a coalition in his brain," said Ben J. Wattenberg, a former speech writer for President Lyndon B. Johnson. "You can carve his cerebrum down the middle and there is his antiwar, Hillary Clinton, liberal left lobe, and the 'New-Kind-of-Democrat,' advocating responsibility, moderation and you-can't-get-something-for-nothing right lobe."
While Mr. Clinton shares the goals of many of the interest groups, he is also acutely aware of the dangers of ceding certain parts of his Administration to elements of the coalition that elected him. His tactic in shaping the Cabinet was to try to satisfy them in general -- appointing a woman as Attorney General, for instance -- but not in particular, by appointing his own woman.
 
Window to Tactics
 When it comes to governing, however, Mr. Clinton will often not be choosing between many options, but rather between rival, and very specific, policy proposals embodied by the different wings of his Cabinet. The way he built his team may be revealing of his tactics.
A less visible factor shaping Mr. Clinton's choices seems to have been his application to Cabinet making of the principle that only Nixon could go to China. Whereas many Presidents choose Cabinet members who will not be advocates for the special interests that lobby their departments, Mr. Clinton has chosen a number of such advocates, precisely on the assumption that only they will be able to pacify their constituencies while pushing through Mr. Clinton's agenda.
That is the logic behind his appointment of the veteran legislators Senator Lloyd Bentsen to be Treasury Secretary and Representative Leon E. Panetta to be director of the Office of Management and Budget, both of whom are considered vital to easing Mr. Clinton's economic agenda through Congress. It is also apparent in his choice of Jesse Brown, director of the Disabled American Veterans Organization, to be Secretary of Veterans Affairs and Hershel W. Gober, director of the Arkansas Department of Veterans Affairs to be the deputy.
Similar concerns also showed in the selections of Carol M. Browner, an environmentalist protegee of Vice President-elect Al Gore, to head the Environmental Protection Agency and Hazel R. O'Leary, a Northern States Power Company executive, as Secretary of Energy.
When Mr. Clinton was asked how he could choose two career advocates to run his Veterans Affairs Department, he said, "One of the reasons that I hired them both, is so they could tell these people and the people they represent all over America the truth about what the facts are and engage them in a meaningful dialogue about how to deal with the difficult questions."
Other Clinton nominees seemed to be not advocates of the agencies they are taking over but rather infiltrators, who Mr. Clinton hopes will infect the departments with new ideas. This would seem to apply most to Representative Les Aspin, the former chairman of the House Armed Services Committee who is the Defense Secretary-designate.
Mr. Aspin has been one of the strongest voices in Congress for using the military to undertake limited action in places like Bosnia, precisely the sort of limited intervention that the Pentagon has staunchly opposed. Mr. Aspin has also supported a doubling of the military spending cuts proposed by the Bush Administration over the next five years.
Republicans seem to be of two minds about Mr. Clinton's Cabinet. On the one hand they note that his promise to appoint a Republican to give his team a bipartisan air was ignored. On the other hand, Republicans almost seem relieved. They had worried that Mr. Clinton might be immune to traditional Democratic Party special-interest pleadings and break the mold of politics as usual by appointing a Cabinet with entirely fresh faces chosen purely on merit.
"But when you look at his Cabinet," said Kevin Phillips, a Republican political consultant, "it does not look like America. It looks like the 43 percent of America who voted for Bill Clinton. I don't see Republicans or Perot voters represented there at all, and one could argue that blacks, Hispanics and left-wing ideologues are over-represented."
True, Mr. Phillips said, Mr. Clinton has opted for solid establishment figures in the vital portfolios of economics, foreign affairs and defense, but if they "don't deliver for him on the economy, and the peripheral Cabinet moves him to the left, he could find himself in trouble with the mainstream."

Thomas F. McLarty 3d/Chief of Staff
Former chairman of Arkla, a natural-gas company. Mr. Clinton's friend since childhood, Mr. McLarty, 46, is a self-described "facilitator" who promises a team approach in managing the access and the flow of work to the Oval Office. He has said he will take his lead from his boss rather than pursuing any agenda of his own.

 
 
ECONOMIC TEAM

 
Lloyd M. Bentsen/Secretary of the Treasury
Chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. A sage, smooth-talking Washington insider respected by his colleagues, Mr. Bentsen, 71, will help push some of Mr. Clinton's liberal economic proposals through Congress. The four-term Texas Senator is an expert on tax laws and a consummate deal-maker who has managed to get people on both sides of the aisle behind the support of particular legislation.

Leon E. Panetta /Director of Management and Budget
Chairman of the House Budget Committee. A master of the arcane budget process, Mr. Panetta, 54, has often seemed to be the Democrats' conscience on reducing the deficit. One of the few in Congress willing to raise taxes and cut popular government benefits, Mr. Panetta once said that Congress liked to deal with the "sugar" in economic packages, but hated to deal with the "vinegar" of the deficit.

Robert E. Rubin/Chairman, National Economic Council (non-Cabinet)
Co-chairman of Goldman, Sachs & Company. Mr. Rubin, 54, showed talent managing traders and deal makers at Goldman, Sachs and will need those skills to manage the new National Economic Council and its interaction with the Council on Economic Advisers. No ideologue, he is likely to balance concern about the financial markets with economic and political reality.

Laura D'Andrea Tyson/Chairman, Council of Economic Advisers (non-Cabinet)
Economics professor at the University of California at Berkeley. A long-shot choice over higher-profile economic heavyweights, Ms. Tyson, 45, is the first woman to lead the Council of Economic Advisers. She wants to be tougher on trade to help American manufacturers. One of her challenges will be to make sure that the council is not overshadowed by the newly established National Economic Council.

Robert B. Reich/Secretary of Labor
Lecturer in public policy at Harvard University. A close friend of Mr. Clinton since their days together as Rhodes scholars at Oxford University, Mr. Reich, 46, provided the intellectual firepower for Mr. Clinton's campaign. His first task will be to turn the Labor Department from a backwater into a place that helps shape efforts to make the United States more competitive.

Ronald H. Brown/Secretary of Commerce
Chairman of the Democratic National Committee and partner at Patton, Boggs & Blow. The first black appointed as head of the Commerce Department, a position that Mr. Clinton said he wanted to make a "powerhouse," Mr. Brown, 51, will have to turn his negotiating and deal-making skills to a department whose principal focus has been promoting trade and forecasting the weather. The ultimate pragmatist, Mr. Brown is known to submerge personal feelings to forge compromises.

Mickey Kantor/United States Trade Representative
Partner at Manatt, Phelps, Phillips & Kantor. Chairman of Mr. Clinton's election campaign, Mr. Kantor, 52, has little background in trade issues and is viewed as having gotten the job as a political reward. One of his biggest challenges will be to win Congressional approval for the North American Free Trade Agreement.

 
 
FOREIGN POLICY TEAM

 
Warren M. Christopher/Secretary of State
Chairman of O'Melveny & Myers law firm. A trusted adviser to Mr. Clinton, respected more for his ability to manage rather than to conceptualize policy, Mr. Christopher, 67, will be a team player and coalition builder who is likely to emphasize pragmatism over ideology. He is expected to rely much more heavily on the advice and expertise of assistant secretaries than did James A. Baker 3d, President Bush's head of State.

Les Aspin/Secretary of Defense
Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee. One of Mr. Clinton's campaign advisers on military issues, Mr. Aspin, 54, is expected to push for further cuts in military spending and to be more aggressive on intervening in the fighting in Bosnia. He sees his biggest challenge as maintaining global readiness in an era of cutbacks. While he has long been fascinated by military issues and has deep knowledge of the Pentagon, he is untested in managing a complex multibillion-dollar organization and is likely to clash with Gen. Colin L. Powell, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, who is wary of using American troops abroad for political or diplomatic purposes.

W. Anthony Lake/National Security Adviser (non-Cabinet)
Professor of international relations at Mount Holyoke College. Considered a pragmatist, Mr. Lake, 53, became a special assistant to Henry A. Kissinger in 1969 and resigned a year later to protest the invasion of Cambodia. He was a director of policy planning in the Carter Administration. He is expected to emphasize the views of career experts over particular ideologies. His close work with Mr. Christopher on foreign policy during the campaign is expected to help alleviate much of the bureaucratic rivalry that has marred relations between the State Department and the National Security Council in the past.

R. James Woolsey Jr./Director of Central Intelligence (non-Cabinet)
Partner in the law firm of Shea & Gardner. A neo-conservative and another former Rhodes scholar, Mr. Woolsey, 51, is an expert on arms control, spy satellites and Pentagon acquisitions. He is close to Brent Scowcroft, who has been national security adviser to President Bush. At a time of budgetary retrenchment, his challenge is to make the Central Intelligence Agency relevant in a post-cold-war era.

Madeleine K. Albright/United Nations Ambassador (non-Cabinet)
President of the Center for National Policy. Born in Prague, she is a Washington insider who worked as a foreign policy adviser to Mr. Clinton, Ms. Albright, 55, is a former professor of international affairs at the Georgetown University School of Foreign Service. She was an adviser to Walter F. Mondale in 1984 and Michael S. Dukakis in 1988. Her expertise in Russia and Eastern Europe is likely to come in handy as she represents the United States on the Security Council.

 
 
DOMESTIC POLICY TEAM

 
Zoe Baird/Attorney General
Vice president and general counsel, Aetna Life and Casualty Company. A tough negotiator who once forced the White House to back down when it wanted to fill the Census Bureau with political appointees, Ms. Baird, 40, served in the Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel in the Carter Administration and later in the White House counsel's office. She was an informal adviser to Mr. Clinton on health issues in the campaign.

Donna E. Shalala/Secretary of Health and Human Services
Chancellor of the University of Wisconsin since 1988, Dr. Shalala served as an assistant Housing and Urban Development Secretary in the Carter Administration. An expert on urban finance, Dr. Shalala, 51, is considered a dynamic leader who is as sensitive to politics as to policy. She prides herself on her ability to cut through bureaucracy, a skill she will need in her new post, where she will immediately be confronted with two intractable problems: health care and welfare.

Henry G. Cisneros/Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
Former Mayor of San Antonio, where he gained national fame as the first Hispanic mayor of a major American city. One of two Hispanic men in the Clinton Cabinet, Mr. Cisneros, 45, displayed a commitment to the problems of cities as Mayor and, by recruiting corporations, helped move San Antonio out of the shadows cast by Dallas and Houston to become a major business center.

Jesse Brown/Secretary of Veterans Affairs
Executive director of the Disabled American Veterans. This former marine has been an advocate for disabled veterans since an ambush in Vietnam left him with a paralyzed right arm 27 years ago. Mr. Brown, 48, is expected to give veterans' organizations a major voice in running the department but faces the challenge of joblessness among veterans and maintaining their health-care benefits at a time of budget cutbacks. Mr. Brown has campaigned vigorously against proposals to cut veterans' benefits.

Richard W. Riley/Secretary of Education
Former Governor of South Carolina. Though low key, Mr. Riley, 59, has a passion for improving education and accomplished sweeping changes in elementary and secondary schools in South Carolina in the mid-1980's. He is likely to urge that the bully pulpit of the White House goad the nation into reforming its educational system and adopting national tests and academic standards.

Federico F. Pena /Secretary of Transportation
Former Mayor of Denver. Elected mayor at 36, Mr. Pena, 45, overcame resistance to his pet project: a $2.3 billion airport that will be the world's largest when it opens next October. An avid jogger, he served on a state commission that charted a 20-year transportation plan featuring mass transit and alternative forms of transportation like bike paths and pedestrian walkways.

 
 
NATURAL RESOURCES/ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY TEAM

 
Hazel R. O'Leary/Secretary of Energy
Executive vice president at the Northern States Power Company of Minnesota, where she has overseen the utility's legal and personnel departments, environmental affairs, public relations and lobbying. An energy regulator in the Ford and Carter administrations, Mrs. O'Leary, 55, became Mr. Clinton's choice after retiring Senator Tim Worth of Colorado fell out of favor. She would be the first Energy Secretary to have worked for an energy company, but her wide experience does not include her new department's biggest job: cleaning up pollution at the nation's nuclear bomb factories.

Carol M. Browner/Administrator, Environmental Protection Agency (non-Cabinet)
Secretary of the Florida Department of Environmental Regulation for the past two years. A former Senate aide to Vice President-elect Al Gore, whose transition team she has directed since November, Ms. Browner, 36, has been praised for her political skills in setting a Federal lawsuit over pollution in the Everglades. She also negotiated a trend-setting agreement with the Disney Company that requires it to spend $40 million to improve a 13-square-mile ranch near Orlando for wildlife.

Bruce Babbitt/Secretary of Interior
A partner at the law firm of Steptoe & Johnson, which has offices in Phoenix and Washington. Mr. Babbitt is a former Governor of Arizona, where business executives have generally spoken highly of him. An outdoorsman fluent in Spanish and fond of unorthodox public policy, Mr. Babbitt, 54, ran for President in 1988 with a wit and sophistication pleasing to editorialists. Voters were less impressed, and he withdrew after finishing fifth in the Iowa caucuses and sixth in New Hampshire primary. Mr. Babbitt was also considered for the post of United States Trade Representative. He is president of the League of Conservation Voters, and his selection thrilled environmentalists.

Mike Espy/Secretary of Agriculture
Representative from Mississippi. The first black to represent Mississippi in Congress since Reconstruction, Mr. Espy, 39, has often defied expectations. Elected to Congress by a slim margin in 1986, he has been re-elected easily. He has appeared in advertisements for the National Rifle Association and forged strong ties with the conservative agricultural interests of the Mississippi Delta. In filling a position typically filled by white men from the Middle West, Mr. Espy will find friends and supporters among producers of cotton, rice, peanuts, sugar and catfish.

HEADLINE: Residents Take Over After City Dismisses Its Staff

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JUAN BAUTISTA, Calif., Dec. 22

 BODY:
Faced with the prospect of bankruptcy in September, the city laid off its entire municipal staff of six full- and six part-time workers. It disbanded the police department and let the city's clerks, public works staff and librarian go.
But rather than plunge the town into a spiral of decay, the Draconian measures have energized the 1,650 people who live here. 
 The city continues to contract out legal and engineering services as it always did. But the county sheriff patrols the streets in place of the town's own police, and dozens of volunteers now conduct the daily business of the city and see to its upkeep.
The city treasurer mows the lawn in front of City Hall, retired residents read the town's 690 water meters and the children in the local karate club clean bathrooms and trim the grounds at the community center.
"They recognize they are the government," said Mandy Rose, a part-time student who volunteers at City Hall, answering phones and using her accounting skills to assist with a city audit. "If things are going to keep moving, they have a responsibility to contribute not only with their taxes, but in other ways as well."
 
Backdrop to 'Vertigo'
 Known for its historic mission, which was in Alfred Hitchcock's "Vertigo," this city 75 miles south of San Francisco has avoided convenience stores and fast-food chains to stay true to its small-town Western roots. Chickens roam the main street in the early morning, and men with weathered faces beneath cowboy hats still greet each other by name.
But what San Juan Bautista could not avoid are the same economic realities plaguing larger cities. Many places, like San Juan Bautista, did not worry when they spent more than they took in each month, thinking that the governments above would rescue them. But the other governments can no longer help, urban experts say.
"Cities used to go into debt heavily and hope for a state or Federal bail-out," said George Peterson, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, a not-for-profit policy research group in Washington. "Now it's become clear that higher levels of government won't do that, and cities are making expenditure adjustments much more quickly than they used to."
In California, financial pressures have weighed on cities for some time. Despite brisk economic growth during the 1980's, revenues in localities decreased by 17.5 percent, when inflation is taken into account, according to the League of California Cities, a lobbying group based in Sacramento.
 
Reasons for Decline
 Proposition 13, which severely limited the ability of cities to raise taxes contributed to the drop in revenues, and the state's lackluster economy and continuing budget crisis have recently added to it. The recession has eroded sales, hotel and business taxes, and to help balance its budget, the state has started to siphon off a greater share of the taxes.
"Cities throughout the state are in the same predicament," said Debbie Thornton, a spokeswoman for the League of California Cities. "Cities are basically at a bare minimum."
Russell Carlsen, the city's interim city manager said: "What people are doing is putting off the inevitable. It sounds like empty platitudes, but we're just balancing the checkbook."
In September, the City Council asked Mr. Carlsen to help San Juan Bautista find a replacement for its departing city manager, draw up a budget for the new fiscal year and ease the transition between administrations.
 
More Disarray Than Expected
 But on his third day on the job, Mr. Carlsen was told the city probably would not be able to make payroll that week. He said the financial records were in far more disarray than he had imagined.
San Juan Bautista, which operates on an annual budget of just $650,000, accumulated $150,000 in debt, and the debt was deepening by about $15,000 each month with no prospects for a turnaround. Seeing little alternative, Mr. Carlsen proposed the drastic cuts.
Though the City Council has a reputation for its combative politics, the council members put aside their usual differences and voted unanimously for the layoffs.
Even so, the decision was not a popular one. Robert Paradice, a councilman, recalls an uncomfortable feeling when he walked through the crowd after that meeting.
 
Looked Like a Lynch Mob
 "I started to figure out what a lynch mob was like," he said.
But the controversy quickly died. The county sheriff, who happens to live in town, has kept a visible presence and all of a sudden things the city could not seem to do when it had money and staff are now getting done.
Anthony Botelho, fed up with potholes, offered to supply workers from his orchard to do the repairs if the city supplied the necessary material. Former Mayor Leonard Caetano called a friend at the nearby Granite Rock Company, who donated three tons of blacktop, enough to patch 300 potholes.
Over at the Mission Cafe, a local coffee shop, the owner, Gloria Gutierrez, said people are generally happy with the way things have worked out.
"We know we don't have the money," she said. "We do the best we can. I think the streets are cleaner than before."

HEADLINE: Workers in Ukraine Protest Big Price Rises

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: KIEV, Ukraine, Dec. 26

 BODY:
Thousands of workers in the Ukrainian capital protested sharp price increases that took effect today as a result of deep cuts in state subsidies.
More than 5,000 workers from a defense plant demonstrated for several hours along with leaders of the Socialist Party, made up mostly of former Communist Party members. 
 Prime Minister Leonid Kuchma defended the austerity measures as crucial to the country's survival. He said cutting subsidies on basic goods and services, which quadrupled the price of bread and increased the cost of a Kiev subway ride tenfold, was a painful step that could no longer be postponed.
"Now the Government is forced to take highly unpopular measures and bring prices for a number of goods into line with their cost," Mr. Kuchma said. "If we do not take this burden on ourselves, then tomorrow it will weigh 100 times more heavily on our children."
Under the increases, a loaf that cost six to eight coupons, or less than a cent in United States currency on Friday, was selling for about 30 coupons or 3 cents in the capital today. A worker at the factory earns about 5,000 to 6,000 coupons, or up to $6.70, a month. The monthly inflation rate 30 percent.
"The Government has no right to allow the impoverishment of the people," said Valery Kravchenko, a protest leader.

HEADLINE: Housing List In New York Hits Record

BYLINE: By SHAWN G. KENNEDY

 BODY:
The number of people waiting for New York Housing Authority apartments has risen to 240,000 families, the highest level ever and nearly equal to the total number of units in all of the city's public housing projects and subsidized apartments.
Based on the current vacancy rate of about 4.5 percent a year in Housing Authority apartments, those applying for housing today without priority consideration could face a 20-year wait for one of the estimated 8,000 units that become available annually. 
 Currently the Housing Authority manages nearly 180,000 units in its own buildings as well as about 61,000 privately owned apartments through a rent voucher program. There are 324 projects and about 600,000 tenants.
Housing officials say the dramatic growth in families seeking public housing in recent years, up from about 180,000 names in 1990, reflects the accumulated impact of 12 years of neglect of housing at the Federal level, the city's burgeoning homeless population, the economic downturn and the impact of the crack and AIDS epidemics on families.
 
600 Applications a Day
 "The need for housing has not been addressed on the Federal front," said Sally B. Hernandez-Pinero, chairwoman of the city's Housing Authority. "We have suffered not just because of a lack of money, but because of a lack of a housing policy. There has been no meaningful construction of new apartments and the city does not have the means to construct housing in a major way."
Despite the scarcity of available units, applicants continue to pour into Housing Authority offices at a rate of about 600 a day. They come, housing officials say, desperate to get out of city shelters, or dilapidated privately owned apartments or the cramped homes of friends and families.
Some are like Nadja Moore, 19, mother of a 5-month-old son. Living, for the time being, with in-laws who she said were eager for her to find her own apartment, she traveled recently from Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, to the Housing Authority's application center in Manhattan to look into taking a vacant apartment she knows about in the Rutland Towers complex in Flatbush, Brooklyn.
"I am already on the list," said Ms. Moore, who is not currently working. "I filled out the application for the first time about a year ago." She said that in a previous interview, "I was told I was priority because I was pregnant, but that it would take at least six months for us to get an apartment."
She described the place where she was living as a dump with rats and broken windows.
"We have to get out of there," she said. "I know people who live in Rutland, and they have better apartments than the place I live now."
Not far from Ms. Moore, Awilda Cordera, 31, worked on an application for herself and her two children. She said that she had heard that housing was nearly impossible to get but that she needed to try.
"We are now in a studio apartment in Manhattan," she said. "It is not enough room for three of us."
 
Little Incentive to Move
 Housing Authority statistics show that, on the average, a family stays in public housing for 15.8 years. That length of time reflects their lack of alternatives, said Albert A. Walsh, a lawyer and board member of Citizens Housing and Planning Council, a national advocacy organization based in New York.
"What is unique to New York is that the spread in rent paid in public housing and what it costs to live in decent neighborhoods is so large that moving out is an insurmountable barrier to many," said Mr. Walsh, who was chairman of the city's Housing Authority during the John V. Lindsay administration in the late 1960's and early 70's.
This does not mean that public housing tenants have solved all of their shelter problems, as the Dec. 17 slaying of a popular school principal in a Housing Authority complex in Red Hook, Brooklyn, illustrated. Concerns about security, the poor condition of buildings and the disruptive presence of drugs are ever-present in some complexes.
Still, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said, "Despite our problems, and we do have them, people still want to live in Housing Authority buildings. We have almost no vacancy rate while in many other cities the public housing has double-digit vacancy rates."
 
List Called False Hope
 Ruth Mathis, a working mother with three sons, has lived for 12 years in the Louis Armstrong Houses in Bedford-Stuyvesant. She says she has stayed in public housing because it gives her a decent, inexpensive place to live.
"I love my apartment, and most of the people here are very good," said Ms. Mathis, who works for the New York City Police Department. "The only thing I don't like are the few undesirables who live in the complex, who can make life difficult for the rest of us," referring to disruptive residents.
Some housing officials have expressed concern that maintaining an open waiting list perpetuates a hope that realistically does not exist for most applicants until well after the turn of the century. Moreover, the intake operation costs about $6 million in an annual budget of $1.5 billion for the Housing Authority.
When asked whether closing the list was a possibility, Ms. Hernandez-Pinero said that because her priorities were improving security and expanding a drug elimination program, she did not feel she could address the issue now.
Jeanne Nathan, a spokeswoman for the Housing Authority, says that when people are interviewed for housing, they are told of the extreme shortage of units. But they are not given an estimate on the time it will take for them to be placed. "There is no accurate way of saying how long the wait will be," she said. "So much depends on factors like the size of the apartment required and where the applicant wants to live."
 
Homeless Get Priority
 An applicant's rank on the list can be affected by a change in personal situations, such as the addition of another member to the household, she said.
Every three years, she said, the list is purged of applicants who no longer need or want public housing.
"It is a long shot for most applicants," she said. "So few apartments become available each year. But like Lotto, you have to be in to win it."
The New York City Housing Authority was created nearly 60 years ago under the administration of Fiorello H. La Guardia to provide a safe, clean environment for the working poor. A state-chartered, public agency, the Housing Authority gets about 80 percent of financing from the Federal Government and the rest from the city and state.
Traditionally, the tenant mix in Housing Authority complexes held at about one third working poor, one third elderly and one third people on public assistance. But the percentage of families on welfare has jumped from about 35 percent to nearly 50 percent of the mix in recent years.
In the last four years, public housing has also been used by the city to alleviate the homeless problem. In 1988 the Housing Authority began giving priority to 2,000 homeless families a year as a way for the city to meet a Federal deadline of removing homeless families from welfare hotels.
Last August Ms. Hernandez-Pinero negotiated a cut in the Housing Authority's obligation from 2,000 to 1,420 of homeless families each year.
 
Federal Aid Cut
 And the Authority's priority placements are not limited to the homeless. It is often called upon to find shelter for others with special needs, like victims of domestic violence.
The line for public housing has continued to grow despite the addition of 48,000 units of housing created at a furious pace, by the city, since 1987. The vast majority of what has been created in city-owned vacant buildings by the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development.
Federal aid for public housing, however, has been cut sharply. The Housing Authority's statistics show that Federal financing for new public housing units in the city fell from just over 20,820 in 1977 to zero in 1982 and 1983.
There was a minor restoration of funding for new units during the remaining years of the 1980's.
In 1990 New York received nothing from Washington for additional housing but the last two years have seen partial restoration of new construction financing. Currently the Housing Authority has plans for 2,500 new units.
The Housing Authority's waiting list is far from the only symbol of New York's severe housing shortage. For example, the wait for units in subsidized, Mitchell-Lama housing complexes, housing built with public subsidies for moderate-income families, can be as long as 12 years.
Ms. Hernandez-Pinero, like other housing officials and advocates, is hopeful that the change in administrations in Washington bodes well for the effort to improve housing opportunities.
"But even if the new administration makes housing an early priority," she said, "any significant impact is years away, because housing was literally abandoned for so long."

HEADLINE: COLLEGE BASKETBALL;
Mashburn Goes Searching for Himself

BYLINE: By WILLIAM C. RHODEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LEXINGTON, Ky.

 BODY:
Jamal Mashburn leaned back on the trainer's table recently, and reflected on his career as a University of Kentucky basketball player and his life as a student. In the last three years, the two have become separate entities.
In terms of his career, life has been extraordinary. 
 Mashburn, who played high school basketball for Cardinal Hayes in the Bronx, is firmly established as one of the nation's elite players. The 6-foot-8-inch, 240-pound player has achieved the perfect balance between the pivot, where he dominates with a strong, versatile inside game, and the perimeter, where he is a lethal 3-point shooter.
His scoring average has increased from 12.9 points a game as a freshman, to 21.3 last season, to 25.3 this season.
 
The Monster Mash
 When Kentucky faces Rutgers at Madison Square Garden tomorrow night, all eyes will be on the man Kentuckians have nicknamed the Monster Mash. Mashburn, born in New York City and raised in the Rangel Homes on 155th Street, has never played at the Garden.
"It'll be exciting, mainly because my mother has never seen me play college ball in New York," he said.
When Mashburn gauges the distance he has traveled since leaving New York, he measures his progress by what has taken place outside the arena. His world has now expanded to a point where proficiency in basketball isn't enough.
"Sometimes I feel that playing basketball is the only gift I have, really," he said. "I wish I could write music or play music. Basketball is not a real big thing. Something besides sports, I think, is a real talent, a gift God gave you. In sport, you can work on it and become good with hard work and talent."
Indeed, those who know Mashburn talk about how hard he has worked to change from being a pudgy playground hopeful to becoming one of the nation's leading players.
 
'People Are Jealous'
 "A lot of times people are jealous, but everybody's so proud of Jamal, first of all because they know what he had to do to get this far," said Russell Glover, Mashburn's cousin and one of his closest friends. "When he was younger, Jamal had a hard time even getting chosen for a team when they played in back of the building. They called him a big baby, said he would never make it.
"The other reason people are happy for Jamal is because of the kind of person he is," Glover added. "He's quiet, doesn't bother anybody. People want to talk with him or touch him. I remember once a couple of people, I guess they were crackheads, came up to him and wanted his autograph and wished him good luck. They said they followed his career and were happy he'd made it. That meant a lot to Jamal. He sees himself as part of the community."
Indeed, aside from becoming a pro-caliber basketball player, Mashburn's must consistent quest, as he negotiates fame, is a longing to fit in. In Lexington he is the Monster Mash, No. 24 or an all-America basketball player. He is featured on posters showing him crushing a basketball.
 
Search for Reality
 Trips back to New York tend to ground him in reality, help him maintain a fix on what is real and what is not.
"I know that's all part of the hype, but that's not who I am," Mashburn said. "Sometimes in Lexington, there's so much hype around basketball, you're treated in a way than can make you lose sight of reality. Back home, around my friends I'm just Jamal. They ask me about my experiences. They want to know what it's like playing against the Dream Team or playing at Kentucky. But it's not like I'm this big star. I'm just a friend who's had some different experiences."
After playing on a select team of college all-stars who scrimmaged against the United States Olympic squad, Mashburn spent most of last summer in New York. He proudly recalls how he spent a good deal of time in recording studios with Glover, an aspiring musician-writer who plays keyboards and hopes to produce rap, rhythm and blues and gospel groups.
"He's a person I really admire," Mashburn said. "Sometimes I envy him because he's so creative, he taught himself to play. He can write and mix. That's the thing, there's so much music where I grew up. People just don't have the resources to get it out."
Perhaps a little more then he would like, trips to Harlem also help remind Mashburn that, for all the hype of his all-America career at Kentucky, in some eyes, in some environments, he is merely a potential criminal in a perpetual game of cops and robbers.
According to his family, Mashburn was stopped by the police in Harlem twice last summer -- both in cases of "mistaken identity." The first time Mashburn and two friends had just picked up Glover from his job at a bank on 145th Street. They were four young black men riding in a car with Kentucky license plates.
Glover said the police stopped the car, and with guns drawn told everyone to get out. Only when Mashburn announced that his father was a police officer was the situation diffused.
His father, Robert Mashburn, recalled the other incident when his son was stopped outside of the Rangel Homes. "Same thing: out-of-town license, black male wearing a certain type of shirt," Robert Mashburn said. "They thought he was selling drugs."
Both of Mashburn's parents agree that since their son has been in Kentucky, they have slept easier.
 
Centerpiece of Rebuilding
 When he committed himself to the Wildcats three seasons ago, Mashburn became the centerpiece of Kentucky's rebuilding process, with Coach Rick Pitino at the helm. Mashburn was a freshman when the Wildcats completed the final season of a two-year probation. Last season, he helped pull Kentucky within an overtime victory of reaching the Final Four.
This season may be Mashburn's final one at Kentucky. He is projected as a National Basketball Association lottery pick should he choose to leave school after this season.
Mashburn says whether he leaves this season or next, in many positive ways he will not be the same person coming out of Kentucky that he was going in.
"I've matured a lot," he said. "I appreciate education. Before, I just wanted to come in, play ball and go to the pros. Now I understand the value of an education, particularly for an African-American male. Even if you don't finish in four years, you absorb information. It changed the way I approach some things."
His mother would like for Mashburn, a communications major, to earn his degree. The reality of economics, however, may dictate a different course of action.
 
Wants to Help
 He would like to move his family out of New York City, he would like to give his cousin's production company a boost.
"There's more than just me to think about," Mashburn said, referring to his decision whether to leave school or stay.
Of course, the first order of business for Mashburn is to have a dominating year. After deferring to upperclassmen his first two seasons, Mashburn, with prodding from Pitino, has taken over. But he has not taken over in a frenzied, egocentric manner. He might take the open shot when he would have passed off, or now he might demand the ball in clutch situations.
"Basically, Jamal is unselfish," his father said. "He's a team player, but it goes past basketball. He was taught to respect all people, to respect his elders. He knows how to wait his turn."
"The way I approach the game, and people, is to respect all and fear none," Mashburn said. "So far, that's what's worked for me."

HEADLINE: No Surprise the Public Is Out of the Loop

 BODY:
Mrs. Gualtieri of the Suffolk Community Alliance shouldn't be surprised that "the democratic process was circumvented" by the State Power Authority at Holtsville ["State Presses Plan to Build Power Plant, Dec. 6]. The public has no control over energy decisions, and she might have added where are the citizens on Judge Weinstein's citizen advisory panel? Where are the elections for the directors of the L.I. Power Authority, and where is the public in the Public Service Commission?
The State P.S.C. is about 90 years old, and governors of that time, including Franklin D. Roosevelt, thought that the public was too stupid to set electric rates. So politicians would appoint commissioners, instead of having them stand for election, sort of like our present Governor's thinking that the public was stupid in turning down the last bond issue for this debt-ridden state. 
 The results were predictable, with Shoreham's being perhaps the worst example. Not only do we have a situation that costs the Island more than the greatest financial scandal in United States history, the savings and loan swindle, but during the Lilco trial some of the P.S.C. commissioners actually testified that they would have approved rate increases even if they knew that Lilco was lying.
The situation becomes even more onerous when one of the politicians selecting P.S.C. commissioners owns a law firm representing Lilco and when commissioners who vote for increases leave to become high-priced "utility experts" and lobbyists. Then there is the violation of the intent of The Sherman Antitrust Act that allows Lilco to control two energy monopolies, gas and electric, that should compete with each other.
The public knows best. Our Founding Fathers, especially Thomas Jefferson, knew that only the citizens should control the public purse. And in a survey that was as close to a referendum as we will have on Shoreham, the citizens rightfully rejected it in spite of years of propaganda from Lilco. Then there is the verdict from another group of citizens in the jury that found Lilco guilty of fraud and perjury.
The statement that "after years of asserting that the 800-megawatt Shoreham plant was essential to meeting electric demand, Lilco now projects that even without Holtsville, supplies will be adequate in the year 2000" is amazing. There are the same people who wanted two more reactors at Shoreham plus four more at Jamesport and threatened "a massive power crisis," offshore oil wells, "one or more coal plants," etc. No wonder the jury found them guilty.
We, the Long Island citizens, are being robbed blind by Lilco's nuclear dream, and the chief executive office of Grumman was right about the cost of Shoreham bankrupting us. I wonder if Judge Weinstein, who threw out the jury's decision and predicted that the people would rue the day Shoreham closed, is now aware of the real truth. We have the highest rates in the nation, and while the average United States electric rate actually shows a slight decrease by the year 2000, ours will increase again by 60 to 100 percent under the Governor's "wonderful deal!"
His Honor also seemed impressed by "this nuclear plant in all its technical glory!" But if he read accounts in the technical press, he might have come to the conclusion that only Rube Goldberg would have been impressed. We are the laughingstock of the technical world for ever letting Lilco pull off this incredible heist, and the details of Shoreham's bungled construction read like a comedy, unless you are one of the innocent victims who have to pay for the mess.
Mr. Koppelman is right about conservation's reducing the need for future plants, and that option is surprisingly good, both for the Island and the nation. Someone in the electrical engineering society, the I.E.E.E., estimated that it takes 50 medium-size plants just to power America's refrigerators and that the fridge design is old and terribly inefficient. How about a redesign of that and many of our other appliances? Bet it would cost a fraction of the Holtsville price, with longer-lasting benefits.
The price for Holtsville seems low -- hopefully not 20 times below the actual price like Shoreham. But if you accept it and even ignore the economy of scale, we could have a half-dozen Shoreham-size gas-fired plants for the amount of money wasted on Shoreham. However, in spite of all the reasons for stopping Holtsville, and Shoreham, there is another that is more important. We live in the largest hydro region in North America, some of which we paid for and some of which was built by an Islander, Robert Moses. Hydropower, where available, is the optimal source of electricity. And the New York Power Authority would be doing the Island a service by stopping Holtsville and increasing our connections to this power. No matter what Lilco now says, hydro should be the major ingredient in our power mix.

HEADLINE: U.D.C. Doesn't Have Plan for 500 State Acres

 BODY:
"State Bypasses Town in Zoning Approval" [Dec. 6] about Huntington had better be a warning to Long Islanders that their vision of humane living and sustainable economic growth is the least concern of our Governor. The mutilation of this 500 acres of residentially zoned state land may well set the pattern for the next phase of wildcat industrial development on Long Island, this time right on top of a sole-source water-aquifer recharge area.
As homeowners we are outraged by Governor Cuomo's use of state authority, i.e., the Urban Development Corporation, to open the door for a hodgepodge of industrial-commercial businesses polluting our drinking water and congesting the two-lane residential roads around this land. The Northern State Parkway, which borders one side of the site, provides no access road and, anyway, does not permit the inevitable trucks, unless that restriction is dropped, giving us another Long Island Expressway for all New Yorkers to enjoy! 
 The chopping up of this land could certainly happen, because the state itself still has no use plan for the 500 acres, even after seven years of frustrating efforts by our Town of Huntington and local residents to work with the state to get one. Furthermore, this is not an urban area, and the U.D.C. was established to focus its projects on distressed areas, not to use our taxes to finance the multimillion-dollar Olympus Corporation to relocate from Nassau to Suffolk.
If this U.D.C. outrage is implemented, it will repeat once again exactly how commercial development should not happen on Long Island. The state says it no longer needs the land. So, instead of turning it over to the Town of Huntington, it will keep it and lease it piecemeal to a series of developers who understandably want to be free of our town's zoning regulations.
Instead of allowing the town to control the property and work with local businesses to intelligently develop a low-density use plan, our Governor is setting up a giveaway scheme that will benefit a few while thumbing his nose at the rest of us. Adding insult to injury, we all will be expected to pay taxes to pay off the flow of bond issuances, which the U.D.C. will continue to use to finance these projects.
The majority of Long Islanders do not want to join in the massive development of the Boston-to-Washington corridor. For sustainable growth we do not need a Calverton jetport. We do not need more shopping malls than we can use. Not in my backyard is not the issue. Instead, the issue is not in anyone's backyard.

HEADLINE: The Winners and (Many) Losers of '92

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS

 BODY:
A year ago, the seers thought 1992 would be a year in which unity would prevail in Europe and George Bush in the American elections. Neither bet, it turned out, proved a winner. But there were winners -- and a lot of losers, too -- justifying the following awards. There will, unfortunately, be no awards ceremony.

Teflon Award 
 To Ernst & Young, whose predecessor firm came to dominate a large part of the savings and loan auditing business in the 1980's with a reputation for being, well, not hostile to aggressive accounting techniques. This year Ernst agreed to pay $400 million to Federal regulators and $63 million to investors who had bought junk bonds issued by the parent of Charles Keating's Lincoln Savings. Ernst's competitors got no fees but are being forced to pay for the transgressions through sharply higher insurance premiums. And Ernst's insurers, not the partners who allowed the bad accounting to go on, paid most of the firm's penalties.

"Did I Say That?" Award
 To John Frazee Jr., chairman of the Centel Corporation, who talked of values above $60 per share if Centel was sold, then agreed to a merger in which Centel shares were exchanged for Sprint stock worth about $33.50, $9 below Centel's market value at the time. Mr. Frazee did not offer refunds to shareholders who, having listened to him, paid premium prices for Centel stock.

Profiles in Courage Award
To Gary L. Roubos, chief executive of the Dover Corporation, for being the only member of the Business Roundtable, big business's lobbying arm, to accept that stock options for executives are worth something. That may have helped persuade the S.E.C. to require that shareholders be told the value of the options so eagerly sought by many of the same executives who claim they are worthless.

Charity for the Greedy Award
To Western Europe's Finance Ministers, who maintained the European exchange rate mechanism just long enough to allow speculators from around the world to get positioned for its inevitable breakdown. Central banks lost billions even as their governments were crying poor.

Pinocchio Award
To Norman Lamont, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, who vowed to take "whatever measures are necessary" to avoid devaluation of the pound, then, within hours, devalued it. To the surprise of many, Mr. Lamont has kept his job.

Boy Who Cried Wolf Award
To George Bush, who had seen so many signs of economic growth since the recession began in 1990 that he was ignored when he talked of recovery -- correctly, it turned out -- in mid-1992.

J.F.K. Missile Gap Award
To Bill Clinton, who ran on the theory that the recession was still on, and discovered almost as soon as the votes were counted that it had vanished.

Worst Inside Trade
To Richard Knight of Chambers Development. As chief financial officer, Mr. Knight was one of the few who knew that Chambers was using dubious bookkeeping techniques that inflated reported profits. When that fact came out, Chambers stock plunged to below $5 a share. Mr. Knight, who has lost his job, had purchased 2,000 shares -- at $26.625 each.

What a Way to Go Award
To Stephen Chao, president of Fox Television Stations, ousted by Rupert Murdoch after arranging for a male stripper to appear at an anti-censorship speech before a group including Mr. Murdoch and the head of the National Endowment for the Humanities.

Nothing Personal Award
To Robert C. Stempel, ousted by the General Motors board as chief executive, then promptly rehired as a consultant.
Runner-up: James Robinson 3d, chairman of American Express, forced to lead a board committee to choose his successor so he could take early retirement.

Best Unpopular I.P.O.
To the Equitable Companies and its chairman, Richard Jenrette, for a public offering that drew Wall Street hisses at $9 per share, then rose above $14 this month.

Worst I.P.O. (Completed)
To Computervision, formerly Prime Computer, which, after cutting its price and reducing the number of shares offered, finally got to market at $12 a share in August. Most of the proceeds went to the underwriter, Shearson Lehman, which just happened to be the firm that had made the mistake of financing Prime's leveraged buyout in 1989. Computervision is trading around $5.

Mr. Magoo Award for Auditing
To KPMG Peat Marwick, which did not notice that checks issued by the Comptronix Corporation to pay for equipment were being deposited into Comptronix's own bank accounts as payment for products it had supposedly sold. In fact, none of the transactions were real, and KPMG certified fictional profits for three years.

Flip of the Year
To Kohlberg, Kravis, Roberts & Company, which bought American Re, the reinsurance firm, from Aetna in September, and proposes to sell part of it to the public, at triple the price, early next year. Why the increase in value? Hurricanes caused big losses for insurers. Wall Street, in its infinite wisdom, figured this made insurance stocks more valuable, because the companies would be sure to raise premiums.

Best Industry Remaking
To Ed Artzt, chairman of Procter & Gamble, for changing the way consumer goods are sold. Rather than charge high prices to retailers and then offer them lots of money for promotion, the company simply cut prices and promotional money. That raised profits and, to the surprise of cynics, apparently changed the way the industry operates.

Worst Industry Remaking
To Robert Crandall, chairman of AMR, American Airlines' corporate parent, for unsuccessfully trying to rationalize industry pricing. His attempts failed in part because he could not resist punishing competitors that offered discounts -- by discounting even more. As the red ink mounted, AMR began to fire executives to save money. Mr. Crandall was not among those receiving pink slips.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 3, 1993, Sunday

 CORRECTION:
An article last Sunday about the winners and losers of 1992 misstated the role of Gary L. Roubos, chief executive of the Dover Corporation, in arguing that stock options for executives have value. Mr. Roubos took that position in a letter to the Business Roundtable.

New Accord in Hartford And Other Bright Spots

BYLINE: By ROBERT SHERMAN

 BODY:
A YEAR ago, the musical review of 1991 contained the doleful tidings that the Hartford Symphony strike, which had already forced the cancellation of three sets of subscription concerts, was not yet resolved. Even the most pessimistic could hardly have guessed that the impasse would continue for the rest of the season and into the fall.
Happily, a three-year agreement has been reached between the musicians' union and the Symphony, and the sounds of orchestra are again being heard in Hartford. The winter-spring schedule lists five pairs of monthly concerts at the Bushnell, along with three sets of Pops programs and another trilogy in the family series. For a brochure or reservations, call the Symphony office at 244-2999. 
 There were other bright spots on the 1992 Connecticut horizon, of course, including a number of organizational births, debuts and other blessed musical events.
Though it did not seem like the most propitious time to start a new opera company, given the perilous economic state of the arts, Connecticut Concert Opera did precisely that last January, introducing a four-event premiere season at the Centennial Theater in Simsbury. "People came streaming out into the lobby absolutely beaming," recalled the president of the opera, John Wadhams, who looks forward to giving listeners many future opportunities to hear "some of the best singing in Connecticut."
Harvard and Yale may be rivals on the football field, but for the first time in their histories, the chapel choirs of each university joined together in a February program at Woolsey Hall. They will try it again next year in Cambridge.
Also in February, Erick Friedman was joined by several of his Yale faculty colleagues at Sprague Hall, the joyful occasion marking the great violinist's first full recital since a car accident five years earlier.
A beautiful new theater opened in March at Norwalk Community College, with opera and jazz concerts ushering in what has grown into a diverse and exceptionally worthy performing arts series.
A May concert in Westport celebrated the merger of Friends of Music, founded in 1956, and the Burndy Library Adventures in Music, which started nine years later. Then in November, Rossini's Cinderella story, "La Cenerentola," was chosen to celebrate the new alliance of Connecticut Grand Opera (which itself had amalgamated with Stamford State Opera several years back) and the Stamford Chamber Orchestra.
At the American Symphony Orchestra League's national conference in June, the Norwalk Symphony and its music director, Jesse Levine, were given an ASCAP citation for "Adventuresome Programming of Contemporary Music."
On Aug. 1, Princeton University published an article by a Connecticut College professor, Timothy Jackson, asserting that the "Four Last Songs" of Richard Strauss are actually Five Last Songs. Not one to waste time, the artistic director of the Summer Music Festival in Waterford, Peter Sacco, conducted what are now titled "Last Orchestral Songs" that same evening at the festival in Waterford, with the soprano Dinah Bryant as soloist.
It took two "extravaganza gala benefits" for the Stamford Center to dedicate the new Rich Forum in September, introducing the communications complex and its several new performing spaces. Having overseen the creation of the forum from its earliest planning stages, the center's executive director, Randall Brion, resigned to pursue new challenges, the board expressing its deepest gratitude to Mr. Brion for his "leadership, artistic vision and deep sense of commitment to excellence."
Connecticut became home to a new folk cafe earlier this month, when the Starry Night Coffeehouse opened for business in Bridgewater. The artists and their songs, said its director, Mitchell Katz, "are sure to capture your attention and captivate your heart."
Finally, congratulations to some of the organizations and artists with round-number anniversaries in 1992.
5: The Shubert Opera and Westfair Chamber Singers have performed for five years now, and Michael Palmer celebrated his fifth season at the helm of the New Haven Symphony by signing a three-year contract.
10: The Connecticut Early Music Festival, Chamber Music at St. John's and the Camerata Ensemble each marked a decade of music making.
15: Newtown Friends of Music has offered recitals for a decade and a half.
20: A January gala celebrated Gustav Meier's 20th year as music director of the Greater Bridgeport Symphony.
25: Three Connecticut conductors marked silver anniversaries last spring: James Humphreville was honored at a benefit for his service to the Danbury Music Center, Richard Vogt led a "Joyful Noise" concert at First Congregational Church of Old Greenwich, and Richard Einsel marked the occasion with a performance of "The Eighth Day," a work commissioned in his honor from Toby Hall and Nancy Evans Bush. And two weekends ago Mr. Humphreville conducted the Danbury Music Center's 25th annual performance of Tchaikovsky's "Nutcracker."
30: The Fairfield County Choral opened its 30th anniversary season only last month, so the party continues into the spring.
35: A similar milestone with five years added, prevails for the Greenwich Symphony.
45: Add yet another decade to catch up with the Candlelight Concert Series in Wilton.
50: The anniversary is golden for Fairfield University, the festivities thus far including the premieres of two commissioned scores, David Leisner's work "Ad Majorem Dei Gloriam" and "Dream Quest" by the Bridgeport composer Peter DeMarco.
500: Orchestra New England gave Concert No. 500, with its founding director, James Sinclair, conducting another world premiere, a horn concerto by Nicholas Skedgell of Hamden.

HEADLINE: Clinton Turning to New Yorkers

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK

 BODY:
Just a few months ago, the Vice President of the United States came to New York, not to praise, but to berate and in fact to ridicule the place where Democrats would nominate their Presidential candidate.
"In so many ways," Dan Quayle said last June, "the liberal Democrats chose the perfect site for their convention, almost as if they feel a strange compulsion to return to the scene of the crime." 
 But now, the Democrats are returning to the White House. And after 12 years of Republican rule, President-elect Bill Clinton is looking to the state for something other than jokes: for people to serve in his Administration.
At least five people who are either from New York or who have spent much of their professional lives in the state, among them Roger C. Altman and Robert E. Rubin, Wall Street bankers, are among the three dozen major appointments announced by Mr. Clinton so far.
It may now take months to fill hundreds of mid- and lower-level posts. But several transition officials said that when the appointments are completed there will almost certainly be more New Yorkers wandering in and out of the Oval Office than at any time since the Johnson Administration.
 
Angling for President's Ear
 Even as many from New York, including those appointed, exult in this sign of renewed eminence, nobody agrees on exactly what it all means. However powerful, these power brokers will only be angling for the President's ear.
Still, there are those like Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the New York Democrat, who say that more New Yorkers in the White House can only mean wonderful things for the state.
"Of course it does," said Mr. Moynihan, himself now in line to assume the powerful post of chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. "It means that they'll know what you're talking about. I mean, if I was sitting there in Treasury and a Senator from Wyoming called me, with the best will in the world I wouldn't really know what he was talking about."
But then there are those like New York's other Senator, Alfonse M. D'Amato, a Republican, who take a less rosy view. Mr. D'Amato agreed that it was certainly interesting that so many New Yorkers were coming to Washington, then politely suggested that this fact and $1.25 could get someone a ride on the New York City subway.
 
'They Won't Have the Money'
 "So there are going to be some sympathetic ears," said Mr. D'Amato. "But let's face it. People in Washington are not going to be able to meet the demands which will be made upon the Federal Government, by New York or by anybody else. There's no way. They're just not going to be able to do it. They won't have the money. They don't have the money."
It would of course be nice to come up with a specific dollar estimate of what a Clinton Administration will mean for New York: an official projection, say, that Gov. Mario M. Cuomo can now count on $827,336,428.53 more for his beleaguered budget this year than he would have gotten from a re-elected President Bush.
But as Mr. D'Amato indicates, that would be wrong. Nobody in New York seems to be counting on any immediate fiscal windfall, although Mayor David N. Dinkins did helpfully send a 24-page letter to Mr. Clinton the day after the election. He urged the President-elect to spend billions more on urban problems like health care, education, housing, roads, bridges, drug treatment, job training and police officers.
Still, even if there are no immediate, tangible benefits at hand, some people here are latching onto the notion that New York, particularly New York City, stands to be helped in some more amorphous but nonetheless important way.
 
Cities High on the Agenda
 "You're going to have people who you know, who we can reach out to directly to make our case," said Anthony E. Shorris, the First Deputy Executive Director at the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and an adviser to the Clinton transition team on transportation appointments. "This is an Administration that right from the get-go says the problems of the cities are high on our agenda."
For the moment, anyway, the auguries are much less clear for New York's neighboring states. It is true that Connecticut might now claim the allegiances of the woman who was nominated by Mr. Clinton to be Attorney General, Zoe Baird, a lawyer for a Connecticut insurance company; but then again, by that logic the state is losing Mr. Bush, who grew up there.
Among the big New York names in Washington these days are Mr. Altman and Mr. Rubin, who are on Mr. Clinton's economic A-team; Donna E. Shalala, a former president of Hunter College, who is his choice for Secretary of Health and Human Services; and Clifton R. Wharton Jr., the chancellor of the State University of New York from 1978 to 1987, who was tapped for Deputy Secretary of State.
 
Studied Law Under Cuomo
 Another New Yorker named to the Cabinet is Ronald H. Brown, who was raised in Harlem, studied under Mr. Cuomo at St. John's Law School, and cut his political teeth as a Democratic district leader in Mount Vernon. He is set to head the Commerce Department.
And plenty of others who now live elsewhere can certainly claim the title of honorary New Yorker. For instance, Samuel R. Berger, the new deputy national security adviser, was a special assistant to New York City Mayor John V. Lindsay and a legislative assistant to New York Representative Joseph Resnick.
Vincent Tese, New York State's Director of Economic Development, said it is significant that both Mr. Rubin and Mr. Altman are from New York City, and he noted that both had served as economic advisers to Governor Cuomo.
 
Knowing Urban Problems
 "Roger Altman and Bob Rubin are people who have lived in the city of New York," said Mr. Tese, "who know the problems associated with urban centers and have a keen appreciation that unless cities are doing well, the country won't do well." He was noticeably more disparaging about some of Mr. Bush's top officials, remarking, for instance, that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady was from "the horse country of New Jersey."
Still, top officials on the Clinton transition team, including those from New York, categorically reject the notion that any particular region of the country will or should benefit from the Clinton Presidency.
"I find it inconceivable that anybody is going to be designing policies to help New York just because they're from New York," said Harold M. Ickes, the special assistant to the transition director, Warren M. Christopher, in a telephone interview from Little Rock. Mr. Ickes, himself a New York City resident, is expected to be given an important position in the new Administration.
There are, arguably, a lot more reasons for states in the South to get excited about the changing of the guard in the White House. Not only is Mr. Clinton a Southerner, so is his Vice President, Al Gore of Tennessee.
And Mr. Clinton was once quoted as sounding a mite wary of New York: several months before the convention he told a reporter that it was "a risk" to hold the Democratic convention in New York, that it could make the Democrats appear to be supporting "status-quo programs and interests that don't work." Mr. Clinton later said his remarks were misconstrued.
But never mind. With a Democrat in the White House, Democrats from New York see a glass that is more than half full.
"We've just had two Republican Administrations that had an antipathy to New York, that held New York up as an example of failure," said New York's Lieutenant Governor, Stan Lundine. "But now it's all going to change. It's not only a matter of the residence of the top officials in the new Administration. It's a matter of perspective."

HEADLINE: What We Pay For

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Your Dec. 2 and 3 editorials on "managed competition" state that patients "give little attention to doctor's fees or employer-paid insurance premiums because they pay only a small part of these bills." We disagree. Patients have a growing sensitivity to their bills, deductibles, co-payments and premiums as the cost of medical care grows at a rate four times faster than the national economy and patients are forced to pick up a bigger share of the burden. 
 What many people don't realize is that fees for physician services represent only 19 cents of each health care dollar nationally, compared with 23 cents for drugs and supplies and 38 cents for hospitals.
Yes, creating an integrated network of providers can achieve some cost savings, but real savings will come only when the emphasis is on keeping people well through preventive care and a continuing relationship with a physician. Clearly, the cost of staying well at home is a lot less than the cost of getting better in a hospital.

HEADLINE: Hawaii's Gentle Throwback

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD; ROBERT REINHOLD is chief of the Los Angeles bureau
of The Times.

 BODY:
SIXTEEN years ago, in one of those boondoggles for which Hawaii is infamous, then Gov. John Burns had an international airport built in Hilo. The idea was to attract jumbo jets full of mainland and Japanese tourists direct to this lush historic city that hugs a crescent-shaped bay at the foot of two mammoth volcanoes on the Big Island of Hawaii. But the airport's long corridors and runways are mostly quiet now. The expected armies of tourists never came, bypassing Hilo for the sunny dry Kona coast of the Big Island, with its glittery new condominiums, hotel developments, golf courses and high prices.
 The problem with Hilo is rain, roughly 130 inches, 280 days or so a year. One no more leaves home in Hilo without an umbrella than without shoes. Visitors and residents stroll through the quaint downtown of old wooden clapboard and stucco buildings under corrugated tin overhangs that cover the sidewalks. The warm tropical rains come and go during the day, on and off, then are heavy and steady during the night, the year round. The patter of drops outside becomes as familiar as chirping birds, something local people screen out as New Yorkers do honking taxicabs. "What Rain?" asks a button distributed by the Hawaii Island Chamber of Commerce. 
But this is a good rain. It makes Hilo a land of orchids, anthurium and plumeria, of magnificent gardens and parks. Moreover the rains have preserved Hilo from the tourism excesses and pretentious accommodations that repel many long-time visitors who long for Hawaii's simpler, quieter days. One can still park in downtown Hilo, the state's second largest city after Honolulu, for 5 cents an hour and get a haircut for $5 ($6 for "style"), and "talk story," or gossip, with the barber.
 Hilo seems stuck in time, a throwback to Hawaii's plantation days, when the islands were merely a quiet remote territory of the United States and when the economy was based more on growing sugar cane and pineapple than on catering to Japanese tourists in search of such typical Hawaiian handicrafts as Gucci luggage and Rolex watches. They were the days when Hilo served, as it still does to a large extent, as the port and commercial center for the island's agricultural industries.
 It is a place where Hawaii's diverse cultures, more Asian than European, all merge into one appealing mix. The influences are astonishingly diverse: Japanese, Polynesian, Filipino, Chinese, Puerto Rican, Portuguese, even Russian.
 Just walking through downtown Hilo brings this into sharp relief. The sounds of drums draw the visitor up a rickety set of outdoor stairs to a hula dance studio, where young people are practicing the art of hula. Nearby, the eerily beautiful sounds of a Tongan church service waft out into the street; inside Tongan men in colorful skirts worship. This may be America, but the names of the shops suggest there is something very different about Hilo: Hale Nani Beauty Salon, Koji's Bento, Shibata's, Sakaki Barber Shop.
 Hilo is the county seat of the Big Island, the largest and youngest of the Hawaiian islands, which at 4,034 square miles is about half the size of New Jersey and more than twice the combined area of the other islands. The city's population has grown to about 45,000, swelled somewhat in recent years by an influx of unreconstructed hippies, retirees and refugees from the rat race on the mainland for whom the subtle mix of soggy weather, lush growth, slow pace and comparatively low prices has a certain appeal.
 For the visitor, it offers not only ready contact with the real Hawaii but also a good jumping-off point for touring the Big Island's natural wonders, especially Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, where the powerful forces of an active volcano can be glimpsed close-up on foot, , by car or from a helicopter, and the rarefied upper reaches of the snow-capped 13,796-foot peak of Mauna Kea, where a half dozen countries maintain astronomical observatories.
 Nature has both blessed and cursed Hilo. The Big Island is home for the Hawaiian goddess of fire, Pele, who in the harmonious spiritual cosmology of Hawaiians is the source of both destruction and creativity, destroying what lies in the wake of her lava eruptions, but creating new land and energy at the same time. In 1990, new lava vents from the 4,077-foot Kilauea crater slowly incinerated the entire town of Kalapana, 30 miles south of Hilo. And the still-active 13,680-foot Mauna Loa, which sent a fiery tongue of lava right into Hilo in 1881, remains an uncertain threat. Hilo is also vulnerable to tsunamis, ocean waves generated by distant earthquakes; one such tsunami swamped and wrecked much of downtown in 1960. But science now provides timely warnings of such hazards, and the visitor faces no particular danger..
 Hilo is most famous for the Merrie Monarch Festival, an annual celebration of Hawaii's most notable native cultural asset, hula, which combines dance, music, wisdom and religion. Every April, hula teachers and their disciples from all over the Hawaiian islands converge on Hilo for a week of hula competitions, dancing, eating and partying. It is an immensely colorful event, the dancers in elaborate feathered costumes competing with each other in dazzling performances. There are arts and crafts exhibits, elaborate floral displays and a final parade -- all in honor of the "merrie monarch," David Kalakaua, the last King of Hawaii (1836-1891), who was a great promoter of the art of hula and all the partying the accompanies it.
 But Hilo is worth a visit even without the hula. Any visit should start with a walking tour of the historic downtown, whose center is the serene Kalakaua Park, a grassy square with a huge old banyan tree, statue of the king and a reflecting pool. On one side is the 1919 Federal building, a graceful open-air affair of loggias and porticoes that combines Neo-Classical and Spanish mission characteristics.
 Opposite is the old police station, now converted into the East Hawaii Cultural Center, which has constantly changing art exhibits and performances by local artists.
 An excellent self-guided walking tour of old Hilo has been prepared by the Hilo branch of the American Association of University Women. The two-mile tour takes you to such landmarks as the Haili Church, built in 1857 by New England missionaries, and the 1913 Taishoji Soto Mission, a Zen Buddhist temple. The tour is available at local shops and bookstores for $1.
 Just up the street from the Haili Church is the Lyman Mission House and adjoining museum, one of the best small-town museums to be found anywhere. The New England style house was the original home of the first Christian missionary to go to Hilo, the Rev. David Belden Lyman. It has been restored to its 1854 style, with antique china and handcrafted furniture and flooring of Hawaiian koa wood. The museum offers fascinating exhibits on the various ethnic groups who settled Hilo, as well as displays on vulcanology, minerals, plants and animals native to the island.
 If you are in Hilo on Wednesday or Saturday, don't miss the colorful farmer's market, a friendly affair where local farmers come out with an inviting variety of local produce, including papayas, macadamia nuts, arugula, bamboo shoots, ginger root, shitake mushrooms, fresh goat milk cheese, as well as flowers and snacks. The market, protected under awnings from the inevitable rains, fills two empty lots on either side of Mamo Street at Kamehameha Avenue.
 Not far away, on Hilo Bay, there is a seafood version of the farmer's market, the historic Suisan Fish Auction. The auction has taken place every day except Sunday since 1907.
 EACH morning the boats dock with their catch of yellowfin tuna, marlin, squid and other delicacies, which are lined up on pallets on the floor and weighed in a big open-air green shed under a huge monkeypod tree at the foot of Lihiwai Street. The auctioneer's bell rings at about 8 A.M. and the buyers for restaurants, sushi bars and wholesale canners make their bids to the auctioneer's guttural bark.
 In one of the cultural dissonances that is so typical of modern Hawaii, the auctioneer keeps accounts on an abacus while the buyers communicate with their offices by cellular phone.
 After the auction, visitors should stroll through the nearby Liliuokalani Park, a serene Japanese style garden named for Hawaii's last monarch, Queen Liliuokalani, who was illegally deposed 100 years ago this January by United States Marines. With its footbridges, Japanese stone lanterns and spreading banyan trees, the gardens are among Hilo's finest assets. Just across a footbridge from the garden is a little island, now known as Coconut Island, that is a kind of sacred ground, a place where early Hawaiians built a refuge, a heiau, a temple or place of worship.
If the rains bring anything good to Hilo, it is the gardens. There are two private gardens worth visiting for a fee.
 The Nani Mau Gardens just south of town has 20 acres of almost formal plantings of almost every conceivable native and imported tropical plant, including giant honeysuckle, wiliwili trees, scented star jasmines. One can spend hours walking through its meandering paths; umbrellas available for free. JUST north of Hilo on the Four Mile Scenic Route is the more rugged Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden, a 17-acre rain forest that doubles as a nature preserve on Onomea Bay. Visitors can explore winding nature trails, lush with rare exotics, gingers, heliconia, bromeliads, more than 1,800 species of plants, not to mention the dazzling parrots and other tropical birds and koi fish.
 No visit to Hilo is complete without a close-up look at volcanic activity, the powerful force that created the Hawaiian islands and continues daily to enlarge the Big Island. About 35 miles south of Hilo on Highway 11 is the 377-square-mile Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, which offers a fascinating education in vulcanology and drives around the steaming Kilauea crater and through forests scarred and burned by years of lava flows. A few years ago, before the town of Kalapana was destroyed by the lava, it was possible for visitors to view the fiery flows up close as they poured into the sea and turned the ocean into steam.
 But the lava has cut the roads now and those areas are inaccessible.
 The only way to see them is from the air, which costs about $135 a person by helicopter or $65 in fixed-wing planes. (Several companies operate out of Hilo airport.) These flights of 45 minutes or an hour usually take the visitor over the famed Rainbow Falls on the Wailuku River just above Hilo, over great stands of eucalyptus and ohia trees, sugar cane fields and macadamia nut farms before the land turns black and treeless with fresh lava.
 Soon there are large billows of smoke, and a dry heat fills the helicopter. The pilot steers over a large hole, about the size of small house, through which a river of red molten rock can be seen flowing under the surface at 10 miles an hour, 2,000 degrees.
 It is truly a window into hell, and one can imagine the spiritual impact the fire goddess Pele had on the Polynesians who first discovered this island 1,500 years ago.
LODGING, DINING AND VISITING Hotels
 The best hotels in Hilo are strung along Banyan Drive on Hilo Bay about a mile from downtown, and they are bargains by Hawaiian standards. Top-drawer are two recently renovated Japanese-owned properties, the Hawaii Naniloa and the Hilo Hawaiian. At both many of the rooms overlook the bay.
 Rates at the 325-room Naniloa start at $96 for a standard double. 93 Banyan Drive, Hilo, Hawaii 96720; (808) 969-3333 and (800) 367-5360 from the mainland, or (800) 442-5845 in Hawaii. The Hilo Hawaiian, 285 rooms, is comparable, starting at $99 for a double. 71 Banyan Drive; (808) 935-9361 and (800) 367-5004 from the mainland and Canada, or (800) 272-5275 within Hawaii.
 In between is an old standby, the Hilo Bay Hotel, rather musty and tacky now but cheaper at about $65. 87 Banyan Drive; (808) 935-0861, or (800) 367-5102. from mainland.
 Hilo also has many good bed and breakfast inns. One of the best is the Hale Kai, on a bluff facing the ocean about two miles from downtown, with just five rooms. Rates are from $75 to $98 a night per room, including full breakfast; three-day minimum, no credit cards. 111 Honolii Pali, Hilo, Hawaii 96720; (808) 935-6330). Other inns run from $45 a night or so. For a list, write the Hawaii Island Bed and Breakfast Association, Post Office Box 726, Volcano, Hawaii 96785.
Restaurants
 Hilo offers no haute cuisine but a wide array of restaurants that reflect the polyglot culture of the island, at very reasonable prices. One old local favorite is the Fuji Restaurant, serving Japanese cuisine, in the Hilo Hotel. Good fish dishesinclude ahi misohaki teishoku, a filet of tuna dipped in a miso sauce and broiled in foil, at $12.60, or a bento box lunch at $10.75.
 For something more lively, Lehua's Bay City Bar and Grill at the corner of Kamehameha and Waianuenue avenues, has a piano bar and serves a charbroiled chicken at $9.95; (808) 935-8055. A popular newcomer to the food scene is Cafe Pesto, nearby on Kamehameha Avenue near Mamo Street, serving a California-style menu of wood-fired pizzas with such toppings as wild mushrooms and artichokes at $9.95; (808) 969-6640).
 Visitors should not leave Hilo without trying some local favorites, like loco moco, a concoction of rice with a hamburger patty and brown gravy topped by an egg. For that, go to Don's Grill, which serves loco moco for $2.50, as well as the house specialty, roast chicken at $5.50. 485 Hinano Street; (808) 935-9099).
 For authentic Hawaiian food there is Kimo's Ono Hawaiian Food, a tiny take-out place at 806 Kilauea Avenue; (808) 935-3111. The lau lau plate, which consists of pork, lomi salmon, poi (taro root) and haupia, or coconut pudding, costs $5.75.

HEADLINE: Hometown Boy Takes Over Ft. Monmouth as Cutbacks Loom

BYLINE: By ARTHUR Z. KAMIN

DATELINE: FORT MONMOUTH

 BODY:
"YOU'RE talking about a one-in-a-million chance," Otto J. Guenther said. The slim, straight-as-a-ramrod 51-year-old was talking about the odds against an officer's being chosen to command his hometown Army base.
But Major General Guenther, born in Long Branch and raised in Red Bank, beat the odds when he was named commander of Fort Monmouth five months ago. And he has spent the time since then coping with threatened cutbacks in the size and scope of the fort's operations. 
 General Guenther presides over a sprawling 1,500-acre complex that is a city unto itself, complete with post exchange, bank, theater, bowling alley, gymnasium, library, day care center, newspapers, social service agencies, even a Burger King. It is the headquarters of the worldwide Communications and Electronics Command plus such institutions as the Army Chaplain Center and School, the United States Military Academy Preparatory School and Patterson Army Community Hospital.
The fort is occupied by 7,800 civilian workers, 2,300 military personnel and 3,800 Army family members, and it provides services for 35,000 military retirees in the region. The yearly payroll: $312 million for civilian employees, $51 million for the military.
A visitor senses considerable tension among the military and civilian workers these days, caused by the Government's decision to reduce the size of the nation's military establishment.
Just before Thanksgiving, General Guenther announced that the Communications and Electronics Command could lose 1,000 civilian jobs worldwide by next summer. Army officials say voluntary early retirement, normal attrition and a hiring freeze could cut that number to 650 -- with the direct impact on Fort Monmouth still unclear.
Then, three weeks ago, the Army reported that the 513th Military Intelligence Brigade, also based at the fort, might be moved to Fort Gordon in Georgia. That could mean a transfer of 558 military and 31 civilian employees by Sept. 30 of next year. A final decision is expected next month.
There have long been rumors that Fort Monmouth may be entirely shut down. But when General Guenther is asked about them, his face tightens and he enunciates his words with crystal-clear clarity. "They didn't bring me here for that," he said.
On the other hand, he said, "there is no question we are going to downsize." He added: "The Department of Defense will draw down approximately 25 percent in both military and civilian strength over the next five years. And Fort Monmouth will take its share of the personnel cuts."
If the base is to remain viable, he said, it will have to pass muster when it undergoes the base-closing review process required by Federal law every other year. "There is no such thing as a free lunch, no guarantees," he said, "but that's the way it is today."
Both of the area's United States Representatives, Frank Pallone Jr., a Democrat, and Richard A. Zimmer, a Republican, have declared their opposition to staff reductions at the fort. And in 1990 there was a revival of the Save the Fort Committee, which was organized in 1977 by Representative James J. Howard, a Democrat, when the future of the base was similarly in jeopardy.
Of General Guenther, Representative Pallone said: "We are fortunate to have him here at this critical time. He knows the area and the people."
General Guenther is also keeping a close watch on the Somalia situation. Three logistics people from the Communications and Electronics Command are there, and several others have been alerted. An emergency operations center at the fort is in contact with troops in Somalia on a 24-hour basis. The 513th Military Intelligence Brigade has sent 11 of its linguists there who are trained in the language of that country. Other brigade elements are on alert.
 
Boyhood in Red Bank
 The general grew up in a two-family house on Washington Street in Red Bank, and he says he drives by every so often to recall his early years there. He remembers helping his father make pickups and deliveries for the Little Falls Laundry and playing his saxophone in the Red Bank High School band.
Recently General Guenther spoke at a Student Council induction ceremony at what is now Red Bank Regional High School. "It meant a great deal to everyone," said Dr. Robert Nogueira, the principal. "The general hasn't forgotten his old high school and the positive impact it had on him."
Nor has he forgotten the stately United Methodist Church on tree-lined Broad Street that his family attended. Chester Apy of Little Silver, a Red Bank lawyer and a former State Assemblyman, recalled that, after young Otto Guenther's graduation from high school, the family did not have enough money to send him to college, and the church fathers eventually encouraged an anonymous member of the parish to set up a scholarship assistance committee to help him out.
The committee has become a fixture at the church and has provided about $300,000 in scholarship aid to needy students over the years.
General Guenther is now the president of the church's board of trustees. "He's very low-key," Mr. Apy said, "and passes the collection plate when asked, and takes on a variety of other church duties."
At Western Maryland College, where he majored in economics, he enrolled in the Reserve Officers Training Corps and entered the Army after his graduation in 1963. It wasn't long before he decided to make the military his career because, he said, he liked the responsibility and the opportunity to motivate and work "with people in all walks of life."
 
A Host of Assignments
 Over the next decades, he had a host of assignments -- most of them in administration and in the communications field, some of them overseas, including Vietnam. He attended some of the Army's most prestigious professional and command schools and received a Master of Science degree in procurement and contract management from the Florida Institute of Technology.
He was a colonel when he was assigned to Fort Monmouth in 1987 but became a brigadier general after serving as the program executive officer for communications systems, a position in which he supervised dozens of projects in such areas as satellite communications and airborne radar systems. He was little known outside the military, he said, until his promotion to commanding general of the fort and of the Communications and Electronics Command.
"That's when everybody started to make a fuss," he said.
The communications command is charged with anticipating the military communications needs of the future and developing equipment that will do the job, from the original concept to the finished product to the eventual distribution of that equipment in the field.
General Guenther describes the command's research mission in these terms: "We will continue to provide battlefield superiority to our soldiers, and that means giving them the technological tools to own the night, own the spectrum, apply software as a force multiplier and know the enemy."
 
Proceeding With Construction
 Despite the proposed downsizing of the military in general, and Fort Monmouth in particular, General Guenther is proceeding with a major construction program. "We are known as an 'Army Community of Excellence,' " General Guenther said, a reference to awards the base has won for its community services. "I want to do everything possible to continue that."
The construction plan calls for extensive renovation of housing, a new youth center and expanded day care services.
General Guenther and his wife, Jan, have two college-age daughters, and the general has a younger sister, Barbara, who lives in Red Bank and is a history teacher at Middletown North High School. It was Barbara Guenther who first introduced her sorority sister at Trenton State, Jan Peterson of Caldwell, to Otto Guenther.
One of his classmates at Red Bank High was John D'Amico Jr., the son of a beautician, who went on to graduate from Harvard College and the Harvard Law School and become a State Senator and, now, a Superior Court judge.
"I remember him well," said Judge D'Amico, a resident of Oceanport. "He was not only a nice guy, but we all knew he would be a high achiever."
What stands out in Judge D'Amico's mind, he said, is how he and General Guenther could move ahead so rapidly in a single generation. "But that's America, that's Red Bank and that's Red Bank High School," he said. "The melting pot at work."

HEADLINE: Will Darkened Theaters Imperil a State Tradition?

BYLINE: By ALVIN KLEIN

 BODY:
IT is a well-known theater story. After a performance of "Green Grow the Lilacs," by Lynn Riggs at the Westport Country Playhouse one summer night in 1939, Theresa Helburn, the producer, had a brainstorm: make it into a musical. Four years later, the musical retitled "Away We Go!" had its world premiere at the Shubert in New Haven where Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein 2d, in their first collaboration, had the title changed yet again, this time to "Oklahoma!"
Then there's the one about Moss Hart when he was a director suffering Broadway opening-night jitters. "It's just a New Haven hit. That's all. Just a New Haven hit," Mr. Hart said, panicking. The show was "My Fair Lady" and the year was 1956. 
 The tales are legendary, their numbers are legion and they all involve Connecticut as a center for the birth of musicals. Not just at the Shubert, though that theater holds the state's most dazzling archive of historic pre-Broadway tryouts, including "Brigadoon," "Carousel" and "Fiorello." Add the Goodspeed Opera House in East Haddam where "Annie," "Man of La Mancha" and "Shenandoah" had their beginnings. And "Ballroom," Michael Bennett's musical after "A Chorus Line," tried out at the American Shakespeare Theater in Stratford.
Even though the number of new American musicals being produced in Connecticut has dwindled drastically, the state's theaters have consistently offered professional musical productions. Adjusting to the times, the state's reputation as a showcase, and still to some extent a birthplace, for musicals has been maintained. Now, for example, the Shubert books an occasional national touring company of an established musical like the current "Guys and Dolls." So does the Bushnell in Hartford.
But the closing or dormancy of several theaters devoted to musicals appears to signify the eroding state of musical theater in Connecticut. Whether new or existing theaters can can take up the slack is uncertain.
Consider the abrupt shutting down last fall of Connecticut's Broadway Theater, formerly the Darien Dinner Theater. Consider also the precarious circumstance -- perhaps homeless, perhaps not -- of Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield, a continuing void in place of an operating theater in Stratford, the "for sale" sign on Sharon Playhouse (dark for four years), this season's "for rent" status of Stage II at Long Wharf Theater in New Haven (now available for private ceremonies and receptions). And a dispute with Actors Equity made the Coachlight Dinner Theater in East Windsor a non-union theater in 1989.
 
A Musical Identity
 Wholly or in part, all these theaters had a musical identity. Even in a curtailed summer season the Stratford theater, where touring productions of "Li'l Abner" and "A Chorus Line" once passed through, presented the American Conservatory Theater of San Francisco's production of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum" in 1989. Renamed the American Festival Theater 10 years ago, after bankruptcy was declared, the theater has since been owned by the state. According to a spokeswoman for the state's Department of Economic Development, proposals for a new life for the Stratford theater -- three proposals have been rejected so far this year -- will be sought in February. First-rate professional stagings of "A Chorus Line" and "One Mo' Time" were seen in Sharon in the mid-1980's. And "I'll Be Seeing You," a review of songs by Sammy Fain, was moved onto the Main Stage at Long Wharf last summer when Stage II's theater activity was curtailed for economic reasons.
 
Abrupt Halt in Darien
 Professional musical theater in Darien was halted abruptly on the morning of Nov. 1 before a matinee performance of "42d Street" -- and a month before the scheduled opening of "Camelot," which was in rehearsal. The theater's producing director, Jane Bergere, cited a list of reasons for the 16-year-old theater's financial straits, including a lack of support by the audience and the landlords (a mortgage interest payment on the building was overdue) and said: "It's of great concern that a theater devoted to a form indigenous to our heritage should disintegrate and disappear. Musicals need to be perpetuated. Maybe the town wasn't welcoming enough. Maybe some people don't know or care what makes a production professional. We employed 110 to 150 people per show, including children who were learning discipline, concentration and an alternative to Nintendo and television."
The 27-year-old Candlewood Playhouse in New Fairfield, with a history of financial and administrative problems, closed on Oct. 30 because of health code violations. Four performances of "Ain't Broadway Grand," a new musical in a pre-Broadway tryout, remained to be seen. "We're closed but not out of business," said Candlewood's executive producer, Rick Belzer, who has run the theater for nine years. A 1993 season, to consist of seven musicals, has been announced to begin in April.
 
Where to Do Big Musicals
 Howard Marron, the composer of "Fauntleroy," a new musical that had a tryout run at Candlewood in September, said, "There are so few places one can do a big new musical. Goodspeed is one; Candlewood could be another if it got itself together." Most regional theaters can only do small shows.
Burry Fredrik -- the artistic director of the Fairfield County Stage Company at the Westport Country Playhouse (which produced last season's revival of "Flora, the Red Menace," and the recently closed "No Frills Revue") and who was in charge of the Candlewood Playhouse in the late 1970's -- said: "We wanted the playhouse ultimately to be a complete home for musicals, re-creations and tryouts, which Candlewood became under Rick Belzer. You have to venerate the American musical which the most enormous contribution we've made to live theater.
"We're all in the same boat from an economic point of view, but I don't know whether that's the reason. We're just barely holding our heads up -- and whether we do musicals next year will depend on whether we're alive."
 
'Walking Across Your Grave'
 Added Susan Hallinan, the director of press relations for Downtown Cabaret Theater in Bridgeport (where a production of "Sophisticated Ladies" is now playing), "You just feel someone's walking across your grave."
What then enables Goodspeed to maintain a secure niche on the musical theater map? The theater, which is to begin its 30th year and an extended season with a new production of "On the Town" in April, while the adjunct house, Norma Terris-Goodspeed at Chester, where musicals in progress are produced, will start its eighth. "I don't know," said Goodspeed's producing director, Michael Price. "But our audiences are comfortable with Goodspeed. They keep coming and Chester's audiences are younger and more risk taking. The outlook is good."
Other promising signs of the perpetuation of musical theater in Connecticut are the upcoming engagement of a touring edition of "Falsettos," which is still running on Broadway. It is to open next month at the Truglia Theater of the new Rich Forum in Stamford where it will be the only musical in a season of four shows. "Forbidden Broadway," in a 1993 updating, is now having an open-ended run in the Leonhardt Studio of the Rich Forum. And the Hartford Stage Company, where "Falsettos" was first seen last year, on Saturday will offer the world premiere of "Martin Guerre," a dramatic musical.
Will such a smattering of musical theater replace its imperiled consistency? Ms. Bergere isn't sure. "All these years, I've been urging people to see musicals in their own back yard. 'Come to Darien, that's where theater is,' I'd say."
"Now what do I say?" she asked.

HEADLINE: Calendars That Offer More Than Dates

BYLINE: By JOYCE JONES

DATELINE: MENDHAM

 BODY:
THE time has come to close the books on another year, an occasion to glance over the calendar of the 12 months past and start anew.
For many, the backward look is to be avoided. As Oscar Wilde put it, "Most modern calendars mar the sweet simplicity of our lives by reminding us that each day that passes is the anniversary of some perfectly uninteresting event." 
 The year ahead may be better. One step in that direction, in the view of Faith Popcorn, chairwoman of BrainReserve, a New York marketing consultant, is to use the calendar as a way to achieve goals, not simply to keep track of appointments.
"We live by our calendar," Ms. Popcorn said. She and her staff set down "personal and professional goals" that are to be accomplished on a day-to-day basis, she said. The calendar then serves as a measure of accomplishment.
For Judith Roth, 47, a designer, calendars are both a personal necessity and a livelihood. A place of honor in her home office in Mendham is given to a 2-by-4-foot planning calendar that spans two months, with notations in every box. The rest of the room -- the built-in work areas, drawing board and desk -- is largely devoted to creating tailor-made calendars for a variety of clients.
Ms. Roth's business is based on the premise that many of the generic calendars that corporations give out are not representative of the caliber of the companies sending them.
 
Traveling Through 20's
 Texaco, for example, has traditionally sent calendars to its thousands of service centers around the country. Ms. Roth talked the company into a 1992 calendar called "Texaco Collectable, First Edition, Circa 1920," which urged its recipients to "take a nostalgic journey guided by reproductions of authentic advertising art."
The theme was a trip through the 20's with Texaco print advertisements: jazz, flappers, roadsters. To give the effect that the calendar had been lying around someone's attic, she had the paper antiqued on the printing press. "It gave just a hint of yellowing," she said.
The calendar, Ms. Roth said, reflected the growing taste for nostalgia in the popular culture. "Everything old is new again," she said.
For the 1993 Texaco calendar, only the edges of the paper have been aged. The period covered is the 30's, when, as dutifully reproduced in the calendar, the Texaco "red" was more orange, and big bands and Packards were all the rage.
Along with the print ads, the calendar lists some events of the 30's, including the first broadcast of the words "A fiery horse with the speed of lightning, a cloud of dust and a hearty 'High-yo Silver' -- the Lone Ranger rides again!" (Jan. 18, 1930) and Joe Louis's knockout of Max Schmeling in one round (June 22, 1938).
On Ms. Roth's desk is the prototype for Texaco's 1994 calendar, a tribute to the 40's: jukeboxes, bobby socks and jalopies. "I can't wait to do the 50's," she said, "with Dalmatians, rock-and-roll and convertibles."
In the works for 1994 is a calendar for the National Aviation Museum in Ottawa. "For years we wanted to put out a calendar where the illustrations would tell people about the treasured aircraft we have in our museum, like the German World War I fighter plane, the AEGG IV, the only one of its kind in existence," said Wendy McPeake, a product director at the museum.
Ms. Roth showed the museum how to do it.
 
Effect of the Election
 The calendar business in general has experienced an uncertain 1992, said Gary Haley, an executive vice president of a calendar manufacturer in Sleepy Eye, Minn., and president of the Calendar Advertising Council.
"An event like Desert Storm caused companies to take their eye off the business ball and deter planning their promotional needs," he said. "However, the election, a grand-scale political happening, augured public confidence and an upsurge in calendar distribution."
In bad economic times, companies unsure about their futures are slow to commit themselves to an advertising medium that relies on a yearlong exposure. Mr. Haley said, "The calendar assures people that a company plans to be in business in 1993."
Surveys by the council, he said, indicate that 21 percent of the recipients of calendars said the gifts had positively influenced their attitude toward the donors.
Among Ms. Roth's clients is Amari (U.S.A.) Inc., a metal distribution company, whose 1993 calendar is printed on silver film with the months and days emblazoned in fiery red and stark white. Another of her 1993 creations is a Jewish calendar with reproductions of a limited edition of silk-screen prints by Mordechai Rosenstein, an artist who commissioned the calendar.
 
A Year Starting in March
 For Mel Tillis, a country singer, Ms. Roth has created a calendar that runs from March to March, coinciding with his production dates at his theater in Branson, Mo., and is illustrated with photos of the entertainer.
The first calendar Ms. Roth designed for the Peapack-Gladstone Bank was inspired by a scene from the bank's logo: a rider in fox-hunting apparel on a horse about to hurdle a fence. Traveling to England, Ms. Roth gained permission from the Sir Alfred Munnings Art Museum in Essex to reproduce examples of equine art by Sir Alfred.
Frank Kissel, the president of the Peapack-Gladstone Bank, in Gladstone, was pleased to discover that several of the 1992 pictures from the calendar, framed, now hang on the walls of his clients' offices. "Because our branches are mainly located in the heart of beautiful horse country, the theme of the calendar is part of our marketing approach," he said.
For the 1993 bank calendar, Ms. Roth followed up the equine theme with works from the Bridgeman Art Gallery in London illustrating horse racing.
 
Research for an Image
 Before she approaches a prospective client, Ms. Roth said, she researches the company's operation and assesses how a calendar could work to foster an image.
"Every time people look at this calendar, the quality of the paper, the text, the lettering and the colors, a subtle feeling should come across about the company and its product," she said.
Her homework paid off with Amari. "What made the idea of having a calendar so feasible was that we received a prototype of what was being proposed," said Barry Gledhill, the company's president and chief executive officer. "That's something like instant gratification."
Ms. Roth, who grew up in Maplewood and attended the Cleveland Institute of Art and Case Western Reserve University, is a graduate of the Parsons School of Design. She and her husband, Michael, who works in real estate, have two children, Elizabeth and Shawn, who are both in college.
It takes Ms. Roth about a year to put together the Texaco calendars; others that require less research take about six months, she said. Her time is spent gathering art from museums and private collections and then supervising the printing in such far-flung sites as Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand and Korea.
 
Red Isn't Always Red
 "I stay at the plant while my work is being printed," she said. "Red to one person is not red enough for someone else."
Having successfully replicated the colors of paintings for the calendar collections, she approached the Art Museum at Princeton University, to produce a portfolio of eight paintings of 19th- and 20th-century landscapes that hang in the museum. "This is the first time we have had our own portfolio," said Jill Guthrie, the museum's managing editor. Ms. Roth is working on an address book for the museum that will feature 40 of the gallery's works of art.
For the Buffalo Bill Historical Center in Utah, art from its Whitney Gallery of Western Art has been duplicated.
Ms. Roth also tracked down Jimmy Velvet, an owner of several Elvis Presley museums, and he commissioned her, on behalf of the late singer's estate and the Elvis Presley Museum Inc., to create a portfolio of eight color photographs taken at the height of Presley's career.
Over the years, Ms. Roth said, she has had her share of rejections, and she studies them to better understand what went wrong. Then there are times, she said, laughing, when a turn-down reminds her of a Chinese axiom, "You can't explain the ocean to a frog."

HEADLINE: The View From: Hartford;
Symphony's Musicians and Managers Back in Tune

BYLINE: By VALERIE CRUICE

 BODY:
IN late October, after a 18-month-long dispute between the musicians union and the management of the Hartford Symphony, agreement was reached on a new three-year contract. A month later, the musicians took their places on stage at the Bushnell auditorium and when the conductor, Michael Lankester, came on stage the orchestra received a standing ovation.
"There was a sense of warmth, and maybe relief," said the chairman of the Symphony's board, Peter Burgess, who described the previous year as "horrific." 
 William Steinberg, the president of the musicians union, said, "We're very hopeful that things are going to smooth out." The contract has not yet been formalized but both the union and management expect it will be signed early next year.
Due to an aggressive subscription renewal campaign, the hall was three-quarters full for the new season's first two concerts, on Nov. 30 and Dec. 1. According to the Symphony's manager, Paul Reuter, the orchestra earned 63 percent of its income from tickets and concert fees last year, compared with a national average of 43 percent for an organization of similar size. "We had 11,000 adult subscribers to three different concert series, Mr. Reuter said. "My job is to regain as many of those as possible."
Throughout the labor dispute, management stayed in touch with its subscribers and the community by sending its conductors to coach in 36 high schools and to talk to community groups. The musicians, meanwhile, continued their usual freelance work and collected unemployment.
 
Dispute Cost Grants
 Recovering its subscription base and ticket sales is only one of the Symphony's worries. To stay in business and serve the region, the Hartford Symphony must raise $3 million over the next three years. The orchestra has already lost $70,000 in grants from the state and from National Endowment for the Arts because there was no contract when the financing decisions were made.
And because of the dispute with the American Federation of Musicians Local 400, some of the Symphony's concert dates at the Bushnell had been sold to other performing groups. The orchestra is now looking for other opportunities to perform, to help regain some of the losses.
To raise the $3 million, a "Save Your Symphony" campaign is under way. "It's an umbrella term we're using for this three-year period," Mr. Reuter said. "We are making the point that this is a multi-year effort. We're asking everybody to increase their giving."
Corporations are being contacted to sponsor individual concerts as well. Already the Symphony has received grants from several local organizations, including a three-year commitment from the Hartford Foundation for Public Giving, totaling $450,000.
The Hartford Symphony has resumed its symphony, family concerts, pops and classical conversations series, and Mr. Reuter is optimistic about the future. "We're very excited about the programming this year," he said, "but we are looking forward to next year, our 50th anniversary."
Founded in 1934, the orchestra temporarily disbanded during World War II and resumed operations in 1948. With the arrival of Fritz Mahler as music director in 1953, the Symphony expanded its concerts for children. In 1964, Arthur Winograd, a founding member of the Juilliard String Quartet, became music director and under him the Symphony performed at Carnegie Hall to favorable reviews. Almost 20 years later, Mr. Lankester succeeded Mr. Winograd and the core orchestra was formed. Today, Mr. Lankester and the Symphony have a $3 million budget and reach an audience of more than 200,000 a year. The 18-month dispute, which caused the cancellation of last year's music dates, revolved around a group of 21 musicians, called the "core players," who provide a full-time commitment to the orchestra, which in turn is permitted to sell the core musicians' services to other groups.
 
Symphony, Opera and Ballet
 Their responsibilities were not only to the Hartford Symphony, but to the Connecticut Opera and Hartford Ballet companies as well, with the three entities contributing toward salaries and benefits. However, the Opera negotiated a separate agreement, and the Ballet, for financial reasons, has been forced to use taped music for all its performances, leaving the Symphony as the organization the core players look to for their primary employment.
The musicians had been locked out, according to Mr. Steinberg, when the Symphony management said it could not meet the terms of the previous contract, which expired in June 1991. "Our position was that we would continue to perform under the terms and conditions of that expired contract," he said. "They locked us out when they refused to allow us to perform. They claimed that they didn't have the money to do that. That's debatable."
The new agreement reduces the number of services -- rehearsal and concert commitments of the core players -- resulting in their gaining an average salary increase of 2 percent. All other musicians will receive a 7 1/2 percent wage increase this year. After that, there will be a minimum 3 1/2 percent cost of living adjustment each year.
 
More Musician Representation
 An unconventional provision of the agreement was the offering of 10 directors' seats to musician representatives; in the past there was only one. The executive committee, a group of 12 to 15 members, will be one-third musician representatives.
"It's up to everybody to make it work," said Michael Pollard, a spokesmen for the musicians and a violinist with the Symphony since 1975. "It's up to the board, management and musicians -- and a responsibility on the part of the community to support this institution."
An example of the musicians' increased involvement was the Symphony's recent phone-a-thon, usually staffed by volunteers. Instead, 10 musicians did the dialing. "There's an understanding of their role as a key to the organization's succeeding," Mr. Reuter said. "Building trust and relationships are fine, but at some point it comes down to money. If we can pay our musicians and find enough work for them, they'll be happy. These are professional people, highly talented and struggling to make a living. It is a struggle to be a musician in society today. Our job is to work together with them. And we won't stop until we get the job done."

HEADLINE: The Executive Life;
I.R.S. Agents Stalk the Hollywood Hills

BYLINE: By Neal Koch; Neal Koch, a journalist based in Los Angeles, often writes about the entertainment industry.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
HOLLYWOOD'S biggest blockbuster this holiday season could be called "Nightmare on Vine Street." But it won't be showing at a theater near you. Rather, it's unfolding behind accountants' doors all around Tinseltown, a production of the Internal Revenue Service, which has launched a massive crackdown on producers, directors, writers, actors, craftsmen, technicians and production companies.
"The entertainment industry is on the hit list," Pamela K. Christensen, an I.R.S. chief field examiner, recently told a crowded gathering of industry attorneys and accountants. 
 About 200 audit notices went out on Dec. 7 alone, she revealed in a subsequent interview, with about 300 more to come each month starting in January. In all, 25 I.R.S. auditors have been assigned here full time to scrutinize the 27,000 individual and 5,500 corporate entertainment industry returns filed in Los Angeles each year, the agency says.
"The audits are dropping like bombs," said Sheri Jeffrey, an entertainment tax attorney recently returned from briefing I.R.S. agents in Washington on Hollywood accounting methods. "There is not one segment of the industry that is escaping review." Ms. Jeffrey was representing the Los Angeles Bar Association in hopes of shaping I.R.S. guidelines for examining the industry.
Fear of the revenuers has been spreading through Hollywood since September, when The Hollywood Reporter, a daily trade paper, first disclosed that the I.R.S. was focusing on "creative talent." Reports followed of I.R.S. agents enrolled in entertainment industry business courses at U.C.L.A. and of the I.R.S.'s purchase of a widely used Hollywood professional directory.
Those being audited are ducking publicity. "They're terrified," said Robert Marich, The Hollywood Reporter's business editor. "They're afraid of retaliation."
"Creative figures who have been audited once before are being reaudited," explained Mr. Marich, who broke the story. "Things that had passed muster with the I.R.S. a few years ago are suddenly being challenged."
The news even has some normally level-headed executives and lawyers wondering whether this campaign should be seen as a parting shot at Murphy Brown's home town by a White House Administration that was canceled before she was.
"There's a lot of feeling in Hollywood that this was instigated by the Bush Administration not only as a method of raising taxes, but as a method of punishing Hollywood because it has been a great liberal supporter and was a great supporter of Clinton," said Burton Merrill, an entertainment tax lawyer whose clients include two directors under audit.
But the I.R.S. denies any political motivation, saying that its focus on Hollywood is part of a plan begun seven years ago to set up specialized groups of agents in Los Angeles with expertise in various targeted industries. (Such groups have now been formed in a number of cities around the country.)
So far the groups here have focused on auto dealers, apparel manufacturers, health care providers and real estate agencies, developers and builders, among others. Their audits have assessed additional taxes at a rate four times higher than nonspecialized corporate audits, according to I.R.S. figures. Preparations to take on Hollywood began about two years ago, Ms. Christensen said.
Even some lawyers who represent entertainers argue that the I.R.S.'s new-found interest in the movies is more a matter of economics than politics. With the pressure on to lower the Government's deficit, the entertainment industry -- with its highly publicized star salaries and intricate overseas deals -- is a natural target. In the land of make-believe, "there certainly has been a lot of camouflaging of profits over the years," acknowledges Michael R. Morris, a former I.R.S. attorney who now advises entertainers.
Indeed, the I.R.S.'s Ms. Christensen drew knowing laughter from a normally somber bar association audience earlier this month when she reported that, "In all the industries that I've been exposed to in 18 years with the Internal Revenue Service, there are issues and business practices endemic to the entertainment industry that I've never seen or heard about in any other industry." By way of example, she cited the not-uncommon practice of writing contracts on the back of cocktail napkins at bars.
So her agents are looking at issues as simple as the deductibility of travel and entertainment expenses and as complex as tax treaty provisions. One major issue is the deduction as a business write-off of what would anywhere else be considered strictly personal expenses, like costs for grooming, makeup, clothing and health club memberships. "My personal favorite," said Ms. Christensen, allowing herself a slight smile, "is massage."
Another red flag is the use of offshore tax havens to incorporate, particularly for the personal service companies that many Hollywood stars and directors form to "loan" themselves out for work on movies and television shows in arrangements that create additional write-offs and pension benefits. The I.R.S. is also closely examining Hollywood's widespread practice of designating creative talent and technical workers as independent contractors, rather than employees, another arrangement that produces bigger write-offs while saving production companies paperwork and tax expenses.
Despite all the added business these audits may produce for Hollywood lawyers, the legal forecast is grim: The I.R.S. has also targeted attorneys here.
"As your clients will be audited in the coming months," Ms. Jeffrey cautioned her colleagues at the bar association meeting, "you will have your own personal problems to worry about."

I.R.S. Agents Stalk the Hollywood Hills

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
HOLLYWOOD'S biggest blockbuster this holiday season could be called "Nightmare on Vine Street." But it won't be showing at a theater near you. Rather, it's unfolding behind accountants' doors all around Tinseltown, a production of the Internal Revenue Service, which has launched a massive crackdown on producers, directors, writers, actors, craftsmen, technicians and production companies.
"The entertainment industry is on the hit list," Pamela K. Christensen, an I.R.S. chief field examiner, recently told a crowded gathering of industry attorneys and accountants. 
 About 200 audit notices went out on Dec. 7 alone, she revealed in a subsequent interview, with about 300 more to come each month starting in January. In all, 25 I.R.S. auditors have been assigned here full time to scrutinize the 27,000 individual and 5,500 corporate entertainment industry returns filed in Los Angeles each year, the agency says.
"The audits are dropping like bombs," said Sheri Jeffrey, an entertainment tax attorney recently returned from briefing I.R.S. agents in Washington on Hollywood accounting methods. "There is not one segment of the industry that is escaping review." Ms. Jeffrey was representing the Los Angeles Bar Association in hopes of shaping I.R.S. guidelines for examining the industry.
Fear of the revenuers has been spreading through Hollywood since September, when The Hollywood Reporter, a daily trade paper, first disclosed that the I.R.S. was focusing on "creative talent." Reports followed of I.R.S. agents enrolled in entertainment industry business courses at U.C.L.A. and of the I.R.S.'s purchase of a widely used Hollywood professional directory.
Those being audited are ducking publicity. "They're terrified," said Robert Marich, The Hollywood Reporter's business editor. "They're afraid of retaliation."
"Creative figures who have been audited once before are being reaudited," explained Mr. Marich, who broke the story. "Things that had passed muster with the I.R.S. a few years ago are suddenly being challenged."
The news even has some normally level-headed executives and lawyers wondering whether this campaign should be seen as a parting shot at Murphy Brown's home town by a White House Administration that was canceled before she was.
"There's a lot of feeling in Hollywood that this was instigated by the Bush Administration not only as a method of raising taxes, but as a method of punishing Hollywood because it has been a great liberal supporter and was a great supporter of Clinton," said Burton Merrill, an entertainment tax lawyer whose clients include two directors under audit.

HEADLINE: A Crowded Writer on the Lonely Prairie

BYLINE: By Kathleen Norris; Kathleen Norris, a poet, lives in Lemmon, S.D.

 BODY:
HOW do we tell the truth in a small town? Is it possible to write it? Certainly, great literature might come out of the lives of ordinary people on the farms and ranches and little towns of the Great Plains, but are the people who farm, the people working in those towns, writing it? The truth, the whole truth, tends to be complex, its contentments and joys wrestled out of doubt, pain, change. How to tell the truth in a small town, where, if a discouraging word is heard, it is not for public consumption?
Like many who have written about the Dakotas, I'm invigorated by the harsh beauty of the land and feel a need to tell the stories that come from its soil. Writing is a solitary act, and, ideally, the Dakotas might seem to provide a writer with ample solitude and quiet. But the frantic social activity in small towns conspires to silence a person. There are far fewer people than jobs to fill. Someone must be found to lead the church choir or youth group, to bowl with the league, to coach a softball team or Little League, to run a Chamber of Commerce or club committee. Many jobs are vital: the volunteer fire department and ambulance service, the domestic violence hot line, the food bank. But all too often a kind of Tom Sawyerism takes over, and makes of adult life a perpetual club. Imagine spending the rest of your life at summer camp. 
 Women writers especially are in danger of being overwhelmed. As a rural North Dakota woman said to me at a writing workshop, "The world will continue to give more and more responsibility to any woman who will accept it." She had told friends she was at a meeting because she thought joining a writing workshop sounded frivolous. In Lemmon, the small town where I live, it's possible for a woman to belong to one or more church groups, a Homemakers Extension club, the American Legion and hospital auxiliary, one or two women's clubs, a bridge club, a sewing club, a country club and several service club auxiliaries, such as the Jayceettes, all with their crafts projects, creeds, codes and books of minutes, every one of them reading "a delicious lunch was served."
AS one North Dakota writer says, "Here and there a woman has to step on a few toes and put her writing above other things." But in drawing back from the social whirl she sets herself apart from those around her, and in a small town this is hard to do. Someone who wants to write must either break away or settle for producing only what is acceptable at a mother-daughter church banquet or a Girl Scout program.
Many writers depicting rural and small-town America -- figures as diverse as Willa Cather, Sinclair Lewis and Louise Erdrich -- have found it necessary to write about that world from a distance. That distance may be mostly geographical, but it can also be the distance a profession provides: teaching in a college, for example. In either case, the writer is insulated from the day-to-day realities of small-town or rural life. But a writer who is thoroughly immersed in the rural milieu of the Dakotas, where nearly everyone is related, faces a particularly difficult form of self-censorship. "I'd like to write about my relatives," one North Dakota ranch woman told me, "but I'm no good at disguising things."
One popular form of writing on the plains is the local history. These books reveal a great deal about the people who write them, but do not often tell the true story of the region. In North Dakota, most homesteaders failed to remain on their land after "proving up" a claim, and the 1920's and 30's brought farm bankruptcies and political upheaval -- but you would never know it to read the local histories, centered on those who "made it." They present tales of perseverance made heroic in the context of a steady march of "progress" from homesteading days to the present. As one old-timer told me, "People have been writing it the way they wished it had been instead of the way it was."
The local-history mentality takes care not to offend the descendants of pioneer families who had grit enough to remain. Instead, it must, as the anthropologist Seena Kohl says in an essay in Plainswoman magazine, present the past "as a harmonious whole" that despite its hardships was preferable to the present. When this view of life comes off the page to dictate present reality, the consequences can be serious indeed. A fourth-generation Dakotan, a high school student, wrote recently in a school theme that his family had "always" been here, and would "always" remain. "Always" in this context is less than 75 years, and with a fragile economy and a falling population, chances are this young man will have to seek his livelihood elsewhere. Having been raised for a world that does not exist, he may find himself sitting in an apartment in Minneapolis, Denver or Spokane, looking back on the Dakota prairie as a lost Eden. Maybe by the fifth generation the family will produce a writer who can excavate the story.
A more immediate consequence of the local-history mentality is the tendency to "make nice." If we can render the past harmonious, why not the present? Why risk discussion that might cause unpleasantness? When our church needed a new pastor, I was on the search committee. At one of our meetings, a woman said, "We don't want anyone too old." A pastor from a neighboring town who was guiding us through the bureaucratic thickets, a woman who had been ordained the week of her 65th birthday, said, amicably but firmly, "I know most churches feel that way, but maybe you should think about that." Another woman jumped in and said, "Oh, we didn't mean anything. It was all in fun."
The bluntness of the first woman was at least useful: had she been more urbane, she would have disguised her prejudice. But the lie put forth by the other woman was intended to silence us. Thanks to the minister's persistence, we did manage a brief look at the question of what age we wanted our next pastor to be, but it was hard on us. Among other things, it forced us to consider the fact that our congregation is aging; people wanted to drop the subject as quickly as possible.
And what of truth? We don't tend to see it as something that could set us free, because that means embracing pain, acknowledging our differences and conflicts, taking our real situation into account. Instead, in the insular small-town and rural environment, truth itself can become an outside authority, like the economic and political forces we profess independence from, or the state and Federal laws we so casually break when they don't fit our needs. I am indebted to the Rev. G. Keith Gunderson for this insight. He was vilified not long ago by many in his town for protesting the local custom of allowing high school graduates to drink in the bars, no matter what their age. The moral issue for him was not drinking but respect for the law. Although the local reaction was mixed, many felt that one of their own -- he was raised just 30 miles away -- had betrayed them. He should have known that this is simply how we do things.
It is a truism that outsiders, often professionals with no family ties, are never fully accepted into rural or small-town life. These communities are impenetrable for many reasons, not the least of which is the fact that the most important stories are never spoken of; the local-history mentality has worn down their rough edges or placed them safely out of sight, out of mind.
To learn the truth about the web of close-knit families that make up an isolated small town on the plains, one must look back some years, to the men and women of the homesteading and early merchant generation. By now they've mostly been mythologized into the stern, hard-working papa and the overworked mother-who-never-complained, all their passions and complexities smoothed over. But many of these people, the women especially, had an intense love/hate relationship with the plains that lives on in their children. Some mourned the loss of European culture or ethnic roots, others the social status they'd enjoyed in cities "back east." Only the toughest survived.
As these men and women's ambivalence (or rage) toward the plains found expression in their relationships with their children, they often doted on sons and daughters who moved away, while treating shabbily those who remained. In the next generation, the grandchildren growing up here developed, in self-defense, an outlook in which everything from the outside world is suspect, while everything local, especially that which derives from the immediate family, is good. These are families that have an exceptionally difficult time dealing with conflict and change. To them, change means failure; it is a contaminant introduced by outside elements. Such families have brought the local-history mentality to life, and in sufficient numbers they dictate the ethos of their small towns. That ethos is as precarious as it is deliberately, even obsessively, harmonious.
And what if such a family produced a writer? How would it be possible to set down the story of their forebears, dig it out from the depths in which it is entombed? If truth has become an outside authority to be resisted in order to keep the family myths intact, then the writer seeking truth would have to become an outsider too. This, in fact, is what often happens. One writer I know, a second-generation North Dakotan who farms with her husband, was stunned to find, when she began a column in the local weekly newspaper, that she suddenly felt insecure on her home turf. She was surprised that so many of her friends reacted with a sullen silence, as if her column did not exist. "Something drives me to do this," she told me. "I'm possessed to do this. Maybe nothing drives them. Maybe it's a sin to be possessed in North Dakota."
ROBERT KROETSCH, a writer from the Canadian plains, suggests that prairie writers can learn to see in "the particulars of place," old photographs, diaries and the like, "archeological deposits" of great value. But in my area, more than one family has abandoned such evidence of their past; they've walked away from farmhouses and moved to town, leaving behind not only the oak furniture but old china and handmade quilts, even family photographs. The truth was so painful it had to be abandoned.
I wonder if the complex and often fragmented narrative style that Mr. Kroetsch believes the prairie writer must adopt in trusting to "a version of archeology" isn't squarely at odds with the local-history mentality, which prefers a linear narrative, the progress model. I know from my experience working in a small-town library that writers like Larry Woiwode and Louise Erdrich are read warily by rural people on the plains, if they are read at all. "Well, it's different," one woman said of "Love Medicine," somewhat startled that the novel wasn't set in New York, Paris or Hollywood, like a "real" best seller. "I didn't want anything like this," another woman said, returning Mr. Woiwode's "Beyond the Bedroom Wall"; "I just wanted a good story."
A "good story" is one that isn't demanding, that proceeds from A to B, and above all doesn't remind us of the bad times, the cardboard patches we used to wear in our shoes, the failed farms, the way people you love just up and die. It tells us instead that hard work and perseverance can overcome all obstacles; it tells lie after lie, and the ending is the happiest lie of all.
This is the reason why books like Mr. Woiwode's -- or Richard Critchfield's "Those Days" or Lois Phillips Hudson's novel of the farm crisis of the 1920's, "The Bones of Plenty," as relevant today as it ever was -- tend to be buried by plains people, cast down into the silence. Who wants to read Mrs. Hudson's depiction of a farm wife's anguish over being torn from her roots, her home, her beloved piano: "If I go over and touch it now . . . just touch the middle C above the golden lock again, I would be turned into a pillar of salt; I would never have to walk out of here and get in the front seat of the car beside my husband, where the world says I belong."
Those years were hard enough to live through; there's no desire to read about them among people who raised their children to believe such times could never come again. Now that they're here, these people and their children are doubly impoverished by having lost a native literature as well as the land that was homesteaded by their grandparents.
I write on the Great Plains, in a small town. I'm an insider by virtue of family history, but also indelibly an outsider and not only because I write. My mother, the only child of Charlotte and Frank Totten -- he was a respected pioneer physician in the region -- eloped with a musician in the 1930's, and I spent my formative years in Washington, Illinois, Hawaii, Vermont and New York. I have a unique role here, and try to respect its complexity. I have no family in the area now, but my roots go deep. When I joined my grandmother's Presbyterian church, with considerable misgivings, more than 10 years after my grandmother died, an old woman startled me by saying, "It's good to have a Totten in the church again." People like her have helped recall me to my inheritance.
Not long ago, I visited with a gentlemanly old cowboy in a local tavern. He was in town, "buying provender," as he put it, and he sought me out as a member of what he termed "one of the old families," to tell me about a sidesaddle he owns that his great-grandfather made as a wedding present nearly 150 years ago. We mused a while on the subject of our ancestors, who traveled from many places -- England, Scotland, Connecticut, Virginia, Iowa, Kansas -- to settle on the plains.
Suddenly, he said: "Who are we, and where do we come from? That's the real question, isn't it?" Before I could reply, he smiled slyly and said, "And here we are, telling each other lies." "Stories," I laughed. "Call them stories." "Stories?" he nearly shouted back, "That's who we are!" Slapping the bar, he repeated, "Who we are!"
Just a small moment, the philosophical enthusiasm of a tipsy but still courtly cowboy, but I think it reveals something about the sensitivity of plains people to their past and present identities. I am entrusted with many stories, and have my own to tell. What I often wonder is why the others are not telling theirs. The material is certainly here: the economic upheavals of the last 10 years alone might have inspired a novel as deeply Dakotan as "The Bones of Plenty." Instead, there is silence. We have comparatively few writers in the Dakotas, most of them teaching in our colleges or universities -- which, as one of them, Jay Meek, has said, makes them "not of the communities, however much they might be from them." A few people in small towns write genre fiction -- cowboy poetry, historical westerns and the like -- and some wonderful indigenous writing appears in memoirs and devotional literature, as in a ranchwoman's chronicle of the current farm crisis told through the Psalms. But mostly there is silence.
The silence here disturbs some who seek after truth; I've heard, both from the clergy and from board members of the North Dakota Arts Council, speculation about what it means to have so few writers in the region. One minister told me he saw it as a kind of censorship, having a different cause than that inflicted by totalitarianism or a military dictatorship, but with the same result. "I worry about us," he said, "if we aren't producing artists here who can tell our story. A people with no art has lost its soul."
Perhaps it will be another generation before the story of these days can be told. The children and grandchildren of farm people forced off their land today may well be the ones to write about it tomorrow. Perhaps, given the distance that the passage of time can provide, they will tell us the truth about ourselves. Whether or not we will listen, out here on the plains, I cannot say.

HEADLINE: States, Failing to Cooperate, Face a Nuclear-Waste Crisis

BYLINE: By ROBERT REINHOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Thousands of hospitals, pharmaceutical makers and electric utilities across the country face grave new troubles in the new year, when it will become much more difficult and costly to dispose of their low-level radioactive wastes.
The problems grow from a 12-year-old Federal law that was intended to make the disposal of such waste more equitable to the states with dump sites. But political conflict and public opposition have frustrated attempts to carry out the law. 
 Under the law, the three states that have been accepting and burying radioactive waste can begin on Jan. 1 to exclude any waste generated outside their own regions. Nevada will shut its dump at Beatty completely, and Washington State's site at Hanford will accept waste from only six other northwestern states and Hawaii.
 
One Dump Gains Monopoly
 That will leave only one dump, in Barnwell, S.C., open for the rest of the country. The authorities there, enjoying a monopoly in an unwanted trade, will impose an access fee of $220 a cubic foot for waste from states outside the Southeast. That, plus transportation costs, will increase the disposal costs three- to fivefold for waste generators in California, New York and other states.
Even so, the South Carolina dump is to be closed to outsiders within 18 months and is scheduled to shut altogether by 1996. After that, given the emotional public opposition to new dumps, it remains unclear where the nation will be able to store the thousands of cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste, which includes equipment from nuclear power plants, contaminated clothing, radioactive substances used to track the flow of drugs in the body and radioactive cancer treatments.
The Federal Government disposes of high-level radioactive waste, like that from nuclear weapons production or spent fuel from nuclear power plants, but each state is responsible for its low-level waste.
 
Gridlock and Opposition
 The deepening crisis reflects the partial collapse of the system of interstate compacts Congress envisioned when it passed the Low-Level Radioactive Waste Policy Act of 1980. It encouraged states to join with neighboring states to build dumps so each region shared the burden equally. Nine such compacts were formed.
But years of political gridlock and determined local opposition blocked the creation of any new dump sites. New York State never joined a compact and must now rely entirely on South Carolina. Because they have failed to comply with the Federal law, Michigan, Rhode Island, New Hampshire, Puerto Rico and the District of Columbia are barred from shipping to South Carolina and have no outlet.
Michigan was expelled from the Midwest Compact last year because it refused to permit a dump within its borders. As a result, the Veterans Administration Hospital in Ann Arbor, among others, sends patients out of state if they need radioactive materials for diagnosis or treatment. More than 36,000 cubic feet of waste have piled up temporarily at 53 locations in Michigan, and about 1,300 more cubic feet are added every month. The authorities have no idea what they are going to do with it.
California, which produces nearly 9 percent of the nation's low-level radioactive waste, has been planning for years -- in a compact with Arizona and the Dakotas -- to put a dump in Ward Valley, in the Mojave Desert near Needles, close to the Arizona border. But the project is tied up in complex legal and political knots, which are unlikely to unraveled before the South Carolina dump closes to outsiders in 18 months.
 
'In a Holding Pattern'
 In the meantime, major producers like the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a 1,100-bed research hospital here in Los Angeles, can do little except worry. "We are in a holding pattern," said Donna L. Early, director of radiation and environmental safety. "I am not going to allow anybody to generate large quantities of radioactive waste until I know where I will dispose of it. We will have to ask, 'Can we do that kind of research?' "
The increasing problems with disposal has had some benefit, with production of low-level waste dropping to 1.4 million cubic feet in 1992 from 2.7 million cubic feet in 1985. Scientists are turning to methods that do not involve radiation. Companies and hospitals have become more efficient in using radioactivity and now often clean and reuse gloves and other equipment rather than discarding them.
Critics say the situation is an unintended result of flawed Federal legislation that was meant to create equity among the states but that instead may cause a proliferation of badly controlled, environmentally risky storage sites at thousands of scattered locations as users make their own provisions. "We've moved in the opposite direction intended by Congress," said Alan D. Pasternak, technical director for Ms. Early's group. "This is a major political failure."
Ron Kuchera, director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources, had even more pointed comments: "This is the worst piece of environmental legislation ever passed by Congress. What's worse, Congress won't revisit it because it's a pernicious issue, and obviously it has failed."
A 1985 amendment to the 1980 waste law extended the deadline for compliance from Jan. 1, 1986, to Jan. 1, 1993, and also required the states to assume legal possession and liability for any waste generated after Jan. 1, 1996.
In June, the United States Supreme Court, acting on a challenge to the amended waste law brought by New York State, upheld the law but struck down the provision imposing liability on the states for waste generated after Jan. 1, 1996. Critics said that ruling essentially eviscerated the law, removing the incentive for the states to find disposal sites for their wastes.
 
Producing Uncomfortable Allies
 The situation is complicated because, while few object to using radioactivity to treat cancer patients, the largest producers of waste are nuclear power plants. Hospitals and drug makers find themselves in an uncomfortable alliance with the nuclear power industry. The Federal Department of Energy said that in 1990 electric utilities generated 56.2 percent of low-level waste nationally, industry 31.2 percent, governments 6.3 percent and hospitals and universities 6.2 percent.
Here in California, environmental groups have delayed the Ward Valley dump by persuading the Legislature that formal hearings before an administrative law judge were required. Leading the protest has been the Committee to Bridge the Gap, an antinuclear group based in Los Angeles that argues that the site poses a danger to groundwater under the desert and to the nearby Colorado River.
The president of the committee, Daniel O. Hirsch, says it would agree to opening Ward Valley if the dump was limited to only medical waste.
But without the utilities, cost would be prohibitive, said Ms. Early of Cedars Sinai. "If we take them out, then economically we do not have a site," she said. "The real driving force is the anti-nuclear power stance."
The Pacific Gas & Electric Company, the electric utility serving almost all of northern and central California, has a single nuclear plant at Diablo Canyon near San Luis Obispo that produces about 5,000 cubic feet of low-level radioactive waste a year. That compares with about 1,000 cubic feet produced each year by Cedars Sinai.
Dennis Coates, an economist at the University of North Carolina who has studied the issue, says that giving the responsibility to the states was bound to backfire, making it necessary to build far more sites than really needed for the amount of waste. In a recent paper for the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis, Professor Coates wrote that the law was "fatally flawed on both technical and practical political grounds."
In an interview, Professor Coates argued that only five sites rather than the 9 to 20 or more that might be needed under the compact system. "The Federal Government should take back the process," he said. "It's unfair for states to continue to host these sites. Ultimately, someone has to do it, but when it's handled at the state level, no one wants to take it."

HEADLINE: Japan's Health Care: Cradle, Grave and No Frills

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
Seventy-year-old Genji Ito had to travel 20 minutes by bicycle on a drizzly morning recently to get to the Toho University Hospital by 7:30, an hour before it officially opened.
But it was still a good day, he noted happily, for his early start had landed him No. 69 in the hospital's dank waiting room, which meant that it would take only until noon to see the doctor about his heart condition and get his medication. 
 "This system is my savior," said Mr. Ito, sitting with about 100 others who filled the rows of vinyl-covered benches, since Japanese physicians generally do not make appointments. Despite the long wait and the briefness of the visits, no matter how many times Mr. Ito goes, he pays just 900 yen a month for his treatment -- the equivalent of $7.25 -- which is typical for a senior citizen.
 
Cheap and Efficient
 Japanese like Mr. Ito put up with waiting at crowded clinics and seemingly impersonal treatment from physicians, but in return they enjoy what some describe as the most efficient comprehensive health-insurance system in the world.
The system has produced one of the healthiest societies on earth, while keeping the financial burden on corporations remarkably light. Japanese companies pay about one-fifth of what American concerns do for employee health insurance.
But the three-decade-old system is facing a challenge of chronology that threatens this success -- the rapid growth in the numbers of retirees healthy enough to pedal a bicycle to the hospital but old enough to need large doses of expensive medical care.
The portion of the population 65 or older is expected to double, to 25 percent from 12 percent now, within 30 years. As a result, the portion of total medical costs that go for the aged is projected to rise from 17.8 percent in 1980 to 37 percent in the year 2000 and 41 percent in 2010.
In the past, the system has been so lucrative that Government-controlled health insurers once used their surpluses to build resorts in Australia and Hawaii. Today, these insurers, reflecting the kind of cost pressures seen in other countries, are preparing to slash $320 million from the budgets of 247 Government-owned hospitals and clinics over the next five years, close 74 other medical facilities and merge 7.
Doctors are bracing for tighter controls on their fees and the possible loss of a major source of profit -- selling the medication they prescribe.
 
Wide Agreement To Spare Employers
 But perhaps the most important lesson for American policy makers struggling to repair the medical safety net is in the Japanese approach to solving the cost problem. In all the study councils and debates taking place here, one bedrock assumption is not being questioned -- that the burden of supporting these soaring medical costs should not fall on corporations. Nearly everyone is calling for the Government, and hence the taxpayer, to foot the bill.
"The increase in costs is unavoidable and we know that," said Tetsuo Yagi, a former deputy minister of Health and Welfare and now vice president of the National Federation of Health Insurance Societies, a trade group. "The issue is how to balance the burden. We know that if we go beyond a certain point, we would lower the vitality of the Japanese economy. That is what we agree we have to avoid. The Government has to bear this burden, and I think it will."
This kind of choice reflects a side of Japan's economic strength that is often overlooked. Americans focus on the technological prowess of Japanese auto makers, computer-chip producers and consumer-electronics giants. But one of the secrets of Japan's industrial might is that the social welfare system delivers an impressive level of services to all, while costing taxpayers and corporations relatively little.
"The Japanese system has lots of trade-offs," said Daniel I. Okimoto, a professor at the Asia-Pacific Research Center at Stanford University, who is coordinating a major study of Japanese health care, "but on balance if your objective is to control costs, it works. That is a competitive strength."
Many Americans would reject some of these trade-offs as cumbersome, impersonal or too restrictive. The complaints here range from crowded, factory-like facilities to doctors' heavy over-prescription of drugs as a way of increasing restricted incomes.
What also makes the Japanese health-care system work more efficiently is the absence of a large, impoverished underclass in Japan, diets heavy in rice, fish and vegetables that are generally healthier than those of Westerners, and an almost total absence of medical-malpractice suits.
Overall, Japanese will spend 21.68 trillion yen on health care this year, or $175 billion at current exchange rates. That is 6.8 percent of the gross national product; total medical costs in the United States are 12.8 percent of G.N.P.
More than 80 million Americans are either uninsured or inadequately insured. Everyone in Japan is covered by the Government-controlled system.
While Japanese corporations pay a little more than $700 per employee on annual premiums, American companies pay $3,452, according to Hewitt Associates, a benefits consultant.
By some measures, none of these trade-offs has compromised the ultimate strength of the Japanese system. The life expectancy for men is 75.9 years and for women 81.8, the highest in the world. The infant-mortality rate is 0.46 percent of live births, said Dr. Naoki Ikegami, a health administrator at Keio University School of Medicine.
"You get your money's worth in the United States, but if you don't have the money, you don't get the worth," remarked Dr. Ikegami, who has been a visiting professor at the University of Pennsylvania. "In Japan there is real equality. That is our strength."
 
Informed Consent An Alien Concept
 But a visit to any clinic or hospital demonstrates just what the Japanese give up. To be a patient here is to be told surprisingly little about diagnoses, the kinds of treatment being used or the drugs administered. Doctors are not accustomed to hearing questions and give almost no information. In this regard, some Japanese doctors say their system stands roughly where the American system did 25 years ago.
For instance, in a landmark case several years ago, Japan's Supreme Court ruled that doctors are not required to tell patients if they are suffering from cancer.
The patient, a nurse, had rejected surgery because her doctor said she had gallstones, rather than cancer. Her family sued, saying that if she had been correctly informed, she would have made a different decision and her life could have been saved. The court rejected that argument on the ground that a doctor need not share the full details of a diagnosis.
In a case this month, it was disclosed that more than 80 old people died in a suburban Tokyo hospital after being infected by a kind of antibiotic-resistant bacteria common in hospitals. Relatives say they were told neither the cause of the illnesses nor that the patients were being given large doses of a new type of antibiotic that was reportedly ineffective against the infection.
No matter what the disorder, patients receive extraordinary numbers of injections and pills, making the Japanese the largest consumers of drugs, per person, in the world. This has for years included a variety of drugs for the treatment of cancer, blood disorders and senility that some doctors say are of dubious effectiveness.
Patients taking experimental drugs are not told in some cases that they are participating in trials. Doctors frequently remove labels from routine prescription drugs.
Hospital stays are measured in weeks rather than days. Dr. Teruo Hirose, a heart surgeon who has practiced both in Japan and the United States and has just written a book comparing the two systems, says the average hospital stay here is 39 days, compared with 5.8 in the United States.
Doctors tend to encourage long hospital stays to increase fees through greater volume of business. But the cost per day is relatively modest, keeping the overall cost of the system low. For example, many patients find themselves having to ask their families to provide meals and other services while they are in the hospital.
 
Rules Govern; Skill Is Parenthetic
 The centerpiece of the Japanese health-insurance system is a thick green-and-white paperback book issued by the Health and Welfare Ministry, which sits on the desk of just about every health professional. The book lists exactly what doctors can charge for every approved treatment.
There is almost no flexibility. An experienced specialist in a demanding area of medicine would be paid the same for an exam as a newly minted general practitioner. Besides providing no differentiation for levels of skill or expertise, there is nothing in it to allow for regional differences in costs. An appendectomy, for instance, costs $388 whether it is performed in downtown Tokyo or in rural areas of the northern island of Hokkaido.
A number of experts, both critics and supporters of the system, agree that this rigid fee schedule restrains costs, but they say it also distorts the services doctors deliver.
The lack of recognition of differences in quality puts emphasis on quantity. According to an article in the Stanford Law & Policy Review last year by Aki Yoshikawa, Norihiko Shirouzu and Matthew Holt, doctors in private clinics see 64 patients a day on the average, for about five minutes each.
While American doctors are generally prohibited from both prescribing and selling drugs to patients, in Japan this is principal source of income.
Japanese take at least 50 percent more drugs than Americans do, says Dr. Masanori Fukushima, who has written extensively on this matter. He also says that the system for testing drugs is not rigorous enough, and thus results in the heavy use of medication of questionable effectiveness.
Dr. Fukushima, a cancer specialist, said this realization took hold when he worked temporarily in Houston 13 years ago and saw the high level of research being done, the quality of the services provided and the close relationships that developed between doctors and patients -- something that rarely exists in Japan. He also became aware, he said, of the concept of informed consent.
"The majority of patients in Japan know nothing about the drugs they are taking," he said. "There are still plenty of doctors who clip off the name of the drug from the package given to patients. The attitudes are pre-modern."
And though the green and white fee schedule does not recognize differences in quality, patients do. Special gratuities are often paid to gain access to the best specialists, such as surgeons. Dr. Hirose said that the top surgeons are simply offered large, under-the-table payments to take on wealthier patients quickly.
"It's a bribe," he said. "It's a part of things."
 
A Model for U.S.? Probably Not
 Every Japanese citizen is covered by one of several health plans overseen and in many instances run by the Government. Slightly more than 55 percent of the nation's 125 million people are covered by corporate plans, which are run like cooperatives. There are separate plans for public employees, seamen, teachers, retirees, farmers and the self-employed.
In one of the biggest differences with the United States, the aged are covered under a separate system. Unlike their American competitors, Japanese corporations are not responsible for the health care of their retired employees.
In most cases, premiums are automatically deducted from paychecks. According to Dr. Ikegami, the medical-school health administrator, the Japanese pay on average 2.7 percent of their total incomes for health-insurance premiums. This is matched by employers.
The incomes of doctors, hospitals and clinics depend on a grand-scale negotiation every two years between the medical association and the Health and Welfare Ministry. They hammer out, line by line, how much each entry in the fee book will be increased. In practice, decisions rest with the Finance Ministry, which lays down in advance the overall increase in costs that will be permitted.
"The big problem is that this does not correctly account for all the costs that doctors and hospitals face," said Dr. Kiyohiko Yoshida, an executive member of the board of trustees of the Japan Medical Association. "Neither side is completely satisfied with the results, but we have to find compromises."
Insurance coverage leaves some of the costs to patients, who pay 10 percent to 30 percent of their medical bills, depending on the kind of plan under which they are covered. But there are monthly caps to costs, and low-income people are heavily subsidized.
Those who know both the United States and Japan well say that the diversity, urban poverty and the strong medical lobby in America would make it impossible to apply Japan's system.
"Delivering medical services in Japan is something like dealing only with the middle class and up in California," Dr. Fukushima said. "Our system is very backward in many ways, but it does show how effective a strong consensus can be."

HEADLINE: New State Laws Reflecting Tough Economic Times

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Across the nation on Jan. 1 the states will put into effect dozens of new laws, and the motivation behind many of them is the lackluster economy.
Georgia will promise business tax breaks for new jobs created in poor areas, and Alaska will increase the price of hunting licenses to $25 from $12 to raise revenue. 
 Most of the laws resulted from legislators' struggles with shrinking revenues, dwindling jobs and rising social-service needs at the same time they sought to enhance their states' attractiveness to businesses and workers.
"A big concern for states is the economy and what they can do within their state economy to make it better," said Doug Sacarto, a public-policy analyst at the National Conference of State Legislatures. "The fundamentals are there: saving jobs, education that's going to keep us competitive in a global economy. This has been talked about at the national level, but you see it acted on in very important ways at the state level."
 
Efforts on Health Insurance
 In addition to the economic moves, starting next year, Minnesota will tax hospitals to finance health insurance for its working poor and Florida will require tighter security against crime in convenience stores.
New Year's Day also inaugurates Indiana's $125 tax credit for those who donate used computers to public schools, lower workers' compensation costs for Maine employers and a New York State ban on toys and candy shaped like hypodermic needles.
Jan. 1 is not a time when laws often take effect; more normally laws become effective at the beginning of a fiscal year or a certain number of months after enactment. But looking at the array of January laws is useful for checking trends.
Other new laws taking effect Friday include these:
*In Pennsylvania, divorced working parents can be compelled to provide health insurance for their children, regardless of whether they have custody.
*New Jersey will require that part of the payroll contributions workers and employers now make to unemployment and disability funds to go to health care for the poor and uninsured.
*California will require employers to warn workers against sexual harassment, while children in the fourth grade and up will risk expulsion from school if they are found to be sexual harassers.
*California will also outlaw job discrimination against homosexuals
*New York State will prohibit the sale or installation of car alarms that sound for more than three minutes.
*Tennessee will tighten state supervision over guardians appointed to oversee the affairs of minors, the disabled and the aged.
*Georgia will make 12 weeks of unpaid family leave available each year to state employees.
*Illinois will ban radar detectors from commercial vehicles.
*Massachusetts will raise cigarette taxes by 25 cents, to 51 cents a pack.
*New Hampshire will increase penalties for rape and require convicted sex offenders to register with the police when they leave prison.
In addition, seven states will enact laws to keep drunken drivers off the roads. New Hampshire, for example, will redefine drunken drivers to include those who operate boats and off-road vehicles.
In two states, legislators also imposed new limits on gifts and contributions they may receive. Starting Friday, lawmakers in Iowa will not be able to accept any gifts or food or drink costing more than $3. In Kentucky, individuals and political action committees will not be allowed to give a political candidate more than $500.

Breathing New Life Into a Hospital

BYLINE: By Sam Roberts

 BODY:
WHEN the Koch administration announced the closing of Sydenham Hospital in 1979, Harlem rallied behind the venerable institution as a symbol of community pride, but not necessarily of quality health care. Finally, Harlem has both.
The same year that the Sydenham decision was announced, a small group of civic-minded New Yorkers reorganized North General Hospital. They enlisted public officials, philanthropists and major medical institutions to extricate the foundering hospital from unpaid bills and to raise both money and standards. 
 The struggle to resuscitate North General is more than a medical miracle. It was a team effort that harnessed the influence of powerful people: among them, Charles B. Rangel, the local Congressman; Basil A. Paterson, the hospital's lawyer and advocate in Albany; former state Health Commissioner David Axelrod, and Randolph Guggenheimer, the lawyer and philanthropist who recently received the United Hospital Fund's Distinguished Community Service Award for faithfully championing North General, first, almost single-handedly, as its only trustee and then as chairman of the nonprofit community hospital.
But North General's very survival as a symbol of self-reliance, the hospital's stunning new home across Madison Avenue from Marcus Garvey Park, and its emergence as the nucleus of a critical mass in the revival of Harlem are largely a testament to the perseverance of one person. In this season of hope, his commitment, and success is another reminder that one person can make a difference.
Add the name of Eugene I. McCabe, North General's president, to an honor roll of largely unsung heroes, including Patrick Daly, the martyred principal in Red Hook; Richard Green, who heads the Crown Heights Youth Collective; Clara Hale, who nurtured Harlem's neediest babies and Ned O'Gorman, who strives mightily to shepherd them through adolescence; Helen VerDuin Palit, who founded City Harvest, which feeds the hungry; Anna Lou DeHavenon, an urban anthropologist whose painstaking investigations have verified the degree of poverty in the city and have also helped mitigate it, and Theodore Gross, a playwright who not only conceived a contribution to society that is remarkable in its simplicity but actually carried it out -- generating hundreds of thousands of dollars for services for the poor, the hungry and the homeless by harvesting people's unwanted pennies. (His Common Cents, at 212-PENNIES, is searching for benefactors to cover overhead).
As for Mr. McCabe, he modestly attributes his success and endurance to naivete. "If you don't know how difficult something is, you just keep going," said the 55-year-old technocrat with a heart. "Syndenham was a card and needed to be played. The issue of quality of care at Sydenham was understood by everyone. But even the things that don't work so well are part of the community's fabric. It wasn't only a loss of services, but it's a feeling that they don't think Harlem's so important."
Mr. McCabe, who attended President-elect Bill Clinton's economic summit earlier this month, said the task at hand was to balance and manage competing needs. "Everyone wants universal access, improved quality and at a lower cost," he said. "The health commissioner says you can have two of the three. The Government will probably put a cap on Federal spending for health care and that will have a ripple effect. The nation needs more managed, primary and preventive health care, which are all the things were trying to do.
"Our feeling was that if you could do basic primary care well you would make an impact. We don't want to do open-heart surgery or brain surgery. Someone coming here understands they're going to get basic, primary care of quality. We want to be a well-managed community hospital."
Mr. McCabe is also a believer in decision making at the local level. "At a teaching hospital, sometimes standards and patient-care expectations are in conflict. And in the municipal hospitals, policy-making is diffused and sometimes decisions can't get made. I don't feel they can ever run as efficiently as they need to without the ability to make them free-standing with responsibilities for budget and admission. They should all be spun off. But if our hospital were twice the size, like some municipals, it wouldn't have worked. It's got to be small enough to have this personal involvement."
With 240 beds and 2,200 employees, North General is Harlem's largest private employer. Mr. McCabe seems to know virtually every employee by name.
North General is also emerging as a pivotal player in Harlem's revival. A medical and office annex to the hospital will be completed next spring. The hospital is sponsoring several affordable-housing projects nearby in conjunction with the city and the state and also a residence for homeless people with AIDS.
"We're not in the housing business," Mr. McCabe said, "but our feeling is if you build up the community you strengthen the hospital."
From the cherrywood lobby to the emergency room, which gets 30,000 visits a year, North General's new building, which opened a year ago this month, is an immaculate monument to what is doable against all odds.
"The new building gives people the idea that things can get better and sense of accomplishment builds on itself," Mr. McCabe said. "If our goal is to deliver first-rate primary care, now that we've had some success people think it's possible."

HEADLINE: Twnhse, 15 Mi. Red Sq., $6,833 Mo.

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
The United States has been exporting chunks of its culture for decades, through books, television shows, compact disks or films, to name a few. But it is fair to say that planned communities, like Columbia, Md., or Rancho Santa Maria, Calif. -- or even the concept -- have not been big items of foreign exchange. But that is changing.
Inspired by a slumping market in the United States and a perceived need to provide Western-style comfort and security for foreigners seeking gold in the former Soviet Union, American developers, with the blessing of the Russian Government, have packed up their blueprints and headed for Moscow. 
 The most ambitious of these projects, an $88 million, 478-town- house development called Rosinka, is now going up, piece by imported piece, around a recently constructed 40-acre lake 15 miles from Red Square. Monthly rents start at $3,750 and go up to $6,833.
Rosinka will be not only one of the most ambitious, but also one of the most expensive in which to live, which means most Russians will probably be excluded, though the developers say that 10 percent of the town houses will eventually be occupied by Russians who work for Western companies. On its grounds, Rosinka will have tennis courts, an indoor pool, a day-care center and a shopping mall.
"If I had to move to Russia, this is the only place I would live, because it is as close to home as you can get, " said Diane Corchard of Senie Kershner International Housing Ltd. of Norwalk, Conn., leasing manager for the project. "When you lie in bed and look outside, it's like being in Vermont."
Kershner International acquired a 50-year lease three years ago to develop the community on Zavet Ilyicha, a collective farm.
It joins other projects. Last summer, an Atlanta developer, the Worsham Group, and two Russian partners, opened a 200-unit complex of town houses and apartments that Moscow magazine characterized as a "hygienically sealed 40-acre hard-currency colony" in the embassy section of the city. Companies that have leased dwelling space there include Ciba-Geigy, Credit Suisse and Du Pont.
And two years ago, the Russian Government signed up the Houston-based developer Gerald Hines as manager and leasing agent of a 333-unit apartment complex, called Park Place, 10 miles southwest of Moscow, built by a Turkish contractor.
Compared with these projects, Rosinka is a distinctly American undertaking, even though it did not start out that way.
Financing a development on the East Coast is a little different from throwing up 478 town houses in the Russian countryside, and signing up creditors was a problem.
At one point, Kershner International thought it had a deal with a Finnish company to build the homes with a loan guaranteed by the Finnish Government. But Helsinki balked when the Russian Government fell behind in its loan payments. A similar contract with an Italian company dissolved when a loan sponsored by the Italian Government failed to come through.
Salvation arrived when Kershner International started talking with Deluxe Homes Inc., a Berwick, Pa., builder of modular units, whose biggest project to date was a 314-unit complex in the Bronx.
Deluxe put Kershner International in touch with the First Eastern Bank N.A. in Wilkes-Barre, Pa., a $2.5 billion institution that knows Deluxe well but does not make many loans outside Pennsylvania, let alone in Russia.
"We don't have international loans in our portfolio," said James Mack, an executive vice president at First Eastern who oversees the bank's commercial loans. "Any credit judgments we make relate to what we know and know well, and we know our customers in western Pennsylvania well."
First Eastern came up with a small revolving construction loan, Lloyd's of London provided the team with political-risk insurance and the International Moscow Bank came up with separate loans in dollars and rubles.
Earlier this year, Deluxe began sending the steel-frame homes, which leave Berwick about 90 percent complete, by ship to St. Petersburg. Trucks carry the homes 535 miles to the building site.
"By dribs and drabs, using Deluxe's bank and letters of credit from each prospective tenant as security, we have been able to amass financing," said John Stock, a lawyer in Westport, Conn., who is one of the partners in the venture.
 
State Department is Tenant
 Having the United States Government as Rosinka's anchor tenant also helped.
After looking at its own projected housing needs for the coming year, a forecast that showed a shortfall of more than 40 apartments, the State Department agreed to lease 40 units at Rosinka; the Agency for International Development took 10.
"We worked for almost a year to get them," Noland Kershner, another principal in the project, said, "but they put us through a wringer and got a discount."
The United States Government was able to slice $2,500 a year out of the annual rent it will pay for each apartment. Even so, rents on the units Washington has taken range from $42,500 a year to $47,500.
State Department officials spoke only on background, but acknowledged that the new Russian digs were not cheap.
Monthly rents start at $3,750 for a two-bedroom town house and run as high as $6,833 for the top-of-the-line five-bedroom model that is just under 3,000 square feet. Leases must run at least three years.
 
A Gilded Ghetto?
 At those prices, chances are slim that many Russians have the wherewithal to call Rosinka home.
Some worry that by building what amounts to gilded ghettos, American developers may inadvertently be reconstructing social and economic barriers that were only recently torn down.
"The Soviets used to encourage ghettos because they didn't want Westerners to learn a lot about Soviet life," said David K. Shipler, the author of the 1983 book "Russia: Broken Idols, Solemn Dreams" and a former Moscow bureau chief for The New York Times. "It is a little ironic that Americans are creating compounds just at a time when the Government there permits foreigners to live among Russians if they choose."
Those concerns seem not to be shared by the Russian powers that be.
Separate surveys of available housing in Moscow by The Economist Intelligence Unit, a division of The Economist, and Runzheimer & Company, management consultants for travel and living costs, show that apartments considered to meet minimal acceptability standards by Western executives are available for rent at prices from $700 to as high as $3,200 a month for a four-bedroom unit.
"There is a less expensive approach" than living in one of these projects, said Richard J. Sherwin, president of International Tellcell, based in Greenwich, Conn., a provider of wireless telecommunication services throughout Eastern Europe that wired Rosinka for cable television.
"You can get a Moscow apartment, but they lack American appliances, good bathrooms, decent water. And there are no international phone lines in those apartments. That is very important to us."
Mr. Sherwin, who said "it makes sense to give people a home away from home," has rented a unit in Rosinka that will sleep five and has three bathrooms.
Even though Rosinka's homes are nearly complete when delivered, about 100 Russians are working for the developers to build the infrastructure.
Despite their own depressed living standards, Mr. Kershner says, the local people have shown no resentment toward those moving into Rosinka.
 
Impact on Outlook
 Mr. Sherwin is not so sure. "I don't think anything is as visceral as seeing things in front of your eyes that you can't have," Mr. Sherwin said. "I am sure there is some resentment."
But the expatriate life has always been much more luxurious than the ordinary Russian's, Mr. Shipler said. More important, he added, will be the way these new communities color a foreign tenant's view of the country itself.
"When you put people into a situation like this, they have very little contact with the Russians," he said. "That has to have an impact on the way Americans see the country they are living in, and on how they see their mission."

HEADLINE: Tool Orders Dropped 22% In November

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools slumped in November as customers canceled orders and others delayed purchases in hopes of future tax breaks, an industry report said yesterday.
Machine tool orders totaled $161.3 million in November, down 22 percent from $206.75 million in October and 30.1 percent from $230.7 million in November 1991. 
 The orders for machine tool exports also reflected the overall weakness in economies overseas, said the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a trade group based in Washington.
"The decline in November was the result of unusually large cancellations and customer uncertainty over possible investment incentives in 1993," said Albert W. Moore, president of the association.
 
 
Small Industry, Major Gauge
 Its monthly report covers two categories of tools, for metal cutting and metal forming. Together, they represent a relatively small industry and the monthly figures on orders can fluctuate widely. Despite this, machine-tool orders are considered an important gauge of industrial health because the tools play a key role in the output of a broad range of goods.
The report followed signs released last week that the economy is turning around after a prolonged stagnant period. A survey of businesses in October and November showed they collectively planned a 5.3 percent increase in investment spending in 1993 after a 3.6 percent rise this year. The gain in investment spending would be the best in four years.
The Commerce Department said the gross domestic product grew at a seasonally and inflation-adjusted 3.4 percent annual rate in the third quarter, not quite as strong as an earlier estimate but still the best of George Bush's Presidency.
For the first 11 months of the year, machine-tool orders were running 1 percent behind last year's pace.
 
Foreign Orders Off 20.5 Percent
 Orders from foreign buyers fell to $18.2 million in November, down 20.5 percent from $22.9 million in October and down more than 60 percent from $48.5 million in November 1991. Canceled orders came to $23.65 million in November, about triple October's level of $7.95 million and well above the year-to-date average monthly level.
Cancellations probably surged because as the year's end approached companies faced tough decisions about growth in their individual industries, said the association's statistical director, Patrick McGibbon.

HEADLINE: Spending Jump Poses A Puzzle

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 27

 BODY:
Even before the holiday shopping season, America's mighty army of retail consumers had begun to loosen its grip on purse strings and wallets -- parting with $165 billion in November alone.
But as merchants bask in what for many was the best Christmas in several years, economists are still trying to piece together just where these shoppers are getting the money: from higher incomes, by borrowing or by drawing from savings or other assets. The answer could well determine the health of the economy in the months to come. 
 Consumer spending on retail goods, rent and other services accounts for two-thirds of the economy, but despite huge volumes of data collected by the Government and private sources, a definitive answer has not yet been found to where the money is coming from. And economists are offering diametrically opposite forecasts for the months ahead.
 
 
'I'm Very Hopeful'
 Some, like Irwin L. Kellner, chief economist for the Chemical Banking Corporation, say they are optimistic, believing the holiday splurge bodes well for the economy in coming months. "I'm very hopeful that it can be sustained," he said, citing substantial recent growth in wages and salaries. "It's no surprise it's a great holiday shopping season."
But many other analysts are more pessimistic.
"In essence, consumers have been spending more than they are taking in, implying that in early 1993 they will be forced to retrench," said Gordon Richards, economist for the National Association of Manufacturers. "It is important not to be lulled into a false sense of complacency by the apparently buoyant Christmas season."
Still others, like Neal M. Soss of the First Boston Corporation, hold a sort of middle ground in their view that consumers will be neither a strong positive force nor an economic drag, despite the skimpiness of income-tax refunds coming this winter and spring.
To spur the election-year economy, the Bush Administration adjusted tax-withholding tables so that about $20 billion that would otherwise have been collected by the Government throughout 1992 and refunded in the early months of 1993 was immediately injected into the spending stream.
 
 
'Episodic' Increases Seen
 Mr. Soss sees "episodic" increases in consumer spending, one of which happened to coincide with the current holiday season, with major growth held back by a lack of jobs.
"Employers feel this intense urge to economize on their head count," Mr. Soss said.
The most confirmed pessimist may be Albert Sindlinger, a pollster in suburban Philadelphia whose mid-December telephone interviews uncovered "little cheer" for the 1993 economy.
"The consumer remains in a tremendous liquidity bind," Mr. Sindlinger said, "unable to sustain lasting growth in personal consumption or in retail sales."
A look at the Government numbers for the various gauges of the consumer's financial position is instructive, though hardly conclusive. But the figures do suggest that incomes are rising, that a newly confident consumer is once again taking on new debt and that households are also pulling money out of savings.
In short, today's spending is being fueled by all three sources, but with little agreement to be found about their relative importance or future course.
 
 
Modest Rise in Incomes
 The Commerce Department reported on Wednesday that personal incomes grew a very modest two-tenths of a percent in November, a lesser gain than in October or September and one only matching the gains for July and August. Closer inspection, however, shows that not only did special factors understate the recent improvement but that the key item of wage and salary income has climbed sharply -- by seven-tenths of 1 percent in each of the last two months.
"It's coming from a surprising source -- incomes earned from employment," Mr. Kellner said when asked the source of consumer wherewithal. The number of new jobs may be "microscopic," he added, but "the people who have jobs are working longer hours, and hourly wages are apparently going up even faster."
Susan M. Sterne, a consultant in Stowe, Vt., whose specialty is consumers, concurs with this analysis of incomes and notes that borrowing is up as well.
After falling every month from February through August, consumer installment debt rose in October for the second straight month and probably continued to rise in November and December. And credit-card issuers report hefty increases in usage, some at double-digit rates.
"I like that a lot," said Ms. Sterne, observing that consumers have refinanced homes and taken other steps to reduce debt burdens, a process that has allowed them to take on new commitments once again.
Mr. Soss contended that "the marginal increase in spending that we're seeing is from borrowing." He is unimpressed with the evidence of rising incomes.
Wayne M. Ayers, chief economist for the Bank of Boston, added, "I think what's really going on is that consumer debt burdens have finally been brought down to more manageable and comfortable levels."
In fact, repayment on installment debt now takes just over 16 percent of disposable personal income, the lowest proportion in eight years, according to Mr. Kellner of Chemical.
 
 
Disputed Source
 The third source of consumer spending power, savings, is subject to somewhat more dispute. The report on national output for the third quarter did show personal savings falling to 4.6 percent of disposable personal income from 5.3 percent in the second quarter, but various analysts wonder whether this reflects consumer reality.
"I don't think we're drawing down massive amounts of savings to support consumer spending," Ms. Sterne said, pointing to very sharp upward revisions for savings in previous business cycles -- three percentage points in the wake of the 1981-1982 recession -- following declines similar to the current one. She also sees little evidence that people are cashing in mutual funds or insurance policies.
Still, most analysts agree, continued consumer prosperity depends largely on job creation and the prospects for this, given swelling health, Social Security and other employment costs, do not seem particularly bright.
Many analysts, in fact, believe it will be business spending for new labor-saving machinery, not the consumer sector, that will power the fledgling expansion. Only if jobs appear as well, Mr. Kellner concluded, would he give "100 percent assurance" of sustained economic growth.

HEADLINE: Fear in Caribbean Over Trade Pact

BYLINE: By HOWARD W. FRENCH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Re public

 BODY:
Just out of earshot of the shop-floor bustle of industrial parks here, plant managers fear they will soon be able to detect another sound here: the whoosh of capital drawn toward Mexico by its sweeping new trade agreement with the United States.
Like many others in the Caribbean basin, they said they thought that the North American Free Trade Agreement, which would allow duty-free movement of goods across the borders of Canada, Mexico and the United States, would give Mexico advantages that would strongly undermine ties between the Caribbean and the United States. Those ties have been building since the early 1980's. 
 The agreement, signed by President Bush, President Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney of Canada, still requires action in each national legislature to go into effect. And some members of the United States Congress, as well as President-elect Bill Clinton, have stipulated various conditions or amendments they will seek to append to the pact -- making it far from a certainty.
Nonetheless, the perceived threat is propelling some Caribbean countries to make radical policy changes and perhaps seek free-trade negotiations of their own with the United States in the hope of winning a place in the hemisphere's emerging new trade order.
But there is fear that with Mexico soon able to offer American corporations cheap labor and transportation and its own large, unprotected market under the new agreement, many of the region's most fragile economies will be hard pressed to compete for trade and investment regardless of the measures they take.
 
Pessimistic Appraisals
 "If you ask any company outside of the circles of people who are already present in the Caribbean where they are looking to invest in the near future, they'll all tell you Mexico," James M. McElyea, a vice president of the Wilson Sporting Goods Company, said at a recent annual conference of investors, industrialists and trade officials from the Caribbean in Miami. Far from a lone pessimistic appraisal, his statement on the effects of the new trade agreement was echoed by many people at the conference.
Since 1984 the Caribbean has enjoyed a preferential trade arrangement with the United States, known as the Caribbean Basin Initiative, which has allowed companies operating in the region to export goods assembled from American components and raw materials to the United States duty free.
The Caribbean initiative, unlike the North American agreement, allowed the small countries of Central America and the Caribbean taking part to protect their own fledgling domestic industries even as new, export-oriented businesses were given free access to the United States market.
Taking advantage of the region's low wages, companies like Wilson and hundreds of others moved in to produce everything from hand-sewn baseballs to electrical switches and underwear in the industrial parks that sprouted in many Caribbean basin countries.
Largely because of the Caribbean Basin Initiative, many of the countries were soon transformed from simple agricultural or tourism-based economies to increasingly more diverse industrial ones.
 
A Warning on Emigration
 If this process is reversed, many warn, emigration from the region to the United States could explode, as could other problems of concern to Washington, from drug trafficking to political instability.
Mr. Clinton has sought to allay fears that the United States' special relationship with the region will be crippled by expanding ties with Mexico. "I have no intention of withdrawing from our historic commitments or our unique opportunities," Mr. Clinton said in early December.
Although they welcomed his address, many Caribbean business and political leaders remain deeply worried. By granting Mexico duty-free access to the United States market, they say, the North American agreement, popularly known by its acronym, Nafta, suddenly pits the Caribbean against a huge, low-cost competitor that many fear they will be unable to match. Equally important for some, the treaty ushers in a model of two-way free trade that many of the region's smaller countries say they could never survive.
"If you ask us to do that tomorrow you will be tearing down our democracy overnight," Ralph Fonseca, a Minister of State from Belize, said of expected calls by Washington for countries in the Caribbean region to abandon tariff barriers protecting their industries and negotiate reciprocal free-trade agreements with the United States. "In Belize we have done everything we can think of, privatizing our economy and opening up, but if we pursue some academic exercise before Washington has understood our predicament, we will end up nowhere."
 
Many Are Changing Plans
 Many larger Caribbean countries have already begun to alter their plans in the belief that the North American agreement will radically change the assumptions on which their economies have been built in the last decade.
"The time of reflection is past," said Juan Jose Arteaga, a senior economic adviser in the Government of the Dominican Republic, which has the Caribbean's most industrialized economy. "This Nafta thing is going ahead, and we will have to move forward very quickly with some major decisions."
Many Dominican officials and industrialists say that to remain competitive with Mexico their country will have to speed overhauls of the legal and tax codes, which have already undergone significant change in the last two years. But ultimately, many say, the country will have no alternative to seeking a similar trade agreement with the United States itself, either alone or as part of regional negotiations, which the Bush Administration has said it favors.
For countries that pursue this route, trade experts say, the stakes will be high. Industries that have thrived behind high tariff barriers will suddenly be subject to competition from large and efficient American corporations. Similarly, local banks and insurance companies will face stiff foreign competition in financial services.
 
Protecting Trademarks
 Washington will also insist strongly on safeguarding intellectual property rights, meaning that manufacturers of everything from soap to pharmaceuticals will be required to respect trademarks and honor licensing agreements in ways that many have sidestepped in the past.
With hints that the Clinton Administration will insist on stronger environmental regulation and more equitable labor codes in Mexico to win enactment of the trade agreement, many are bracing for change.
"These are all important themes among our private industrial sector right now, and in the next six months we will see some major decisions on them," said Jose M. Ceron Pena, executive vice president of San Isidro Industrial Free Zone, a large park on the edge of Santo Domingo. "Some people are saying do these things to open up right away. Others are saying do them more gradually. But for us, one of the choices is no longer not opening up at all."

ABC on the Trail of Cocaine Traffickers in Bolivia

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
If Bill Clinton tunes into ABC tonight, he will hear himself being instructed by Peter Jennings to admit that "the cocaine war in Bolivia is already lost" and to stop wasting money on it. Such a directive to an incoming President may seem a touch presumptuous, even from a network anchor, but it is forcefully backed up by pointed interviews and vivid scenes from the field.
"The Cocaine War, Lost in Bolivia" is meant to stir withdrawal symptoms at the Drug Enforcement Agency, whose greatest success has been all those pictures of drug busts it has imposed on television stations. Looking into the agency's operations in the country that produces much of the cocaine that reaches the United States and where he has been told he could see the war against drugs at its most effective, Mr. Jennings finds unredeemed failure. 
 That is not for want of will or courage of the American agents, who are seen undertaking arduous and risky actions in wild and unfriendly territory. As Mr. Jennings explains, many people in this poorest country of South America owe what livelihood they have to the coca plant, and the police and army are contaminated by drug money. He delivers the phrase "Bolivian law" with a sneer.
The ABC camera operators, too, deserve credit for slogging along with American-Bolivian teams on a stakeout to capture a small plane coming to pick up a load of cocaine (it does not arrive) and in a fruitless search for some Colombian traffickers that ends up with the stranded Americans calling for helicopters to rescue them.
The climax of the program finds Mr. Jennings on a mission to the town of San Joaquin, along with several American agents, 120 Bolivian soldiers and 14 helicopters, in pursuit of three reputedly important traffickers and their accomplices. First the local army contingent has to be ordered to stay in barracks because it is known to be in cahoots with the drug interests. Two of the main targets of the raid escape -- as usual, a leak is suspected -- and those who are arrested will either be back in business soon or readily replaced.
Mr. Jennings conducts sharp interviews with Bolivia's president, Jaime Paz Zamora, and with the American Ambassador, Charles R. Bowers, who mouths the highly optimistic assessments that are required to justify an investment of nearly $350 million in the last two years. (The documentary opens with President Bush's 1989 inauguration promise about cocaine: "Take my word for it, this scourge will stop.")
Mr. Zamora concedes somewhat sheepishly that if Washington does not like a Bolivian official, he is fired. But as Mr. Jennings notes, no Bolivian politician can ignore the fact that if the drug trade was really shut down, the country's feeble economy would collapse. You may come away hoping Mr. Clinton has tuned in.
When, a few weeks ago, Dan Rather and Tom Brokaw hastened to Somalia to greet the arriving American forces, Mr. Jennings stayed home. Although the presence of the CBS and NBC anchors constituted a seal of importance for the operation, their reporting added little to that of their less-famous colleagues on the spot. Mr. Jennings's report from Bolivia is something special. Maybe the lesson for the stars of network news is to go where they are not expected.

HEADLINE: How to Survive in Music? Play Anything, Anywhere

BYLINE: By ALLAN KOZINN

 BODY:
One recent Saturday, at an hour well before many clock radios switch themselves on, Wayne du Maine stood in a corner of a practice room at the Juilliard School, took off his St. Louis Cardinals cap and put it on again, backward. He picked up his trumpet, silently fingered its valves, and gently challenged a young student to play a scale.
Mr. du Maine, who is 27 years old, was starting his weekly teaching stint at Juilliard, where he is one of the few black teachers in its Music Advancement Program for promising minority elementary school students. Teaching is his only regularly scheduled job in a calendar otherwise filled with midday rehearsals and one-night performances of anything from a Mahler symphony to an Andrew Lloyd Webber musical. 
 As soon as he finished teaching, he took a cab up to the Harlem School of the Arts, where he and his ensemble, the Cardinal Brass Quintet, played in a WQXR radiothon that helped to raise money for the school and, not incidentally, gave the band some exposure. From there he was off to catch a flight to St. Louis to visit his parents and to play a solo recital.
 
From Bleak to Better
 Mr. du Maine is a freelance musician. Though he has been in New York since 1986, when he arrived from St. Louis to attend Juilliard, he has been freelancing full time only since September. The first month, he said, was pretty bleak. But since then he has worked as a substitute in "Jelly's Last Jam" and "Cats," and made contacts that may lead to subbing jobs in other shows. He played in a jazz band at Tavern on the Green, and he backed the Flying Elephants, a Japanese Beatles-imitation band that played at Carnegie Hall. He did a recording session with Concordia, a chamber orchestra, and symphonic concerts with the Long Island Philharmonic and the Canterbury Choral Society. And he was an onstage trumpeter in "L'Elisir d'Amore" at the Metropolitan Opera.
The degree of style-hopping he does is not atypical for a New York freelancer. When he played in a Mahler Eighth Symphony last month, he knew several musicians in the orchestra from his Broadway gigs. Flexibility is a job requirement and, as Mr. du Maine sees it, variety is a benefit of the freelance life.
 
Competition for Jobs
 For young musicians, New York is a magnet. Night for night, there are far more opportunities to play here than in any other American city. But it is a crowded field. According to statistics maintained by Local 802 of the American Federation of Musicians, the union that regulates musical life in New York City, only 700 musicians have tenured positions with the New York Philharmonic, the orchestras of the Metropolitan Opera and the New York City Opera and a few other permanent ensembles.
About 900 players are listed as classical freelancers, and vie for jobs in everything from ad hoc chamber groups to the orchestras that support choirs and shoestring opera companies, to more prominent ensembles like the Orchestra of St. Luke's, the American Symphony Orchestra, the Brooklyn Philharmonic or the New York Chamber Symphony. The rest of the union's membership of 12,500 specializes in pop.
A recent informal survey by the union showed that a New York freelancer's average income is under $15,000. More specifically, union scale for chamber and symphonic music is $84 for a concert and $40 for a rehearsal. Broadway scale is $110 a night. By contrast, the minimum salaries at the Philharmonic and the Met are from $60,000 to $70,000 a year.
 
What May Ease the Way
 "I came to New York to go to school," Mr. du Maine said, "and while I was at Juilliard, some friends of mine who were freelancing asked me if I was interested in doing some subbing. That's how I made my first contacts. It's much more of a struggle if you come here with nothing, without school, an apartment, a job or any contacts. I would never recommend that someone come here without at least one of those things."
While he says he enjoys the freedom and variety his peripatetic career offers, Mr. du Maine has other aspirations. He dreams of settling into a tenured position with a major orchestra, a post with a salary, benefits and a regular schedule, he said, the kind of job he held after his graduation from Juilliard, but lost. For just over a year he was a co-principal trumpeter in the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. The position opened in April 1991, when one company trumpeter became the personnel manager. Mr. du Maine, who was just about to graduate with his master's degree from Juilliard, won the job in a local audition.
But there was a catch. After a year, the original trumpeter could return. If he decided not to, the position would be open to national auditions. By his own account, Mr. du Maine approached the auditions with an incumbent's security that the position was his, and did not play well. He lost the job.
 
'It Wasn't Too Fun'
 "When my number wasn't called, I walked to my locker at the Met, put my horn away and realized, I don't have a job here anymore," he recalled wistfully. "It wasn't too fun. I was really down. I didn't practice for a while. It was the first time since I was 6 years old that I didn't practice every day. But I didn't panic. I had freelanced before I got the Met job, and I knew that I could do that again. After a month, I said, 'It's time,' and I started making phone calls to let people know I was available."
Mr. du Maine is still beating himself up about this lost opportunity: the poster announcing the audition is taped to his television cabinet, where it reminds him what can happen when he does not play his best.
On the other hand, during his year at the Met, he saved enough money to afford to rent a comfortable one-bedroom apartment within walking distance of Lincoln Center. Having just revived his freelance career, he refuses to guess what his income will be, but he says he can subsidize himself for about two years. He is betting that by then he will either have established a solid freelance career or, better yet, have landed another orchestral position.
 
'What Keeps Me Going'
 "I could save a lot of money by moving out of here, moving uptown to a place where the rent is half of what I pay now, and find a roommate," he said. "If I didn't have the money from the Met job, I'd have to do that. But right now, this is what keeps me going."
After having shared apartments for years, Mr. du Maine has lived alone for the last year and a half, which suits him. He likes to practice in the morning, he said, and dislikes practicing with a mute, which prevents him from working on the subtleties of his tone. His neighbors are usually at work when he plays. He often attends rehearsals in the afternoon, and, of course, performances are at night.
But, Mr. du Maine said, he has kept his schedule from devouring his personal life. He has a girlfriend, but sees her rarely because she lives in Vermont, where she is an administrator at a music festival. He plays basketball when he can, football every Sunday and Monday, and is a member of three softball teams that play in Central Park. He is also what he describes as a "weather freak." When he gets home from concerts, he tunes into the Weather Channel, or watches a videotape of a tornado.
 
Inspiration Behind the Dream
 Mr. du Maine grew up in St. Louis, one of nine children. His father, a disabled Army veteran, insisted that all the children learn the piano as well as a secondary instrument. As a pianist, Mr. du Maine won several local competitions, but he was drawn to the trumpet after hearing Louis Armstrong, and it eventually became his principal interest. When he attended a Wynton Marsalis master class in 1984, he said, Mr. Marsalis told him that if he wanted to make a career, he should study at Juilliard.
Between working as a piano accompanist and delivering pizzas, he saved up the air fare to come to New York to audition, and was given a partial scholarship, as well as a grant from the New York Philharmonic's Music Assistance Fund. He covered the rest of his tuition by taking out loans. Through friends who were already freelancing, Mr. du Maine began freelancing in jazz bands, but gave that up when he found that playing jazz all night took its toll on his early-morning lessons.
He started doing Broadway subbing and orchestral concerts to earn rent money. In 1990, he won his first orchestral post, second trumpet in the Springfield Symphony in Massachusetts. On his first day there, the orchestra voted 70 to 2 to strike (Mr. du Maine, eager to play, was one of the holdouts), but the contract was settled before the walkout.
 
When Practice Doesn't Make Perfect
 There were some early missteps. Once, when a last-minute Juilliard ensemble commitment forced Mr. du Maine to miss a freelance job, the contractor for the professional job struck Mr. du Maine's name from his list and never called him again. And the first time he was hired for a concert conducted by Gerard Schwarz, he was so intent on impressing the conductor -- who had once been a trumpeter -- that he overdid his practicing and could hardly play at concert time.
"Generally, I've gotten work through word of mouth," he said, "through other players who, when the contractors call and say, 'Do you have anyone in mind?,' they say, 'Well, there's this guy named Wayne.' That's usually how it works. I just come in and play, and if the contractor likes the way I play, he keeps me on his list. All you have to do is play as well as you can and keep your mouth shut. That's another thing: I'll never let my mouth get me into trouble. I've seen that happen. They want someone who can play well, and that's as far as it goes. And I always have fun."
What Mr. du Maine has always wanted, though, and what he still wants, is a position in a major orchestra. He has his eye on jobs that are to open up at the Philharmonic, the Met and the Chicago Symphony over the next couple of years, and every month he scans the union newspaper, International Musician, for news of auditions.
"When you're at Juilliard training for an orchestral job," he said, "auditions are your life. They're your main focus. You're in your practice room every day at 8 A.M., working on symphony excerpts. At the auditions themselves, you play for about five minutes, and you're competing against 100 other guys. Most of them are older, and most already have orchestral jobs. There's a lot of pressure, but you can deal with that."
These days, auditions are generally blind: for the early rounds, at least, the musicians play from behind a screen to eliminate the possibility of racial or sexual discrimination. Some orchestras remove the screen for the finals.
 
'So It Still Goes On'
 "I've never felt that I've been discriminated against," Mr. du Maine said, "nor have I felt that I've been chosen because I'm black. Although I've been accused of that. And I have a friend, a horn player, who got a job in Texas through a tape audition in 1987. When he got there and they found out he was black, they sent him home. So it still goes on, no question about it."
Even without worrying about discrimination, though, his life has its insecurities. Most of Mr. du Maine's job calls come within a month of the performance. So even a full date book means he knows what he'll be doing only for the next few weeks. And although he projects an air of confidence and resolve, he notes with muted alarm that the recession and cutbacks in government support for the arts have led some orchestras to give fewer concerts and to play works that require fewer players.
Some of his colleagues supplement their income by working in record stores or in office jobs, but he refuses to do that.
"I've thought about it," he said. "A lot of people do that. But I've always believed that if I had something to fall back on, another way to earn a living, I would do that, and my music would suffer.
 
'It's Not a Stable Life'
 "I know some people who eventually gave up and moved away. One guy was married and had a kid, and wasn't working a lot. He moved to Georgia. I know another who was really struggling for work, and was very down on the freelance life. Eventually, he got a job with the Dallas Brass. He didn't want to go, but now he's having a great time.
"Yeah, it's not a stable life. Especially right now, I'm a sub for 90 percent of the things I do. If someone's sick, or has a conflict, I work. That's hard to count on, but somehow I get called. But I feel I'm in control, and that I'm going uphill. I'm just happy to be playing, to be doing different things. At the moment, that's more important to me than the financial thing."

HEADLINE: Old St. Wapniacl

 BODY:
Now that President-elect Bill Clinton has done the hardest thing, appoint his Cabinet, schoolchildren around the country will be pressed to do the next hardest: remember it -- at least to the extent of remembering the names of all the Cabinet departments. It's an assignment that invites sympathy and assistance.
For decades, students could find comfort in good old St. Wapniacl. That was the mnemonic representing the initials of the then 10 departments: State, Treasury, War, Attorney General, Post Office, Navy, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce and Labor. But the last four decades have seen endless churning in the makeup of the President's Cabinet. War and Navy were combined into Defense. Post Office fell out of the Cabinet. And six new Cabinet agencies have been created. 
 A refined mnemonic is available, one that has the added virtue of giving the departments in the correct order of their creation:
See The Dog Jump In A Circle. Leave Her Home To Entertain Educated Vets.
That is, State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Interior, Agriculture, Commerce, Labor, Health and Human Services, Housing and Urban Development, Transportation, Energy, Education and Veterans Affairs.
On reflection, by filling all 14 jobs, plus a few others designated as of Cabinet rank, the President-elect has not done the hardest thing. That would be to cut the Cabinet. He'd be more likely to get efficient government from six or seven superagencies than from this collection of surrenders to interest groups eager to wield inside influence.
Consider a roster along these lines -- State, Treasury, Defense, Justice, Human Services, Natural Resources and Economic Development. That could, with or without a mnemonic, make a Cabinet worth remembering.

HEADLINE: On Health Care Reform;
Managed Competition Is Good Diagnosis

 BODY:
To the Editor:
"Suddenly, Momentum for Health" (editorial, Dec. 10) implies that the American Medical Association just entered the health care reform debate. That does not square with the facts. The A.M.A. began its campaign to assure access to affordable care for all Americans in March 1990. 
 That plan, Health Access America, favors patients' choice of health plans, greater cost-consciousness by patients, broadened access and economic competition to promote efficiency. Ours was the first major health organization to call for mandated employer health insurance.
The A.M.A. supports the concept of managed competition if certain criteria are met, including patient choice of physician and physicians' ability to determine their practice arrangement.
Health system reform should also provide a level playing field. If any of the delivery options are given unfair tax advantages, for example, managed competition becomes "mismanaged" competition.
Some managed-competition supporters hope to control costs by concentrating purchasing power in large health insurance networks. These networks must not become faceless giants with the power to impose their will on patients and physicians. Physicians must retain their traditional role as patient advocate. This can be accomplished by assuring physicians the authority to negotiate contractual terms with the insurance networks on the arrangements under which they deliver care and are then paid.
The A.M.A. agrees with your previously stated position that global budgets are inappropriate. We believe that they are fundamentally in conflict with managed competition.
The cost problem can be addressed through reforms that should be part of any new system. These include stressing cost-effective health treatments, lowering administrative costs, enacting professional liability reforms and helping patients be more responsible for their own health care.
The American Medical Association is very encouraged for our patients' sake that health care reform is finally receiving the priority it deserves.

HEADLINE: 'Let's Do Lunch,' Clinton Says, Calculatingly

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Clearly convinced that his forays into McDonald's are not enough, and mindful that Washington is perceived as short on ordinary Americans, President-elect Bill Clinton plans to go all out to show that his will be an Administration of and for the common people. He is shipping them to Washington for lunch.
Inaugural officials said today that they would fly more than 50 people here for what is billed as an "intimate" lunch. Actually, the expense-paid trip for people whom Mr. Clinton or Vice President-elect Al Gore or their spouses met during the campaign will last a week and include admission to all the major inaugural events. The trip will cost more that $500,000 and is being paid by the inauguration committee. 
 Hardly a random sample of America, the guest list appears to be as calculated as the diverse group invited to Mr. Clinton's last event where he mingled with the people: the economic conference in Little Rock, Ark. The guests, from veterans and teachersto preachers and people whose children have mental disorders, were painstakingly picked to make political points.
The guest lists even includes two former Los Angeles gang members who now run a youth organization; Charles Rachael is a former member of the Crips and Leon Gullette is a former member of the rival Bloods.
Also invited are Louise and Clifford Ray, whose 15-year-old son, Ricky, died of AIDS two weeks ago. Ricky's two younger brothers, Robert, 14, and Randy, 13, who both carry the virus that causes AIDS, will also attend the week of activities. The hemophiliac brothers were believed to have been infected by blood transfusions.
Other guests include Patrick Murphy, a disabled Vietnam veteran from Las Vegas, Nev.; Danny Kronenfeld, who runs the Henry Street Settlement, a neighborhood outreach program, on the Lower East Side of Manhattan; Peter Madonia, a baker from the Bronx; Michael A. Quercio, a teacher in Boston who has AIDS; Frank Henderson, a former timber worker from Pleasant Hill, Ore.; Mary Poldruhi, who runs a pirogi shop in Parma, Ohio; Ollie McLemore, an elementary school principal on the South Side of Chicago, and Demitrios Theosanis, a hotel worker in Manhattan.
While Mr. Clinton is not inviting his guests to the Georgetown parlor of Pamela Harriman, who will be the host of the "A" list dinner parties for Democrats, these guests and their families will not be dining on burgers and fries either: Their lunch with the Clintons and Gores, on Jan. 18, will be at the Folger Shakespeare Library.
Mr. Clinton's aides said the lunch was the President-elect's idea, and they vigorously denied that it was a political stunt reminiscent of President Bush's "points of light." The inaugural officials are calling the guests "Faces of Hope."
Richard Mintz, press secretary for the inauguration, referred to the guests as if they were senior Presidential appointees. "This is not some contrived event to connect him with the people," he said. "He feels very comfortable with these people and wants them to be part of his Administration."
Rahm Emanuel, the co-executive director of the inauguration, put it this way: "It's not just a stop by. They are very much a part of the Governor's efforts at renewal of this country."
The guest list was arrived at after an initial list of more than 300 people was culled to those with the most compelling stories. It includes representatives from every region and every ethnic and religious background. Some of the guests were often mentioned in campaign speeches by Mr. Clinton.
Besides demonstrating his ties to ordinary Americans, the importing of people to Washington appeared to be an effort by Mr. Clinton to temper the ostentatiousness of inaugural week during a time of economic distress.
 
'I Called Him Bill'
 To the delight of the public, and the frustration of his aides, Mr. Clinton was often late to events during the campaign because he enjoyed hanging around to chat with people. Some of those people hope to continue their conversations with him in Washington.
Mr. Quercio, the teacher who has AIDS, said he introduced himself to Mr. Clinton at a fund-raising dinner in October in Boston and was surprised that Mr. Clinton was interested in hearing about how he was coping with the illness.
"Of all things, I called him Bill," recalled Mr. Quercio, 32. "We were in a room full of people clamoring to be close to him and he held my hand for four or five minutes and never took his eyes off me. I think it's really ironic that I've never been in Washington before to consider that my first visit is one in which I'll be honored by the President-elect."
Another emotional moment was described by Mr. Murphy, the Vietnam veteran, who recounted his conversation with Mr. Clinton about the high suicide rate of veterans. "His eyes were glassed over and he started to choke up and he hugged me three times," Mr. Murphy recalled. "Three days later he wrote me and said it was one of the most emotional moments of the campaign."
Mr. Henderson said Mr. Clinton was riveted when he told him how he had been laid off from the timber industry in Oregon, went through a retraining program and opened a plastics welding business.
"He was really interested in thermoplastic welding," Mr. Henderson said. "He had never heard of it before. I went with the kids back to his hotel and I probably talked to him off and on for three and a half hours."
Ms. Poldruhi, who runs the pirogi shop, said she expected to talk at length with Mr. Clinton about the plight of small businesses, and with Mr. Gore about the environment. She also made the point that her trip to Washington would have emotional and financial rewards.
"Our business picked up dramatically since Clinton visited here on the bus tour," she said, adding that she expected more attention after her visit to Washington. "A little 30-second spot on the news does wonders for a small business."

HEADLINE: Rise of Militants Seen in Algeria As Junta Falters

BYLINE: By CHRIS HEDGES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALGIERS, Dec. 24

 BODY:
Almost a year after it took power in a coup, the military-backed Government of Algeria is facing a declining economy, deepening public resentment and mounting armed attacks by Islamic militants, and many Western diplomats here expect it to fall within a year in favor of an Islamic government.
The Algerian crisis is now the most pressing concern of Western diplomats in the region, especially those from France, which has a large Algerian population and might have to absorb waves of immigrants fleeing an Islamic state. But the diplomats' longer-term concern is for an Algerian fundamentalist government's influence in nearby countries of North Africa, including the West's biggest Arab ally, Egypt.
 
'A Catalytic Effect' Is Feared
 "When Iran became an Islamic state it shook the Arab world, even though Iran is Persian and its rulers are Shiite rather than mainstream Sunni Muslims," a senior Western diplomat said. "If Algeria is handed over to the fundamentalists it could have a catalytic effect in the region, much as we saw with the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe." 
 Most Western governments, including the United States, are said to hope that by refusing to lend significant backing to the tottering Algerian junta they can moderate the severity of the Islamic government that may follow. Some diplomats said they hoped for the emergence of some kind of coalition between the army, Algeria's traditional arbiter of power, and the militants.
"We must begin to have a dialogue with the fundamentalist movements throughout the region, as unpleasant as many of us find the task, because it is they who seem set to inherit power," a European diplomat said.
 
Possible Role for Christopher
 One of those who may join such a dialogue is Warren M. Christopher, President-elect Bill Clinton's designate for Secretary of State, who worked closely with the Algerian authorities in 1980 and 1981 in the Algiers-mediated negotiations for the release of American hostages taken at the American Embassy in Teheran.
But Egyptian, Syrian, Moroccan and Tunisian officials, fearful that their own fundamentalist movements will receive a significant boost from the creation of an Islamic state in Algeria, are doing their best to shore up the junta. The Egyptian authorities, who work closely with the Algerian security forces, are shipping in Muslim clerics to try to challenge the militants on theological grounds.
It would appear, however, that Algerians' widespread dissatisfaction with their Government is rooted in economics, and that the fundamentalists' appeal among Algeria's urban, secularized majority lies more in their reputation for incorruptibility than in their religious conviction.
Government officials in Algeria believe that if they can crush the Islamic movement and ram through economic austerity measures, they can regain control of the country. The Government has promised presidential elections by the end of 1993.
"The crux of the problem is economic," said Abdel Hamid Chebchoub, a Foreign Ministry official. "Once we help the young people find work and bring down the cost of living the situation will be different."
But opposition leaders say that few Algerians are in the mood to make further sacrifices, especially as the Government has moved to reverse some of the market-oriented policies introduced by its predecessor and has failed to tackle what many Algerians believe is widespread corruption within the Government.
"No one recognizes the legitimacy of this regime and no one is going to endure an economic austerity program imposed by these officials," said Mohammed Cherifi, a former Minister of Trade. "If we do not get some kind of representative government very soon we will face chaos."
Salaries are ravaged by a 40 percent inflation rate and unemployment is well above 20 percent, with about half of the labor force underemployed. Lacking spare parts and foreign exchange to import raw materials, the state enterprises that formed the backbone of the centralized economy operate at 50 percent capacity. Many companies are unable to pay workers on time and there have been numerous strikes.
The lifting of food subsidies this summer has doubled the cost of many basic commodities, and the housing shortage is so pronounced that dozens of people often share a single apartment.
 
22 People in 3 Rooms
 Fatma Bouallaga stood on a small balcony perched over the crumbling houses that pack the slopes of the Casbah in central Algiers. Along with her husband and nine children, she shares three tiny rooms with her brother-in-law's family. The 22 occupants have no place for bathing and barely enough room to lie down and sleep.
"We have written many letters and asked for our own apartment," she said, "but all we hear are empty promises."
The junta, backed by the military, seized power in a coup in January that forced out President Chadli Benjedid. Mr. Benjedid promoted democratic policies that led to the country's first free elections a year ago.
The elections appeared set to give the militant Islamic Salvation Front an overwhelming majority in the Algerian Parliament. The Islamic Front won 188 of the 231 seats decided in the first round of the voting in December 1991. But the second and decisive round of the elections, scheduled for January, was canceled after the coup, and the the first-round results were thrown out.
The Islamic Front, known by its French acronym, F.I.S., calls for an Islamic state that would reject the political and cultural values of the West. It was outlawed in March and driven underground by the five-man junta known as the High State Council that has ruled the country since the coup. The junta declared a state of emergency in February.
The Government of Prime Minister Belaid Abdessalam has overseen the dismantling of virtually every public, charity, business or private entity with connections to the Islamic Front, including as many as 200 municipal councils controlled by the fundamentalists.
The Islamic movement, denied power through the ballot box, has mounted an armed revolt against the Government with, Western diplomats contend, significant help from some supporters inside the armed forces. The Government plans to try 90 army officials on charges of handing over arms and intelligence to the fundamentalists.
 
More Militancy Is Seen
 The suppression of the political wing of the movement has altered the leadership within the Islamic Front, political analysts said.
"The refusal to allow the F.I.S. to achieve power through legitimate means has driven the more moderate Islamic leaders to the sidelines and radicalized the movement," one former Government minister said.
One militant leader, interviewed in an idling car in a back street in the Kouba neighborhood, said: "We operate in tiny cells now. I only deal directly with two other people, so if I am caught and tortured they can't get much from me. I have no idea where our leaders are. I just receive my orders and carry them out."
In August Islamic militants, in the deadliest attack in Algeria since its war of independence against the French, were blamed for a bomb blast at the airport that killed nine people and injured scores more. Six policemen were killed in an ambush in Algiers the other day.
In response, the authorities are increasingly turning to raw force to maintain control.
 
Curfew in the Capital
 The Government imposed a 10:30-P.M.-to-5-A.M. curfew on Algiers and six nearby districts two weeks ago. It has instituted secret courts to try those suspected of being involved in terrorist attacks and amended laws to sentence minors to death if they are convicted of belonging to an armed underground group. The junta has shipped at least 9,000 suspected militants to remote camps in the Sahara. Some half-dozen newspapers have been shut down, and all political activity has been banned.
New restrictions, including the recent decision ago to close Muslim prayer rooms in schools, offices and factories, are issued each week. The state-controlled television has stopped broadcasting sounds from crowds at soccer matches because of the frequent anti-Government chanting.
On Wednesday, the Prime Minister promised security forces more equipment and dismissed the possibility of any compromise with what he called "subversive forces working for the destruction of Algeria."
The Government makes little attempt to hide the severity of the conflict. Bands of riot police officers, their faces covered by balaclava hoods to avoid identification, race through the streets in caravans, the black snouts of their shotguns and Kalashnikov assault rifles protruding from the windows. Gunfire echoes across the capital each evening and shoot-outs are common even in the center of the city.
The Government says about 200 police and army officials have been killed this year, but Western diplomats say the number is at least twice that.

HEADLINE: New Jobs Depend on Fast Economic Growth, Experts Say

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The recession is officially over, but the American economy will have to grow more than 3 percent a year -- perhaps much more -- to stop the kind of mass layoffs that have taken place in recent months and to create enough new jobs to employ most of the people who want to work.
That is the almost unanimous view of more than a dozen economists, labor experts and business executives interviewed recently. Most are doubtful that the economy can expand so robustly on its own -- achieving a growth rate that almost doubles the average performance since 1988 -- without some significant Government spending. 
 "During previous recoveries, you needed only enough economic growth for companies to justify hiring back laid-off workers," said Robert B. Reich, the Harvard teacher who is President-elect Bill Clinton's Secretary of Labor-designate and also the chief of his economics team during the transition period. "But this time, jobs were abolished and people have to find work in new fields. You are talking about very strong economic growth for this to happen."
For three decades, economists generally held to the rule that an annual growth rate of 2.5 to 3 percent for the American economy was sufficient to absorb nearly everyone seeking jobs and thus keep the unemployment rate steady. But now, with companies shrinking staffs and reorganizing to become more competitive, economists think it will require more growth -- perhaps more than 3.5 percent on average over the next two or three years -- to maintain the same equilibrium.
The leading military contractors alone are laying off 10,000 workers a month, the Labor Department reports, and thousands of relatively well-paying jobs are disappearing at companies like General Motors and I.B.M., which are bent on cutting labor costs as sales decline. Given such pressures, without strong expansion, the unemployment rate, now 7.2 percent, could rise.
"We need for the economy to grow between 3 percent and 4 percent a year just to get job creation moving in the right direction, and we need 4 percent growth to feel good about jobs," said Alan Blinder, a Princeton University economist who presented his views to the President-elect during his economic conference in Little Rock this month.
The third-quarter surge in economic growth to 3.4 percent -- a level last reached in 1988 -- did, in fact, generate a spurt in new jobs in November, bolstering the view among economists and labor experts that this might be the proper growth goal. But the 50 forecasters polled monthly by Blue Chip Economic Indicators, a newsletter, believe that growth will fall below 3 percent by early next year.
Whatever the future holds, more than 3 percent annual economic growth is emerging as the benchmark in a national debate over whether the Clinton Administration or the Federal Reserve should step in to help the economy -- if growth falls below 3 percent.
 
 
Framing the Debate
 "The numerous layoffs are undoubtedly making companies more efficient," said Robert Hall, a Stanford University economist. "But increasing productivity in this fashion is not a socially desirable thing unless we can put those laid off back to work."
Given that goal, the debate is being framed in these terms: If the nation's corporations and consumers become in effect energetic enough to make the American economy expand by more than 3 percent, then proposals for a special Government stimulus -- more public works spending or new tax credits or pressure on the Federal Reserve to once again lower interest rates -- are likely to be postponed or dropped.
But if economic growth falls below the goal of more than 3 percent, then the Clinton Administration is likely to act. Mr. Reich said Mr. Clinton would wait at least until late January to make a judgment.
The mathematics that make more than 3 percent the benchmark are plain enough. The rate at which people are entering the labor force, to seek jobs, is now growing at about 1.2 million people a year, or 1 percent of the 108 million people with jobs, the Labor Department reports. So the economy, in response, has to grow by at least 1 percent to absorb them. More precisely, the national output, as measured by the gross domestic product, has to rise by this amount. The G.D.P. measures the wealth generated by Americans producing the nation's goods and services.
The greater the rise in the G.D.P., the greater the number of workers needed to produce goods like autos and toys and services like retailing and accounting -- with one caveat. If companies find ways to increase the output of each worker, then they do not have to hire more people to make the G.D.P. grow. And recently, Corporate America has made huge strides in improving worker productivity.
The Labor Department, which measures worker output, reports that the productivity of American workers has risen at an annual rate of 2.7 percent over the last year. The G.D.P. in effect has to grow by more than this amount to begin putting the jobholders displaced by this productivity improvement back to work. And it has to grow an additional 1 percent a year, or a total of 3.7 percent, to also employ the new people entering the labor force.
 
 
Millions of Others
 The Labor Department, in addition, lists roughly 16 million people who are in effect stockpiled from past layoffs and job cuts. This group includes the nation's nine million unemployed who are actively hunting or jobs; more than one million others who have become too discouraged to look, although they say that they want jobs, and six million people who have settled for part-time work, although they want to work full-time.
Putting them back to work requires an even higher growth rate for the G.D.P., one that would create more than 240,000 jobs a month, economists say. By comparison, the November surge -- the strongest in months -- produced 105,000 new jobs.
"If you could promise me a 4 percent growth rate through 1993, I would be less worried," said Robert M. Solow of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, a Nobel laureate in economics who favors $50 billion in additional public works spending during each of the next two years, to help achieve this level.
Rapid growth in productivity is not uncommon in the months immediately after a recession. But this time, the current 2.7 percent improvement rate is considered likely to continue, rather than to fall back to a lower level.
In the past, rising sales during a recovery have made companies less concerned about holding down labor costs, but this time productivity improvement, mostly through layoffs and attrition, have endured for an unusually long period. The recession ended in March 1991, nearly two years ago, according to the findings last week of a committee of prominent economists that acts as the arbiter for the nation on these matters.
 
 
Productivity Keeps Improving
 During past recoveries, productivity gains had peaked by this point in the recovery, and were tapering off. But through this year's third quarter productivity was still improving. That is largely because American companies seem determined to operate with a minimum number of employees.
"There is no doubt that an unusual improvement in productivity is an important reason why the economy has grown since March 1991 and the national output has risen with hardly any increase in employment," said Mr. Hall, who heads the committee of economists that dates recessions for the record books.
Various reasons are offered for the reluctance to hire. One is the smaller number of new workers in the post-Baby Boom era, a circumstance that encourages corporations to make each available worker produce more. Another is what Frank Levy, a labor economist at M.I.T., calls the tendency of corporate executives to imitate one another. "When companies see that other companies are cutting back their payrolls, they think that they should do so, too," Mr. Levy said. "Shrinking the staff has become something to be proud of."
Whatever the motives, new hiring in recent months often takes place only at companies where sales have been unusually strong and the company cannot get by without more help. That resistance to hiring has reinforced the view of Mr. Reich and others that the national economy, in similar fashion, will have to grow more strongly than in the past to get Corporate America to create more jobs than it eliminates.
"We do not have historical examples that precisely fit our present situation, and it is hard to know how much economic growth we need to create jobs," Mr. Reich said.
 
 
'Trying to Keep Lean'
 Among retailers, for example, J. C. Penney & Company, the nationwide department store chain, reports that sales have risen by 15 percent over the last year, even after adjustments for inflation. "We have been trying to keep lean," said Ira Silver, the company's chief economist.
But after cutting the work force to 185,000 last year from 200,000 in the late 1980's, Penney's booming sales prompted it to hire 5,000 people this year. That increased the work force by a meager 2.7 percent. In the past, similar sales booms inspired retailers like Penney to hire more people.
Similarly, the Dr. Pepper-Seven Up Companies, which manufactures the concentrates for the two soft drinks, reports that sales revenue is rising more than 6 percent a year, far greater than the economy as a whole. And after automating many operations and cutting the staff from 1,200 in the 1980's to fewer than 900, steady growth in sales forced the company to begin hiring three years ago. The staff numbers 980 today.
"We run a tight company; we don't have excess," said John R. Albers, the chairman. "I believe that many companies still have two or three layers of management that they do not need."

HEADLINE: The Neediest Is Lending Hand to Family

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD J. LEVY

 BODY:
Victoria and Alan H. go to sleep many nights ashamed of how they are raising their three young daughters. They wish they could nurture the girls by helping them with homework, taking them to museums or pushing them on the swings at the playground. Instead, the girls are often forgotten.
That is because the girls' parents spend nearly all their time caring for their eldest child, a 10-year-old son who is emotionally disturbed. The boy often wanders through their apartment in Brooklyn disconnected from reality and unresponsive to other family members. He smears food on his clothes, is agitated easily and sometimes runs away. Numerous doctors have been unable to treat him. 
"Every little thing bothers him," Victoria said. "Two nights ago, the neighbors were walking upstairs and he heard footsteps. He was so frightened that he couldn't go to sleep and he kept me up until 2 A.M."
 
Time for Herself
 She became so tired and overwhelmed that she cried nearly every day until she began seeing a social worker from the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services. The board is financed by United Jewish Appeal-Federation of Jewish Philanthropies of New York, one of seven charities aided by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
At their first session, the social worker asked Victoria a simple question: "Do you have any time for yourself?" When she said no, the social worker arranged for an attendant to visit her home every few weeks to take care of the children so she could relax for a few hours.
The assistance provided by Mishkon, an agency of the Jewish Board, also helped Victoria cope with worries about the family's finances. Victoria does not work. Because of cutbacks, Alan may lose his job as a teacher next week, further straining a budget that was already drained by doctor bills.
 
'We Are Praying'
 The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund has come to the aid of families in crisis since the early years of this century. The fund is now conducting its 81st appeal at a time when charities across New York City must meet growing responsibilities. The Neediest charities help New Yorkers like Alan and Victoria as well as people who are for the first time in their lives facing unemployment, homelessness or illnesses.
The Times pays for the fund's overhead, so all contributions go directly to the charities. This year's campaign ends on Feb. 28.
Because of Mishkon, Victoria and Alan now have the energy to spend more time with their daughters. They can sit down at night and read stories to the girls or quiz them on their math tables. And Victoria is more hopeful about finding treatment that will ease her son's isolation.
"We are praying," she said. "We have to give him a chance. Many people say we should put him in an institution. But he is a child with a soul and the intelligence is there. He has sisters who love him and he brings joy into the house."

Shrinking Goals For Aid to Russia

BYLINE: By Louis Uchitelle

 BODY:
WITH Yegor T. Gaidar ousted as Russia's economics czar, American experts on Russia are going through a sometimes angry post-mortem: if the Western industrial nations had underwritten Mr. Gaidar's efforts with $24 billion in loans, would he still be in power today, hastening Russia toward a market economy? Maybe, but not for many more weeks. With or without Western money, his days seemed numbered.
Gradually most of the American experts are concluding that the West cannot buy a Western version of capitalism for Russia, although the United States and the other industrial nations spent 1992 trying to do so. Huge loans were offered, but only if Russia agreed to obey Western rules for building a market system as rapidly as possible. Mr. Gaidar agreed, but failed to rescue the economy. And Western loans to Russia in 1993, if any are made, are likely to have more modest goals. 
 "The prospect of aid was dangled before Mr. Gaidar and his team, and they spent all their time trying to pry the money from the West," Steve Hanke, a Johns Hopkins economist and Russia expert, said. "But huge loans are not a necessary condition for economic transformation."
The new approach pops up frequently in interviews. Marshall Goldman, associate director of the Russian Research Center at Harvard, for example, would channel money to privately owned enterprises that appear to be thriving. Such new enterprises are numerous in the Russian Far East.
Similarly, some regions in Russia are moving more quickly toward market economies than Russia as a whole, and that makes them deserving of Western loans, says Robert Hormats, a vice president at Goldman, Sachs & Company. Anthony Solomon, chairman of the economics program at the Institute of East-West Studies, would concentrate on technical assistance for key sectors, like oil and agriculture. "This is all we can do for a while," Mr. Solomon said.
What diffidence compared with last spring. Then the view was that without Western money, the emerging market economy would collapse and Russia would backslide into socialist central planning. To prevent this, the West urged President Boris N. Yeltsin's Government to agree quickly to the West's rules for the transition to capitalism. The International Monetary Fund, acting as agent for the West, would endorse $24 billion in loans, but only if Russia carried out sweeping reforms.
To strengthen the ruble, for example, the Yeltsin Government would have had to gain control over lending in the other former Soviet republics that use the ruble as their currency. And the Yeltsin Government would also have had to cut off subsidies to inefficient state companies, in the process putting millions out of work.
That was beyond the power of Mr. Yeltsin's economics team, headed by Mr. Gaidar. The managers of the state companies, well represented in Parliament, demanded Mr. Gaidar's ouster; faced with this challenge, the Gaidar team offered a new reason for quick delivery of $24 billion in loans. Without the Western money, Mr. Gaidar could fall and the transition could founder.
No Westerner made this case with greater conviction than Jeffrey Sachs, a Harvard economist who was Mr. Gaidar's most prominent foreign adviser. And now that Mr. Gaidar is gone, Mr. Sachs is predicting that the new Prime Minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, will backtrack on capitalism -- a view not shared by many other Russia experts. Mr. Sachs also attacks the I.M.F. for insisting that Russia has actually received $18 billion of the promised $24 billion. "They are pathetic," Mr. Sachs said of the I.M.F. "There is a pathetic need for self-justification."
Mr. Sachs asserts, and the I.M.F. agrees, that half of the $18 billion was in bilateral trade credits, to buy grain and other products. Nearly $4 billion more was German loans to build housing in Russia for Russian troops returning from East Germany. The Russians also were permitted to postpone a $2.5 billion interest payment on an earlier debt. The rest is $670 million in World Bank loans not yet distributed and a $1 billion I.M.F. loan that the I.M.F. has not allowed the Russians to spend.
 "There is no guts in this lending; no concept of using it to encourage reform," Mr. Sachs said. Most important, the West did not provide a $6 billion stabilization fund that the Russians could use to buy rubles and thus strengthen the currency. Without a strong ruble, a rapid transition to capitalism is not possible, Mr. Sachs maintains.
But rapid transition is no longer the Western model. The new approach appears to be flexibility in lending, with the I.M.F. perhaps shunted aside. For example, Stanley Fischer, a former chief economist at the World Bank, would send to Russia a prominent Westerner, like Paul A. Volcker, former chairman of the Federal Reserve, and give him the authority to disburse $20 billion a year in loans. "He would sit down with the Russians to help them do the best job that they can do," he said.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
For a Fee, an Old Friend for a Day

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: SUMMIT N.J.

 BODY:
HAROLD ADER was not one to trust in doctors. Sure, he had stomach troubles. But he could still drive a concrete truck. Even after his retirement, when inactivity made the illness seem worse, he refused to see a doctor -- until the day before he died of colon cancer last April.
"After the funeral," said Anna Ader, his wife of 35 years, "I started to feel the walls closing in." 
 About the same time nearby, Elizabeth Zielenbach had the same feeling. She was 90 years old, living alone and blind, also depressed.
Now, through an unusual program promoting elderly companionship, the two women from opposite sides of the tracks have become fast friends, spending one day a week together, talking, walking, listening, eating and sharing the written word.
This morning at 9:30 sharp, the 74-year-old Mrs. Ader will park her '83 Mercury with the disobedient gas pedal, stride briskly up the walk to Miss Zielenbach's house, walk in without knocking and set about having -- and giving -- a nice day. "I really look forward to Tuesday," they both said.
It's one measure of the subterranean changes afoot within the once tight-knit structure of now far-flung American families that some elderly people must hire friends to combat the emotional virus of social isolation. An increasing number have no family nearby. Isolated, with little outside contact save mind-numbing TV fare, their interests wither, along with physical activity and their taste for preparing and eating healthy meals, a lethal physical-psychological combination.
"Many elderly don't need full-time care," said Susan Brady, a spokeswoman for SAGE, the Summit-Area Association for Gerontological Endeavors. "They're healthy. But they're lonely. You'd be amazed at the power of a touch, a joke or a walk with someone. Most of us take such things for granted."
For almost 40 years SAGE, a private, nonprofit group founded here by seniors impatient with missing government services, has offered help, first through visiting-home nurses, then Meals on Wheels, an adult day-care center and, since September, a home companion program.
Elderly people in Summit, Springfield, Short Hills, New Providence, Millburn and Chatham can hire visitors for occasional afternoons, mornings or regularly all day, as Miss Zielenbach does. The companion receives $6 of the $10.50 hourly charge. Last week six SAGE companions clocked 72 hours of visiting. "People want more companionship around the holidays," Ms. Brady added.
"I enjoy the work," says Mrs. Ader. "It gets me out with people. Actually, it isn't work."
On her days alone, Miss Zielenbach tends to stay in pajamas close to bed. "I don't like to move around," she explains, "I'm afraid of breaking things. Or falling." But Mrs. Ader allows no such dawdling. It's get up, get dressed, a light breakfast, chatting all the time, followed by several slow laps, arm in arm, from the living room into the dining room, the kitchen and back around.
"In the spring," says Mrs. Ader, "we'll walk in the garden sun." Miss Zielenbach mentions that she hasn't been thinking much past each afternoon.
There may be a doctor to visit, phone calls to take, soap operas to mock. But Miss Zielenbach doesn't like hearing the news anymore. "It's nothing but conflict," she complains, "fighting, fighting, fighting everywhere. I don't know why we care for the hungry so far away with our own right here in New York and Kentucky."
Mrs. Ader agrees.
For 40 years Miss Zielenbach taught home economics in Elizabeth high schools. She wonders how "my children" are doing now, probably with their own families. "And I miss my reading so much," she says. Several operations stalled her glaucoma, but eight years ago total blindness hit.
"I can only imagine what today's fashions look like," she says. Mrs. Ader describes some, adding that she makes all her own clothes.
"You, too?" says Miss Zielenbach, suddenly engaged. "I used to make everything." Mrs. Ader encourages her to knit again. "Years ago I did that needlepoint family tree on the wall behind me somewhere."
"It's beautiful," Mrs. Ader says.
The women share their losses. "Harold was in the hospital only 24 hours," Mrs. Ader says. "And I got 12 different doctor bills. How can so many doctors get in a tiny room in such a short time?"
Miss Zielenbach shakes her head.
"He was a good man," Mrs. Ader adds. "Stubborn, but good. I could have used more years with him."
Sometimes, they share silence and Miss Zielenbach nods off. They share lunch. They discuss God. Mrs. Ader is a devout Baptist; she thinks there's a reason for her being alone. Miss Zielenbach is a Catholic with doubts.
Some Tuesdays Mrs. Ader reads the morning newspaper aloud, not news stories but the occasional feature about admirable people who cope.
Have a nice day, ladies.

U.S. Bonds Fall in Light Trading

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Treasury bond and note prices declined yesterday in very light trading.
Combined with smaller falls at the end of last week, investors have given up most of the gains that drove the yield on the 30-year bond down to 7.34 percent last Tuesday. 
 These kinds of volatile moves are not unusual at the end of the year or in other periods when trading volume is below normal and investors are waiting for some more definitive news so they can decide what direction interest rates should take.
There was no economic news yesterday to guide the market, and analysts said there was no point trying to read anything into the day's decline.
"It is hard to read this as bearish," said Peter McTeague, a fixed-income analyst at Technical Data in Boston, referring to the price decline in the market yesterday. "So maybe we should dismiss all the bullish talk of last week," when prices were rising with little apparent reason, he added.
But as Bill Clinton's inauguration approaches and the President-elect puts his economic proposals on the table, investors and traders will begin to get the kind of information they need to decide whether long-term interest rates should be moving down or up.
In late trading in the secondary market, the price of the 7.625 percent 30-year bond was off 15/32 , to yield 7.40, up from 7.36 percent on Thursday. The prices of notes also declined, with the 10-year note down 10/32 , to yield 6.71 percent, compared with 6.67 percent on Thursday.
The discount rates on Treasury bills rose, with the one-year note up 3 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 3.48 percent.
At the weekly auction of three- and six-month Treasury bills, the three-month bill was sold at an average discount rate of 3.22 percent, up from 3.16 percent a week ago. The average rate for the six-month note was 3.38 percent, the same as a week ago.
Traders said the 6 percent five-year note of December 1997 that was auctioned last week was under extra selling pressure. But Mr. McTeague said it appeared that the buyers of the five-year note were still willing to hold on until trading gets in full swing again in January.
On the day, the price of the five-year note was down 5/32 . to yield 6.06 percent, up from 6.02 percent at the end of last week. The note was auctioned at a single price of 6.03 percent.
 
Year-End Pressures

There were more indications yesterday that a jump in overnight interest rates at the end of the year may not be a problem.
The fact that the last trading day of the year is on Thursday means that dealers, banks and investment banks have to do end-of-the-year borrowing over the four days between the end of trading on Thursday and the resumption next Monday. This raised the fear that there might be such a demand for funds over the four days -- or "the turn" -- that short-term interest rates would skyrocket. Such a squeeze on borrowers helped send the Federal funds rate on overnight borrowing to 100 percent near the end of December in 1990.
But yesterday the Federal Reserve helped calm fears by doing a seven-day repurchase agreement with bond dealers, which was a way for the central bank to assure managers that plently of funds would be available for the four-day weekend.
Louis Crandall, chief economist for R. H. Wrightson & Associates, said he and many other analysts had expected the Fed to do a three-day repurchase, which would not have bridged the year-end turn.
Mr. Crandal also said that "a lot of people seemed to have done their financing well in advance" because of the concern about getting caught.
Although he warned that the year-end market could still be a little tight, he said, "the risks of a really bad year-end have been subsiding."
Following are the results from the Treasury auction yesterday of three-month and six-month bills:

HEADLINE: Japan's Trade Surplus Set Record High for November

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 28

 BODY:
Japan's trade surplus grew nearly 50 percent in November from a year earlier, the Government said today, and economists predicted that the gap would continue to widen as long as an economic slowdown suppressed imports.
The Ministry of Finance said Japan's $10.45 billion surplus in the current account -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and services -- was the largest ever for the month of November, although still below the record $13.80 billion set last March. In November 1991, the surplus was $7.05 billion. 
 The expansion in the current account surplus reflected a jump in both the trade surplus in goods and the surplus in "invisibles," or services, a ministry official told reporters.
Japan's trade surplus in goods widened to $9.65 billion in November from $8.46 billion a year ago, but decreased from $13.05 billion in October, the ministry said.
Japan exported $26.49 billion worth of goods in November, up seven-tenths of 1 percent from the corresponding month the year before. Japan's import bill was worth $16.83 billion in November, down 5.7 percent from a year earlier.
Trade in invisible items, or services, turned to a $1.15 billion surplus in November for the first surplus since March, the ministry official said. This was because Japanese banks improved their position by paying less interest abroad, while creditor banks here received large payments from debtor nations like Brazil, he said.
In addition, fewer Japanese traveled abroad, narrowing the deficit in the tourism account, he said.
The growing surplus is expected to be the subject of continuing attacks by other countries, especially the United States.
Economists agreed, however, that the current account surplus would keep widening until Japan's economy recovers and the country's domestic demand and imports pick up. They see that happening only in the latter half of 1993 at the earliest.
The Government recently revised downward its estimate of Japan's economic growth for the current fiscal year to 1.6 percent from its earlier forecast of 3.5 percent.

HEADLINE: Big Science Squeezes Small-Scale Researchers

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
THE nation's top Federal agency for the support of basic scientific research is battling to reconcile the growing financial appetite of its biggest project with an overall budget crunch. The conflict is threatening to pull the plug on more than a hundred small-scale science projects across the country.
"People here are in great pain," said Dr. Stuart A. Rice, dean of physical sciences at the University of Chicago. "Really senior people are having their grants cut." 
 If the big project, a device intended to observe gravity waves, goes through and there are further reductions in smaller projects as a result, "it will be a calamity," he said.
The $230 million device, the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory, or LIGO (pronounced LIE-go), is being constructed by the National Science Foundation, the Government's main agency for the financial support of general science.
Similar clashes between big and small science are likely to bedevil the incoming Clinton Administration as it seeks to invigorate the nation's research base while keeping pledges to build large scientific instruments costing tens of billions of dollars.
The observatory's goal is to find waves of gravity thought to be rippling through the space-time fabric from such cosmic cataclysms as the collisions of black holes, stars so dense that light cannot escape their gravitational grip. The endeavor is widely seen by scientists as exciting and worthy of pursuit. Gravity waves, predicted some 80 years ago by Einstein, have never been detected on Earth despite decades of hunting with detectors of increasing sensitivity.
The problem is that LIGO's budget, which Congress more than doubled in the fiscal year 1993 to $43 million for research and construction, is rapidly expanding at the same time as the agency's overall research funds are shrinking for the first time in years. The squeeze is threatening a host of smaller scientific research projects with extinction. The science agency, including its head, Dr. Walter E. Massey, is now fighting with Congressover the fiscal 1993 budget to try to avert a debacle.
The worst-case outcome, said Dr. Robert A. Eisenstein, head of the agency's physics division, "would do great damage," adding:. "We're talking about cutting off really good people. One should not be under the misapprehension that we're cutting fat. It would be muscle and bone."
Such conflicts have grown in recent years as big science has flourished. The Government has embarked on about two dozen large projects for the 1990's estimated to cost some $60 billion to build and $100 billion to operate over their lifetimes. They include giant telescopes, atom smashers and space probes meant to explore some of science's most fundamental questions or to open new realms of inquiry.
While these flashy projects get the bulk of public attention -- and public money -- small-scale science and the infrastructure needed to support it have fallen into disrepair, prompting cries of alarm from researchers.
Despite its lackluster name, small-scale basic research is the source of most scientific breakthroughs. Financed largely by the Federal Government, it is undertaken around the country by scientists at universities, Federal laboratories and private research centers, rather than by big teams working with giant machines and instruments.
Some of its fruits -- antibiotics, transistors, lasers -- spur the economy and aid everyday living; others nourish the nation's intellectual life. Small-research ventures lie behind the vast majority of the Nobel Prizes awarded in science.
Even so, experts say small projects are rapidly loosing ground to their big counterparts. A key reason is that modest endeavors do not attract the political constituencies and patrons that shield big projects from budget pressures in Congress and the rest of the Government.
A vivid example of this process is LIGO, a joint project of two of the nation's most celebrated schools, the California Institute of Technology and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
The technical aim is to build two gravity-wave observatories hundreds of miles apart, each consisting of two perpendicular tunnels some two and a half miles long. Inside the tunnels, laser beams are to flash back and forth, while detectors watch for a minuscule shift in their waves that would announce the passage of gravity waves. The geographic separation of the two observatories is to help rule out false positives caused by terrestrial factors like seismic vibrations and to help pinpoint a true signal's cosmic origin.
Even in its conceptual stage, the gravity project generated hot debate. Backers, while admitting there was no guarantee of success, said the scientific payoff was potentially gigantic. The goal, they said, was to create a powerful new tool for investigating celestial objects that eluded conventional telescopes, which rely on the radiation of light and radio waves.
Opponents, while acknowledging the scientific allure, said the project was too risky to warrant large-scale spending. In March 1991, Dr. J. Anthony Tyson, an astrophysicist at the A.T.& T. Bell Laboratories and chairman of the Astronomy Advisory Committee of the National Science Foundation, or N.S.F., told a House panel that it was "premature to commit to a full-scale LIGO," arguing instead that further research was needed to boost its projected powers of observation.
 
Force of Political Reality
 Advocates countered by lobbying members of the Senate, arguing that the project was strongly supported by physicists and that Dr. Tyson had underestimated the anticipated sensitivity of its detectors. The advocates won. In 1991, Congress directed that the first building funds would flow in fiscal 1992. It put up $5 million for advanced research and $16 million for construction.
Last February, the political muscle behind the project grew significantly when the science foundation announced that the two observatories would be built in the districts of House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Democrat of Washington, and Senator J. Bennett Johnston, a Louisiana Democrat who sits on the Senate committee that appropriates money for the agency.
The observatories were to be built on Federal land at the Hanford Reservation in central Washington and in a paper-company forest near Livingston, La., about 30 miles east of Baton Rouge. These areas would thus get lucrative construction contracts that would produce hundreds of new jobs.
Gaining momentum, LIGO was given $5 million in research and $38 million in construction funds by Congress for fiscal 1993, more than twice its 1992 budget. The rub was that at the same time the science foundation's overall research budget contracted from $1.872 billion to $1.859 billion. Adjusting for inflation, that was a drop of about 5 percent.
 
Calls for Moderation
 The foundation is now fighting for breathing room, hoping to protect the funds of the individual investigators who are the lifeblood of small science. Dr. Massey, the agency's head, wrote Dec. 3 to Senator Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland Democrat who heads the agency's appropriating committee, proposing that the gravity project's construction budget be cut from $38 million to $20 million.
"These funds," he wrote, "will enable the completion of industrial design and much of the preparation work at both sites. At this level, support for LIGO increases by $4 million, or 19 percent, above last year's level, allowing the project to move forward in a significant manner."
The Congressional response has been cool. On Dec. 9, Senator Mikulski and her House counterpart, Representative Bob Traxler, Democrat of Michigan, wrote the science foundation to say "the committees cannot agree to the proposed reductions." They proposed a meeting of officials in early January to "reach agreement on a reasonable resolution of this impasse."
On Dec. 16, N.S.F. officials say, Dr. Massey met with Senator Johnston, a LIGO kingpin on Capitol Hill, arguing for slower construction to avert budget turmoil.
"He understood our problem," said a foundation official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, "but he also said he wanted to keep it moving forward as a major project, and that a number like $20 million was going to throw it behind."
An aide to Senator Johnston echoed that assessment, saying, "He's flexible, but $20 million is not enough."
Dr. Eisenstein, the N.S.F.'s head of physics research, said he hoped any budget cuts would not fall exclusively on his division, but if that happened it could eliminate about 130 of the 900 grants scheduled to be awarded in fiscal 1993, a drop of about 15 percent. That, he said, "would be catastrophic."
 
Slicing a Shrinking Pie
 Small-scale projects that might be cut, he said, included ones probing the riddles of cosmic evolution, searching for subatomic particles and, paradoxically, pioneering new ways to detect gravity waves.
If Congress insists on $38 million for LIGO construction, or something close to it, one option for foundation officials is to spread the budget cuts across other research areas, which include math, geology, engineering, economics, chemistry, biology, sociology, materials research and computer science.
"I think Bennett Johnston is a tremendous friend of science," said Dr. Eisenstein. "He really understands these things. But once a guy like that gets hold and says, 'Hey, I want this to happen,' it's a real problem when we don't have the financial wherewithal."
A Senate aide put the blame on the National Science Foundation, saying the agency was unfair in expecting politicians to pull back suddenly on promises to constituents. During the 80's, when there was rapid growth, he said, the agency failed to economize and set priorities.
Dr. Rochus E. Vogt of Caltech, director of the gravity-wave project, said in an interview that his team could "do a successful, vigorous program in the coming year at $20 million" but that its projected five-year construction timetable would then be stretched out.
"My job is to make sure my team does meaningful work at a variety of budget levels," he said. "We will move in bulldozers in the coming year, even at $20 million."
"It would be most unfortunate," Dr. Vogt added, "if LIGO progressed at the expense of individual investigator grants. What's best for the project is that it fits into the overall science effort in the country."
Such dramas are likely to increase as the nation presses ahead with big-science efforts like a $3 billion project to map the human genome, an $8 billion atom smasher and a $30 billion space station.
During the Presidential campaign, Bill Clinton appeared to try to please everybody by pledging strong support for scientific efforts both big and small.
"I do not accept the view that one must be sacrificed in order to support the other," he told Science magazine. "Individual researchers and small teams will be a priority -- this type of research is the source of most new discoveries and innovations."
But some types of research, he added cautiously, "can only be done in large facilities."

Chart/Diagrams: "A Costly Eye for Hidden Violence"
One of the biggest and most complex science projects is the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory (LIGO), an instrument designed to detect gravity waves and, possibly, confirm the existence of black holes by observing gravitational havoc thought to flow from their violent motions. Backers say such basic research is a key to understanding the universe. Opponents say it is so expensive that it threatens to drain money from small projects that are more useful and important.
Scientists want two instrument sites to help distinguish terrestrial "noise" from other readings and to help infer clues to where a wave source might be. Three instruments would be required for more precise locating ability.
 
When a pair of neutron stars whirl about each other in a suicidal dance, as they sometimes do, their violent motions are thought to produce gravity waves, though none has been detected on Earth.
Gravity waves can arise, theorists believe, when space and matter are bent and stretched by the enormous mass of some double stars. [Diagram]
 
Detecting waves
In LIGO, intense laser beams will be bounced back and forth between mirrors many times; part of the light leaks out past a partly reflective mirror to hit a detector. If gravity waves pass through, the whole giant assembly will compress or expand in such a way that the intensity of light that reaches the detector will be altered.
The mirrors and laser beams are to be housed in an L-shaped vacuum system, with each leg about two and a half miles long. The vacuum chamber is the most expensive part of the system. [Diagram]

HEADLINE: Gunter Grass Considers the Inescapable: Politics

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN

 BODY:
Conversations with writers usually drift from current events to literature to personal lives, back to literature again, then to a bit of the news and on to long discussions of the writer's current work. But a talk with Gunter Grass, one of Germany's most prominent novelists and essayists, is nearly all about politics, very specifically German politics. He cannot escape, he said, this shadow that insinuates its way into his writing, his etchings and his conversations.
"I always wish that once there will be a period in Germany where politics is in the corner, but I never had it," said Mr. Grass, who was in New York City recently to promote his latest novel, "The Call of the Toad" (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich). 
 "Politics is not always the reality, but it's always very hungry and wants to be the reality," he said. "We are, in Germany and in Europe, formed or misformed, punished by politics, getting older by politics. I see it in my children. Whether they want or don't want, they are involved in politics, even if they are not engaged in a political party."
For a German, politics intrudes upon nearly every encounter, the 65-year-old writer said. "Someone traveling from Sweden will be asked about beautiful blond women," he said. "Or from the U.S., they will be asked about the Empire State Building. But when you say you're from Germany, immediately people want to know about the skinheads and firebombing the foreigners' hostels. There is no escape from it."
 
No Distance From the Present
 In "The Call of the Toad," two lovers in their later years -- a German widower and a Polish widow -- try to bring final relief from politics in an entrepreneurial plan to repatriate corpses from the battle-scarred regions of eastern Germany and Poland in a Cemetery of Reconciliation in Gdansk, Poland (formerly Danzig, Germany, Mr. Grass's birthplace). They want to offer Poles, Lithuanians and Germans who have been displaced by warring governments a chance to be buried or reburied in their homeland.
But before long, the political strife the couple hoped to redress haunts the project. The cemetery, intended as a haven from politics, booms into a major commercial enterprise, and its founders soon incur envy and criticism and accusations that the Germans are trying "reconquest through corpses."
"This is life, the result of our century," Mr. Grass said resignedly about the political fallout his characters face. "To write a book like 'The Call of the Toad,' to write parallel to the present time, is always risky. You have no distance. But sometimes literature has the possibility to reflect fears in the mind, and perhaps if you write it first, you can stop bad results from happening."
 
The Artist as Citizen
 From his first novel, "The Tin Drum" (1959), the provocative and comically disturbing story of a young German who lived through the horrors of Nazi Germany and who willfully stunts his growth and bangs a toy drum in anarchistic protest, Mr. Grass established himself as a voice of conscience and controversy for postwar Germany. That reputation has continued and grown with the publication of, among others works of fiction, nonfiction, poetry and illustrations, the novella "Cat and Mouse" (1963), and the novels "Dog Years" (1963), "From the Diary of a Snail" (1973) and "The Flounder" (1977).
This political entanglement is inevitable to Mr. Grass, an active Social Democrat, who says plainly: "I'm not just a writer or an artist. I'm a citizen of my country."
His role as citizen writer has become ever more urgent in recent years as the collapse of Communism in Eastern Europe thrust his country into one of the most difficult and dramatic events of this century: the reunification of Germany.
Both before and after the Berlin wall came down in 1989 and before the two Germanys were reunified in 1990, Mr. Grass prophesied about a Germany weakened and disenchanted by such a union. His calls were largely maligned and condemned by his countrymen.
His 1990 collection of essays, "Two States -- One Nation?" (A Helen and Kurt Wolff Book/Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), which argued for a confederation of the two Germanys, chafed against popular public opinion of the time. In one essay, he warned that Germans "have every reason to fear ourselves as a unit," and in another that Auschwitz stood as a witness against such a move because "one of the preconditions for the terrible thing that happened was a strong, unified Germany."
Today, he would revise none of the warnings in that book. "It is coming out as I promised," he said.
 
The Weak vs. the Weaker
 Mr. Grass points to the rise of fascist and neo-Nazi activities among young people, pressures from many quarters to limit immigration, and the disaffection of people from the former East Germany who are struggling to find their purpose in this new German colossus.
"Many people from the East hoped to join the West with their own face, their own experiences," he said. "But the West was coming like colonial masters, treating them like children. It was shock for many. They were astonished. There is no longer a wall or an iron curtain, but Germany is divided socially and economically. There are Germans first and second class. I'm afraid this will take longer than the wall to fix."
He said he believed that the violence against immigrants was not so much an expression of true hate against outsiders as much as it was the weakest members of German society fighting their own lowly status.
"The hate between Germans is the root of this violence," he said. "But they know that they cannot take on the other Germans, the stronger Germans, with their jobs and their money and their cars, so they go for the weakest. In many ways it is an expression of their own self-hate, which was bound to happen with reunification. It is expensive. It is unsettling. And so the weakest of East and West Germany got thrown to the bottom, and they are fighting to be above somebody or really anybody. And who is beneath them? The foreigners.
"But the most dangerous thing is we have skins in the Government," he continued. "They are nicely dressed with beautiful hair, educated. They speak well. But they think the same way as the young kids who shave their heads and carry swastikas and demonstrate. They encourage these ideas and these brutal actions."
And so wherever he goes, by fate and by design, Mr. Grass ruminates about politics, occasionally interjecting a worried, raspy note about literature and about the dangers of culture's becoming marginalized by the undue influence of politics.
"What is deadly dangerous to literature is that in politics you have to repeat yourself," he said. "And literature and art are about the new and the innovative, about the undiscovered and the unvoiced. We must find ways to show responsibility to both."

HEADLINE: The Los Angeles Art World's New Image

BYLINE: BY ROBERTA SMITH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
Sue Spaid, a tall young woman who opened a gallery in a tiny storefront on Beverly Boulevard two years ago, is something of a legend in the freshman ranks of the Los Angeles art scene. Mention her name and people will remark that she has been known to work in a bakery at the minimum wage to keep her gallery going, or that she doesn't have a car.
Ms. Spaid admits to having "a financial crisis every six weeks," that she operates her gallery on about $2,500 a month and that she has no staff, but "a lot of volunteers." Ask her what she thinks of the current state of the Los Angeles art world, where the recession has taken a high toll among galleries, and she says elliptically, "I think probably things' not being so great is what makes it so great." 
 Great, not so great. The gallery scene in this city is in such a state of flux that both adjectives are regularly applied. But something -- maybe a few somethings -- has reached critical mass here.
Talk to established dealers with their large, sleek galleries and big overheads and you see an art scene that may have expanded beyond the needs of its environment. Three years ago new galleries were opening and older ones expanding at a remarkable rate; Santa Monica was being called the next SoHo and an art collection was the status symbol of choice among Hollywood and real-estate moguls alike. These days, after nearly a dozen galleries, most of them in Santa Monica, have closed, the dealers who remain open complain about the fickleness of local collectors or, more rationally, the narrowness or shallowness of "the collector base."
 
Talking, Not Looking
 Some cite real-estate barons who prefer to buy art in New York; others point to television producers who spend more time parked in front of galleries cradling car phones than they do inside looking at art. Along the way, still others complain that the new young dealers -- Ms. Spaid, who is 31 years old, and her generation -- are getting too much press, an unsurprising cavil in a scene whose dealers are notoriously insular. And two gallery owners, speaking anonymously of course, say that they think the only dealer who is doing any real business in Los Angeles is Arne Glimcher, the owner of the Pace Gallery in New York. Not only is Mr. Glimcher himself a sometime movie producer and director, his Hollywood connections are magnified by his close friendship with Michael Ovitz, who is the head of the powerful Creative Artists Agency and an avid collector of contemporary art.
Rosamund Felsen, who has been in business for 14 years (the last 2 in handsome new space in West Hollywood), and represents Los Angeles artists exclusively, sees collectors as "the weakest link" in the Los Angeles art scene.
"We've got everything else: really important artists, critics and museums," Ms. Felsen said. "The handful of important collectors continue to buy, but the others just don't realize that if they want to have an art community that's respected around the world, they have to support it. Not only have they stopped buying, they're not even coming in."
Michael Kohn moved from his West Hollywood gallery to an upscale Colorado Avenue mall in Santa Monica with several other dealers two years ago. "A lot of the collectors I used to sell to no longer buy, although I'd have to put collectors in quotes," he said. "People say don't close; hang on; hang on. I say buy art and I'll hang on. The Hollywood collectors, that necessary evil, consistently don't have time to look at art in their own city."
But in contrast to the market's contracting top is the expanding bottom, where Ms. Spaid and her colleagues are forging a no-frills gallery style. The last year has seen the emergence of several shoestring galleries and exhibition spaces with odd names like Food House, Nomadic Sites, 1301 and TRI. Some are in unrefurbished storefronts or private homes; others lack permanent addresses. Most concentrate on showing the young artists coming out of the area's unusually plentiful and unusually good art schools. All are run by a new generation of mostly 20-something dealers, artists and low-key entrepreneurs who are bringing a new vitality and community to a scene where traditional entry points like alternative spaces have been in short supply.
 
Importing Established Artists
 The conversations at this level, where everyone has a lot less to lose, are considerably brighter, with emphasis on local artists, non-Hollywood collectors, low prices (as in "nothing over $3,000, most under $1,000") and taking things into your own hands. The younger set sees the 1980's gallery boom as a free-floating, corporate-influenced phenomenon. It was a time when most big galleries, sometimes called dinosaurs, concentrated on importing established artists from New York and Europe rather than putting down roots in the local art community.
The new dealers cite as inspiration the shoestring approach of Thomas Solomon, son of the New York art dealer Holly Solomon, who operated a gallery out of a single-car garage on an alley in the Fairfax district for almost three years, giving a number of unknown artists from both coasts their first solo shows. After gradually expanding to five garages, Mr. Solomon moved two years ago to a relatively large gallery on North Fairfax Avenue, a converted automobile mechanic's garage, as it turns out.
"The whole lifeline of the commercial gallery had run its course," said Leonard Bravo, a 27-year-old painter, as he explained why he and two other artists, Robert Grunderman and Stephen Hartzog, both 29, opened the tiny gallery called Food House in Santa Monica last spring. While Mr. Bravo referred to the "bigger was better" habits of established galleries, Mr. Grunderman called their own approach "back to basics."
Indeed, Food House, situated on the downscale end of Colorado Avenue, looks like a miniature, no-budget facsimile of what may soon be called the classic Santa Monica gallery. The space has the same spare industrial beamwork overhead, the same cement floor underfoot, but it measures only 500 square feet; its front desk is strictly plywood and its staff is limited to the gallery's founders. They already represent a dozen young artists. "We want to stay away from showing just one school," Mr. Bravo said, referring not so much to esthetics as to the way the graduates of a particular art school often form tight (and sometimes feuding) cliques.
 
'Art's Presentation'
 What's emerging at the grass roots level may be a gallery for a small art scene, something flexible, modest and right in the living room. The most extreme example of flexibility is Nomadic Sites, a yearlong series of exhibitions initiated in July by a 27-year-old sculptor, Charles LaBelle. Organized by different artists at Mr. LaBelle's invitation, the shows have so far been held in donated spaces that have ranged from studios to vacant storefronts to the lobby of a public library. Mr. LaBelle said he saw the exhibitions as "a program about art's presentation" that "brings art back to the discourse rather than the market." Sticking closer to home are Brian Butler, Rory Devine and Amanda M. Obering, who all exhibit art in their apartments.
Mr. Devine, who is 27 and an artist, has a shy, deadpan manner that can remind one a little of Andy Warhol. (Another carless dealer, he said he moved from New York to Los Angeles three years ago, sight unseen, because "The Rockford Files" was his favorite childhood television program.) With his office in his kitchen and his exhibition areas in his living and dining room, he runs his gallery, TRI, as a kind of domesticated alternative space. He does not represent individual artists, but instead orchestrates quirky group shows, like the one of work by six women named Laura ("The Laura Show") as well as the three-artist shows that gave the gallery its name.
Another stay-at-home dealer is Amanda M. Obering, who has so far had three exhibitions in AMO, as she calls the living room of her high-rise apartment. Ms. Obering, who is 27, is so freshly arrived from New York (the daughter of the painter Mary Obering, she grew up in the art world there) that it's too soon to tell if she will become a permanent part of the scene. Nonetheless, an installation piece by Devon Diekouthat covered the entire living room floor with several inches of cement, in homage to the Grauman's Theater's famous autographed sidewalk, indicating a certain level of commitment.
Brian Butler is a native of Los Angeles who has worked for art dealers in Cologne, Germany, and London, as well as his hometown. In February he set up his own gallery, 1301, in his small Santa Monica duplex apartment at 1301 Franklin Avenue. Mr. Butler works with a small group of artists who are mostly in their 30's, including Meg Cranston and Thaddeus Strode, giving them two-month shows in his living room while also running a separate business, Brain Multiples, that publishes inexpensive multiples and prints.
 
'Movie Tinseltown'
 The tall, lanky Mr. Butler veers between dedication and an in-L.A.-but-not-of-L.A. attitude reminiscent of some of the more experienced art dealers. "I'm going to do this no matter what," he said. But he continued, "If you come into L.A. and have no expectations, it's a great city. I don't have any predisposed notion that people from here are going to buy from me; most of my sales are in New York and Europe. People don't want to be intellectually challenged here. If they did, this wouldn't be movie tinseltown, it would be cinema central."
Perhaps taking a page or two from the newcomers, a number of middle-generation dealers in their late 30's and early 40's seem to be attempting to lower both their expectations and their operating costs by radically restructuring the way they do business. In June, Susan Landau, of the defunct Krygier-Landau Gallery, opened a gallery in her home in West Los Angeles. Last month, Linda Cathcart, Stuart Regen and Richard Kuehlenschmidt, who have been open for 3, 2 and 12 years respectively, announced that they would close their galleries, but not go out of business, nor even stop holding exhibitions. Mr. Regen, for example, plans to rent different spaces on a one-show basis, beginning with a project by Richard Prince sometime in March.
"Maybe there wasn't anything in L.A. to begin with," said Ms. Cathcart, who represents more artists from New York than Los Angeles and has decided to move her gallery to her home. In October she purchased a four-level Santa Monica town house designed by Frank Gehry. She will display art on its ground floor, starting next month with an exhibition of sculpture by Louise Bourgeois. Ms. Cathcart will be open on Saturday and Sunday only, in an attempt to cater to clients who can only visit galleries on weekends.
"If the big guys aren't willing to spend their money here, staying open and sitting in our galleries all day long seems kind of silly," she said.

HEADLINE: Alien Species Threaten Hawaii's Environment

BYLINE: By CAROL KAESUK YOON

 BODY:
FOR 70 million years the Hawaiian islands enjoyed blissful isolation, disturbed only once every few thousand years by a species crossing the Pacific to find a new home. But researchers say alien species are now entering this tropical paradise at many thousands of times their natural rate, causing critical problems.
"The alien species problem is by far the most important problem facing both Hawaii's environment and our agricultural economy and perhaps our entire economy," said Alan Holt, director of science and stewardship for the Nature Conservancy of Hawaii. Mr. Holt was a co-author of a recent report on alien species by his group and the Natural Resources Defense Council that was described by environmentalists as the first comprehensive study of this threat. 
 The report cited troublesome invaders like fruit flies that damage crops, grasses that fuel wildfires, ants that destroy native insects and bacteria that infect waters, causing disease. One serious economic pest is established each year on average.
 
Lost Crops and Markets
 Industry experts estimate that the Mediterranean, Oriental and melon flies cost the state's agriculture industry more than $300 million a year. Farmers suffer not only damage to fruit crops, but lost markets as well. The mainland United States and many foreign countries no longer buy Hawaiian fruits that are potentially infested with the flies.
Alien pest plants also take their toll on the islands. Fountain grass, a highly flammable weed that flourishes after fires, has been the cause of numerous burns that have damaged commercial and residential developments as well as large stands of native forest.
But Hawaii is threatened with the loss of much more than revenue.
Separated from the nearest land mass by more than 2,000 miles, Hawaii fostered the evolution of many unique and exquisite organisms. But the isolation of these gentle islands from mainland predators and diseases created a flora and fauna ill equipped to handle the rigors of competition with the outside world. Hawaii is home to thistles without prickles, blackberries without thorns and many flightless insects and birds.
Unless prevention and control efforts are successful, planes and boats will continue to bring in more of the mainland's dangerous alien species, quickly driving extinct what little remains of Hawaii's priceless wildlife.
"If your concern is, are we going to have any substantial examples of native areas with native plants and native birds and native insects in even as little as 10 years, then I think it's a crisis," said Susan Miller of the Natural Resources Defense Council, a co-author of the report.
Scientists have found the recently imported Argentine ant to be a ravenous predator that they say is "erasing" the islands' native insect populations. The ants may also erase what remains of the islands' silversword plant. Among the ants' meals are two of the main insect pollinators of this unusual plant, whose impressive sword of flowers can only be found in volcanic craters of Hawaii.
"Silverswords flower once and die, so the plant is very dependent on insect pollinators," said Art Medeiros, research associate at Haleakala National Park on Maui. "Without pollinators the silversword would probably last another 50 years and that's all."
Along with many other native plants, silverswords have suffered under the trampling feet and in the munching jaws of feral goats. Introduced cattle, pigs, and sheep have also eaten many native species towards extinction, moving like a fleet of lawnmowers across Hawaii's delicate, native ecosystems.
Ronald Walker, the state's wildlife program manager, said imported rabbits were the newest grazing threat. Pet owners, either unable or unwilling to care for their rabbits, release them in the rich environment of the native forest. Mr. Walker said that most people did not realize the seriousness of their acts.
 
A Piranha Threat
 Still other alien pests directly threaten human health. Already responsible for a few injuries, newly introduced piranhas have caused a bit of a panic among islanders, one recently being fished out of a reservoir. As with most of these alien species, it is often difficult to determine exactly how they were introduced, since researchers discover them only after the fact.
Another threat to Hawaii's peaceful waters is the introduced bacteria Leptospira, which caused 66 cases of leptospirosis in Hawaii in 1989, two of which resulted in death. Spread into the islands' streams and waterfalls by alien rats and pigs, the bacterium from Southeast Asia, which can cause infections of the liver and kidneys, has made many scenic spots unsafe for swimming.
In response to the report, Government agencies have recently joined forces with the two environmental groups to prevent the invasion of new alien species. They have focused on coordinating the efforts of the responsible agencies. Mrs. Miller said more than 20 state, Federal and private organizations were working on alien species prevention and control in Hawaii. "It's been an ad hoc, piecemeal approach," she said.
The agencies have begun by modeling their combined efforts after what may be the best and most effective program to fight alien species, that of New Zealand. In consultation with New Zealand officials, Hawaii's agencies are making plans to computerize and standardize records of all intercepted invasions. Environmentalists said New Zealand was an excellent example because it was also struggling to protect fragile ecosystems that no longer enjoy isolation.
Despite the many agencies involved, the report found that a large proportion of domestic airline passengers and their baggage continued to come into Hawaii uninspected. State inspectors seem to agree that the millions of airline passengers arriving each year are the largest single source of alien species.
While evidence suggests that the mainland United States is the leading source of new pests, some types of domestic cargo, even cut lumber, which is known to be a likely source, also go entirely unchecked.
Environmentalists say that Federal regulations may need to be changed. They are aimed largely at protecting the mainland from harmful pests and may actually be aiding alien invasions of Hawaii. Many tropical plants that would be unable to survive a winter are legal for shipment to the mainland because they do not pose the threat of permanent invasion as weeds. Although these same plants are illegal in Hawaii, they are allowed to enter the islands on the way to the mainland.
Once these goods pass Federal inspections in Hawaii they are no longer regulated and can easily be distributed illegally on the islands. In addition, foreign products that may carry pests dangerous only to Hawaii can enter the United States on the mainland and later be shipped to Hawaii as domestic cargo, making foreign pests difficult to detect.
The real question is whether the new efforts will be enough as the islands are flooded with more and more air and sea traffic. From 1971 to 1989, the report said, the number of passengers arriving on Oahu, Hawaii's busiest island, more than doubled. The number of air cargo and mail parcels has tripled.
At the same time the quarantine inspection staff of Hawaii's Department of Agriculture on Oahu increased by only 15 percent. The result is that staff members have become ever more thinly spread.
 
Worse Problems Awaited
 Even with the already great cost of alien pests to Hawaii, environmentalists say the worst may be yet to come.
Free from many of the fearsome biting flies that plague most of the tropics, Hawaii is constantly threatened with the invasion of these and other pest insects that could prove a nightmare for the islands' reputation as an idyllic vacation spot.
Other potential invaders include fire ants, highly aggressive Africanized bees and the bird-devouring brown tree snake, all of which would probably flourish in the rich, tropical habitats on Hawaii and all of which could easily make their way there.

HEADLINE: Kenyans Sip Democracy But Find It Bitter, So Far

BYLINE: By KENNETH B. NOBLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NAIROBI, Kenya, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The campaign for Kenya's first multiparty elections in 26 years ended tonight with charges that brutality and fraud were being used to win votes.
On the eve of the voting Tuesday, President Daniel arap Moi urged supporters not to drink any alcohol, warning that the opposition was plotting to dilute them with hallucinogens to make voters so drowsy that they would oversleep and miss the balloting. 
 Mr. Moi, who has ruled for 14 years, also announced an overnight ban on the use of trucks and other large vehicles. He said this was to prevent opposing parties from busing supporters to voting districts where they were weak.
And two of the main opposition contenders, Oginga Odinga and Mwai Kibaki, charged that serious electoral irregularities had already occurred. They insisted that the President would finish no higher than third in a fair election.
Mr. Moi, who succeeded Jomo Kenyatta as President in 1978, may have surpassed him in concentrating Kenyan political power in the presidency. After a coup attempt 10 years ago, he intensified efforts to put down dissent.
A year ago, Mr. Moi grudgingly agreed under foreign pressure to end a ban on opposition parties and promised fair elections. Some thought Kenya, long a one-party state, was moving toward political pluralism.
But increasingly in recent weeks, the political climate has again turned rough and sometimes ugly, with little focus on issues. Candidates and their supporters have often campaigned with invective and have sometimes returned to violence.
An editorial today in The Nation, an independent paper, reflected the anger and anxiety many Kenyans feel.
"It impossible to pretend," it said, "that the electoral process has been totally fair. Kenyans should make no mistake: as a country we are at a crossroads. Kenya's once-booming economy is under severe pressure" and can no longer bear "the effects of accumulated corruption and inefficiency that is pulling it down.".
 
Once Seen as a Model
 Such pessimism is striking in light of Kenya's previous reputation as an economically stable and politically mature African country. In the 1970's and 80's, in part because of its pro-Western outlook and position on the Indian Ocean, Kenya received large amounts of Western aid.
In recent months, though, much aid has been suspended because donors including the United States regard the Moi Government as increasingly corrupt and authoritarian.
The conventional wisdom in Kenyan political circles had at first been that virtually any of the seven candidates challenging Mr. Moi would win handily in a fair contest. So incompetent and unpopular was the incumbent, it was said, that he would be lucky to win a majority even among his own small tribe, the Kalenjin.
But Mr. Moi is a relentless campaigner and his party, the long-ruling Kenya African National Union, remains a vote-generating machine.
The President's pitch has not wavered: Stability, he says, can be guaranteed only if he and his party win. The other parties, he insists, represent tribalism, the curse of Africa.
"The opposition badly underestimated Moi," said an African diplomat with long experience in Kenya. "Here is a man who has been a professional politician for 37 years; you don't last that long at the top unless you're smart and savvy. Moi has outwitted them all."
 
Second Round Possible
 Still, predictions about the outcome are uncertain. The main question is whether Mr. Moi can win the 25 percent in five of the eight provinces that is required for outright victory. If he fails, most impartial observers believe, he will face a tougher run-off against the strongest challenger.
The prospects for a first-round opposition victory, however, are hardly promising. The opposition is deeply split along regional and tribal lines. Mr. Odinga, a Luo from western Kenya and a former Vice President, leads one faction. Kenneth Matiba, a Kikuyu and former Cabinet minister, who was detained by Mr. Moi for almost a year in 1990 and 1991 for urging an end to one-party rule, leads another. Still another faction, the Democratic Party, is led by a former Vice President and Finance Minister, Mwai Kibaki, who is also from the Kikuyu tribe, the largest and formerly the most powerful in Kenya.
Perceptions of electoral integrity, or the lack of it, are expected to determine whether Kenya stands at the dawn of progress under a new democracy or the brink of political disarray. Only the Government and the ruling-party apparatus can tamper with the vote effectively. If Mr. Moi wins, the cheating issue will loom large.
Whether the election is perceived as being fair will determine in large part whether donor nations will continue to reduce or withhold aid.

HEADLINE: Gloom Lifts in U.S. and Falls on Japan

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Dec. 28

 BODY:
The Japanese are losing confidence that their nation will be the dominant economic power in the next century, while Americans see their own economy as gaining strength and view Japan as less of a long-term economic threat than before.
In a poll conducted in both countries this month by The New York Times, CBS News and the Tokyo Broadcasting System, 45 percent of Americans said the United States would be "the No. 1 economic power in the world" in the 21st century while 30 percent said Japan would be. 
 That is a striking reversal from only a year ago, when 30 percent of Americans said the United States would be the world's leading economy and half said Japan would be.
 
'A Very Quick Turnaround'
 While 44 percent of Japanese still say their country will dominate the world economy in the next century, their certainty appears to be ebbing. Only a year ago 53 percent expressed that opinion.
"It is a very quick turnaround in perceptions," Masaru Yoshitomi, a leading Japanese economist and an adviser to the country's Economic Planning Agency, said today. "People's impressions of the power of the Japanese economy were inflated by the bubble economy," he said, using the term Japanese often invoke to describe the country's tremendous expansion in the late 1980's, before it began to burst two years ago. "More of a sense of reality is setting in," he added.
Plummeting corporate profits, growing bankruptcies and the beginnings of job layoffs in Japan -- all unaccustomed events in the country's remarkable postwar growth -- have left the Japanese pessimistic about their country's prospects for the next few years.
In the poll, 71 percent of Japanese said the state of their economy was "fairly bad" or "very bad." Only 6 percent saw reason for hope that things were getting better.
But old perceptions abroad die hard. More than half of the Americans polled rated the state of the Japanese economy "fairly good" or "very good," evidence that the two countries measure their economic performances by very different yardsticks.
Thirty-four percent of Americans said the future generation of Japanese would be better off than people today, while only 13 percent of Japanese said they shared that view. Two years ago more than half of Americans said the future generation of Japanese would be better off.
The results appeared just as Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa has come under increasing fire at home for doing too little to spur Japanese economic activity. Over the weekend, the Cabinet approved a budget for the next fiscal year, but critics immediately characterized it as a warmed-over version of past budgets that would do little to revitalize the economy.
The poll findings were based on nationwide telephone interviews with 1,333 Americans conducted Dec. 7-9, and in-person interviews with 1,357 Japanese throughout Japan conducted Dec. 3-9. Each poll has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
More Optimistic in U.S.
 In the poll of Americans, 50 percent said the economy would improve with Bill Clinton as President and nearly a third said the economy was "getting better." That was an increase in optimism since the end of October, when only 17 percent said the economy was on the upswing.
As the new Administration prepares to take office in the United States, Japanese are also somewhat more pessimistic than Americans are about relations between the two countries, particularly on trade matters.
While 77 percent of Americans describe relations between Japan and the United States as "friendly," and 17 percent say they are "unfriendly," Japanese are more closely divided. Fifty-three percent say relations are friendly; 46 percent say they are not.
The percentage of Japanese who term relations unfriendly has been rising since the Times/CBS News/Tokyo Broadcasting System poll began asking the question in 1985. At that time, only 21 percent of Japanese expressed that view.
The two countries are far apart on the question of whether Japanese companies are competing unfairly with their American counterparts, or whether the United States is blaming Japan for its own economic problems. Among Americans, 40 percent said competition was unfair, while 49 percent said Japan was being used as a scapegoat.
But 78 percent of Japanese said they were being blamed by America for problems that were not of their making; only 17 percent said Japanese companies were not competing fairly.
 
A Matter of Respect
 Once again the poll revealed that a majority of Japanese -- this year about 77 percent -- say Americans look down on Japanese. Only 18 percent said Americans respect the Japanese people.
But the results were very different when the question was asked in reverse: whether Japanese respect Americans. Fifty-eight percent of Japanese said most Japanese do respect the American people, though only 31 percent of Americans share that belief. About 55 percent of Americans said Japanese look down on them, a view shared by 33 percent of Japanese.
An increasing number of Japanese -- though still a minority of 34 percent -- say their country has a "responsibility to give military assistance in trouble spots around the world" when help is sought by the United States or other Western allies. An additional 39 percent say Japan has a responsibility to give financial aid to military peacekeeping efforts around the world.
Sixty-nine percent of Americans say Japan has a responsibility to provide military aid.
While participation in United Nations peacekeeping activities is not an issue in the United States, it is a constant subject of debate in Japan. The governing Liberal Democratic Party spent more than a year winning passage of the bill that permitted the deployment of troops to Cambodia, over the objections of those who said the Japanese Constitution bans any use of force overseas.
 
Under Severe Restrictions
 Though troops have now been sent to Cambodia, the first such deployment since the end of World War II, they operate under severe restrictions, forbidden from entering any area of likely conflict. Japan has not contributed personnel to other peacekeeping efforts.
The poll suggested that Japanese are more cynical than Americans about their central Government. More than two-thirds of Japanese said Japan had more government corruption than did the United States, a view that was doubtless amplified by the latest political scandal here, in which allegations have been made that organized crime had a role in the naming of Noboru Takeshita as Prime Minister in 1987.
Fifty-three percent of Americans said the United States Government was more corrupt than Tokyo's.
 
 
 
HOW THE TWO POLLS WERE CONDUCTED
 The New York Times/CBS News/Tokyo Broadcasting System Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted Dec. 7 to 9 with 1,333 adults throughout the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii, and on personal interviews conducted Dec. 3 to 9 with 1,357 adults throughout Japan.
In the United States, the sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen so as to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. For each exchange, the telephone numbers were formed by random digits, permitting access to both listed and unlisted numbers.
Within each household one adult was designated by a random procedure to be the respondent for the poll. The results have been weighted to take account of household size and the number of telephone lines into the residence and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, race, sex, age and education.
In Japan, the survey was conducted by the Nippon Research Center under supervision of the Tokyo Broadcasting System. Personal interviews were conducted in communities throughout the country to yield a statistically representative sample of the Japanese public.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by seeking out all American adults, or all adult Japanese.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the polls. The translation of questions between English and Japanese, for example, can sometimes result in questions that have slightly different meaning in each language.
