HEADLINE: Tapering of Stimulus Could Start as Soon as September, 2 Fed Presidents Hint

BYLINE: By NELSON D. SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Two Federal Reserve regional presidents suggested on Tuesday that the central bank could ease its extraordinary efforts to stimulate the economy sooner rather than later, but stopped short of providing an exact time frame.
Charles L. Evans, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago, said he would not rule out the possibility that the Fed could start tapering as early as next month.
The remarks came at a breakfast with reporters in Chicago and echoed through the markets during the day, because Mr. Evans is a voting member of the Federal Open Market Committee, which sets Fed policy, and because he has generally supported more aggressive efforts to stimulate the economy in the past. 
In a separate interview with Market News International, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, Dennis P. Lockhart, also indicated a September move was an option. Mr. Lockhart is not a voting member of the committee, however, so his comments carry a bit less weight than those of Mr. Evans.
On Wall Street, which has benefited from the Fed's accommodative stance, stocks dropped after the comments, and major market indexes closed lower by a little more than half a percentage point.
The Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have signaled that the central bank's policy of buying $85 billion a month in government bonds and mortgage-backed securities will be wound down if the economy improves further and unemployment continues to fall.
Mr. Bernanke has said he envisions the stimulus program coming to an end by the middle of next year if unemployment falls to about 7 percent. Last Friday, the Labor Department reported that unemployment in July fell to 7.4 percent, from 7.6 percent in June.
Mr. Bernanke has not said, however, when the tapering will begin, only that the speed and timing of any easing is contingent upon continued signs of strength in the economy.
Traders and economists expect bond purchases to be reduced before the end of 2013, but opinion is divided about whether that will start as early as next month or come as late as December.
The Fed's ultimate decision will have wide-reaching impact. The Fed's aggressive bond buying has helped keep long-term interests rates low; mortgage rates have risen by roughly a full percentage point since Mr. Bernanke first raised the possibility of tapering in May. In addition, the stimulus has also helped prop up the big rally on Wall Street.
While the remarks by Mr. Evans and Mr. Lockhart on Tuesday did not resolve the debate, their tone suggested that tapering was indeed on the horizon if the economy held up.
''Adjustments to asset purchases are going to be conditional on our outlook materializing,'' Mr. Evans said. ''It's going to be data-dependent.''
''I do expect though that the outlook will materialize, and we are quite likely to reduce the flow purchase rate starting later this year -- couldn't tell you which month that will be -- and it's likely to wind down, over time, in a couple or a few stages,'' he said.
In terms of September, Mr. Evans said, ''I clearly would not rule it out, it's going to depend on the data -- the data have been not so bad.''
For his part, Mr. Lockhart, the Atlanta Fed president, also said there was plenty of wiggle room for the central bank, depending on how economic growth shaped up over the coming months.
If growth turns out to be weaker than expected, he said, a reduction in stimulus efforts could be put off.
''If we see a deterioration from this point, and I would say my more realistic fear is just a kind of ambiguous picture of mixed data that signal neither accelerating strength nor necessarily deterioration, but that kind of moping along in the middle, then I think it's not a foregone conclusion that the asset purchase program should be removed or removed rapidly,'' he said.
Dean Maki, chief United States economist at Barclays, said: ''Neither Fed president was willing to commit to September nor rule it out. What this is telling us is the F.O.M.C. is keeping its options open and awaiting further data.''

HEADLINE: It's Tycoon Vs. Tycoon Over Mobile

BYLINE: By ALEXANDRA STEVENSON

 BODY:
The hedge fund tycoon Philip A. Falcone may be down, just a month after regulators rejected his settlement over federal charges of market manipulation. But on Tuesday, he showed that he's not out of the game yet.
Mr. Falcone's hedge fund, Harbinger Capital Partners, and its subsidiaries filed a lawsuit against the satellite television mogul Charles W. Ergen, accusing him of colluding with another hedge fund to wrest control of the bankrupt broadband wireless company LightSquared from Harbinger. The lawsuit, filed in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York, contends that Mr. Ergen has been surreptitiously acquiring LightSquared's debt for more than a year.
The fight has the feel of a cowboy-style showdown between two billionaires who have built their reputations on savvy investments. 
For Mr. Ergen, the chairman of both Dish and EchoStar who has a reputation as a firebrand executive, LightSquared is part of a strategy to gain a foothold in mobile data as Dish's satellite TV subscription numbers slow. He has been on the hunt for mobile operators, but recently made a string of failed bids, including a high-profile attempt to take over Sprint Nextel.
For Mr. Falcone, who made billions through Harbinger betting against subprime mortgage market in 2007, the suit is a last-ditch attempt to keep LightSquared in his control. He is racing against time to save the company while also battling civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Their feud is part of a larger, industrywide scramble to acquire what is known as spectrum -- a crucial and limited resource for telecommunications companies seeking to operate wireless networks.
Mr. Falcone's complaint comes just over a week after Mr. Ergen raised a bid for LightSquared to $2.2 billion from $2 billion.
Over the past few years, Harbinger has become best known for its investment in LightSquared, and Mr. Falcone's plan to transform the company into a broadband network that could compete with the likes of AT&T and Verizon has been closely watched.
But his plans have been held up since February 2012, when the Federal Communications Commission refused to grant LightSquared a license to operate a 4G network because of concerns that the network would cause interference with GPS equipment.
Three months later, LightSquared was forced to file for bankruptcy protection after Mr. Falcone failed to come to an agreement with bondholders on how to restructure the company. He continues to battle the GPS industry.
In the lawsuit, Mr. Falcone claims Mr. Ergen secretly acquired most of LightSquared's debt through the hedge fund Sound Point Capital. That, Mr. Falcone contends, allowed Mr. Ergen to bypass the company's credit agreement, which prohibits a competitor from buying LightSquared's debt.
The purchases stymied efforts by Harbinger to work out a plan with creditors to pull LightSquared out of bankruptcy, the complaint says. Mr. Falcone also accuses Mr. Ergen of making a ''lowball, bad-faith bid'' for LightSquared's wireless spectrum through his Dish subsidiary L-Band Acquisition.
Mr. Falcone and Harbinger are seeking damages of more than $2 billion from Sound Point and its managing partner, Stephen Ketchum; SP Special Opportunities Holdings; Mr. Ergen; EchoStar; Dish and L-Band Acquisition.
In response, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, the firm representing SP Special Opportunities, issued a statement saying: ''The Harbinger complaint is without merit and is full of mischaracterizations and factual inaccuracies. All trades relating to LightSquared's bank debt were permitted under the terms of LightSquared's credit agreement.''
Not shy about attracting publicity, Mr. Ergen, who is said to have once been thrown out of a casino for counting cards, appears to be drawn to controversy and litigation. Earlier this year, he made a bid for Sprint and Clearwire that culminated in a heated exchange between Dish and SoftBank, the Japanese phone carrier that also wanted to acquire Sprint.
SoftBank's chief executive, Masayoshi Son, was critical of Mr. Ergen in late April after he topped SoftBank's $20 billion bid, calling Dish's $25.5 billion offer ''incomplete and illusory'' and calling Mr. Ergen a desperate ''amateur,'' at a news conference in Tokyo. Mr. Ergen fired back with a suggestion that SoftBank's acquisition of Sprint would pose a national security risk. Mr. Ergen eventually dropped his bid, clearing the way for Softbank's acquisition.
Mr. Falcone, meanwhile, faces another challenge.
In June 2012, the S.E.C. filed civil charges against him, including one saying that he took a loan from Harbinger Capital to pay his tax bill. The director of the S.E.C.'s enforcement division said at the time that the case ''read like the final exam in a graduate school course in how to operate a hedge fund unlawfully.''
In May, Mr. Falcone agreed to pay an $18 million fine to settle the case, including $4 million of his own money. In a sudden and rare turn of events, though, the S.E.C. last month overruled the decision to settle the case. The agency is expected to either take Mr. Falcone to trial or enforce a larger penalty.
Since LightSquared filed for bankruptcy protection, Sound Point Capital, the hedge fund run by Mr. Ketchum, who is also a defendant in Mr. Falcone's case, has been quietly buying up much of the company's secured debt from creditors, according to the complaint. As a result, Mr. Ergen is now the single largest holder of LightSquared's debt.
LightSquared's fate may now rest between its largest shareholder and its biggest creditor. Philip A. Falcone's complaint in Lightsquared's bankruptcy case:

This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A $147 Million Signal of Faith in Atlanta's Public Schools

BYLINE: By KIM SEVERSON; Alan Blinder contributed research.

 BODY:
ATLANTA -- The most expensive public high school ever built in Georgia opens Wednesday in an old I.B.M. office building.
With 11 stories, a 900-car parking deck and views fit for a corporate executive, the school, North Atlanta High, looks very much like the fancy office buildings and glittery shopping strips that populate its Buckhead community.
The school cost about $147 million. That is small change compared with the Robert F. Kennedy high school complex in Los Angeles, built in 2010 for $578 million -- a figure critics liked to point out was more expensive than Beijing's Olympic stadium. 
But in the Deep South, where the median cost of a new high school is $38.5 million, it might as well be the Taj Mahal.
As a result, some in this antigovernment, tax-sensitive part of the country are grumbling, especially since the project was $50 million over its original budget.
''The raw numbers themselves in terms of the cost of construction should give pause to any taxpayer,'' said Edward Lindsey, a lawyer and a Republican member of the Georgia House of Representatives.
But for the Atlanta Public Schools, which are just beginning to recover from a cheating scandal that in March brought indictments against 35 educators, including a former superintendent, the shining new school is being pitched as an important step toward redemption.
About 48,400 students will attend public school in Atlanta this year, about 400 fewer than last year.
''We have a special obligation here,'' said Howard E. Taylor, the new principal. ''The district is digging out of a historic crisis.''
He and other educators say that the new school building is an opportunity to show that a large, urban public high school can be a viable alternative to the rising tide of charter schools, voucher systems and private education.
Some of the 1,400 students who will attend the school this year come from the wealthiest families in the region, but others, Mr. Taylor said, are homeless. Nearly half are black. About 27 percent are white and 20 percent are Hispanic. They speak more than 40 languages.
''If there was ever a model for an urban high school, this is it,'' he said.
The goal is to move the school from its graduation rate of about 61 percent -- a rate so low it helped lead to the ouster of top administrators last fall -- to 90 percent.
The amenities should help. There are a performing arts complex, a broadcast and video center, a cafeteria that looks like a food court, and a rifle range for the shooting team and military programs. The gymnasium can seat 1,800 people.
In the classroom, the school offers an extensive list of advanced placement, international studies and business courses.
''Hopefully, the academics will be as good as the building,'' said Regine Zuber, touring the school with her daughter, Amanda Stevens, 14, this week.
Transforming a 1977 office building that once held about 5,000 workers into a functional and safe high school designed to eventually hold 2,400 was challenging.
Atlanta planners toured two high schools in New York City and studied other large schools, but nothing quite matched the challenges of a concrete edifice on a wooded 56-acre plot of land.
Security was paramount. Fences had to be added around the spring-fed lake that borders part of the school. A system had to be devised to control the 17 building's entrances. Impact-proof safety glass was installed in the floor-to-ceiling windows, and 423 security cameras were tucked into stairwells and hallways, said Jere J. Smith III, the district's director of capital improvements.
He deflected criticism of the school's price. The land, bought in 2011, cost $55.3 million and was a relative bargain driven by recession-era corporate downsizing. Construction was hampered by asbestos and problems with the quality of soil and the abundance of granite on the site. Labor costs were higher than expected.
The cost seems fine to some parents, who say that Buckhead residents live in one of the wealthiest ZIP codes in the South and many pay plenty in taxes.
''This is a nice gift to the Buckhead area from the state of Georgia for all the money we send them,'' said Jennifer Salberg-Kopelman, whose daughter will be entering the 11th grade.
At an open house Tuesday, students were excited. The main criticism seemed to be something that vexes most people who live or work in high-rise buildings.
''My only advice is to invest in better elevators,'' said Mariana Ryes, a sophomore. ''There is no way I am going to get to my classes on time in these.''

BUILDING TO A SHINY NEW HIGH SCHOOL: The new North Atlanta High School has amenities like a video production center, a cafeteria resembling a mall food court and, below, a perennial staple of anatomy lessons.

HEADLINE: Washington Steps Warily On Housing

BYLINE: By BINYAMIN APPELBAUM

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In the seven years since the housing market started to fall apart, politicians of both parties have promised repeatedly to build a better system for financing the American dream of owning a home. There is little sign of progress.
Instead, the stopgap nationalization of housing finance has hardened into one of the most enduring legacies of the Great Recession. The federal government guaranteed about 87 percent of new mortgage loans last year, through Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and the Federal Housing Administration, effectively setting the terms and providing the money for nine out of 10 home purchases and refinanced loans. 
In a speech on Tuesday, President Obama signaled that Washington may finally be returning to the place where the financial crisis started. With the housing market on the mend, Mr. Obama said it was time to ''wind down'' Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.
''I believe that our housing system should operate where there's a limited government role and private lending should be the backbone of the housing market,'' Mr. Obama said in Phoenix, a city that is a symbol of both housing booms and busts.
The president praised a bipartisan Senate effort to replace Fannie and Freddie with a system that would charge lenders for explicit government guarantees of some mortgage loans. And while there is a risk that the cost of borrowing would increase, Mr. Obama also said that he wanted to preserve the wide availability of the 30-year, fixed-rate loans that are preferred by most Americans.
House Republicans are proposing a sharper retreat, preserving only the government's support for lending to lower-income families. Proponents say it, too, would preserve the availability of 30-year fixed-rate loans, though they are not widely available in countries without government-backed systems.
''Washington has suddenly come alive on housing finance reform,'' said David Stevens, president of the Mortgage Bankers Association, who headed the Federal Housing Administration during Mr. Obama's first term. ''We saw nothing substantive prior to this year, but now we're in a housing recovery and the odds have clearly improved given that both the House and Senate have weighed in.''
For all the talk, however, it will be difficult to alter the government's role in housing finance, which has remained substantially unchanged for half a century -- notwithstanding Fannie and Freddie's move from informal to formal wards of the state. That is because Americans like cheap mortgage loans and it is hard to preserve the benefits without the costs of the current system.
Fannie, Freddie and the Federal Housing Administration backed 87 percent of new mortgage loans over the last five years, the same share they backed in 2012, according to estimates by Inside Mortgage Finance, a trade publication. In the years before the crisis, less than 40 percent of the market was government-backed.
The government's heavy hand is holding down interest rates, helping the housing market and the broader economy to recover. The average rate on a 30-year loan was 4.37 percent in July, according to Freddie Mac, a full percentage point above rates earlier in the year, but still very low by historical standards.
There is growing concern, however, that the government's risk aversion and the absence of private competition are suppressing the availability of loans. The average credit score for borrowers whose loans were bought by Freddie Mac rose to 756 in 2012 from 720 in 2006, according to its securities filings.
''Every few days somebody comes in who in my mind should be able to get a mortgage loan, and I have to turn them away,'' said Louis Barnes, a mortgage lender with the Premier Mortgage Group in Boulder, Colo. ''It's like trying to push ice cream out of the wrong end of the ice cream cone.''
Mortgage companies, backed by some federal officials, say Fannie and Freddie are being too aggressive in pursuing refunds from lenders when borrowers default, leading lenders to reject applicants they deem even mildly risky.
Other critics of Fannie and Freddie make the opposite point, that government support for housing, by making mortgage loans more affordable, is distorting the economy. The government, they say, is subsidizing homeownership, with much of the benefit flowing to affluent Americans, at the expense of biomedical research or bridge repairs.
Most of all, demands for an overhaul of the current system reflect the confounding reality that the government, which spent vast sums cleaning up the last housing crash, is still promising to pay for the next one.
''Taxpayers are taking on trillions in risk for no discernible policy goal,'' said Karen Shaw Petrou, managing partner of Federal Financial Analytics, a consulting firm. ''The government is running the market, but there is no coherent policy. You have taxpayers subsidizing mansions in much of the country.''
The list of obstacles, however, only begins with the generic facts that the Republican House and the Democratic Senate are agreeing on legislation of any kind at a historically low rate, and that both parties are bracing for fiscal battles this fall.
The real challenge is drafting a replacement. The terms of the government's involvement in housing finance have remained substantially unchanged because the benefits are wildly popular with powerful interest groups, including banks, builders, real estate agents -- and, of course, homeowners.
Previous generations of politicians created Fannie and Freddie as a means of providing those benefits while pretending the costs did not exist. The companies were declared to be private during the fat years, and their shareholders profited handsomely, even as everyone understood that the government would stand behind the companies during the lean years.
That strategy has probably been exhausted, as Washington appears to have lost its appetite for implicit guarantees.
That leaves an unpalatable choice between making the cost of the system an explicit government obligation, or making it harder for Americans to buy homes. Any reduction in government support for the mortgage market is likely to increase the cost of home borrowing.
Plans to revive private sources of financing for mortgage loans also need to be harmonized with the government's countervailing efforts to reduce risk-taking by financial institutions. Some analysts are worried that new rules and regulations will limit the ability or willingness of the market to finance mortgage loans.
Alex J. Pollock, a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, said he was confident that lenders would learn to operate within the rules -- or learn to go around them -- but he added that the effort required to do so would be billed to the borrowers.
''Enterprising companies are very able to figure out how to deal with these regulations, but that's not free,'' he said. ''The loans will cost more.''

HEADLINE: Iran's New President Calls for Nuclear Talks Without Rejecting Direct U.S. Role

BYLINE: By THOMAS ERDBRINK; Rick Gladstone contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
TEHRAN -- Iran's new president, Hassan Rouhani, on Tuesday used his first news conference to call for serious negotiations to solve the decade-long dispute over the country's nuclear program, and he repeatedly suggested openness to direct talks with the United States, an idea that until recently had been unthinkable for many years.
At the same time, Mr. Rouhani said Americans needed to take the first step in the stalled nuclear negotiations, and he would not specify what his country would be prepared to do, if anything, to make those negotiations advance. While the tone of Mr. Rouhani's remarks appeared more accommodating than that of his predecessor, he broke no new ground on Iran's position regarding the nuclear dispute, the most serious international issue confronting the country. 
''As the president of the Islamic Republic of Iran, I state that the Islamic republic system is very seriously determined to solve the nuclear issue. It will defend its people's rights and at the same time will remove the concerns of the other party,'' Mr. Rouhani said.
''What matters to us is a practical response from the U.S. government, not statements,'' he said. ''If we feel that the Americans are truly serious about resolving problems, Iran is serious in its will to resolve problems and dismiss worries. If they are serious, too, naturally things will go ahead, and we will see practical results.''
Numerous times during the question-and-answer session, Mr. Rouhani referred to unspecified ''warmongering pressure groups'' that he accused of confusing the White House at the behest of an unidentified country.
Mr. Rouhani apparently was referring to pro-Israel advocates of strong sanctions against Iran that have publicly praised Congress in recent days for advancing legislation that would greatly intensify the economic consequences on Iran unless it halts uranium enrichment.
Israel's government, which regards Iran as an existential threat, has accused the Iranians of working toward production of a nuclear weapon, an accusation they have repeatedly denied. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel has described Mr. Rouhani as a ''wolf in sheep's clothing'' and has asserted that Mr. Rouhani's election on June 14 did not portend a policy change.
Mr. Rouhani never made any explicit reference to Israel at his news conference. But he said that the interests of ''one foreign country'' had been imposed on Congress, and that ''even the interests of the U.S. are not considered in such actions.''
Mr. Rouhani also said, ''We advise that the White House come out of its current confusion, see the realities and make decisions based on them.''
The State Department responded to Mr. Rouhani's remarks by reiterating its position that Iran is in violation of United Nations Security Council resolutions requesting a halt to the uranium enrichment.
''We've also expressed an openness to having direct discussions with Iran,'' a State Department spokeswoman, Jen Psaki, told reporters at a daily news briefing. ''But the ball is in their court. We still feel that they need to take steps to abide by their international obligations, and we're not at that point.''
Mr. Rouhani's repeated mention of direct negotiations with the United States made clear that Iran is no longer ideologically opposed to such talks, ending a period of more than three decades in which the subject was a political taboo.
On Saturday, Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stated that he was not opposed to talks over certain issues, but warned Mr. Rouhani that some of Iran's enemies ''do not speak our language of wisdom.''
The new president's choice for foreign minister, Javad Zarif, said in a statement to Parliament that managing relations with the United States would be one of his tasks. Mr. Zarif was educated in the United States, where he spent many years, and is widely seen as Mr. Rouhani's main adviser on foreign policy. His confirmation is expected.
Mr. Rouhani, who presents himself as a moderate within Iran's political system, has been involved in most of Iran's important foreign policy dossiers. He faces enormous problems, many related to the economy's weakness and the international sanctions.
In a new twist for an Iranian president, Mr. Rouhani's social media aides sent English-language Twitter messages about his news conference as he conducted it, even using American-style colloquial shorthand common among Twitter users. ''Provided that our natl interests are met, we have no problems w negotiations w any1 w good intentions, incl US,'' read one posting.
But he gave no indication at the news conference that the uranium enrichment would be compromised.
One Iranian journalist, from the reformist Etemad newspaper, asked how Mr. Rouhani would handle the nuclear issue compared with his predecessors, arguing that the enrichment centrifuges were not worth the economic cost. Mr. Rouhani countered that the program had strong popular domestic support.

HEADLINE: Strong Earnings For Live Nation In Concert Season

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
With the worldwide concert business shaping up to have one of its best summers in years, the music and ticketing company Live Nation Entertainment on Tuesday reported strong earnings for its second quarter. 
Live Nation, the world's biggest concert promoter and the owner of Ticketmaster, had $1.7 billion in revenue for the three months that ended in June, up 8.3 percent from the same period last year. The company's net income was $59 million, or 30 cents a share, about 20 cents above analysts' expectations.
Live Nation's division that puts on concerts, its biggest business segment, had $1.2 billion in revenue, up 11 percent. In a conference call with investors, Michael Rapino, the chief executive, called the results ''a set-up for what looks to be a record summer.'' Concert ticket sales for the first six months of the year were up 26 percent from the same period of 2012, propelled by tours by Beyoncé, Rihanna and Kid Rock.
Closing at $16.32, Live Nation's stock declined 1.86 percent for the day, but was up about 6 percent in off-hours trading. Since the beginning of the year, its stock price has grown more than 70 percent.
Live Nation profits from nearly every segment of the concert business, and is poised to capitalize on improved consumer discretionary spending. As a promoter, the company makes money when attendance is high at concerts and festivals, as well as from advertising and ancillary sales like food and parking; as a ticketer, it also collects a portion of the surcharges added to each ticket.
After years of steady growth, the concert industry was badly hit by the recession in 2010, but it has gradually recovered. Pollstar, a trade magazine, said that ticket sales for the top 50 tours was up 23 percent, to $1.8 billion, for the first half of the year.
One area of the music business in which Live Nation has been particularly aggressive is in the popular electronic dance genre. The company has bought several concert and festival promoters over the years, and says that it now has 17 festivals across the United States and Europe, which this summer it expects will draw 2.5 million people.
In the conference call, Mr. Rapino also confirmed one of the most closely watched deals in the concert business: Live Nation's investment in Insomniac, the promoter behind the Electric Daisy Carnival series of dance festivals. When news of a possible deal emerged earlier this year, Live Nation was reported to have bought a 50 percent stake in Insomniac for somewhat less than $50 million.
Mr. Rapino did not give details about the transaction on the call. But in a filing on Tuesday with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Live Nation reported a good will charge of $48.1 million ''primarily associated with the May 2013 acquisition of a controlling interest in a company that promotes festivals.''

HEADLINE: Anxiety About Fed Further Deflates Market

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
The stock market slid for a second day on Tuesday after a pair of Federal Reserve officials made comments that left investors uncertain about the timing of a possible reduction in the central bank's economic stimulus program.
Dennis P. Lockhart, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta, told Market News International that the Fed could begin trimming the size of its purchases of Treasury and mortgage-backed bonds, now at $85 billion a month, as soon as September. But he added that the Fed might wait longer if the expected economic growth in the year's second half failed to materialize.
Later in the trading session, Charles L. Evans, the president of the Chicago Fed, echoed that sentiment when he said the central bank would probably reduce its bond-buying program later this year and could do so as early as next month, depending on the economic data. 
Fed officials ''are all hedging themselves, which is why the market continues to just be a little bit confused and why it is going to churn,'' said Kenny Polcari, director of the New York Stock Exchange floor division at O'Neil Securities. ''There is really no reason at the moment for the market to go higher because it is still too unclear'' when the Fed will act, he said.
One catalyst for Monday's downturn in the Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was provided by Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas. He said he supported scaling back the central bank's stimulus next month unless economic data took a turn for the worse.
On Tuesday, the Dow fell 93.39 points or 0.60 percent, to end at 15,518.74. The S.& P. 500 declined 9.77 points, or 0.57 percent, to 1,697.37. The Nasdaq composite index dropped 27.18 points or 0.74 percent, to 3,665.77, erasing very marginal gains on Monday.
The S.& P. 500's decline on Tuesday was its biggest fall since June 24 as investors continued to take profits from the recent rally that drove the Dow industrials and the S.& P. 500 to back-to-back nominal closing highs late last week.
The S.& P. 500 has risen for five of the last six weeks, gaining more than 7 percent over that period.
Trading volume was light for a second day, exaggerating the market's swings.
The biggest drag on the Dow was I.B.M., which fell $4.51, or 2.3 percent, to $190.99 after Credit Suisse cut its rating on the stock to underperform from neutral. The firm also cut its price target on I.B.M. by $25, to $175, saying growth would be a challenge.
Bank of America shares slid 16 cents, or 1.1 percent, to $14.64 after the Justice Department sued the bank, accusing it of defrauding investors by underestimating the risks involved in $850 million of residential mortgage-backed securities.
Retailers' shares were among the day's biggest losers. American Eagle Outfitters plunged $2.40, or 12 percent, to $17.57 after the retailer said its second-quarter profit would be hurt by weak sales and margins. A number of analysts downgraded the stock.
Of the 418 companies in the S.& P. 500 that have reported earnings for the second quarter through Tuesday, Thomson Reuters data showed that 67.5 percent had topped analysts' expectations. On the revenue side, the data showed that 54 percent had reported revenue above estimates.
In the bond market, interest rates were stable. The price of the Treasury's 10-year note was unchanged at 92 12/32, while its yield remained 2.64 percent.

HEADLINE: Poor Children Show a Decline In Obesity Rate

BYLINE: By SABRINA TAVERNISE

 BODY:
After years of growing concern about obesity among children, federal researchers have found the clearest evidence yet that the epidemic may be turning a corner in young children from low-income families.
The obesity rate among preschool-age children from poor families fell in 19 states and United States territories between 2008 and 2011, federal health officials said Tuesday -- the first time a major government report has shown a consistent pattern of decline for low-income children after decades of rising rates.
Children from poor families have had some of the nation's highest rates of obesity. One in eight preschoolers in the United States is obese. Among low-income children, it is one in seven. The rate is much higher for blacks (one in five) and for Hispanics (one in six).
Several cities have reported modest drops among school-age children, offering hints of a change in course. But gains were concentrated among whites and children from middle- and upper-income families, and were not consistent across the country. 
''We've seen isolated reports in the past that have had encouraging trends, but this is the first report to show declining rates of obesity in our youngest children,'' said Dr. Thomas R. Frieden, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which prepared the report. ''We are going in the right direction for the first time in a generation.''
The cause of the decline remains a mystery, but researchers offered theories, like an increase in breast-feeding, a drop in calories from sugary drinks, and changes in the food offered in federal nutrition programs for women and children. In interviews, parents suggested that they have become more educated in recent years, and so are more aware of their families' eating habits and of the health problems that can come with being overweight.
Health officials noted a small decline in the national rate for low-income children for the first time in December, but they did not regard it as important because they lacked a geographic breakdown to show whether the pattern had taken hold in many states.
The new report, based on the country's largest set of health data for children, used weight and height measurements from 12 million children ages 2 to 4 who participate in federally funded nutrition programs, to provide the most detailed picture of obesity among low-income Americans.
It included data from 40 states, as well as the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands. Ten states were not included because of incomplete data. Trained health professionals took the children's measurements.
''This is the first time we have this many states in the U.S. showing a decline,'' said Heidi Blanck, a senior researcher at the C.D.C. ''Until now, it has been a patchwork.''
Researchers last analyzed these data in 2009, when only 9 states and territories had obesity declines and 24 had increases. In the report on Tuesday, the proportions were reversed, with only 3 states experiencing increases and 18 states and the Virgin Islands showing declines; 19 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico were flat. The declines were modest: Most states dropped by less than 1 percentage point.
More children were added to the study because of a drop in their income during the economic downturn, leading researchers to investigate whether the decline could be attributed to an influx of new children with lower weights. They concluded that it was not, Dr. Blanck said.
Researchers agreed that the decline was real and held good implications for future health in America. Children who are overweight or obese between age 3 and 5 are five times as likely to be overweight or obese as adults, creating a higher risk of heart disease, stroke, diabetes and cancer.
But there was little consensus on why the decline might be happening.
Children now consume fewer calories from sugary beverages than they did in 1999, Dr. Blanck said. More women are breast-feeding, which can lead to healthier weight gain for young children. Federal researchers have also chronicled a drop in overall calories for children in the past decade, down by 7 percent for boys and 4 percent for girls, but health experts said those declines were too small to make much difference.
Another explanation is that some combination of state, local and federal policies aimed at reducing obesity is starting to have an effect. Michelle Obama has led a push to change young children's eating and exercise habits and 10,000 child care centers across the country have signed on.
Many scientists doubt that anti-obesity programs actually work, but proponents of the programs say a broad set of policies applied systematically over a period of time can affect behavior.
''We can't prove what are the changes in environment and policy that led to'' the declining rates, Dr. Frieden said. But he added that it was hard to believe that the government policies now in place ''aren't having a big role here.''
Tom Baranowski, a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine who has been skeptical about government interventions, said obesity has as much to do with genes as it does with behavior. ''It could be that we are hitting some sort of a biological limit,'' he said, in which ''all those who are genetically predisposed to being obese already are.''
At the Union Baptist Harvey Johnson Head Start, a bright preschool in Baltimore, the focus is on behavior. Children now get health lessons, field trips to a grocery store, healthier meals and an hour of exercise a day on a new jungle gym. Instructors measure children's height and weight and a nutritionist counsels parents. The income threshold for a family of three is under $20,000.
The share of the school's approximately 250 children who were obese or overweight fell to 33 percent in 2013, from 35 percent in 2010.
In interviews, parents agreed that encouragement from child care programs like Union Baptist, as well as warnings from doctors, had helped. But just as important, they said, were health worries that have taken hold in low-income communities because of the epidemics of obesity and diabetes.
Shannon Freeland, a 35-year-old pharmacy tech instructor, said both her grandmothers died in their 50s. One, who weighed 300 pounds, had a heart attack, while the other died from diabetes after amputations that began with her toes and ultimately took both legs.
''Grandparents aren't supposed to pass like that,'' said Ms. Freeland, whose first child, Iren, was overweight as a toddler. ''That's when it started to click for me.''
She added, ''We were pricking Iren's finger at age 2, and that was scary for me.''
Ms. Freeland said it was still hard to eat better, partly because it is expensive, but also because with three children, the pull of fast food is strong. She has tried shopping at Whole Foods, but said she cannot afford it. But since going back to college for a degree in public health, she has become more aware of her family's food habits. Many of her friends are also back in school, avoiding a grim job market.
''People look at Head Start moms and say, 'Oh they're just low income and that's it,' '' she said. ''I think parents have changed. Our income may still be low, but we're more educated.''

HEADLINE: The Growing Popularity of Having Surgery Overseas

BYLINE: By ELISABETH ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
As health care costs in the United States rise, an increasing number of Americans are going overseas for elective procedures, or are at least considering that possibility.
In response to an article in The New York Times on Sunday about an American who went to Belgium to have his hip replaced because his insurer in the United States would not cover the procedure, hundreds of readers said they would be willing to follow that path.
Michael Shopenn's surgery in 2007 would have cost close to $100,000 in the United States. But it cost just $13,660 -- including all medicine, doctors' fees and round-trip airfare -- at a private hospital in Torhout, Belgium. The Belgian government regulates medical fees, though most doctors' offices and hospitals are privately run. 
''In the past few years, Americans are definitely more willing to go overseas and now appreciate that there is quality there, whereas seven years ago they didn't have that perception,'' said Jonathan Edelheit, the chief executive of the Medical Tourism Association, an industry group that supports and facilitates such travel.
The growing numbers of American medical tourists tend to be people who do not have insurance or whose insurance does not adequately cover the procedure they need. Their destination often depends on their cultural ties, Mr. Edelheit said. Spanish-speaking patients might favor Latin America, for example, he said.
While five years ago most American patients who went abroad for cheaper care went to countries like India and Thailand and over the border to Mexico, many are now going to Europe, where care at top hospitals frequently costs a fraction of what is charged in the United States. There are private facilitators who help make the arrangements, pairing patients with doctors and hospitals and arranging travel plans.
In the last few years, governments and hospitals in Europe have entered the field and are now promoting their services.
''The idea is to make it easier for patients from overseas -- whether from North America, Russia or the Middle East -- to see Europe as a solution because of its high quality and reasonable prices,'' said Balazs Stumpf-Biro, the executive director of the European Medical Travel Alliance, an industry group.
People from the East Coast tend to head to Europe, while many from the West Coast go to Asian countries like South Korea or Thailand, Mr. Stumpf-Biro said. ''The numbers are really growing because of the costs in the U.S.,'' he added, ''but the main driving factor is quality and a common background.''
Dr. Fabrice Gaudot, an orthopedist with a private practice in Paris, said that his clinic treated a lot of foreigners and that the total price for a hip replacement was about $13,000, which he called expensive by French standards. Implant prices are about one-fifth as much in France as in the United States, he said. The patient and the doctor settle on a price and by law must sign a contract before surgery.
Hospitals in English-speaking countries offer an obvious advantage for Americans. A consortium of hospitals and health care providers in Northern Ireland is exploring setting up a program to attract and treat foreign patients.
But before readers start booking tickets to Europe, they should know that several programs are in the works to lower the cost of joint replacement surgery in the United States. With a huge increase in demand for joint replacements as baby boomers age, holding down costs is important to companies as well as patients.
The average price of a hip replacement rose from about $35,000 in 2001 to about $65,000 in 2011, according to Truven Health Analytics. The number of such procedures each year for patients under 65, paid for by commercial insurers, rose to about 90,000 from less than 30,000.
The California Public Employees' Retirement System set a so-called reference price of $30,000 for joint replacement surgery for those it covers. If patients choose a hospital that charges more, they must pay the difference.
A study by James C. Robinson, a health economist at the University of California, Berkeley, that was published on Monday in the journal Health Affairs found that the program was a two-pronged success: a majority of patients chose hospitals that met the price. More important, many hospitals reduced their price so patients would be more likely to choose them.
In two years, the program saved California $6 million and saved patients $600,000 in costs and co-pays, Dr. Robinson said.
Medical tourism, it turns out, does not have to be international. (Medicare does not currently cover joint replacements outside the United States.) Some economists point out that health plans in New York City, a relatively expensive market, could save money by sending their patients to Buffalo in limousines.
Services like MediBid allow patients to shop online for lower-priced medical care, whether local or in another state. Ralph Weber, the chief executive of MediBid, said the service recently sent a patient to Glendale, Calif., for a hip replacement for $14,450 and another to San Antonio for $19,000 -- comparable to European rates.
''When companies make a large purchase of machines, they ask for a few bids, but that doesn't normally happen in medicine,'' Mr. Weber said. ''When providers have to compete with transparency, the rates come in lower.''

HEADLINE: Indian Rupee Falls to Record Low

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- The Indian rupee lurched to a record low against the dollar on Tuesday, shrugging off recent measures aimed at propping it up and underscoring the severe problems facing the economy as the country heads toward an election next year. 
The rupee has slumped nearly 15 percent since May, when the possibility of scaled-back bond purchases in the United States prompted foreign cash to flee emerging markets around the world. The Indian central bank reacted last month with several steps to support the currency, but the rupee continued its slide Tuesday, falling to 61.71 per U.S. dollar by late afternoon.
Stemming the rupee's rapid decline will be one of the first tasks for the next governor of the Reserve Bank of India, the nation's central bank. Reuters reported Tuesday that the Indian government appointed Raghuram Rajan, the chief economic adviser in the finance ministry, to the post. According to a statement by the finance minister, Mr. Rajan will replace Duvvuri Subbarao, whose tenure ends on Sept. 4 after five years, Reuters reported.
Mr. Rajan joined the Indian government last August, after serving chief economist at the International Monetary Fund and a professor at the University of Chicago.
India's fundamental problems, said Rajiv Biswas, Asia-Pacific chief economist at IHS Global Insight in Singapore, are a ''chronic current account deficit,'' which has worsened over the years, and a big outflow of foreign capital since Ben S. Bernanke, the chairman of the United States Federal Reserve, signaled in May that the American economy may soon be ready to be weaned off the massive bond purchases that have bolstered its economy since the global financial crisis.
''Last year, they were able to deal with the current account deficit because capital inflows were strong,'' Mr. Biswas said. Now that the money is ebbing away, the rupee is coming under systemic pressure, he said.
More broadly, much-needed economic overhauls -- like improving the country's infrastructure and cutting red tape -- have been notoriously tough to push through, while a slowdown in growth in recent years has made the country less attractive to foreign investors, despite the potential offered by a huge, young population.
The pace of expansion has slowed to about 5.5 percent this year from more than 8 percent in 2009 and 2010, and the latest purchasing managers indexes for the manufacturing and services sectors, released by the British bank HSBC, both slipped in July.
''There are few good signs on the economic horizon,'' Mr. Biswas said, ''and there is not a great deal that either the government or the central bank can do in the short term.'' He added that slowing growth had further reduced the government's room to maneuver.
The slide in the rupee, moreover, will probably make things worse, analysts warned.
Although a cheaper rupee makes Indian exports less expensive for consumers abroad, the effect provides relatively little lift to the Indian economy, as the country is far less reliant on exports than many of its Asian peers.
Meanwhile, the weaker currency raises India's import bills for dollar-denominated goods like oil, of which the country is a big importer, adding pain to an already slowing economy and potentially fueling inflation to worrisome levels further down the line.

HEADLINE: Justice Dept. Sues Bank Of America

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
The Justice Department sued Bank of America on Tuesday, accusing the bank of defrauding investors by vastly understating the risks of the mortgages backing some $850 million in securities.
The lawsuit adds to the hefty legal burden of the bank, which has been badly battered by mortgage-related losses and litigation since the financial crisis. The great bulk of those troubles stem from the bank's 2008 acquisition of the subprime lender Countrywide Financial.
Yet the latest litigation centers on Bank of America's own homegrown mortgage operations. And the loans at issue were represented as prime jumbo mortgages -- at the time, 2007, loans of more than $417,000 for a single-unit dwelling -- rather than subprime mortgages, which were at the heart of the mortgage crisis. 
Those new elements were woven into a familiar narrative as the Justice Department's lawsuit portrayed the bank's mortgage operations as emblematic of Wall Street's reckless practices in the heady days before the financial crisis.
Under pressure to generate profits, the lawsuit said, Bank of America pushed employees to churn through mortgage evaluations. The instructions for slipshod standards emanated from the upper echelons of the bank, the lawsuit said.
One employee, according to the lawsuit, said that her job was to ''basically validate the loans,'' rather than to comb through them to spot flaws. The goal, the employee said, was to get through mortgage applications swiftly. She was told by her superiors, prosecutors said, to ''keep her opinions to herself.''
In the end, the prime mortgages turned out to be far more dangerous than investors were led to believe, the lawsuit contends. Bank of America misrepresented the quality of the loans, and five investors lost about $100 million, the government said.
A spokesman for Bank of America contested the government's characterization of its conduct.
''These were prime mortgages sold to sophisticated investors who had ample access to the underlying data and we will demonstrate that,'' Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman, said in a statement.
Bank of America disclosed last week in a corporate filing that it was bracing for an action from the Justice Department. The Securities and Exchange Commission filed a parallel action on Tuesday.
The lawsuit is the latest salvo from President Obama's federal mortgage task force. Eric H. Holder Jr., the United States attorney general, said it was ''the latest step forward in the Justice Department's ongoing efforts to hold accountable those who engage in fraudulent or irresponsible conduct.''
Still more than five years after the housing market imploded, federal prosecutors are still working to pin blame for problems that helped drive the mortgage boom and then its demise. It is an effort that has generated some frustration among the American public, fed up with the lack of criminal prosecutions since the financial crisis, and a slew of civil lawsuits, some of them seemingly repetitive, aimed at banks.
For Bank of America, the lawsuit on Tuesday follows a case from federal prosecutors in New York. In that civil suit last year, federal prosecutors claimed that Bank of America, through its Countrywide Financial unit, defrauded the government by producing loans at such a fast clip that controls were ignored.
The Justice Department's lawsuit on Tuesday also highlights a lack of controls at the bank. An ''unprecedented'' number of the loans packaged and sold to investors came from mortgage brokers, it said. As a result, prosecutors said, the loans were shaky, at best.
At the time, Bank of America's chief executive, Kenneth D. Lewis, described loans that came through such wholesale channels as ''toxic waste,'' according to the lawsuit.
Once the mortgages were originated, the government said, Bank of America deliberately kept investors blind to the risks associated with the ensuing securities. Bank of America, the government said, never told investors that some of the mortgages included were so-called stated income and stated asset loans, meaning that the bank never verified the income the borrowers claimed to have.
Prosecutors said that investors were also deprived of critical knowledge about the underlying mortgages, like the fact that 22 percent of the borrowers were self-employed. The investments at issue were sold in 2008 to five investors, including the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco and Wachovia Bank, which has since been acquired by Wells Fargo.
Without quality controls, the government said, trouble ensued. The number of borrowers that fell behind on their payments was ''abnormally high,'' according to the lawsuit. The turbulence ''cannot be explained solely by the downturn in the real estate market'' alone. According to the government's assessment, at least 23 percent of the mortgages had defaulted or were delinquent as of June 2013.
The lawsuit cites 2007 e-mails from the bank's own securities traders expressing frustration about the quality of mortgages. One trader wrote, some were ''like a fat kid in dodgeball, these need to stay on the sidelines.''
While the accusations add to the pressure on Bank of America, which has been working to move past the crisis, previous government lawsuits against it that began with much fanfare have lost some of their momentum.
In the United States attorney's lawsuit against Bank of America that was filed in October, for example, prosecutors originally said that the problematic home loan program known as the ''hustle'' was kept alive by Bank of America through 2009.
But, last month, the government scaled back those accusations. The program lasted through May 2008, not through December 2009, the government said in a court filing.

HEADLINE: Struggling Market

BYLINE: By MARK SCOTT

 BODY:
LONDON -- Standard Chartered reported on Tuesday that profit fell 24 percent in the first half of the year, as the firm took a $1 billion charge related to its operations in South Korea. 
Although the bank is based in London, its businesses are spread across emerging markets in Asia, Africa and the Middle East, where the financial crisis is starting to take a toll.
Standard Chartered said it had generated net income of $2.1 billion in the six months through June 30, compared with $2.8 billion in the period a year earlier. When adjusted for one-time costs, the firm's pretax profit rose slightly, to $4.1 billion, over the same period, in line with analysts' estimates.
The firm was hurt by a $1 billion charge to its South Korean business, which has been hit by an increasing number of delinquent loans, poor domestic economic conditions and stringent local regulation.
Standard Chartered had announced in June that it would take a charge on its South Korean business. The British bank had expanded its operations there after acquiring Korea First Bank for around $3.3 billion in 2005.
''Korea continues to be our most difficult market,'' Standard Chartered's chief executive, Peter A. Sands, said in a statement on Tuesday. ''We expect that the second half will also be very difficult.''
Shares in Standard Chartered, which generates around 90 percent of its earnings from emerging markets, rose 2.7 percent in morning trading in London on Tuesday.
The bank said loan impairments across its global operations had risen 27 percent, to $730 million, adding that it was not on target for ''double-digit income performance for 2013.''
Last year, Standard Chartered agreed to a combined $667 million in settlements with federal and state prosecutors in the United States related to charges that it had illegally handled money for Iranian banks and corporations.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: The Tea Party's Path to Irrelevance

BYLINE: By JAMES TRAUB. 
James Traub, a columnist at foreignpolicy.com, is writing a biography of John Quincy Adams.

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- THE Tea Party has a new crusade: preventing illegal immigrants from gaining citizenship, which they say is giving amnesty to lawbreakers. Judson Phillips, the founder of Tea Party Nation, recently told Politico that his members were ''more upset about the amnesty bill than they were about Obamacare.''
They're so upset, in fact, that Republican supporters of immigration reform, like Senators Marco Rubio of Florida and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, have become marked men in their party, while House Republicans have followed the Tea Party lead by refusing to even consider the Senate's bipartisan reform plan. 
Tea Partyers often style themselves as disciples of Thomas Jefferson, the high apostle of limited government. But by taking the ramparts against immigration, the movement is following a trajectory that looks less like the glorious arc of Jefferson's Republican Party than the suicidal path of Jefferson's great rivals, the long-forgotten Federalists, who also refused to accept the inexorable changes of American demography.
The Federalists began as the faction that supported the new Constitution, with its ''federal'' framework, rather than the existing model of a loose ''confederation'' of states. They were the national party, claiming to represent the interests of the entire country.
Culturally, however, they were identified with the ancient stock of New England and the mid-Atlantic, as the other major party at the time, the Jeffersonian Republicans (no relation to today's Republicans), were with the South.
The Federalists held together for the first few decades, but in 1803 the Louisiana Purchase -- Jefferson's great coup -- drove a wedge between the party's ideology and its demography. The national party was suddenly faced with a nation that looked very different from what it knew: in a stroke, a vast new territory would be opened for colonization, creating new economic and political interests, slavery among them.
''The people of the East can not reconcile their habits, views and interests with those of the South and West,'' declared Thomas Pickering, a leading Massachusetts Federalist.
Every Federalist in Congress save John Quincy Adams voted against the Louisiana Purchase. Adams, too, saw that New England, the cradle of the revolution, had become a small part of a new nation. Change ''being found in nature,'' he wrote stoically, ''cannot be resisted.''
But resist is precisely what the Federalists did. Fearing that Irish, English and German newcomers would vote for the Jeffersonian Republicans, they argued -- unsuccessfully -- for excluding immigrants from voting or holding office, and pushed to extend the period of naturalization from 5 to 14 years.
Leading Federalists even plotted to ''establish a separate government in New England,'' as William Plumer, a senator from New Hampshire, later conceded. (The plot collapsed only when the proposed military leader, Aaron Burr, killed the proposed political guide, Alexander Hamilton.)
The Federalists later drummed out Adams, who voted with the Jeffersonian Republicans to impose an embargo on England in retaliation for English harassment of American merchant ships and impressment of American sailors. This was the foreshadowing moment of the War of 1812, which the Anglophile Federalists stoutly opposed.
Finally, in the fall of 1814, the Federalists convened the Hartford Convention to vote on whether to stay in or out of the Union. By then even the hotheads realized how little support they had, and the movement collapsed. And the Federalists, now scorned as an anti-national party, collapsed as well.
Contrast that defiance with Jefferson's Republicans, who stood for decentralized government and the interests of yeoman farmers, primarily in the coastal South.
They ruled the country from 1801 to 1825, when they were unseated by Adams -- who, after splitting with the Federalists, had joined with a breakaway Republican faction.
In response, Jefferson's descendants, known as the Old Radicals, did exactly what the Federalists would not do: they joined up with the new Americans, many of them immigrants, who were settling the country opened up by the Louisiana Purchase.
Their standard-bearer in 1828, Andrew Jackson, favored tariffs and ''internal improvements'' like roads and canals, the big-government programs of the day. The new party, known first as the Democratic-Republicans, and then simply as the Democrats, thrashed Adams that year. (Adams's party, the National Republicans, gave way to the Whigs, which in turn evolved into the modern Republican Party.)
Today's Republicans are not likely to disappear completely, like the Federalists did. But Republican leaders like Mr. Rubio and Mr. Graham understand that a party that seeks to defy demography, relying on white resentment toward a rising tide of nonwhite newcomers, dooms itself to permanent minority status. Opposing big government is squarely in the American grain; trying to hold back the demographic tide is quixotic. Professional politicians do not want to become the party of a legacy class.
The problem is that the Tea Party is not a party, and its members are quite prepared to ride their hobbyhorse into a dead end. And many Republicans, at least in the House, seem fully prepared to join them there, and may end up dragging the rest of the party with them.
The example of those early days shows that American political parties once knew how to adapt to a changing reality. It is a lesson many seem to have forgotten.

HEADLINE: Tech Magnates Bet on Booker And His Future

BYLINE: By DAVID M. HALBFINGER, RAYMOND HERNANDEZ and CLAIRE CAIN MILLER

 BODY:
The conference room in the Mountain View, Calif., headquarters of LinkedIn was packed with the stars of Silicon Valley. Top executives of Facebook, Google and Twitter gathered around a table; the billionaire Sean Parker looked on from a back row. The guest of honor: Cory A. Booker, the mayor of Newark.
The stated purpose of the gathering was to give Mr. Booker, already a Twitter fanatic, a seminar on social-networking technologies. But hanging in the air was an electrifying sense of being in the presence of an ascendant politician they believed understood the potential of the new digital world they were shaping.
''He's part of this tide,'' said Gina Bianchini, an entrepreneur who was at the meeting, in May 2009. ''It feels like he's one of us.'' 
Two and a half years later, some of those same Silicon Valley leaders joined forces again on Mr. Booker's behalf. But this time, their efforts resulted in giving Mr. Booker, until then an admired outsider, the equivalent of full-fledged membership in their elite circle: an Internet start-up of his own.
Mr. Booker personally has obtained money for the start-up, called Waywire, from influential investors, including Eric E. Schmidt, Google's executive chairman. A year after its debut, Waywire has already endured a round of layoffs and had just 2,207 visitors in June, according to Compete, a Web-tracking service. The company says it is still under development.
Yet in a financial disclosure filed last month, Mr. Booker, 44, revealed that his stake in the company was worth $1 million to $5 million. Taken together, his other assets were worth no more than $730,000.
That revelation, with just a week left in Mr. Booker's campaign for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, shows how a few tech moguls and entrepreneurs, many of them also campaign donors, not only made a financial bet on the mayor's political future but also provided the brainpower and financing to help create a company that could make him very rich.
Waywire has also provided jobs for associates of Mr. Booker: the son of a top campaign supporter and his social media consultant, who is now on his Senate campaign staff.
The company has a goal: making it easy to ''collect, curate and share'' videos from across the Web. But much about its operations and Mr. Booker's role as chairman appears ill defined.
Mr. Booker declined to answer questions about the details of Waywire's finances, including what percentage of the company he currently owns. A spokesman said Mr. Booker had invested some of his own money in the company but refused to say how much.
Though his involvement in Waywire has been public since July 2012, Mr. Booker did not disclose his ownership interest in the company on his financial report filed with the city and only recently amended the federal form he filed as a candidate for the Senate to reflect his ownership. The spokesman, James Allen, said that the city form was amended Tuesday.
In a telephone interview, Mr. Booker deflected questions about his financial interest. Instead he stressed that he was drawn to exploring technology because he believes it can be, among other things, a democratizing force.
''What was exciting to me was that it was expanding entrepreneurial, economic, and educational opportunities for so many,'' he said.
The value of his shares could rise significantly, analysts say, should the company outrace competitors now puzzling over how to let users sift through the billions of Web video clips to find those that they want to watch. ''Curation is the next big thing to happen to video,'' said James L. McQuivey of Forrester Research.
Mr. Booker has made a national reputation in seven years as the chief executive of Newark, New Jersey's largest city and one of the country's poorest. But his involvement in founding, financing and promoting a private business highlights the significance of his other constituency in the tech industry, which is seeking a bigger voice in national policy in Washington. Such business activities are prohibited for senators and members of the House, but permissible for many elected officials in New Jersey.
A graduate of Stanford, Mr. Booker has nurtured close ties to Silicon Valley: he amassed more than $400,000 in campaign contributions from tech executives and employees for his 2010 mayoral re-election and nearly $700,000 this year for his Senate bid, an analysis of state and federal campaign finance records shows. This spring, the widow of Steve Jobs, Laurene Powell Jobs, and the power couple Marc Andreessen and Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen held a fund-raiser for him.
And as a social media enthusiast, with more than 30,000 Twitter posts, Mr. Booker has cast himself as an ambassador between the high-tech world and his beleaguered city. His aides noted that he had leveraged his relationships to Newark's benefit, including a pledge of $100 million to the city's schools from Mark Zuckerberg, the Facebook founder.
It was during a fund-raising swing in Silicon Valley in 2009, when Mr. Booker was soliciting campaign contributions from Ms. Powell Jobs and the venture capitalists Ted Schlein and Fredric Harman, that the visit to LinkedIn headquarters was arranged. In attendance at the gathering were Jeff Weiner, the chief executive of LinkedIn, and its co-founder, Reid Hoffman (both of whom later invested in Waywire) along with John Ham of Ustream, the live-video service (Mr. Ham is now on Waywire's advisory board), and Sarah Ross, the marketing wizard behind Ashton Kutcher's record-setting Twitter following, who would become a principal in Waywire.
Ms. Ross suggested in an interview that she saw in Mr. Booker a kindred social media spirit. She said she has wondered how the civil rights movement might have been different had the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. had access to Twitter. ''Social media is a movement,'' she said, ''and Cory Booker is a leader in this movement.''
In 2011, Ms. Ross was approached by a friend, Nathan Richardson, an Internet executive who was thinking of starting a new company, to talk about the future of social media. In January 2012, she arranged for Mr. Richardson to join her and Mr. Booker at the Andros Diner in Newark.
Mr. Booker had concerns about ''marginalized voices'' getting lost in the ocean that is YouTube, he said. ''I see high school kids who are doing incredible videos,'' he said, ''but their voices are not breaking into the national conversation.''
The idea of a company soon came together among the three.
Mr. Booker recalled how Ms. Ross pressed him to sign on: '''You know what? You should do it, found the company. Obviously you don't have to be involved -- you've got a full-time job. But found the company.' ''
Waywire was set up in March 2012. The mayor said he saw his role as ''put it into motion, you know, but get out of the way,'' he said.
Interviews show he took a significant role in obtaining financing, however, sending notes to friends, soliciting interest and opening doors for his co-founders, Ms. Ross and Mr. Richardson, who like several investors in Waywire have also donated to Mr. Booker's Senate campaign. Among those he approached was Oprah Winfrey, who also was among the first investors announced in June 2012.
Mr. Booker said it was not hard to raise $1.75 million in seed capital ''because of the power of the idea.''
He reached out to Eric Schmidt of Google, who agreed to become the first investor, though the precise amount of his investment has not been disclosed.
''Cory introduced me to the team and I liked their approach,'' Mr. Schmidt, who is also a campaign donor, said in response to e-mailed questions about Waywire, adding that he also admired Mr. Booker's thinking and oratory.
Mr. Booker and Mr. Schmidt have close ties: Mr. Booker has made multiple appearances at Google events, including its private ''Zeitgeist'' conference for advertisers and business partners in Paradise Valley, Ariz., in 2011. And last summer, he flew Mr. Booker on a jet he chartered to a three-day, private Aspen Institute-style conference in Yellowstone, Mont.
In interviews, Ms. Ross and Mr. Richardson both played down Mr. Booker's day-to-day work on Waywire, saying that he was mainly focused on Newark. Yet Mr. Richardson confirmed that the mayor received a larger percentage of ownership in Waywire than he or Ms. Ross did, though they were the ones who oversaw its launching and continue to manage its operations.
Mr. Booker received the largest stake because of his social media profile, his name recognition and his connections to investors, and he was not expected to run the company, Mr. Richardson said, though Mr. Booker has attended every board meeting, according to another investor. ''Cory is the inspiration architect,'' Ms. Ross said. ''He really is the thought-leader soul part of the business.''
The enhanced percentage is troubling to some ethics watchdogs. ''If you're getting a large percentage just because you're a well-known political figure, that's a little bit problematic,'' said Melanie Sloan, executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ''People tend to prefer their political figures not to be cashing in on their positions of public trust.''
And while Mr. Booker said that investors had been drawn to Waywire because it represented a powerful idea, the company has clearly struggled to find its purpose: it has been variously touted as a site for video-hungry teenagers and a platform to bring people of political passion together. It began with grand ambitions of original content creation and a newsroom in Lower Manhattan; after false starts and technical hurdles, it recently shifted away from generating its own video to focus on getting video from elsewhere and on refining the mechanics of its Web platform, laying off at least eight employees and vacating its temporary Manhattan office space.
The company's employees, some of whom are engaged in unrelated ventures simultaneously, now work ''virtually,'' a spokeswoman said; she would not say how many there were.
There is no question, however, that Mr. Booker's star power has brought attention: Mr. Booker impressed an audience at the South by Southwest conference in March in Austin, Tex., in which he touted Waywire as a way to empower the politically disenfranchised. Other celebrity connections have helped the company: Waywire has put Andrew Zucker, 15, the son of Jeff Zucker, president of CNN, on its advisory board and given him stock options.
While mayor of Newark, Mr. Booker has supplemented his government salary with a frenetic schedule of paid speeches, earning $1.3 million over five years, and bought a small apartment building that had been foreclosed upon in Newark. (His aides noted he also gave much of the money from speaking fees to local charitable endeavors.)
If he should win the Senate seat, he could no longer count on the steady income from honorariums: the Senate prohibits members from accepting speaking fees. He also would have to step down from Waywire's board and stop promoting it, as he does now through his Twitter feed, ethics experts say.
Of course, Waywire's prosperity and the compounding of Mr. Booker's investment are by no means assured. Mr. McQuivey, the Forrester analyst, said the company was still some distance away from being able to muster enough interesting content into what he called ''meaningfully personalized experiences'' to break through.
''Waywire has not fulfilled the promise yet,'' he said.
Still, the bonds between Mr. Booker and the tech industry are likely to be fruitful. The industry, which is seeking to expand its influence in Washington, can use more friends in Congress. And Mr. Booker, who is viewed within the Democratic Party as a future national contender, can benefit from the fund-raising muscle and new media platform that Silicon Valley provides.

HEADLINE: Daring To Fail

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
Secretary of State John Kerry has pulled off a major achievement in getting Israelis and Palestinians to say yes to the United States. Can he now get them to say yes to each other?
I admire Kerry's doggedness in getting Israelis and Palestinians back to the negotiating table for the first time in five years, in part by making clear that whoever said no to America's urging that they resume talks would be called out publicly. I also like the fact that Kerry dared to fail. It is how you make history as a secretary of state. It can also be helpful to him going forward. Even a little success like this breeds more authority, and more authority can breed more success in other arenas.
That said, the prospects for an Israeli-Palestinian deal remain slim. Indeed, if these negotiations were a play, it would be called: ''When the Necessary Met the Impossible.'' 
So why should we even bother? I've always thought that the most important rule of journalism is: Never try to be smarter than the story. There is every reason to doubt that these talks will succeed, but when you look under the hood of this story you find there were some powerful forces propelling both sides to say yes to Kerry -- and at least consider saying yes to each other, so it's worth letting this play out a little.
Let's start with a small item in Britain's Independent newspaper on July 24, which began: ''He once sang, 'You Gotta Get Outta This Place,' but now Eric Burdon is not even turning up at all having deciding to withdraw from a planned concert in Israel. ... The Animals frontman, whose hits include 'House of the Rising Sun,' and 'San Franciscan Nights,' had been due to perform alongside local Israeli bands in Binyamina. ... However, in a statement, Mr. Burdon's management, said: 'We've been receiving mounting pressure, including numerous threatening e-mails, daily. ...''' Burdon was just the latest of a rising number of artists and intellectuals who have started boycotting Israel over the occupation issue.
Israel's continued occupation of the West Bank is isolating the Jewish state more and more. Just before Prime Minister Bibi Netanyahu agreed to these negotiations, the European Union announced new guidelines banning E.U. financing or cooperating with any Israeli institutions in territory seized during the 1967 war. This involves research grants, scholarships and cultural exchanges. The E.U. is considering requiring any products made in West Bank settlements to be labeled as such (some individual E.U. states already do) to make them easier for Europeans to boycott. These are dangerous trends for Israel. The E.U. is one of Israel's largest trading partners. And now add the fact that Palestine has been granted U.N. status as a ''nonmember observer state,'' so President Mahmoud Abbas is positioned to ask the International Criminal Court to investigate Israel's settlement activities in the West Bank, which are widely viewed as contravening international law.
Meanwhile, Abbas was looking at a situation where the turmoil in the Arab world was both sidelining the Palestinian issue and weakening his archrival Hamas, which had been supported by the Syrian regime and Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood. If Abbas -- who foolishly did not take advantage of former Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert's offer of a two-state deal in 2008 -- did not take advantage of this renewed U.S. effort, it is not clear when the next bus would come again for him, if at all.
If all of that explains why both sides felt these talks were necessary, what makes them feel impossible is the sheer accretion of obstacles. There are some 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and at least 50,000 to 80,000 would have to be moved, even after land swaps. There are tens of thousands of Palestinian refugees living outside the West Bank and Gaza who will have to be persuaded that they can return to those two places but never again to their original homes in pre-1967 Israel. Hamas will try to use any Abbas concessions to undermine him, while rightists in Israel will go ballistic over any Israeli givebacks in Jerusalem, while Palestinians will denounce any leader who does not restore a Palestinian foothold there.
And have no doubt: just trying to make peace will have consequences the minute both sides reveal their maps. One should never forget just how crazy some of Israel's Jewish settlers are. They assassinated Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin when he tried to cede part of the West Bank for peace. Nor should one underestimate the capacity of Palestinian hard-liners to generate suicidal violence when left only with despair or a sense that their leadership is selling them out.
But doing nothing also promised disaster -- permanent Israeli control of the West Bank -- and I think the center in both communities has come to see that. I repeat: They did not come to the table by accident or just to please us. But saying yes to each other will require a new kind of leadership from Abbas and Netanyahu. They will have to help each other face down their respective internal opponents rather than use each other as an excuse for not doing so. How and whether they do that is the drama that you're about to see play out. Pull up a chair.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 8, 2013

 CORRECTION:
Thomas L. Friedman's column on Wednesday about peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians misattributed a sentence about a singer, Eric Burdon, to The Independent of Britain. The sentence -- ''Burdon was just the latest of a rising number of artists and intellectuals who have started boycotting Israel over the occupation issue'' -- was by Mr. Friedman. (After withdrawing from a planned concert in Israel, Mr. Burdon decided to go ahead with it, despite pressure not to.)

HIGHLIGHT: Two buyout bids illustrate the rising tide of shareholder power. | The Justice Department sues Bank of America over mortgage securities. | It would not be surprising to see Jeffrey P. Bezos worry little about turning a quick profit at The Washington Post. | Cory A. Booker has obtained money for an Internet start-up from influential investors. 

 BODY:
The $612 million bid by the Weiss family to buy the American Greetings Corporation, the greeting card company the family controls, is not as well known as the headline-grabbing $24.4 billion bid by Michael S. Dell and the private equity firm Silver Lake to buy the computer company Mr. Dell founded. But both deals "illustrate the rising tide of shareholder power, as well as the devilish issues that emerge when management tries to buy a public company," Steven M. Davidoff writes in the Deal Professor column. "And even though Dell's board has changed the voting rules, both companies are being tested by shareholders who view the buyouts as undervaluing their companies."
Both companies are what Wall Street analysts charitably call a melting ice cube, Mr. Davidoff writes. In the case of American Greetings, whose stock traded at a high of $53.75 in 1998, the special committee of independent directors ultimately reached a deal with the bidders in March at $18.20 a share, after the Weisses initially offered $17.18 a share. But the announcement set off shareholder outrage. In the wake of complaints from TowerView, the investment company headed by Daniel Tisch and owner of 6.2 percent of the company, the Weiss family has raised the price to $19 a share. American Greetings shareholders will vote on Wednesday. 
"In years past, shareholder power was a hollow one. Less than 1 percent of deals have been rejected by shareholders. American Greetings will be the first test of this new shareholder attitude," Mr. Davidoff writes. "Will it be that these institutions finally step up and take the risk of running a business?"
U.S. SUES BANK OF AMERICA OVER MORTGAGE SECURITIES | The Justice Department sued Bank of America on Tuesday, claiming the bank defrauded investors by vastly understating the risks of the mortgages behind about $850 million in securities, Jessica Silver-Greenberg reports in DealBook.
Unlike previous legal troubles stemming from the bank's 2008 acquisition of the subprime lender Countrywide Financial, "the latest litigation centers on Bank of America's own homegrown mortgage operations," Ms. Silver-Greenberg writes. "And the loans at issue were represented as prime jumbo mortgages - at the time, 2007, loans of more than $417,000 for a single-unit dwelling - rather than subprime mortgages, which were at the heart of the mortgage crisis."
The lawsuit portrayed the bank's mortgage operations as emblematic of Wall Street's reckless practices in the days leading to the financial crisis. A spokesman for Bank of America contested the government's characterization. "These were prime mortgages sold to sophisticated investors who had ample access to the underlying data and we will demonstrate that," Lawrence Grayson, a spokesman, said in a statement.
A PROMISE OF INNOVATION AT WASHINGTON POST | "The big news in newspapers - that Jeffrey P. Bezos is buying The Washington Post - was not even 24 hours old when shock and wisecracks about the unexpected $250 million deal began to give way to acceptance and even envy," Jenna Wortham and Amy O'Leary write in The New York Times. "Now that he is the private owner of The Post, it would not be surprising to see him worry little about turning a quick profit and instead push to upend the often ossified world of newspaper publishing, just as he did with books more than a decade ago."
ON THE AGENDA | The Carlyle Group, AOL and Time Warner report earnings before the market opens. Mondelez International, Groupon and Tesla Motors report earnings this evening. Tim Armstrong, the chief executive of AOL, is on Bloomberg TV at 8:15 a.m.
CORY BOOKER'S TECH START-UP | Cory A. Booker, the Twitter-using mayor of Newark who has hobnobbed with some of the biggest stars of Silicon Valley, has obtained money for an Internet start-up called Waywire from influential investors including Eric E. Schmidt, Google's executive chairman, The New York Times reports. In a financial disclosure filed last month, Mr. Booker, 44, revealed that his stake in the company was worth $1 million to $5 million. His other assets, taken together, were worth no more than $730,000.
"That revelation, with just a week left in Mr. Booker's campaign for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate, shows how a few tech moguls and entrepreneurs, many of them also campaign donors, not only made a financial bet on the mayor's political future but also provided the brainpower and financing to help create a company that could make him very rich," The Times writes. "Waywire has also provided jobs for associates of Mr. Booker: the son of a top campaign supporter and his social media consultant, who is now on his Senate campaign staff."

HEADLINE: Not Banks, but Still Lending Money and Drawing Investors

BYLINE: RANDALL SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: The success of Lending Club, which links up borrowers with investors who are willing to make loans, has spawned imitators and venture capital backers that are looking for similar results. 

 BODY:
In one sense, much of Internet commerce is largely a matchmaking service, connecting people looking for relationships, taxis or spare bedrooms. One of the hottest areas is the market for personal loans, which is attracting money from venture capital investors, spurred by the fast growth of the largest online platform, Lending Club, and the paper profits for its early backers.
In their simplest form, these marketplaces link borrowers who want to refinance high-interest credit card debt of 20 percent or more with investors looking to beat paltry bank savings account yields of less than 1 percent.
At Lending Club, borrowers obtain three- or five-year personal loans and pay annual interest of about 14.5 percent, depending on their credit scores, which can lift it to as much as 30 percent, with fees. Investors can earn interest rates of about 8.5 percent, the company says. The difference from the average comes from defaults, which cut annual returns by 3.5 percent, and the company's annual fees of 2.5 percent. 
Some of Lending Club's earliest investors, including Norwest Venture Partners, Canaan Partners and Morgenthaler Ventures, are showing paper profits of more than 10 times their investment, based on Lending Club's most recent valuation of $1.55 billion in an investment led by Google in May. Lending Club hopes to complete an initial public offering next year.
That success has drawn the interest of venture capital firms looking for similar results.
"Investing in the networks that light up the sharing economy" for items like rooms and rides "certainly looks like a good idea," Fred Wilson, a managing partner of Union Square Ventures, said in a post on his Web site in July. Union Square invested in Lending Club in 2011 and has put money into multiple platforms. Last year, it backed Funding Circle, which offers small business loans in Britain. This year, it financed the personal-loan marketplace Auxmoney in Germany.
"There is a platform proliferation out there," said Frank Rotman of QED Investors, a group of former executives of Capital One Financial that has invested in four platforms. "Usually that happens when you see one company succeed and people say they want to find the next one. Right now, everyone is trying to find the next Lending Club. They don't want to feel like they missed the opportunity."
The number of significant lending platforms has already grown to roughly 50 worldwide, according to Disruption Credit, an investment firm. The main personal loan platforms in the United States are Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace. On Deck and Kabbage offer small-business lending. Overseas, Zopa and RateSetter offer consumer lending in Britain, as does SocietyOne in Australia. And student-financing platforms include Social Finance, CommonBond, Pave and Upstart.
Disruption Credit's chief executive, Michael Parekh, says such platforms can disrupt Wall Street and traditional banks much like Google has taken on old-style media companies and Amazon.com has taken business from brick-and-mortar retailers. Disruption and other experts cite a vast $2.8 trillion consumer credit market up for grabs.
Lending Club, which just passed the $2 billion mark in total loans made, already has plans to expand into small-business and student loans, and may pursue credit cards, insurance and mortgages. It may also expand globally.
In addition to its original base of individual investors, Lending Club has attracted the participation of a few community banks as well as institutional funds that invest in the loans. It also attracted a later-stage investment in 2012, at about one-third the current value, from the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which has a partner, Mary Meeker, on Lending Club's board. Other directors include John J. Mack, a former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, and Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary. Kleiner's China fund is also backing CreditEase, an online small-business and consumer lender in China.
If Lending Club can complete an I.P.O. on schedule next year, "I believe this will be the financial-tech version of the Facebook I.P.O., a coming-of-age event just like Facebook was for social media," said Dan Ciporin, general partner of Canaan Partners, Lending Club's second-largest shareholder, with a 15 percent stake.
Lending Club expects revenue could roughly triple, to $100 million in 2013 from $36 million in 2012, and could grow to $400 million by 2015. One Wall Street banker said other fast-growing online services like LinkedIn and Priceline.com traded at 7 to 10 times revenue expected for the following year. At that rate, he says, Lending Club could be worth more than $3 billion in an I.P.O. next year.
"I think this is viewed by venture capitalists as incredibly disruptive and rapidly scalable," said Ron Suber, head of institutional sales at Prosper Marketplace.
Pat Grady, a partner at Prosper's chief venture backer, Sequoia Capital, said big banks might be hobbled by their "legacy infrastructure" and "incumbent inertia." He added, "In some ways, the sky's the limit. There's nothing that says the banks of yesteryear have to be the banks of tomorrow."
At a presentation in June at the inaugural Lendit conference for the nascent sector in New York, Lending Club's founder and chief executive, Renaud Laplanche, compared its rapid embrace by customers to the adoption of electricity, color television, stoves and washing machines, saying he plans to "transform the banking system."
Some platforms are adept at gleaning online data about their customers. Borrowers, for example, must agree to allow Lending Club to obtain data from their employers' payroll processors. And the small-business lender On Deck has developed methods for evaluating borrowers based on dozens of online sources.
But some investors still have doubts.
One skeptical venture investor says such lending sites have flourished in an environment of a pullback by banks from unsecured consumer lending, an improving economy and a steep decline in interest rates on other investments, starting with savings accounts. Other experts note that banks have a big advantage in rock-bottom financing costs.
"There's been an explosion of new companies using the Internet to originate loans," said Josh Koplewicz, founder of Thayer Street Partners, an investment firm that focuses on technology and financial services. "The barriers to entry are low. There are people setting up shop with a couple hundred thousand dollars." But aside from a few big names like Lending Club, he says, it may be difficult to create enterprise value without some edge in access to borrowers.
Indeed, some venture firms' investments have already shown paper losses. For example, the stakes of venture firms including Accel Partners and Benchmark, which invested in Prosper Marketplace from 2005 to 2010, fell in value in January when Sequoia rebooted the company with a new round of financing and a new management team.
Prosper, which started offering loans in 2006, just before Lending Club, had offered higher rates and riskier loans, which led to investor losses in the 2008 market collapse. Prosper also clashed with securities regulators over whether its offerings should be subject to disclosure rules.
Both Prosper and Lending Club temporarily curtailed their loan offerings in 2008 after the Securities and Exchange Commission required that loans offered to average investors be registered publicly; Prosper recently reached an agreement to settle a class-action investor lawsuit over the losses. Amid the economic slump, Zopa in Britain abandoned its own costly push into the United States. And some fledgling entrants like Loanio and Pertuity Direct shut down.
Even after meeting the S.E.C.'s requirements, Lending Club and its rivals have had run-ins with regulators. Lending Club can offer its loans to investors in only 26 states but thinks those limits would melt away after an I.P.O. Both Florida and Missouri fined the company $100,000 each last year for selling unregistered securities because Lending Club had allowed its registrations there to lapse.
In June, Ohio securities regulators filed charges against SoMoLend, an online small-business lender, accusing it of securities fraud and unregistered securities sales. SoMoLend, which declined to comment on pending talks with the regulators and on a hearing set for October, has halted transactions with individual investors in the state.
Some Lending Club investors and executives are hedging their bets, taking some chips off the table even before an I.P.O. Both Canaan and Morgenthaler sold some of their shares in a $125 million stock sale in May. About 30 Lending Club employees, including Mr. Laplanche, sold an average of less than 5 percent of their stock as well. Insiders also sold in a recent On Deck financing.
At the moment, the wind of the market is at Lending Club's back. With broad United States market indexes up more than 18 percent this year, social media and social commerce stocks have been surging even more.
Facebook, up 46 percent this year, recently regained its I.P.O. price after 14 months below that level. The real estate marketplace Zillow has tripled this year, and the business network LinkedIn and business-review site Yelp have doubled.

HEADLINE: Blackstone Is Expected to Sell Hilton in I.P.O.

BYLINE: MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED


HIGHLIGHT: The move by Blackstone matches a trend by private equity firms that are cashing in on their portfolio companies while the stock markets are rallying. 

 BODY:
Updated, 8:10 p.m. | As private equity firms rush to cash in on their investments, the Blackstone Group is moving to sell one of the biggest companies to go private in recent years.
Hilton Worldwide, the hotel giant that Blackstone bought six years ago, has begun preparations for an initial public offering, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. That includes hiring four banks - Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley - to start the process.
An offering for Hilton, whose more than 4,000 properties are as diverse as Hampton Hotels and the Waldorf-Astoria in Midtown Manhattan, would probably be in the first half of next year, one of these people said. 
A Hilton spokesman declined to comment.
Private equity firms have been eager to sell their companies, either outright or through an initial offering, to take advantage of booming stock markets and generate realized profits for themselves and their limited partners.
That has served to bolster the financials of the alternative investment giants. Last month, Blackstone reported a tripling of its second-quarter profit thanks in part to cashing out of its investments. And Wednesday, the Carlyle Group said its quarterly profit jumped nearly fourfold, and distributable earnings rose 41 percent, again partly to sales of its portfolio companies.
The markets have pushed up the value of assets so high, in fact, that some alternative investment firms have slowed down their core business of buying up companies to focus on selling their existing holdings.
Generating real profits from portfolio companies has also aided in fund-raising efforts, with successful exits serving as helpful talking points with new and existing investors.
Blackstone has been among the more active sellers within the industry. In the second quarter alone, it held an I.P.O. for SeaWorld Entertainment, the home of Shamu the killer whale, and sold additional shares in companies like Nielsen Holdings, the media measurement giant. It also was working on a potential initial offering of a smaller hotel chain, La Quinta, a person briefed on that process said.
Still, Hilton will be one of the biggest divestitures by a private equity firm in the last several years. The company is now among Blackstone's single biggest investments.
The hotel chain's sale in the summer of 2007 for $26 billion was the last of the giant leveraged buyouts struck during the credit boom that ended later that year. It was also the biggest-ever takeover of a hotel company.
But the hotelier soon began to struggle amid the crashing markets for debt and commercial real estate. Business and leisure travel also dropped in 2008 and 2009. Blackstone eventually reached a deal to cut its portfolio company's debt by several billion dollars.
Hilton has since flourished, as the economy has rebounded and consumers have begun traveling again. Such is Hilton's rebound that Blackstone's chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, spoke of the company's 17 percent rise in pro forma earnings for the first half of the year during the private equity firm's second-quarter earnings call.
Publicly traded hotel companies have also been performing well. Shares in Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and in Hyatt Hotels have risen by more than 15 percent so far this year.
Blackstone executives said that more opportunities to cash out of investments abounded for portfolio companies. The firm's president, Hamilton E. James, told analysts during the earnings call that possible ways to exit investments included more I.P.O.'s, outright sales and special dividend payments.
News of the banks' hiring was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Reveals It Faces Criminal and Civil Inquiries

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS


HIGHLIGHT: The bank is under investigation in Philadelphia and California and is accused of flouting federal laws with its sale of subprime mortgage securities. 

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase disclosed on Wednesday that it faced a criminal and civil investigation into whether it sold shoddy mortgage securities to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis, the latest legal threat to the nation's biggest bank.
JPMorgan acknowledged for the first time the existence of the investigation - one of several mortgage-related problems looming for the bank - in a quarterly regulatory filing. It said that the civil division of the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of California, which covers a stretch of land that includes Sacramento and Yosemite, has "preliminarily concluded" that JPMorgan flouted federal laws with its sale of subprime mortgage securities from 2005 to 2007. The parallel criminal inquiry, according to one person briefed on the matter, is in a more preliminary stage. 
Adding to scrutiny of the bank, federal prosecutors in Philadelphia are examining whether JPMorgan duped investors into buying troubled mortgage securities that later imploded, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The prosecutors are investigating whether JPMorgan churned out the mortgage-backed securities without ensuring that the investments met underwriting standards, the people said.
Representatives for the bank and the federal prosecutors declined to comment. 
Once a darling in regulatory circles, JPMorgan has become a magnet for scrutiny in recent years, drawing attention from at least eight federal agencies, a state regulator and two European nations. The authorities are investigating the bank in connection with its financial crisis-era mortgage business and a $6 billion trading loss in London last year, among other issues.
As the investigations drag on, the bank is racking up significant legal costs. To help cushion against potentially hefty payouts to the authorities, JPMorgan recorded a $678 million expense for additional litigation reserves in the second quarter, up from $323 million in the same period a year ago, according to the filing on Wednesday. 
The bank also estimated it could incur up to $6.8 billion in losses beyond its reserves, nearly $1 billion more than the first quarter of the year.
JPMorgan is hardly the only Wall Street firm taking heat in Washington. The investigations into the bank are playing out as prosecutors increasingly take action against Wall Street firms that bundled mortgages into complex investments in the heady days of the housing boom.
 On Tuesday, Bank of America found itself in the government's cross hairs when the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of defrauding investors by greatly overstating the quality of mortgages backing roughly $850 million in securities. The bank contested the accusations.
The lawsuit was the latest volley from President Obama's federal mortgage task force, which has vowed to hold financial firms accountable for their role in the mortgage boom and bust that threatened to topple the American economy. 
The working group's first action came last October, when the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, took aim at Bear Stearns, the firm that JPMorgan acquired during the depths of the financial crisis. The firm, Mr. Schneiderman said in a lawsuit, sold securities between 2005 and 2007 that caused roughly $22.5 billion in losses for investors.
Investors were assured, the lawsuit said, that the firm scoured the loans packaged into the investments to assure their quality. In fact, the prosecutor contended, there was little vetting.
JPMorgan is fighting the lawsuit.
A month later, however, JPMorgan agreed to a $296.9 million pact with the S.E.C. to resolve unrelated claims that Bear Stearns duped mortgage investors by failing to disclose some delinquent loans. JPMorgan did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
JPMorgan is also one of 18 banks that a federal regulator accused of selling troubled loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac - the government-controlled mortgage finance giants - without fully disclosing the potential risks. The regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, recently rejected a settlement offer from JPMorgan, the people briefed on the matter said, raising the prospect of a drawn-out legal battle.
In the latest investigations out of California and Philadelphia, federal prosecutors are examining whether 
JPMorgan ignored evidence of broad flaws among the loans that were ultimately pooled and sold to investors, the people briefed on the matter said. The California investigation is aimed at the mortgage business that JPMorgan inherited after its purchase of Washington Mutual, the people said. It is unclear what prompted the inquiry in Philadelphia.
 Facing the onslaught of unwanted attention, JPMorgan has moved to settle some cases. The bank recently struck a $410 million settlement with the nation's top energy regulator, which had accused the bank of devising "manipulative schemes" to transform "money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers."

HEADLINE: Too Much Work?

BYLINE: LINDA GREENHOUSE


HIGHLIGHT: Appointing judges to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court is only one of many duties the chief justice has these days in addition to judging. 

 BODY:
Americans have undoubtedly learned more in the past couple of months about the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its extensive powers than in the previous 35 years of the court's existence. But it shouldn't have taken the renegade intelligence analyst Edward J. Snowden to let us in on a fact that, while hardly secret, had been little noticed: in establishing the court, Congress gave the authority to name its judges to one individual, the chief justice of the United States.
As Charlie Savage reported in The Times last month, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. has used that authority to name Republican-appointed judges to 10 of the court's 11 seats. (While Republicans in Congress accuse President Obama of trying to "pack" the federal appeals court in Washington simply by filling its vacant seats, they have expressed no such concern over the fact that the chief justice has over-weighted the surveillance court with Republican judges to a considerably greater degree than either of the two other Republican-appointed chief justices who have served since the court's creation in 1978.)
Theensuing controversy is, I think, a good thing. The country is overdue for a discussion about whether we have given the chief justice - any chief justice, not just this one - too much to do. 
While provoked by the question of whether Chief Justice Roberts has made the best choices for a particular court, the issue is a good deal deeper. The office of Chief Justice of the United States has grown enormously in recent decades in responsibility and complexity - not because of power-grabbing chief justices but because Congress has piled onto the office a large number of added responsibilities. What was Congress thinking when it told the chief justice to choose 11 federal district judges to sit on the foreign intelligence court, as well as the three additional judges who sit to review the special court's decisions? (The selections aren't subject to approval, or even consultation, anywhere else in the government.) Or how about other statutes that give the chief justice similar authority to staff other specialized courts and judicial bodies?
Congress has, for example, instructed the chief justice to choose the seven members of the judicial panel that consolidates mass tort cases and chooses which court to send them to for trial; this may sound like a fairly technical matter, but these tend to be huge cases with far-reaching economic consequences. The chief justice also chooses the five judges who make up the Alien Terrorist Removal Court (a court established in 1996 to determine whether an alien should be removed from the country for being a terrorist, and which I confess I never heard of until doing the research for this column).
Before the independent counsel statute expired, thankfully, back in 1999, the chief justice chose the three judges charged with naming an independent counsel to investigate allegations of executive branch wrongdoing. The aura of partisanship lingers from that panel's fateful decision in 1994 to name Kenneth W. Starr as the independent counsel to investigate President Bill Clinton. Two of the judges, appointed two years earlier by Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, decided to ditch the experienced and scrupulously nonpartisan incumbent, Robert Fiske. The third judge, John D. Butzner Jr., an elderly Southern Democrat, went along quietly after having dissented internally, a fact revealed by Ken Gormley in his 2010 book, "The Death of American Virtue: Clinton vs. Starr."
These extra duties are in addition to serving as the head of a branch of government consisting of some 2,000 judges and many thousands of other employees, a complex bureaucracy with its own turf battles and sometimes toxic internal politics. The chief justice presides over the Judicial Conference of the United States, which makes policy for the judicial system and speaks on behalf of the judiciary to Congress. While the chief justice doesn't choose the 26 other members of the conference, composed of the chief judges of the federal circuit courts as well as district judges chosen by their colleagues, he selects the more than 200 members of the two dozen committees in which the real work of the Judicial Conference is conducted. Chief Justice Roberts has named 67 judges to senior positions on Judicial Conference committees. According to Russell Wheeler, a visiting scholar at the Brookings Institution and a leading authority on the judicial branch, who analyzed the data at my request, these appointments have been roughly proportional to the judiciary as a whole in terms of whether the judges were appointed by Republican or Democratic presidents.
For the eight associate justices, serving on the Supreme Court is assumed to be a full-time job (although a number of the current justices do find time to maintain active off-the-bench lives of speaking and writing.) Assuming a chief justice's day has only 24 hours, the actual work of judging must account for just a fraction of a normal workweek. In 2006, my Yale Law School colleague Judith Resnik published a list of the federal laws that impose "statutory duties" on the chief justice. She came up with 81 laws and sections of laws (including the expired independent counsel statute.) Chosen almost at random from this list, these include appointing the top administrative officials of the judicial branch, setting salaries for various employees, serving as a trustee of the National Gallery of Art and a regent of the Smithsonian Institution, approving policies governing the Supreme Court library, establishing rules for the handling of classified information, and summoning the attorney general to address the Judicial Conference on "matters related to the United States as a party before the courts."
Debate over whether the chief justice has too broad a mandate is nothing new. It's gone on for years in academic and policy circles. Professor Resnik and Professor Theodore Ruger of the University of Pennsylvania have spoken and written at length of their concerns about the accretion of power in the hands of a single life-tenured official. As Professor Ruger pointed out in a 2004 article titled "The Judicial Appointment Power of the Chief Justice," appointments to special courts are problematic because judges are being selected to serve one specific pre-ordained function, an unusual situation that raises at least the possibility of strategic appointments designed to serve a chief justice's personal policy goals.
In 2009, a group of prominent law professors drafted and sent to Congress a proposal for limiting a Supreme Court justice to seven years as chief justice, much as the chief judges of the lower federal courts, where judges become chief through seniority, are limited by law to a single seven-year term. In a letter to leaders of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, the professors said a limitation on the chief justice's tenure was desirable given that "over time, the powers and responsibilities of the office have been extended into numerous other political, administrative, and non-judicial roles calling for a measure of special accountability." There has been, needless to say, no response from the Hill.
The vigorous insiders' conversation about the chief justiceship rarely breaks through to public attention, as it may have begun to do in the past few weeks. I certainly don't expect any major reversal of a decades-long trend, and it's probably naïve to expect even a small change unless an incumbent chief justice lobbies to be relieved of some of the extra responsibilities. But it's a public conversation well worth having.
One current Supreme Court justice may recall encountering the issue of the chief justice's authority once before. Shortly before his elevation to the Supreme Court, then-Judge Anthony M. Kennedy, of the federal appeals court in San Francisco, heard an appeal from a man convicted of trying to sell defense secrets to Russian spies, who turned out to be F.B.I. agents. The sting operation had been prompted by conversations overheard on a wiretap authorized by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court.
On appeal, the defendant, Thomas P. Cavanagh, raised various challenges to the surveillance court's operation. He argued that because the Constitution gives the president the power to appoint judges, the chief justice couldn't constitutionally appoint judges to the surveillance court. Judge Kennedy wrote the opinion in United States v. Cavanagh for a unanimous three-judge panel, affirming the conviction and rejecting the constitutional argument out of hand.
As authority, Judge Kennedy cited a 1916 decision in which the Supreme Court unanimously rejected the notion that a federal judge nominated and confirmed to one district couldn't validly preside over a trial in another district. (Under one of the statutes on Professor Resnik's list, the chief justice can temporarily assign a judge to sit elsewhere.) The defendant in this old case, Lamar v. United States, argued that the result of his trial by a re-assigned judge had been to "usurp the power of appointment and confirmation vested by the Constitution in the president and the Senate."
"We think merely to state it is to demonstrate its absolute unsoundness," the Supreme Court said in disposing of this argument in a single sentence.
Decisions were shorter in those days. Today's Supreme Court would most likely find its own more verbose way to say the same thing. While critics have raised the question of whether the chief justice's authority to appoint the intelligence court judges comports with the Constitution, I'd be surprised if that argument got traction at the Supreme Court. But as we hear so often from Washington these days, just because something is constitutional doesn't mean it's the best idea, or even a good one.

HIGHLIGHT: A Daimler once driven by Queen Elizabeth II is going up for auction, and Texas state police face heat over invasive searches. 

 BODY:
In which we bring you motoring news from around the Web:
 What has four wheels, four doors and a custom-made holder for a regal handbag? Queen Elizabeth II's 2001 Daimler V8 Super LWB comes to mind, and it's scheduled to hit the auction block in England on Aug. 31. Her majesty put about 11,000 miles on the car, mostly driving herself the 20 miles from Buckingham Palace to Windsor Castle. The Jaguar-built car has 15,242 miles on the clock now. Equipped with a 375-horsepower 4-liter V-8, lambskin rugs and a custom handbag storage space on top of the console, Historics at Brooklands expects the car to sell for more than $40,000.

 A claim that sudden unintended acceleration in a 2006 Toyota Camry caused the death of a woman is headed to a jury trial, according to a report from Automotive News. A jury has been selected, and opening statements in the trial could begin this week. The plaintiffs in the trial said a brake override system could have saved Noriko Uno when her car hit a tree in 2009. Toyota says there is no evidence that she was trying to brake at the time of the crash. The case's outcome could determine how similar claims are handled by Toyota. (Automotive News) 
 According to a report by the Polk automotive research firm, better quality vehicles and a desire by consumers to avoid higher monthly car payments has increased the average age of vehicles on the road to a record 11.4 years. In 2007, before the recession began, the average age of America's vehicle fleet was nearly two years newer. Polk also found that 50 percent fewer cars and trucks were scrapped each year and predicted that the change would help auto repair and parts stores and would increase activity among do-it-yourselfers. (The Washington Post)
 Although black, white, gray and silver are still the dominant colors of America's automotive color palette, a report from NBC News says more colors are becoming available. BASF, which supplies much of the automotive industry with its paint, says that trends and current events affect the color choices of consumers. Paul Czornij, the technical manager of BASF's Color Excellence Group, suggested that higher demand for earth tones seemed to be linked to concern for the environment and that blues and greens had become more popular. Silver, he said, was being surpassed by white in popularity. (NBC News)
 The Texas Public Safety Department has been sued for two separate incidents in which women pulled over by state troopers during routine traffic stops said that the troopers performed unconstitutional full body cavity searches on the side of the road, in full view of passing motorists. In both cases, police stopped a vehicle for a minor infraction, the trooper said he smelled marijuana, then called a female trooper to perform a cavity search. One of the women whose vagina and rectum were searched said the troopers did not look in her shoes and socks. So far, one of the women settled with the department for $184,000, and two troopers have been indicted. Allie Booker, the Houston lawyer representing two of the women, said other people who had experienced the same thing in Texas were coming forward with testimony. (New York Daily News)

HEADLINE: Health Care Inflation and the Arithmetic of Labor Taxes

BYLINE: CASEY B. MULLIGAN


HIGHLIGHT: Data and arithmetic make clear that the Affordable Care Act could have negative effects on employment, despite the optimism of the law&#8217;s supporters, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Casey B. Mulligan is an economics professor at the University of Chicago. He is the author of "The Redistribution Recession: How Labor Market Distortions Contracted the Economy." 
A modest reduction in health care inflation by itself might increase employment or number of hours worked, but the effect will be overwhelmed by new taxes coming into effect in the next two years.
Health care and the labor market are connected because so much of the non-elderly population obtains health insurance through an employer or the employer of a family member. As the decades have gone by, Americans have been spending more and more on health care, largely through their health insurance premiums, to the point that many families cannot afford the kinds of health insurance plans in which middle- and upper-income families take part.
So it's reasonable to wonder whether the health expenditure trends affect the amount of employment in the economy, and thereby whether policy reforms that reduce the rate of health expenditure growth might reverse some of those employment effects. 
The direction of the employment effects of health care inflation is unclear, because it depends on the reasons for rising health care costs. To the degree that rising costs derive from new, valuable (but expensive) pharmaceuticals and medical procedures, rising costs may make people more attached to jobs with health benefits in order to have better access to medical innovations and to pay for them with pretax dollars.

But health economists have also pointed to less benign sources of health care inflation, including excessive malpractice penalties and a number of other health industry inefficiencies that raise employer health insurance costs without creating commensurate value for employees. 
The economists Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra looked at evidence suggesting that malpracticelike sources of health care inflation are economically equivalent to an implicit tax on employers (see Page 612 of their paper). Economists call it an "implicit tax" because it has many economic characteristics of a tax, even though it is not legally a tax; it reduces employee cash wages by the amount of the implicit tax, and incentive-sensitive employees respond by working less.
As the House of Representatives began to consider whether to repeal the Affordable Care Act, David Cutler of Harvard testified about the Baicker-Chandra results and asserted that the Affordable Care Act would reduce average health care costs by about 5 percent by 2015, reduce the health care cost implicit tax on employers and thereby increase nationwide employment more than it would have grown had the Affordable Care Act not been enacted. 
He also organized and signed an economists' letter to Congress asserting that "repealing the Affordable Care Act would produce job reductions of 250,000 to 400,000 annually." The Affordable Care Act was cutting employer costs and Congress needn't worry that it would contract the labor market, they wrote.
Neither Professor Cutler's testimony nor the economists' letter mentioned that the Affordable Care Act also creates explicit taxes on employers, subsidies for layoffs and various implicit taxeson employees with many of the same economic characteristics as taxes on employers.
Other advocates of the Affordable Care Act dismiss the act's work disincentives as negligible, because incentives supposedly have little effect on employment and hours worked. At first glance, it might seem that we have a case of dueling experts, and that we'll never know which effect dominates. But that first impression would be incorrect, because each effect cited above - like the employer mandate or the health care cost reduction - is a tax effect, and simple arithmetic is all that is needed to determine the direction of the combined effect of all of the tax-like provisions.
After I sent Professor Cutler a draft of this post, he responded: "When I was giving my testimony, I was excluding the vast bulk of policies that will affect part-time work, job choice, etc., because I wanted to focus on the overall cost issue. I don't think you can do this right unless you include all the effects." 
He agreed with me that readers of his testimony and letter might get the wrong impression that "repealing the Affordable Care Act would produce job reductions" refers to the act as a whole, when it fact it refers to the cost-reduction provisions by themselves. (He also said that neither his testimony nor my calculations quantify the effect of the health care law on job mobility and on the health of the work force, and that he believes these two employment effects to be large. I will return to those issues in a later post.)
Furthermore, Professor Cutler told me he left out explicit and implicit tax effects because he believed (and still believes) them to be less than the cost-reduction effects, and because he "didn't have a way to add them all up," referring to the various effects. Since Professor Cutler's testimony, I have shown how most of the effects can be added together because cost reduction is a tax effect comparable to the tax effect of the employer mandate, the tax effect of the subsidy for layoffs and so on (see also the methodology in Chapter 3 of my book "The Redistribution Recession"). 
Begin with Professor Cutler's (probably optimistic) estimate that the act will reduce employer health costs by 5 percent as of 2015. Because of the special payroll and income tax treatment of employer health insurance, 1.5 of those five percentage points of savings will accrue to government treasuries, leaving 3.5 percentage points of health care savings for employers and employees. Americans spend about 18 percent of their gross income on health care and 82 percent on other things: saving 3.5 percent on health care is like saving 0.6 percent on their total budget.
(In principle, the government treasuries could use their savings to cut marginal tax rates or increase them less than they would have. But they could also use the savings to pay for additional assistance programs that erode work incentives, so I take the middle ground and assume that the government savings by itself has no effect on marginal tax rates.)
Some cost-reducing provisions in the Affordable Care Act, such as the tax on "Cadillac" health plans or the Independent Payment Advisory Board, may reduce value received by employees at the same time that they reduce employer costs, and therefore affect employment less than cutting implicit employer taxes does. The implicit tax cut effect associated with the act's cost reductions (as estimated by Professor Cutler) is therefore somewhere in the range of 0.3 to 0.6 percentage points, with the 0.6 percentage point case representing the extreme where none of the cost-saving measures reduces employee value.
The Affordable Care Act's explicit taxes on employers, subsidies for layoffs and implicit taxes on employees, together amount to a five or six percentage point addition to the average marginal tax rate on labor income (this includes the fact that many people will not take part in programs for which they are eligible, the tendency of the act to move people off means-tested uncompensated care and the fact that the act implicitly taxes unemployment benefits, as I noted in testimony before the Human Resources Subcommittee of the House Ways and Means Committee). By these calculations, the tax effects that Professor Cutler left out are about 10 times greater than, and in the opposite direction of, those he conveyed to Congress.
Professor Cutler projected that the Affordable Care Act's cost reductions by themselves will increase employment in 2015 by about 400,000, or about 0.3 percent of total employment (see Figure 2 in his testimony). If his estimate of the cost-savings channel is accurate, and I am right that the overall labor market effect of the act is about 10 times larger (in the other direction) than the cost-savings channel, we might then expect the act to contract the 2015 labor market by about 3 percent rather than expand it.
As time goes by and additional research results become available, it increasingly appears that even the experts failed to fully appreciate the labor-market-depressing effects of the Affordable Care Act at the time it was passed.

HEADLINE: The Economics of the Affordable Care Act

BYLINE: DAVID M. CUTLER


HIGHLIGHT: Casey Mulligan&#8217;s negativity about the Affordable Care Act fails to acknowledge how it is likely to reduce health care expenditures, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
David Cutler is Otto Eckstein Professor of Applied Economics at Harvard University. He served as senior health care adviser to the Obama presidential campaign in 2008. 
Will the Affordable Care Act help or hurt the economy? At a time when economic growth remains mild and the employment outlook is mixed, answering this question is of fundamental importance. 
The negative case is easy to understand. The law has a number of provisions that may inhibit employment and growth, including an employer mandate to pay for health insurance coverage (now delayed), increases in the Medicare contribution rate for high-income workers and taxes on medical device companies, health insurance companies and tanning salons. Many economists worry about the economic impact of these provisions (though fewer about the tax on tanning salons).
Casey Mulligan has just presented the gloomy situation on this blog, and he did so well. Professor Mulligan is a serious and concerned analyst; his views are not the rant of those who see death panels lurking around every corner. Indeed, many issues that Professor Mulligan highlights are topics that have drawn public concern; for example, Darden Restaurants (owner of Red Lobster and other chains) drew immense attention - much of it negative - when it announced that it would increase use of part-time labor to avoid the payment requirements for full-time workers under the Affordable Care Act. 
Interestingly, the most widely expected adverse effects of the Affordable Care Act have yet to materialize, despite the fact that it has been in place for nearly three years. As a recent chart released by the President's Council of Economic Advisers shows, hours of work are up in the restaurant industry since March 2010. The same is true in the vast bulk of retail businesses where the option to move workers from full to part time is a real one. It may be that companies are waiting until the employer mandate kicks in - or it could be that the fears of significant adverse effects were overblown.

Additional data from Massachusetts, where a state law was the precursor to the Affordable Care Act, suggests that it is the fears that are overblown. Two studies, one by Jonathan Kolstad and Amanda Kowalski and a second by Lisa Dubay, Sharon Long and Emily Lawton, found very little adverse effect from the employer and individual mandates on employment; workers valued the insurance greatly, so the mandate was actually a benefit for them. 
It is possible that the differences between the Massachusetts and federal laws will lead to a different result for the Affordable Care Act, but at this point the evidence overwhelmingly suggests no need for major worry.
 The Benefits of Cost Reduction 
In looking at the totality of the Affordable Care Act, what is most noticeable for the economy is the good news that it promises for American workers and businesses. The most important component of the act is what it will do to the costs of medical care. For the last 25 years (see Table 5, Page 24, of from the National Federation of Independent Business), small businesses have ranked the cost of health insurance as the most critical problem they face. It is no wonder why: rising health insurance costs are associated with increases in total compensation, reduced competitiveness vis-à-vis other companies and increased human-resource problems.
The link between health costs and employment is increasingly clear. A study by Neeraj Sood, Arkadipta Ghosh and José Escarce shows that industries that provided health care to more of their workers in 1986 had significantly lower employment growth between 1987 and 2005. No similar relationship was observed in Canada, where businesses do not pay for health insurance, confirming the role of health care in the relationship. Another study from Katherine Baicker and Amitabh Chandra looks at area-level cost increases in the United States and reaches a similar conclusion. 
A fundamental question about the Affordable Care Act is thus what it will do to employer spending on health insurance. The act has a number of provisions designed to reduce spending growth. These include the "Cadillac tax" on expensive health insurance plans and a transition of medical care payments away from fee-for-service payment into value-based payments. Economists are virtually united in asserting that a combination of these demand and supply-side levers are the way to get a handle on a wasteful system. 
Already, these payment transitions seem to be having an effect. Health care cost increases are at the lowest level in the last half-century, and employer premium growth has slowed markedly. My own work with Nikhil Sahni shows that the Affordable Care Act is one factor in this slowdown. 
In the testimony that Professor Mulligan mentioned and the analytic work behind it (done jointly with Professor Sood), I estimated that slowing cost growth along the lines made possible by the Affordable Care Act would lead to 250,000 to 400,000 jobs gained annually over the next decade. The effects would increase over time.
In the public sector, the impact of a cost slowdown is more difficult to assess. The federal government typically responds to increased Medicare and Medicaid costs by borrowing more. Lower national savings means less investment in plant, equipment and other productive activities. Using standard economic models, the President's Council of Economic Advisers estimated that slowing medical care cost increases by 1.5 percentage points annually (and effectively borrowing less) would lead to gains in the gross domestic product of 2 percent by 2020 and 8 percent by 2030. 
Down the road, higher costs mean either higher taxes or reduced services. Neither the sequester nor the Medicare tax increase in the Affordable Care Act would have been necessary if Washington had dealt with health spending some time back. Similarly, state and local governments have cut education spending, laid off teachers and hired fewer police and fire fighters in response to higher benefit costs. A slowdown in cost growth could bring some of these jobs back. 
Professor Mulligan discounts the possibility of implicit tax cuts in the future and does not consider the benefits of any additional spending that may result from lower public-sector health costs; implicitly, his analysis assumes that government spending is all wasteful. I disagree. Making room for productive investment in our economy is one of the major potential benefits of the Affordable Care Act.
 Impact on the Work Force 
At the work force level, the Affordable Care Act reduces or eliminates many distortions, even as it creates some others. The economist Brigitte Madrian showed nearly two decades ago that many workers were "locked" into their jobs because they had health insurance on a current job and might not be able to maintain that coverage if they switched jobs. Universal insurance coverage would free workers to move to their most productive job or to start a business. Other studies have shown that greater access to health insurance encourages people on disability insurance to work more, reducing the cost for that program.
Then there are the costs of workers missing work (absenteeism) or being less productive at work because they are ill. Common conditions like mental illness, back pain and persistent headaches lead to each of these. Each is treatable but all are undertreated, in part because people are uninsured or underinsured. A recent study pegged the costs of absenteeism and productivity losses on the job at more than $200 billion annually, or about 1.5 percent of G.D.P. 
The Affordable Care Act will not eliminate these costs - people will still get sick, after all - but it is likely to reduce them. The recent Oregon Health Study, for example, found that people who gain insurance are much less likely to suffer from depression than their less fortunate peers who remain uninsured.
Are the benefits from reduced job lock, greater work among disability insurance recipients, and less absenteeism and workers ill on the job greater than the potential distortions from shifts into part-time work and increases in marginal tax rates? I do not know; no one has added up the various costs and benefits. For that reason, I did not highlight the work force implications of the Affordable Care Act when I testified before Congress. Instead, I focused on the cost savings implications of the act, which are immense and likely to be more important. I am glad that this forum allows Professor Mulligan and me a chance to discuss these other effects.
What is most clear is that the current health care system is failing families, businesses and governments. The Affordable Care Act is the most serious effort ever made to address the myriad flaws in health care today. If it works as intended, the health of our economy - as well as our people - will be much improved.

HEADLINE: The Price of Urban Family Living

BYLINE: AIMEE PHAN


HIGHLIGHT: After plugging our information into the Economic Policy Institute&#8217;s budget calculator, I was stunned. The rent estimate was half what we pay, the grocery stipend looked like a typo, and the child-care cost was a fantasy. 

 BODY:
When the Economic Policy Institute released a budget calculator last month to help estimate the income families need to live modestly, I could not resist entering our statistics. As a young family of four living in the pricey San Francisco Bay Area, we are constantly juggling our monthly expenses.
After plugging in our information, I was stunned. The rent estimate was half what we pay, the grocery stipend looked like a typo, and the child-care cost was a fantasy. In the Berkeley-Oakland area, rents vary wildly around the $1,361 the institute averages for housing, from the working flats where we live to the mansions in the hills. We can shop for groceries at the farmers' market, the neighborhood store or the chain supermarket - but they are all comparably expensive. The institute calculates $953 for monthly child care, while our reality is closer to $2,000 for part-time preschool for my daughter and a part-time nanny share for our son. 
Although I had never thought of my husband and myself as gratuitous spenders, these numbers both angered and shamed me. Were the expenses we considered necessities really excessive luxuries? Or was there was a huge disconnect between the E.P.I.'s numbers and economic reality?
Families pay a lot to stay in the city, which is why so many leave. Young families typically flee for the suburbs or more reasonably priced towns, and in the Bay Area, they often travel from San Francisco to the east and south bays, to even more remote cities and towns far beyond the metropolitan area.
There are also those who stay. Since my husband and I work in San Francisco with frequent evening obligations, we must live close to work. We also love our diverse, vibrant community. But this loyalty is constantly tested by persistently high crime rates, rising rents and uneven public school systems.

If we want to live in a good school zone, our rent increases significantly. If we want more square footage, we give up a safer neighborhood. If we splurge on groceries, then we cannot eat out that week. While other parents send their children on a carousel of after-school enrichment activities, we debate whether ballet class or a swim lesson is worth more than an investment in a college savings bond. We stretch our budgets while our choices shrink and sacrifices grow, making us wonder how long we can afford urban living.
The financial pressures on urban families are not new, and it may be that we must simply get used to them. My husband and I were both products of suburbs with first-rate public educations, safe, pedestrian- friendly neighborhoods and a moderate cost of living; places that could be comfortably enjoyed by their predominantly middle-class community.
Before moving to the Bay Area, my husband and I lived in eastern Washington State, where the cost of living was half of what we pay for in Berkeley. Our colleagues and friends in the rural university town often remarked that it was the perfect place to raise children: safe, clean and cheap.
But the prospect of raising our biracial children in a small, isolated town surrounded by wheat fields concerned me. I grew up in a predominantly white suburb, and I acutely remember the isolation I felt as a child, and the relief and joy I experienced after moving to Los Angeles for college and discovering a larger, more diverse community. I already see how my daughter, whose preschool proudly displays a mixed-race children's bill of rights in its foyer, thrives from being surrounded by teachers and children of many ethnicities and cultures. They celebrate difference. I cannot imagine another city where our children could feel so included, respected and loved.
The E.P.I.'s calculator is part of the group's larger efforts to draw attention to the unrealistic estimates of the government's standard poverty level and a minimum wage - but it still offers a very limited picture. I only wish the institute's budget was possible for our household, or those of many of our friends struggling to raise families in the Bay Area. These numbers simply don't add up here, even for educated professionals in jobs that supposedly pay "well." For parents and families in other circumstances - fast-food workers, teachers and school support employees, retail clerks - the gap between the living wage and a living wage in a city like ours is even larger. You can probably get a job at one of the trendiest foodie restaurants in the Gourmet Ghetto of North Berkeley, but you won't be able to afford to live in its posh, hilly neighborhoods on your hourly wage alone.
Maybe no budget calculator can factor in the many levels of economic disparity within the lower and middle classes. This one doesn't reflect my reality, or that of many around me. We've got everything we need, in theory, to make ends meet: good educations, two working parents. But like so many families in America recovering from the economic crisis, we are struggling to make do with less.

HEADLINE: JPMorgan Faces Civil And Criminal Inquiries

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG and BEN PROTESS

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase disclosed on Wednesday that it faced a criminal and civil investigation into whether it sold shoddy mortgage securities to investors in the run-up to the financial crisis, the latest legal threat to the nation's biggest bank.
JPMorgan acknowledged for the first time the existence of the investigation -- one of several mortgage-related problems looming for the bank -- in a quarterly regulatory filing. It said that the civil division of the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of California, which covers a stretch of land that includes Sacramento and Yosemite, has ''preliminarily concluded'' that JPMorgan flouted federal laws with its sale of subprime mortgage securities from 2005 to 2007. The parallel criminal inquiry, according to one person briefed on the matter, is in a more preliminary stage. 
Adding to scrutiny of the bank, federal prosecutors in Philadelphia are examining whether JPMorgan duped investors into buying troubled mortgage securities that later imploded, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. The prosecutors are investigating whether JPMorgan churned out the mortgage-backed securities without ensuring that the investments met underwriting standards, the people said.
Representatives for the bank and the federal prosecutors declined to comment.
Once a darling in regulatory circles, JPMorgan has become a magnet for scrutiny in recent years, drawing attention from at least eight federal agencies, a state regulator and two European nations. The authorities are investigating the bank in connection with its financial crisis-era mortgage business and a $6 billion trading loss in London last year, among other issues.
As the investigations drag on, the bank is racking up significant legal costs. To help cushion against potentially hefty payouts to the authorities, JPMorgan recorded a $678 million expense for additional litigation reserves in the second quarter, up from $323 million in the same period a year ago, according to the filing on Wednesday.
The bank also estimated it could incur up to $6.8 billion in losses beyond its reserves, nearly $1 billion more than the first quarter of the year.
JPMorgan is hardly the only Wall Street firm taking heat in Washington. The investigations into the bank are playing out as prosecutors increasingly take action against Wall Street firms that bundled mortgages into complex investments in the heady days of the housing boom.
On Tuesday, Bank of America found itself in the government's cross hairs when the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission accused the bank of defrauding investors by greatly overstating the quality of mortgages backing roughly $850 million in securities. The bank contested the accusations.
The lawsuit was the latest volley from President Obama's federal mortgage task force, which has vowed to hold financial firms accountable for their role in the mortgage boom and bust that threatened to topple the American economy.
The working group's first action came last October, when the New York attorney general, Eric T. Schneiderman, took aim at Bear Stearns, the firm that JPMorgan acquired during the depths of the financial crisis. The firm, Mr. Schneiderman said in a lawsuit, sold securities between 2005 and 2007 that caused roughly $22.5 billion in losses for investors.
Investors were assured, the lawsuit said, that the firm scoured the loans packaged into the investments to assure their quality. In fact, the prosecutor contended, there was little vetting.
JPMorgan is fighting the lawsuit.
A month later, however, JPMorgan agreed to a $296.9 million pact with the S.E.C. to resolve unrelated claims that Bear Stearns duped mortgage investors by failing to disclose some delinquent loans. JPMorgan did not admit or deny wrongdoing.
JPMorgan is also one of 18 banks that a federal regulator accused of selling troubled loans to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- the government-controlled mortgage finance giants -- without fully disclosing the potential risks. The regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, recently rejected a settlement offer from JPMorgan, the people briefed on the matter said, raising the prospect of a drawn-out legal battle.
In the latest investigations out of California and Philadelphia, federal prosecutors are examining whether
JPMorgan ignored evidence of broad flaws among the loans that were ultimately pooled and sold to investors, the people briefed on the matter said. The California investigation is aimed at the mortgage business that
JPMorgan inherited after its purchase of Washington Mutual, the people said. It is unclear what prompted the inquiry in Philadelphia.
Facing the onslaught of unwanted attention, JPMorgan has moved to settle some cases. The bank recently struck a $410 million settlement with the nation's top energy regulator, which had accused the bank of devising ''manipulative schemes'' to transform ''money-losing power plants into powerful profit centers.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Radical Life Extension

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW

 BODY:
The United States -- and indeed the world -- is straining under the weight of an aging population, and that strain is only expected to grow.
Life expectancy at birth in this country at the turn of the 20th century was nearly 50 years. According to the United States Census Bureau, it's now over 78. And by 2050, it'll be over 80. Others estimate it could be even higher.
A 2009 report by the MacArthur Research Network on an Aging Society estimated that by 2050 ''life expectancy for females will rise to 89.2-93.3 years and to 83.2-85.9 years for males.'' 
One of the authors of the study, S. Jay Olshansky, a professor at the School of Public Health at the University of Illinois, Chicago, said at the time: ''The economic implications for the U.S. economy are huge. We estimated we would be spending $3.2 to $8.3 trillion more in today's dollars than currently projected.''
The Census Bureau projects that the number of Americans over 65 will more than double by 2060.
And this top-heavy population pyramid may only become more warped. A 2009 study published in The Lancet predicts that more than half of babies born in 2000 in ''countries with long life expectancies'' will live past 100 years old.
All of this raises tricky economic and ethical questions about how a society survives and prospers when so many of its citizens are beyond what we currently conceive as working-age, and live longer in the twilight, when disease ravages the mind and body, and people are more likely to be dependent than independent.
For instance, think of the raging debates we are now having about entitlements in light of a rapidly aging population. How can they be shored up? Can they survive as currently constructed?
Think of the pension problems that cities like Detroit are experiencing. Will those pension liabilities become even more unsustainable as more people grow older?
Having examined Americans' feelings about living substantially longer lives, the Pew Research Center released a report on Tuesday titled ''Living to 120 and Beyond: Americans' View on Aging, Medical Advances and Radical Life Extension.''
Most Americans hadn't heard of radical life extension, but as the report explained, it's the prospect -- raised by scientists, bioethicists and other experts -- ''that advances in biotechnology and other fields could slow down or turn back the biological clock and allow many humans to live to 120 years or beyond.''
When asked if they'd like to live to be 120, most Americans said no, but most said that their ideal life span was between 79 and 100 years old, higher than the current average life expectancy.
Half thought treatments allowing people to live to be 120 would be bad for society, while 4 in 10 thought they would be good. Two-thirds thought that the treatments prolonging life would strain natural resources.
But aside from the economic and scarcity issues, there are ethical and theological issues.
Pew points out that longer life spans could have real effects on relationships and family structures, calling into question how and when people considered marriage and childbearing and care for the elderly.
And as they explain: ''There are many ethical issues, too. At a very basic level, some fear life extension could fundamentally alter people's sense of what it means to be human -- and not for the better.''
How do people value life when death is increasingly delayed?
Before Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger became Pope Benedict XVI, he led a theological commission that wrote: ''Disposing of death is in reality the most radical way of disposing of life.''
That's one religious view, although there are many others.
The point is that we are living longer and our life expectancies are predicted to keep rising. This presents real challenges for us as a society and an economy.

HEADLINE: Nearly 70, a 'Little Boy' Seeks a Home for His Trove

BYLINE: By BILLY WITZ

 BODY:
LOS ANGELES -- It is an overwhelming chore to process all that the eyes can see in the bright, 30,000-square-foot warehouse that is home to the Sports Museum of Los Angeles: thousands of artifacts, including old uniforms, pieces of equipment, trophies, plaques, newspaper clippings and photographs.
Not only is the collection huge, but it seems out of place. The items, primarily related to the Brooklyn Dodgers and the Yankees, are being housed across the country from their ancestral home. But for Gary Cypres, who over the last 20 years built most of the collection bit by bit -- often bid by bid -- there is a bigger chore than grasping its size and location: what to do with it all. 
Cypres will turn 70 in October, and while there is something eternally youthful about collecting sports memorabilia, it has not obscured the realization that he will not be around forever.
So rather than one day leaving his wife and five children with the burden of dispersing his collection, Cypres is looking for a good home for it. ''The reality has finally caught up with me,'' he said. ''There is a realization when you get to my age that you've sort of had your fun. But it's very hard for collectors to sell. It's like giving up a tangible piece of your life, especially when you have a collection like my Dodger collection. When you take a piece here and a piece there, it destroys the continuity.''
But Cypres may end up doing just that. The Dodgers are not interested in taking the entire collection, and he plans to see whether someplace in Brooklyn, like Barclays Center or the Brooklyn Museum, would be interested in a long-term loan akin to those made to museums by private art collectors. Collections at the Hall of Fame, he said, are geared more toward individuals than to teams.
The heart of his collection, which Cypres estimates is worth more than $10 million, is from the period of 1947 to 1957, baseball's most vivid age in New York, the era of Willie Mays, Mickey Mantle and Duke Snider. During those years, the Dodgers and the Yankees played each other six times in the World Series, the Giants appeared in the Series twice, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier, and the Dodgers and the Giants played their last season in New York before moving west.
It was also when Cypres came of age in the Bronx, falling in love with the Yankees and the game.
He began collecting baseball cards, though not always with great care, putting them in the spokes of his bicycles. Collecting remained only a hobby until 1990.
''That's when my economics changed,'' he said.
Cypres, whose corporate career had taken him to La Jolla, Calif., abruptly gained the means to invest heavily in his passion when the holding company for which he was the chief financial officer was acquired in a merger.
Shortly after the Los Angeles riots in 1992, Cypres bought a burned-out warehouse in an industrial area just south of downtown Los Angeles, unsure what he would do with the property but confident he had gotten a good deal. He rebuilt the warehouse, leasing parts to small businesses and running some of his own start-ups there. But with the means to do so, he devoted himself to collecting and put the building to another use.
''I had two choices,'' said Cypres, whose wife, Kathi, collects contemporary art. ''There was the rational, economic one, to keep renting it out, or the idiotic one, to house a collection. I made the little boy's choice.''
The museum presentations are simple and well thought out, but the collection is so big that even in a two-hour guided tour, it is difficult to fully absorb the back stories of so many items.
''It's funny, because what limits most collectors is space,'' Cypres said. ''I'm fortunate, or unfortunate, depending on one's viewpoint. I've often wondered, if I didn't have the space, would I be better off? Would I have collected more narrowly? It's an interesting question, whether lack of room helps you in your collecting.''
Cypres's acquisitions include some contemporary pieces, like Barry Bonds's 755th home run ball, but it is the vein of Dodgers and Yankees memorabilia that runs deepest and richest.
Among the pieces are Brooklyn's 1889 acceptance letter into the National League, the ball and the Champagne bottle from the 1913 christening of Ebbets Field, Dazzy Vance's 1924 N.L. Most Valuable Player medallion (there was no trophy then) and three balls used in different games during Joe DiMaggio's 56-game hitting streak.
Also on display are works by Willard Mullin, the cartoonist who popularized the Brooklyn Bum, the stubble-faced embodiment of a team affectionately known as Dem Bums.
''The Dodgers could have brought all this stuff west with them, but they didn't,'' Cypres said, and it helps explain why he was able to obtain so much of it. ''Other than here, it's nowhere, quite honestly. There are pieces, but nobody has assembled the history of the Dodgers, particularly from 1890 to 1957. The brand wasn't created here. The brand was created in Brooklyn when they played the Yankees in all those World Series.''
Cypres opened his collection to the public in 2008 but closed it after several months because of the expense of security and staff, and concerns about exposing the collection to too much light and traffic. He now opens the museum by appointment and for special events, like a premiere party this year for the Robinson movie ''42.''
Cypres said the former Dodgers owner Frank McCourt had expressed interest in housing the Dodgers portion of the collection as part of a stadium redevelopment plan. When McCourt sold the club, the new ownership group told Cypres it was interested in displaying only a few items. The Dodgers' vice president for planning and development, Janet Marie Smith, and their president, Stan Kasten, were not available for comment, a team spokesman said.
So Cypres will continue to look elsewhere for a home for the accumulation of history in which he has invested so much of his fortune and himself, hoping to find someone with the means and the belief in its significance and value.
In the end, that would help validate the idea that it was more than a little boy's choice all along.

HEADLINE: Borrowing By Consumers Rose in June, Fed Reports

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Americans borrowed more in June to buy cars and attend college, but they were frugal again with their credit cards, indicating that many remain wary of taking on high-interest debt. 
Consumers increased their borrowing by $13.8 billion in June from May, to a seasonally adjusted $2.85 trillion, the Federal Reserve said on Wednesday in its monthly report on consumer credit.
The category that includes credit card use dropped $2.7 billion in June. That followed a gain of $6.4 billion in May. Still, overall credit card debt remained 16.5 percent below its July 2008 peak.
Borrowing for autos and student loans rose $16.5 billion in June. These gains have lifted overall consumer credit to record levels in all but one month since June 2011.
And since January 2011, the measure of student and auto loans has risen $312.6 billion. During that same two-and-a-half-year period, credit card debt rose only $16 billion.
The Fed's report does not separate student loans and auto loans. But the Federal Reserve Bank of New York tracks consumer credit on a quarterly basis and its reports show that student loan debt has been the biggest driver of borrowing since the recession officially ended in June 2009, partly because many unemployed Americans have returned to college.
More credit card borrowing could bolster consumer spending, which accounts for about 70 percent of economic activity. But many consumers have been hesitant to run up high-interest debt.
The economy grew at a lackluster annual rate of 1.4 percent in the first six months of this year. Many economists forecast that growth will accelerate to a rate of around 2.5 percent in the second half of this year, as the impact of higher Social Security taxes and spending cuts begins to fade. Hiring gains are also expected to increase consumer income, supporting more spending.
The Fed's report excludes mortgages, home equity loans and other loans related to real estate.

HEADLINE: Freddie Mac Reports $5 Billion Gain

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Freddie Mac earned $5 billion from April through June, the seventh straight profitable quarter for the mortgage investor.
The second-quarter gain reported on Wednesday compares with net income of $3 billion in the same period last year. Freddie said its earnings were largely because of increased profits from investments made to hedge against rising interest rates. That helped offset losses on mortgages during the quarter. 
Freddie, based in McLean, Va., will pay a dividend of $4.4 billion to the United States Treasury next month and is requesting no additional aid.
The government rescued Freddie and its larger sibling, Fannie Mae, during the financial crisis in 2008. Together, they received loans of about $187 billion.
A housing recovery that began last year has made both profitable again. Combined, they have paid back roughly $136 billion of their government loans. Those payments are helping to make this year's federal budget deficit the smallest since President Obama took office.
Once the second-quarter dividend is paid, Freddie will have repaid $41.4 billion of the roughly $71.3 billion it received from taxpayers.
Fannie and Freddie own or guarantee about half of all mortgages in the United States, worth about $5 trillion. Along with other federal agencies, they back about 90 percent of new mortgages.
On Tuesday, Mr. Obama proposed a broad overhaul of the American mortgage finance system, including winding down Fannie and Freddie. He declared that taxpayers should never again be left ''holding the bag'' for the mortgage giants' risky moves.
Nearly all of Freddie's second-quarter profit is going back to the government. Under a federal policy adopted last year, Fannie and Freddie must turn over their entire net worth exceeding $3 billion in each quarter to the Treasury. Freddie said its net worth in the second quarter was $7.4 billion.

HEADLINE: Blackstone Is Expected To Sell Hilton In an Offering

BYLINE: By MICHAEL J. DE LA MERCED

 BODY:
Updated, 8:10 p.m. | As private equity firms rush to cash in on their investments, the Blackstone Group is moving to sell one of the biggest companies to go private in recent years.
Hilton Worldwide, the hotel giant that Blackstone bought six years ago, has begun preparations for an initial public offering, people briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. That includes hiring four banks -- Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley -- to start the process.
An offering for Hilton, whose more than 4,000 properties are as diverse as Hampton Hotels and the Waldorf-Astoria in Midtown Manhattan, would probably be in the first half of next year, one of these people said. 
A Hilton spokesman declined to comment.
Private equity firms have been eager to sell their companies, either outright or through an initial offering, to take advantage of booming stock markets and generate realized profits for themselves and their limited partners.
That has served to bolster the financials of the alternative investment giants. Last month, Blackstone reported a tripling of its second-quarter profit thanks in part to cashing out of its investments. And Wednesday, the Carlyle Group said its quarterly profit jumped nearly fourfold, and distributable earnings rose 41 percent, again partly to sales of its portfolio companies.
The markets have pushed up the value of assets so high, in fact, that some alternative investment firms have slowed down their core business of buying up companies to focus on selling their existing holdings.
Generating real profits from portfolio companies has also aided in fund-raising efforts, with successful exits serving as helpful talking points with new and existing investors.
Blackstone has been among the more active sellers within the industry. In the second quarter alone, it held an I.P.O. for SeaWorld Entertainment, the home of Shamu the killer whale, and sold additional shares in companies like Nielsen Holdings, the media measurement giant. It also was working on a potential initial offering of a smaller hotel chain, La Quinta, a person briefed on that process said.
Still, Hilton will be one of the biggest divestitures by a private equity firm in the last several years. The company is now among Blackstone's single biggest investments.
The hotel chain's sale in the summer of 2007 for $26 billion was the last of the giant leveraged buyouts struck during the credit boom that ended later that year. It was also the biggest-ever takeover of a hotel company.
But the hotelier soon began to struggle amid the crashing markets for debt and commercial real estate. Business and leisure travel also dropped in 2008 and 2009. Blackstone eventually reached a deal to cut its portfolio company's debt by several billion dollars.
Hilton has since flourished, as the economy has rebounded and consumers have begun traveling again. Such is Hilton's rebound that Blackstone's chief executive, Stephen A. Schwarzman, spoke of the company's 17 percent rise in pro forma earnings for the first half of the year during the private equity firm's second-quarter earnings call.
Publicly traded hotel companies have also been performing well. Shares in Starwood Hotels & Resorts Worldwide and in Hyatt Hotels have risen by more than 15 percent so far this year.
Blackstone executives said that more opportunities to cash out of investments abounded for portfolio companies. The firm's president, Hamilton E. James, told analysts during the earnings call that possible ways to exit investments included more I.P.O.'s, outright sales and special dividend payments.
News of the banks' hiring was reported earlier by The Wall Street Journal online.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: China Fines Milk Powder Suppliers Over Pricing

BYLINE: By AMY QIN and EDWARD WONG

 BODY:
BEIJING -- The Chinese government has fined six infant milk powder companies a total of 668.7 million renminbi for anti-competitive behavior and price fixing, according to an announcement issued by the country's top economic planning agency Wednesday. It is the largest fine China has ever issued for violations of its anti-monopoly law, according to Xinhua, the state-run news agency.
Five of the companies subject to the $109 million in fines are foreign, and one is based in Hong Kong. They are Abbott Laboratories of the United States; Biostime International of Hong Kong; Dumex Baby Food, a subsidiary of Danone of France; Fonterra Cooperative Group of New Zealand; Mead Johnson Nutrition of the United States; and Royal FrieslandCampina of the Netherlands, according to a statement from the Chinese planning agency, the National Development and Reform Commission. 
The statement said three makers of infant formula -- Meiji of Japan; Wyeth Nutrition, a subsidiary of Nestlé of Switzerland; and Zhejiang Beingmate Technology Industry & Trade of China -- were exempted from the punishment because they ''cooperated with the government investigation, provided important evidence and actively took self-rectification measures.''
The decision concluded an investigation into the infant formula industry for what the commission said was price fixing of baby formula in the Chinese market.
The statement said that the evidence gathered during the course of the investigation showed that the companies used various methods to ensure that distributors raised prices, including signing contractual agreements, imposing fines, cutting rebates and restricting the supply of goods. People's Daily, the Communist Party newspaper, and at least one analyst of the China market for baby products have said that prices of foreign-branded infant milk powder had risen at least 30 percent since 2008, when Chinese began buying such brands in droves because of a wide scandal involving tainted, and in some cases fatal, Chinese-made milk powder.
The government statement said fines were levied according to what Chinese officials perceived was the degree to which the companies complied with and responded to the investigation. After the inquiry began, at least three foreign companies -- Dumex, Mead Johnson and Nestlé -- cut prices of their products in the China market by around 20 percent.
Mead Johnson was fined 203.8 million renminbi, or four percent of its 2012 revenue in China. In its announcement, the commission said the company did not actively cooperate with the investigation but was quick to take corrective measures. Though Mead Johnson said it did not intend to contest the agency's decision, a company spokeswoman said in an e-mail Wednesday that ''we believe our business practices were consistent with prevailing interpretations of regulatory requirements applicable to our industry.''
Biostime, which was fined 162.9 million renminbi, or six percent of its revenue from last year, was dealt the harshest punishment of the six companies for its ''serious violations'' of the anti-monopoly law and its failure to actively change. A statement by the company released Tuesday said it intended to pay the fine and would continue to work to ensure that its ''various business decisions comply with the applicable P.R.C. laws and regulations,'' referring to the People's Republic of China.
Dumex, Abbott, FrieslandCampina and Fonterra were each fined three percent of their revenue from last year. The National Development and Reform Commission said they had cooperated with the investigation and had been quick to change. The fines were 172 million, 77.3 million, 48.3 million and 4.5 million renminbi, respectively.
While a statement from Fonterra pointed out that its fine was ''in the lowest range,'' the company has been mired in a separate food safety scandal in China related to potentially tainted ingredients used in baby formula products made by other companies. This week, a top Fonterra executive flew to China to issue an apology at a news conference. Chinese officials have banned imports of New Zealand milk products, and several foreign companies have said they would take precautionary measures and recall products with the Fonterra ingredients. The Chinese state-run news media have covered the story extensively, including running front-page stories and harsh editorials.
The Chinese milk industry has suffered severe losses since the 2008 scandal, when six babies died and more than 300,000 children fell ill after drinking milk products tainted with melamine, a toxic chemical. When Chinese officials announced the price-fixing investigation, they also said they would ensure stricter standards within the domestic industry. Chinese state-run newspapers ran editorials saying they hoped that the new standards would bolster the competitive ability of the domestic companies versus foreign rivals.
For various reasons, including aggressive marketing by the formula makers, many Chinese mothers prefer to give their babies formula rather than breast milk, though breast-feeding has grown in popularity since the 2008 scandal. The market for infant formula in China is enormous and growing fast -- estimated to be worth about $12.7 billion in 2012, and projected to grow to $15.4 billion this year and $18.4 billion in 2014, according to data from Euromonitor, a research organization.
Chinese parents have gone to great lengths to buy foreign-made infant milk powder, and that has led to shortages in at least a half-dozen countries around the world. Some large retail chains have imposed a limit of two to four cans of milk powder per customer, and Hong Kong has made it a criminal offense to bring more than two cans of milk powder out of the territory. The law was imposed in March to crack down on smuggling of milk powder to the mainland.

HEADLINE: Blaze Damages Nairobi's International Airport

BYLINE: By REUBEN KYAMA and NICOLA CLARK; Reuben Kyama reported from Nairobi, and Nicola Clark from Paris. Alan Cowell contributed reporting from London.

 BODY:
NAIROBI, Kenya -- A huge fire broke out Wednesday and raged for four hours at Nairobi's international airport on the anniversary of the attacks on the United States Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, officials and witnesses said, bringing East Africa's busiest airport to a standstill and turning parts of it into charred ruins.
By midafternoon, Michael Kamau, a senior government transportation official, told reporters that the airport, Jomo Kenyatta International Airport, had been partly reopened for domestic and cargo flights, but that international passenger traffic was still suspended. The airport authorities planned to convert another part of the facility to a temporary terminal for international passenger flights, he said. 
Visiting the gutted section of the circular, 1960s-era terminal, Kenya's president, Uhuru Kenyatta, said there was no loss of life but expressed dismay over the damage and disruption, said Manoah Esipisu, a presidential spokesman. The fire's cause was being investigated, he added.
Kenya is a crucial Western ally, abutting troubled areas of neighboring Somalia. But Mr. Kenyatta and other Kenyan officials were reluctant to make any immediate link to terrorism. Wednesday, Aug. 7, is the anniversary of the coordinated bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania in 1998, attacks that killed more than 200 people.
''There is no reason to speculate at this point,'' Mr. Esipisu said.
Nairobi is an essential hub for sub-Saharan passenger traffic, transporting 6.3 million passengers a year on more than 40 international airlines from Europe, the Middle East, Asia and the rest of Africa. It is also a vital cargo link, particularly for the export of produce, cut flowers and other perishable goods from across East Africa -- an important source of foreign currency.
Analysts said the quick resumption of international cargo traffic would probably minimize any immediate impact on the Kenyan economy, and the fact that some passenger flights had also resumed indicated that critical computer systems that handle ticketing, baggage processing and navigation systems were unaffected by the blaze.
''If the runway can operate and the control tower can operate, then the airport should be close to fully operational within a few days,'' said David Feldman, a managing partner at Exambela, an aviation consulting firm based in Paris.
Airport officials said the fire started around 5 a.m. Wednesday, when many flights to and from Europe and elsewhere were scheduled. Many incoming flights were diverted to Mombasa, on the Indian Ocean coast.
Katie Price, an American aid worker with Catholic Relief Services, said she arrived on a plane from Lusaka, Zambia, that landed around the time the fire broke out and was stranded in the aircraft for several hours, before hundreds of passengers were evacuated in a cargo area that escaped the blaze.
In a telephone interview, Ms. Price, 32, said the fire appeared to have caused major damage. ''It looked like it would be hard to repair,'' she said.
Kenya's civil aviation authorities gave clearance late Wednesday for the airport to operate international passenger flights from a part of the terminal normally reserved for domestic traffic.
Smoke continued to billow from the blackened, five-story terminal building late Wednesday, and an acrid stench lingered in the air. Hundreds of people, including airport workers and stranded travelers, milled outside a cordon set up near the remains of the international arrivals area, which also housed baggage-claim facilities.
Mr. Feldman predicted that the situation for air travelers was likely to remain chaotic for some time, as August is a peak month for Kenyan tourism, with thousands of visitors flocking to its beaches and game reserves.
''It will be a mess, probably operating in very uncomfortable, open-air conditions'' with significant delays, Mr. Feldman said.

HEADLINE: Not Banks, but Still Lending Money and Drawing Investors

BYLINE: By RANDALL SMITH

 BODY:
In one sense, much of Internet commerce is largely a matchmaking service, connecting people looking for relationships, taxis or spare bedrooms. One of the hottest areas is the market for personal loans, which is attracting money from venture capital investors, spurred by the fast growth of the largest online platform, Lending Club, and the paper profits for its early backers.
In their simplest form, these marketplaces link borrowers who want to refinance high-interest credit card debt of 20 percent or more with investors looking to beat paltry bank savings account yields of less than 1 percent.
At Lending Club, borrowers obtain three- or five-year personal loans and pay annual interest of about 14.5 percent, depending on their credit scores, which can lift it to as much as 30 percent, with fees. Investors can earn interest rates of about 8.5 percent, the company says. The difference from the average comes from defaults, which cut annual returns by 3.5 percent, and the company's annual fees of 2.5 percent. 
Some of Lending Club's earliest investors, including Norwest Venture Partners, Canaan Partners and Morgenthaler Ventures, are showing paper profits of more than 10 times their investment, based on Lending Club's most recent valuation of $1.55 billion in an investment led by Google in May. Lending Club hopes to complete an initial public offering next year.
That success has drawn the interest of venture capital firms looking for similar results.
''Investing in the networks that light up the sharing economy'' for items like rooms and rides ''certainly looks like a good idea,'' Fred Wilson, a managing partner of Union Square Ventures, said in a post on his Web site in July. Union Square invested in Lending Club in 2011 and has put money into multiple platforms. Last year, it backed Funding Circle, which offers small business loans in Britain. This year, it financed the personal-loan marketplace Auxmoney in Germany.
''There is a platform proliferation out there,'' said Frank Rotman of QED Investors, a group of former executives of Capital One Financial that has invested in four platforms. ''Usually that happens when you see one company succeed and people say they want to find the next one. Right now, everyone is trying to find the next Lending Club. They don't want to feel like they missed the opportunity.''
The number of significant lending platforms has already grown to roughly 50 worldwide, according to Disruption Credit, an investment firm. The main personal loan platforms in the United States are Lending Club and Prosper Marketplace. On Deck and Kabbage offer small-business lending. Overseas, Zopa and RateSetter offer consumer lending in Britain, as does SocietyOne in Australia. And student-financing platforms include Social Finance, CommonBond, Pave and Upstart.
Disruption Credit's chief executive, Michael Parekh, says such platforms can disrupt Wall Street and traditional banks much like Google has taken on old-style media companies and Amazon.com has taken business from brick-and-mortar retailers. Disruption and other experts cite a vast $2.8 trillion consumer credit market up for grabs.
Lending Club, which just passed the $2 billion mark in total loans made, already has plans to expand into small-business and student loans, and may pursue credit cards, insurance and mortgages. It may also expand globally.
In addition to its original base of individual investors, Lending Club has attracted the participation of a few community banks as well as institutional funds that invest in the loans. It also attracted a later-stage investment in 2012, at about one-third the current value, from the venture firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers, which has a partner, Mary Meeker, on Lending Club's board. Other directors include John J. Mack, a former chief executive of Morgan Stanley, and Lawrence H. Summers, a former Treasury secretary. Kleiner's China fund is also backing CreditEase, an online small-business and consumer lender in China.
If Lending Club can complete an I.P.O. on schedule next year, ''I believe this will be the financial-tech version of the Facebook I.P.O., a coming-of-age event just like Facebook was for social media,'' said Dan Ciporin, general partner of Canaan Partners, Lending Club's second-largest shareholder, with a 15 percent stake.
Lending Club expects revenue could roughly triple, to $100 million in 2013 from $36 million in 2012, and could grow to $400 million by 2015. One Wall Street banker said other fast-growing online services like LinkedIn and Priceline.com traded at 7 to 10 times revenue expected for the following year. At that rate, he says, Lending Club could be worth more than $3 billion in an I.P.O. next year.
''I think this is viewed by venture capitalists as incredibly disruptive and rapidly scalable,'' said Ron Suber, head of institutional sales at Prosper Marketplace.
Pat Grady, a partner at Prosper's chief venture backer, Sequoia Capital, said big banks might be hobbled by their ''legacy infrastructure'' and ''incumbent inertia.'' He added, ''In some ways, the sky's the limit. There's nothing that says the banks of yesteryear have to be the banks of tomorrow.''
At a presentation in June at the inaugural Lendit conference for the nascent sector in New York, Lending Club's founder and chief executive, Renaud Laplanche, compared its rapid embrace by customers to the adoption of electricity, color television, stoves and washing machines, saying he plans to ''transform the banking system.''
Some platforms are adept at gleaning online data about their customers. Borrowers, for example, must agree to allow Lending Club to obtain data from their employers' payroll processors. And the small-business lender On Deck has developed methods for evaluating borrowers based on dozens of online sources.
But some investors still have doubts.
One skeptical venture investor says such lending sites have flourished in an environment of a pullback by banks from unsecured consumer lending, an improving economy and a steep decline in interest rates on other investments, starting with savings accounts. Other experts note that banks have a big advantage in rock-bottom financing costs.
''There's been an explosion of new companies using the Internet to originate loans,'' said Josh Koplewicz, founder of Thayer Street Partners, an investment firm that focuses on technology and financial services. ''The barriers to entry are low. There are people setting up shop with a couple hundred thousand dollars.'' But aside from a few big names like Lending Club, he says, it may be difficult to create enterprise value without some edge in access to borrowers.
Indeed, some venture firms' investments have already shown paper losses. For example, the stakes of venture firms including Accel Partners and Benchmark, which invested in Prosper Marketplace from 2005 to 2010, fell in value in January when Sequoia rebooted the company with a new round of financing and a new management team.
Prosper, which started offering loans in 2006, just before Lending Club, had offered higher rates and riskier loans, which led to investor losses in the 2008 market collapse. Prosper also clashed with securities regulators over whether its offerings should be subject to disclosure rules.
Both Prosper and Lending Club temporarily curtailed their loan offerings in 2008 after the Securities and Exchange Commission required that loans offered to average investors be registered publicly; Prosper recently reached an agreement to settle a class-action investor lawsuit over the losses. Amid the economic slump, Zopa in Britain abandoned its own costly push into the United States. And some fledgling entrants like Loanio and Pertuity Direct shut down.
Even after meeting the S.E.C.'s requirements, Lending Club and its rivals have had run-ins with regulators. Lending Club can offer its loans to investors in only 26 states but thinks those limits would melt away after an I.P.O. Both Florida and Missouri fined the company $100,000 each last year for selling unregistered securities because Lending Club had allowed its registrations there to lapse.
In June, Ohio securities regulators filed charges against SoMoLend, an online small-business lender, accusing it of securities fraud and unregistered securities sales. SoMoLend, which declined to comment on pending talks with the regulators and on a hearing set for October, has halted transactions with individual investors in the state.
Some Lending Club investors and executives are hedging their bets, taking some chips off the table even before an I.P.O. Both Canaan and Morgenthaler sold some of their shares in a $125 million stock sale in May. About 30 Lending Club employees, including Mr. Laplanche, sold an average of less than 5 percent of their stock as well. Insiders also sold in a recent On Deck financing.
At the moment, the wind of the market is at Lending Club's back. With broad United States market indexes up more than 18 percent this year, social media and social commerce stocks have been surging even more.
Facebook, up 46 percent this year, recently regained its I.P.O. price after 14 months below that level. The real estate marketplace Zillow has tripled this year, and the business network LinkedIn and business-review site Yelp have doubled. Even the discount-deal service Groupon, which replaced its chief executive after its shares plunged 87 percent from the I.P.O. price, has risen 79 percent this year.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

They are Mead Johnson Nutrition of the United States; Dumex Baby Food, a subsidiary of Danone in France; Biostime International of Hong Kong; Royal FrieslandCampina of the Netherlands; the Fonterra Co-operative Group of New Zealand; and Abbott Laboratories of the United States, according to a statement from the National Development and Reform Commission, the Chinese economic planning agency. 
The statement said three other companies were exempt from the punishment because they ''cooperated with the government investigation, provided important evidence and actively took self-rectification measures.''
Those not subject to the action were Wyeth Nutrition, a subsidiary of Nestlé of Switzerland; Zhejiang Beingmate Technology Industry and Trade Company, a Chinese company; and Meiji Holdings of Japan.
The decision concluded an investigation that began in March into the infant formula industry for what the commission said was price fixing of baby formula in the Chinese market.
The statement said evidence gathered during the course of the investigation showed that the companies used various methods to ensure that distributors raised prices, including signing contractual agreements, imposing fines, cutting rebates and restricting the supply of goods.
People's Daily, the Communist Party's official newspaper, and at least one analyst of China's market for baby products have said that prices of foreign-branded infant milk powder had risen by at least 30 percent since 2008, when the Chinese began buying foreign brands in droves because of a wide scandal involving tainted Chinese-made milk powder that caused widespread illness and some deaths.
After the investigation began, at least three foreign companies -- Mead Johnson, Dumex and Nestlé -- cut their product prices about 20 percent in the Chinese market.
Mead Johnson was fined the equivalent of 4 percent of its 2012 revenue in China, or about $33 million. In its announcement, the agency said Mead Johnson did not actively cooperate with the investigation but was quick to take corrective measures.
Mead Johnson said it did not intend to contest the agency's decision. A company spokeswoman said in an e-mail on Wednesday, ''We believe our business practices were consistent with prevailing interpretations of regulatory requirements applicable to our industry.''
Biostime, which was fined 6 percent of its revenue from last year, or $26.6 million, received the harshest punishment of the six companies for its ''serious violations'' of the antimonopoly law. A statement by the company, released on Wednesday, said it intended to pay the fine and would continue to work to ensure that its ''various business decisions comply with the applicable P.R.C. laws and regulations,'' referring to the People's Republic of China.
Dumex was fined $28 million, Abbott was fined $12.63 million and Friesland was penalized $7.89 million -- all representing about 3 percent of their 2012 revenue in China. The Chinese agency said they had cooperated with the investigation and had been quick to change their practices.
Fonterra was fined only about $730,000, but it has been mired in a separate food safety scandal in China related to potentially tainted ingredients used in baby formula products made by other companies. This week, a top Fonterra executive flew to China to issue an apology at a news conference.
Chinese officials have banned imports of New Zealand milk products and several foreign companies have said they would take precautions and recall products containing the Fonterra ingredients. The Chinese state-run news media has run front-page articles and harsh editorials over the case.
Foreign brands have become popular since the Chinese milk industry experienced severe losses after the 2008 scandal, when six babies died and more than 300,000 children fell ill as a result of drinking milk products tainted with melamine, a toxic chemical.
When Chinese officials announced the price-fixing investigation a month ago, they also said they would ensure stricter standards within the domestic industry. Chinese state-run newspapers ran editorials saying they hoped that the new standards would bolster the competitive ability of the domestic companies versus foreign rivals.
For various reasons, including aggressive marketing by the formula makers, many Chinese mothers prefer to give their babies formula rather than breast milk, though breast-feeding has grown in popularity since the 2008 scandal.
The market for infant formula in China is enormous and growing fast. It was estimated to be worth about $12.7 billion in 2012, and is projected to grow to $15.4 billion this year and $18.4 billion in 2014, according to data from Euromonitor, a research organization.
Chinese parents have gone to great lengths to buy foreign-made infant milk powder, and that has led to shortages in at least a half-dozen countries around the world.
Some large retail chains have imposed a limit of two to four cans of milk powder per customer, and Hong Kong has made it a criminal offense to take more than two cans of milk powder out of the territory. The law was imposed in March to crack down on smuggling of milk powder to the mainland.

HEADLINE: Vacancies Hamper Agencies For Arts

BYLINE: By PATRICIA COHEN

 BODY:
The week before the Broadway producer Rocco Landesman was scheduled to deliver his first Congressional testimony as chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, he traveled 2,000 miles from Washington to Jerome, Idaho, to take in a production of ''Othello'' at a high school. Sitting next to him that spring day in 2010 was his host, Representative Mike Simpson, the top Republican on the committee that controls the endowment's financing.
This kind of face-to-face encounter is at the core of the chairman's job. But now, as the White House and Congress prepare for a September showdown over the budget that could mean severe cuts for the federal arts agency, advocates are fretting over the absence of their strongest champion -- a permanent chairman.
More than eight months have elapsed since Mr. Landesman announced that he was stepping down from the nation's top arts post. The only time a search has taken longer was in 2002, after the conductor and composer Michael P. Hammond died after just six days in office. Yet the hunt for a replacement -- who must be nominated by the president and confirmed by Congress -- seems to have stalled, according to people with knowledge of the search, who asked to remain unnamed because of the sensitivity of the subject. 
''It shouldn't take this long to find a cultural leader,'' said Robert Lynch, president and chief executive of Americans for the Arts, a lobbying group.
The endowment's sister agency, the National Endowment for the Humanities, has also been without a permanent director since May, when its chairman, Jim Leach, resigned. Both endowments have acting chairwomen, Joan Shigekawa at arts and Carole Watson at humanities, who have drawn high marks, but experts say even the most able manager cannot replace a permanent chief who has the president and Congress's seal of approval.
''The N.E.A. and N.E.H. need chairpersons, because they need people to be working with Congress, the White House and the public to build support,'' said Dana Gioia, the poet who led the arts endowment from 2002 to 2008. Without confirmed chairmen, the endowments are forced to ''operate with a disability.''
''That's just Washingtonian common sense,'' he added.
The endowments, both created in 1965 -- one to nurture and preserve the arts, the other to promote humanities research and education -- have always represented a minuscule portion of federal spending. Nonetheless, in some smaller states, endowment money can account for a third to a half of the arts funds, and nationally the chairman is a cheerleader for the cultural and economic benefits of the arts. ''The power of the N.E.A. is not the amount of money it has,'' said Mr. Lynch of the Americans for Arts, but in the ''bully pulpit'' it provides.
For decades, though, supporters say the endowments have come to resemble orphaned dogs who beg for table scraps but often get kicked instead. They have recovered from their darkest hours in the 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan tried to eliminate both agencies, and in the 1990s, when budgets and programs were lacerated during the height of the culture wars. But there remains a vocal minority of Republicans who treat them as luxuries the nation cannot afford.
In 2011, for example, the Republican presidential hopeful Mitt Romney pledged to slash the endowments' financing, while the Alaska governor and former vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin labeled them ''frivolous,'' and called for them to be put on ''the chopping block.''
Last month, in the face of crushing federal deficits, the House Appropriations Committee, which includes Mr. Landesman's fellow theatergoer in Idaho, Representative Simpson, proposed halving the $154.5 million budget for each endowment that President Obama had requested for the 2014 fiscal year.
Mr. Simpson did not return repeated phone calls and e-mails to his office.
Politicians and advocates acknowledge that focusing on the endowments is difficult when Washington is consumed with a budget stalemate, the secret surveillance of Americans, the choice of a new Federal Reserve chairman, an immigration bill and a backlog of judicial nominees who need Congressional approval.
''Frankly, the whole government is stalled,'' said Representative Louise M. Slaughter, a Democrat from New York's northwestern tier and a chairwoman of the Congressional Arts Caucus. ''We can't get anything done.''
Ms. Slaughter said she does not think the lack of a permanent chairman would necessarily hurt the arts or humanities endowments during budget negotiations, saying that there are representatives from both parties who understand their importance.
She, like other endowment cheerleaders, emphasized both the economic and educational returns that come from investing in the arts. Mr. Landesman, for instance, has frequently noted that each dollar spent by the arts endowment generates $8 of additional investment and $26 of economic activity in the community. Mr. Lynch traces the creation of art districts in Miami and the annual Art Basel fair there to an infusion of endowment seed money.
Arts advocates, in particular, expressed frustration with the delay in filling the $165,300-a-year job at the arts endowment. ''People have been expressing interest in this position for many months, and I just don't know why there hasn't been movement,'' Jonathan Katz, chief executive of the National Assembly of State Arts Agencies, said. ''Programmatically, the agency tends to drift until you have a chairman coming in, because nobody wants to commit the agency to something that might not be the new chairman's priority.''
The violinist Aaron P. Dworkin, who founded the Sphinx Organization in Detroit to promote diversity in classical music, confirmed that he was considered for the post after Mr. Landesman announced his departure. But he said he was happy to be continuing with his work at Sphinx, ''where I think I can have the best impact.''
Mr. Dworkin, who is a member of the National Council on the Arts, the panel that advises the arts endowment chairman, said that possible candidates are being considered, but that he did not know who they were or if there was anyone moving along the pipeline. At the council's last meeting in June, the update on the search contained no new information.
Some arts advocates said they had pushed for Caroline Kennedy, but the president had other plans for her. Two weeks ago, she was nominated to be ambassador of Japan.
An administration spokesman said the White House does not comment on personnel decisions.
William Ferris, who steered the humanities endowment during the Clinton administration, said he hopes to hear an announcement about nominees soon. The case for support ''needs to be put on a personal level,'' he said, ''and the chairperson does it best.''

HEADLINE: Nature's Power Meets Star Power In Santa Fe

BYLINE: By JAMES R. OESTREICH

 BODY:
SANTA FE, N.M. -- The five productions of the Santa Fe Opera season come in two kinds, a distinction made clear last week, when they were presented in quick succession for the benefit of the press and other completists looking to economize. (Good luck with that in Santa Fe.)
First came three new productions mounted as star vehicles for established performers: Offenbach's ''Grand Duchess of Gerolstein,'' for the mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, on July 30; Theodore Morrison's ''Oscar,'' for the countertenor David Daniels (already reviewed), on July 31; and Rossini's ''Donna del Lago,'' for the mezzo-soprano Joyce DiDonato, last Thursday. Then came two revivals, more evenly cast and featuring mostly young and rising singers: Verdi's ''Traviata'' on Friday and Mozart's ''Nozze di Figaro'' on Saturday. 
It was largely a matter of taste in repertory, granted, but for one listener, the revivals were more satisfying over all. Nor did those productions lack star power of their own.
The ''Traviata'' was especially effective, with moving performances from Brenda Rae, as Violetta, and Michael Fabiano, as Alfredo. Laurent Pelly's staging, the program notes say, has been refined since its premiere in 2009, but to judge from reports of that production, the essentials remain intact.
With minimal, boxy sets, designed by Chantal Thomas, and elaborate Belle Époque costumes, designed by Mr. Pelly, the staging strives for naturalism. In the opening party scene, the women's gowns are slit up the front to the waist, affording easy access and allowing the high-class prostitutes to do what prostitutes do. The scene ends with Alfredo and Violetta kissing and groping each other, and suggesting and simulating the rest.
The naturalism carried through to the final scene, where Violetta looked a wreck, as a woman dying of consumption might, but sang gorgeously. Dying slowly, of course: Ms. Rae made Violetta's bursts of renewed energy and song, so often the butt of jokes, as believable dramatically as they could possibly be.
Ms. Rae soared beautifully in the early going, but it was in her pianissimo singing that she really shone. Her assurance to Alfredo's father that she would step aside from her romance with his son to protect the honor of the Germont family was ineffably touching, her death scene even more so.
Mr. Fabiano, though a slightly stiff stage presence, also sang nimbly and with attractive tone, his voice showing real metal at times. Roland Wood was a little woolly and wobbly as the elder Germont, but Jennifer Panara was winning as Violetta's friend Flora.
Leo Hussain conducted, and both chorus and orchestra had fine moments. All this despite the thunder and wind storm that blew through the open-air theater during most of the third and fourth acts.
The pleasures of ''Le Nozze di Figaro'' were different, achieved through the work of a unified and multitalented ensemble. Perhaps the best-established singer here was the Countess, Susanna Phillips, heard just a week before at the Aspen Music Festival in Colorado as Ellen Orford in Britten's ''Peter Grimes.'' Her touchstone aria in ''Figaro,'' ''Dove sono'' (''Where are the lovely moments''), was a model, delivered straightforwardly at first, then in a gripping half-voice and with melting ornamentation in the da capo repeat.
A sturdy and elegant presence throughout, Ms. Phillips was offset in kind by the Count, Daniel Okulitch, who sang with a full, rich bass-baritone and added a fine comic touch. Zachary Nelson made an attractive, ebullient Figaro, and Lisette Oropesa was irresistible as Susanna, burbling to and fro in a lovely voice. Emily Fons proved unusually persuasive as a male in the trouser role of Cherubino, the libidinous page, and Susanne Mentzer, who used to be quite the Cherubino herself, brought the older Marcellina (Figaro's mother, it turns out) to appealing life.
As Mr. Pelly did with costumes in ''La Traviata,'' Bruce Donnell, in this ''Figaro'' production from 2008, made flowers a sort of keynote: markers of class, since they are grown and bestowed by underlings for the flattery and edification of aristocrats. Flowers are a frequent presence in the opera -- with Cherubino's death-defying leap into the flower pots, the floral homage paid to the Countess by shepherdesses and the final scene in the garden -- and Mr. Donnell makes them omnipresent.
For others, the main attractions of the season will undoubtedly be the new productions. I willingly admit to my own shortcomings here: a limited tolerance for operetta silliness of the kind shown in ''The Grand Duchess of Gerolstein'' and for bel canto vocal display of the type that fills ''La Donna del Lago'' (''The Lady of the Lake'').
That said, the star turns were remarkable. The veteran Ms. Graham plays the Grand Duchess to the hilt as a cougar, in the director Lee Blakeley's conception, a woman who is willing to go to war simply to relieve her boredom. For whatever reason, the action is transferred to the United States, a land blessedly free of duchies. The music is left in French, the dialogue presented in English.
Ms. Graham dominates (in every sense) and sings with her usual richness. Paul Appleby is modestly appealing as Fritz, a second-class private promoted to general as the Duchess's plaything and busted back down. And Kevin Burdette is stentorian as General Boum, at whose expense Fritz is promoted.
Mr. Blakeley fills the stage with colorful costumes (designed by Jo van Schuppen) and entertaining dance (choreographed by Peggy Hickey) and stage activity.
Ms. DiDonato's performance as Walter Scott's Lady of the Lake is indisputably great, both vocally and dramatically. And she is superbly supported by the tenor Lawrence Brownlee, as Uberto, King James of Scotland in disguise.
The supporting cast is less effective. René Barbera, as Rodrigo, the chief of the Highlanders, commands a vocal agility to rival that of the leads, but his tone tends to turn steely. Marianna Pizzolato, in the trouser role of Malcolm (who is in amorous pursuit of Elena, the Lady), sings well but fails to project anything remotely mannish.
Paul Curran's production, with set and costume designs by Kevin Knight, is serviceable.
The audiences were more universally enthusiastic than I was, showering ovations on revivals and new productions alike. More power to the Santa Fe Opera.
The Santa Fe Opera season continues through Aug. 24 in Santa Fe, N.M.; (800) 280-4654, santafeopera.org.

HEADLINE: For Obamacare, Hurdles Lie Ahead

BYLINE: By EDUARDO PORTER. 
E-mail: eporter@nytimes.com; Twitter: @portereduardo

 BODY:
Like other big employers, in the mid-1990s Harvard University was struggling with the ballooning cost of providing health insurance.
It chose what was a novel solution for the time. It dropped its standard deal -- a subsidy that rose in line with the price of the insurance policy -- and switched some 10,000 workers on its payroll to a fixed subsidy that encouraged them to shop around for care.
For Harvard's accountants, the change worked wonders. A study a couple of years later by David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist, and Sarah Reber, a Harvard graduate, concluded that competition among insurers cut the university's health bill by 5 to 8 percent.
But not everybody was equally pleased. Families of workers who chose the Preferred Provider Organization offered by Blue Cross/Blue Shield -- the most comprehensive plan, with lots of doctors and hospitals on its network -- faced a $500-a-year jump in their out-of-pocket spending on health care. 
Younger and healthier workers canceled their P.P.O. plans, enrolling in cheaper H.M.O. options or dropping Harvard insurance altogether. Left with a sicker patient base, the P.P.O. raised its premiums further, which prompted the next layer of relatively healthy customers to leave.
And so on. In 1997, Blue Cross/Blue Shield withdrew its P.P.O. from the market, making it a victim of what economists call the death spiral of adverse selection.
In a couple of months the nation is set to experience a similar shock on a very large scale: the greatest change in how Americans pay for health care since the advent of Medicare nearly half a century ago.
Come October, millions of uninsured people will be able to choose one of several health plans, offered at four different tiers of service and cost through new health exchanges coming onstream in every state.
Cheap ''bronze'' plans will shoulder some 60 percent of patients' medical expenses. Pricey ''platinum'' plans will cover at least 90 percent. But insurers will not be allowed to exclude people with pre-existing conditions, or charge more for the sick, or put a lifetime cap on medical costs. Their policies will have to cover a minimum standard of medical care. And the government will subsidize those who cannot afford to buy the policies.
President Obama and his advisers hope the overhaul will do two things. The first is to extend coverage to tens of millions of Americans who today lack health insurance. The second is to hold the line on rising health care costs.
''Over time, success will depend on what happens to the cost curve,'' Professor Cutler told me. ''If we don't bend the cost curve, everything will fail. The government won't be able to afford it. Nobody will be able to afford it.''
In theory, the overhaul could meet both goals. Millions of new Americans armed with a subsidy and shopping among plans would bring consumer choice to bear, finally, on the health care industry. Insurers would compete to create policies that offered the most value for money, pressuring hospitals and doctors on behalf of all of us.
Yet despite the care the administration took in establishing incentives and safeguards, even some of Obamacare's most committed backers are wondering whether the experiment will work as advertised -- or, like Harvard's P.P.O., go off the rails along the way.
Adverse selection is perhaps the direst threat. For Obamacare to work, millions of healthy, young, uninsured Americans must join a health plan to counterbalance the sicker millions who are most likely to buy insurance. Otherwise, health plans on the exchanges will have to raise premiums to shoulder the higher costs.
Selection will also take other forms. Healthier Americans will probably flock to cheaper bronze plans. And insurers will vie to enroll the healthy. In some states, big insurers have chosen not to participate in exchanges to avoid their strictures. On the outside, they could still sell cheap plans to skim off the healthy and avoid a rule that insurers on the exchanges must also offer more generous silver and gold plans.
Adverse selection is not the only risk.
A few studies have found that more competition among health insurers leads to lower hospital fees on average and that premiums rise when insurer competition diminishes. But researchers have also found that top hospitals -- which any decent plan must have on its network -- increase their fees when more health plans compete for their business.
Some economists have voiced fears that insurers with small market shares will not have the clout to bargain effectively with enormous hospital systems, which are being encouraged to consolidate even further into Accountable Care Organizations that take charge of patients' entire health needs.
''The more health plans compete for insured in a local health market, the more fragmented the payment side of the market will be vis-Ã -vis the ever more consolidated supply side,'' Uwe Reinhardt of Princeton, a contributor to The Times's Economix blog, wrote me in an e-mail. ''And the higher prices for health care will be.''
This month, Washington State announced that it had rejected the applications of five health plans on the grounds that they did not have enough hospital capacity in their networks. John Holahan of the Urban Institute suggests that more states should worry about that possibility.
''We were told that insurers would develop narrow networks excluding high-cost providers, and squeeze providers to give lower rates,'' Mr. Holahan told me. ''But smaller insurers will probably not get a good network at good prices.''
Republicans -- unyielding critics of Obamacare -- have been gleefully issuing forecasts of doom. A report in May by Republicans on the House Committee on Energy and Commerce forecast disaster all around.
Disaster is unlikely. There are provisions in the Affordable Care Act to mitigate adverse selection, including the subsidy and a small fine for those who refuse to buy insurance. Risk adjustment mechanisms to compensate health plans that enroll a sicker pool of patients should prevent death spirals and reduce insurers' incentive to skim off the healthy.
States have been disclosing plans approved for their exchanges. It appears there will be enough to offer real choice. In Massachusetts the number of insurers has increased fourfold since it introduced a health insurance exchange in 2006. Over the period, the market share of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Massachusetts fell to 40 percent of individual enrollment, from 80 percent.
And while premiums will increase for some people, there is little reason to expect they will soar across the board.
Still, avoiding disaster does not amount to success. Recent studies have come to radically different conclusions on the impact of risk adjustment on adverse selection and health care costs. Hospital oligopolies could undo it all.
Jonathan Gruber from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, who advised the administration on the design of Obamacare, argues that the health overhaul strikes the right balance between competition and regulation. Sure, there will be some adverse selection. It is nonetheless an improvement over a health care industry that gets around the problem by not insuring the sick.
That may not be enough, though. Consider Harvard's experience. It eventually fixed its death spiral by requiring that every insurer offer an option with broad access to health providers alongside its typical H.M.O. It added risk adjustment. This prevented further health plan failures, but it did not shield Harvard from inexorably rising health costs. Those are something Obamacare -- and the nation -- cannot afford.

HEADLINE: Searching Big Data for 'Digital Smoke Signals'

BYLINE: By STEVE LOHR

 BODY:
The office has the look and feel of an Internet start-up. The workers are young, the dress is casual and the computer of choice is an Apple notebook. They inhabit a single open room. The walls have whiteboards for scribbling ideas when inspiration strikes.
But the office in Manhattan is not dedicated to the latest app. It is the base camp of the United Nations Global Pulse team -- a tiny unit inside an institution known for its sprawling bureaucracy, not its entrepreneurial hustle. Still, the focus is on harnessing technology in new ways -- using data from social networks, blogs, cellphones and online commerce to transform economic development and humanitarian aid in poorer nations.
''We work hard, play hard and tend to stay well-caffeinated,'' said Robert Kirkpatrick, who leads the group. ''This is an exercise in entrepreneurship.''
The efforts by Global Pulse and a growing collection of scientists at universities, companies and nonprofit groups have been given the label ''Big Data for development.'' It is a field of great opportunity and challenge. The goal, the scientists involved agree, is to bring real-time monitoring and prediction to development and aid programs. Projects and policies, they say, can move faster, adapt to changing circumstances and be more effective, helping to lift more communities out of poverty and even save lives. 
Research by Global Pulse and other groups, for example, has found that analyzing Twitter messages can give an early warning of a spike in unemployment, price rises and disease. Such ''digital smoke signals of distress,'' Mr. Kirkpatrick said, usually come months before official statistics -- and in many developing countries today, there are no reliable statistics.
Finding the signals requires data, though, and much of the most valuable data is held by private companies, especially mobile phone operators, whose networks carry text messages, digital-cash transactions and location data. So persuading telecommunications operators, and the governments that regulate and sometimes own them, to release some of the data is a top task for the group. To analyze the data, the groups apply tools now most widely used for pinpointing customers with online advertising.
''We're trying to track unemployment and disease as if it were a brand,'' Mr. Kirkpatrick said.
Global Pulse is small, employing 11 people in New York. Seven more people work at a laboratory in Jakarta, Indonesia, that opened last fall. And Global Pulse is hiring for another lab in Kampala, Uganda, to open this fall.
The research labs are initially working on demonstration projects to show the potential of the technology. ''But the larger role of Global Pulse is as a catalyst to foster a data ecosystem for development, bringing together the private sector, universities and governments,'' said William Hoffman, an associate director who leads the data-driven development program at the World Economic Forum, which has worked with Global Pulse.
Its United Nations pedigree helps Global Pulse serve as an impresario for data-driven development efforts. ''Global Pulse has been central in raising awareness,'' said Alex Pentland, a data scientist and director of the Human Dynamics Lab at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ''And it is a trusted party in an area that is sensitive for many governments and companies.''
The group traces its origins to the 2008 financial crisis and concerns about how the economic pain would sweep through the developing world. But as Secretary General Ban Ki-moon of the United Nations said in a speech, ''Our traditional 20th-century tools for tracking international development cannot keep up.''
Global Pulse is intended as a 21st century answer to that problem. It was set up in 2009, as an innovation arm in the office of the secretary general. Mr. Kirkpatrick joined in early 2010, began assembling a team and emphasized tightly focused projects and rapid experimentation, while traveling the world to spread the data-for-development gospel at conferences and in private meetings.
There are several nonprofit organizations dedicated to using Internet technology and data for humanitarian ends, including DataKind, Ushahidi, Crisis Mappers and InSTEDD. But those groups typically respond after natural disasters and emergencies. Yet Global Pulse is also focused on re-engineering traditional development projects in transportation, water supplies and food distribution. Its deputy director is Makena Walker, a 15-year veteran of the United Nations' World Food Program.
For all of its goals, Global Pulse needs corporate partners. In addition to working for nonprofits, Mr. Kirkpatrick spent years in the corporate world, having been a founder of the humanitarian systems teams at both Microsoft and Groove Networks, a software company bought by Microsoft in 2005.
In Indonesia, for example, Global Pulse has worked with both Crimson Hexagon, a start-up, and SAS Institute, a large data analytics software company, to mine Twitter messages and other online media for clues to price trends. The smart algorithms must identify not just words, but context and often sentiment. ''I had rice for breakfast'' is not a signal. ''The price of rice is getting scary'' is. The research found that surges in online mentions accurately capture price increases a month or two before official statistics.
''Sentiment analysis of social media is where our technology is headed,'' said I-Sah Hsieh, global manager for international development at SAS. ''We certainly never expected that the U.N. would be our partner for cutting-edge research.''
Cellphones are mobile sensors of human behavior. So the data collected by mobile carriers is often particularly useful for development programs. But the collection and sharing of that data often raises questions about privacy.
Mr. Kirkpatrick has been an advocate of ''data philanthropy'' and the creation of a public ''data commons,'' in which companies contribute large customer data sets, stripped of personally identifying information, for research on development and public health. For companies, Mr. Kirkpatrick insists, it should be a matter of self-interest, since economically healthy communities are more attractive markets.
Orange, formerly France Telecom, took a significant step last year when it released a data set containing 2.5 billion records of calls and text messages exchanged between five million anonymous cellphone users in Ivory Coast. It was done for research purposes and with the cooperation of the Ivory Coast government.
The result was a global contest of ideas, with hundreds of university and corporate scientists participating. The research projects were presented, and winners were announced in May at a conference at M.I.T.; Mr. Kirkpatrick was on a jury selecting the winners.
The winner in the development category was an I.B.M. team of scientists, who analyzed travel patterns, derived from call location data. Minor changes to the bus network, they concluded, could cut the average commute time in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast's largest city, by 10 percent, making is easier for children to travel to school, for rural residents to seek work in the city and to reduce pollution.
Before submitting the call records, Orange executives sent the data set to three European universities, where computer experts probed the anonymous data and made suggestions to improve security.
''It is a gray zone, and there are risks, but we think it's really worth it,'' said Nicolas de Cordes, vice president for marketing vision at Orange. ''We hope this stimulates the desire of other mobile operators to work on best practices for sharing their data.''

HEADLINE: Fast-Food Fight

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
The fast-food workers who have been walking off their jobs illustrate a central fact of contemporary work life in America: As lower-wage occupations have proliferated in the past several years, Americans are increasingly unable to make a living at their jobs. They work harder and are paid less than workers in other advanced countries. And their wages have stagnated even as executive pay has soared.
As measured by the federal minimum wage, currently $7.25 an hour, low-paid work in America is lower paid today than at any time in modern memory. If the minimum wage had kept pace with inflation or average wages over the past nearly 50 years, it would be about $10 an hour; if it had kept pace with the growth in average labor productivity, it would be about $17 an hour. 
In contrast, the median hourly pay of fast-food workers -- most of whom are in their 20s or older and many of whom are parents -- is less than $9 for front-line workers and just above $9 when shift supervisors are included. Not surprising, the strikers demanded better pay -- $15 an hour -- and the right to organize without retaliation.
Also not surprising, they have been motivated to act by the inaction of the nation's leaders. Republicans are against a higher minimum wage, and Democrats are too timid. Legislation proposed by Congressional Democrats would raise the hourly minimum to $10.10 over nearly two-and-a-half years from the date of enactment. President Obama has proposed a similarly gradual increase to $9 an hour. Congress and the White House also squandered a chance to try to improve workers' earnings prospects when they let right-to-organize legislation die years ago.
Activism among fast-food workers is almost certain to continue and is likely to spread to other underpaid workers. Most of the jobs lost during the recession were midwage jobs, while most of the new jobs have been lower paying. In addition to food-service jobs, big growth areas today include home care and retail sales, with median hourly wages of roughly $10 and $11, respectively. According to the Labor Department, six of the 10 occupations that are projected to add the most jobs by 2020 pay wages at the lower end of the scale.
At some point, as strikes continue, well-paid executives in low-wage industries will have to confront the fact that low worker pay is at odds with their companies' upbeat corporate images and their self-images as top executives. (The chief executives of McDonald's and Yum Brands, which owns Taco Bell, Pizza Hut and KFC, are among the nation's highest-paid corporate leaders.)
Political leaders will likewise have to confront their own failures. The strikers did not ask for Washington's help, but there is a lot that Congress and the Obama administration could do. In addition to raising the minimum wage, there needs to be more enforcement of fair labor laws, including crackdowns on employers that misclassify employees as salaried workers, independent contractors or interns in order to deny them overtime, benefits or other pay. It would help, too, for Congress to end the foot-dragging around implementation of a law passed years ago requiring disclosure of the ratio of chief executive pay to that of a company's work force.
The Great Recession and the slow recovery have reinforced trends toward inequality and inadequate pay that were evident even before the last downturn. Fast-food workers are fighting back, in just cause.

HEADLINE: New York's Common Core Test Scores

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
Over the last decade or so, most states deceived the public about the dismal quality of public schools by adopting pathetically weak learning standards that made children appear better prepared than they actually were. Not surprisingly, when states like Kentucky dropped the charade and embraced more challenging standards, scores dropped precipitously. 
That same scenario is playing out in New York State, which, this week, released the first round of scores from tests linked to the rigorous Common Core learning standards, which have been adopted by all but a handful of states.
Teachers in New York are just becoming familiar with instructional methods necessary for teaching more complex skills. Given that reality and a challenging exam, the scores were expected to decline. Still, the test results show how far the state has to go to prepare children for jobs in the new global economy.
The Common Core standards are aimed at helping children acquire sophisticated reasoning skills. The goal is to move the schools away from rote learning -- and those weak, multiple choice bubble tests -- to a writing-intensive curriculum that emphasizes problem-solving skills. Since the new tests require different and stronger skills than the old ones, the state has discouraged direct comparisons of results from the two.
Nevertheless, the data show that about 31 percent of the state's students in third through eighth grades met or exceeded the proficiency standard in language arts. That is down from about 55 percent in 2012 and 77 percent in 2009, when the state tests were easier.
The achievement gap remains a problem. In language arts, for example, 50.4 percent of Asians, 39.9 percent of whites and 16.1 percent of African-Americans were performing at or above the proficiency level. The state will need to intensify efforts aimed at narrowing those gaps.
The new scores were bound to be controversial in New York City thanks to the mayoral race. Some candidates are trying to curry favor with the teachers' union, which is taking a scorched-earth approach to Mayor Michael Bloomberg's educational policies.
Some candidates are looking for ways to blame Mr. Bloomberg for the drop in scores, even though the tests are overseen and managed by the state, and even though the city experienced less of a decline in scores than the state as a whole.
In fact, student performance in New York City is far ahead of that of other large urban districts like Buffalo, Rochester and Syracuse -- where most academic proficiency rates fell into the single digits. The good news is that the test score gap between New York City schools and the state as a whole has narrowed substantially. In math, for example, the proficiency rate in the city's schools was 29.6 percent, behind the statewide rate of 31 percent.
These scores should be seen as a kind of baseline to evaluate student progress from here on out. Instead of sniping at the outgoing mayor, the candidates who are vying to succeed Mr. Bloomberg need to figure out how to advance the reform effort. That means making sure that teachers are fluent in the instructional methods that help students reach the new learning goals. That, in turn, will require high-quality professional development programs that help teachers master the necessary classroom skills.

HEADLINE: Cost of Medical Devices, in the U.S. and Abroad

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re ''For Medical Tourists, Simple Math'' (''Paying Till It Hurts'' series, front page, Aug. 4), about the prices charged by medical device manufacturers, focusing on artificial hips and knees: 
Contrary to the article's claims, the medical technology industry is highly price competitive. Over the last 20 years, industry prices have increased at only one-fifth the rate of prices for other medical goods and services and only about one-third as fast as the Consumer Price Index. Implants like artificial hips and knees are, if anything, even more competitively priced. Medical technology has consistently accounted for a low and stable 6 percent share of national health expenditures.
While prices have actually declined in inflation-adjusted terms, the industry has continued to develop scores of lifesaving and life-enhancing products. Decades of technological advances allow the patient profiled, who could not even stand without pain before surgery, to resume snowboarding.
Low prices and amazing medical progress. That's a good deal for American patients.
STEPHEN J. UBL President, Advanced Medical Technology Association Washington, Aug. 6, 2013
To the Editor:
Your useful account of the much higher prices for hip replacements in the United States compared with Europe only scratches the surface of the problem. At the heart of this situation is the effective elimination of the competition that international transactions in medical services can provide.
''Exporting patients and importing doctors'' is an important way in which we can introduce competition to bring down the exorbitant cost of many surgeries beyond hip replacement. ''Long-distance'' consultations and treatment (telemedicine) are also effective ways to introduce competition and greatly reduce costs.
Equally, relaxing entry by foreign medical personnel will reduce the danger that we will insure people who will be unable to find doctors to treat them.
JAGDISH BHAGWATI SANDIP MADAN New York, Aug. 6, 2013
The writers are, respectively, a professor of economics at Columbia and the chief executive of Global HealthNet.
To the Editor:
Orthopedic surgeons applaud your article's emphasis on joint replacement as a transformative experience. This was demonstrated by the patients profiled, who are back to work, living their active lives.
The article's inclusion of the surgeon's fee for one patient's operation (shown in a graphic) was, however, misleading. The average Medicare reimbursement for an orthopedic surgeon is $1,454 for a total hip replacement, a far cry from the $17,500 for the operation cited in the graphic. Average Medicare reimbursement to a hospital (including the implant) is, as you point out in your article, approximately $12,000, again a far cry from the $44,900 in the graphic.
JOSHUA J. JACOBS THOMAS FEHRING Rosemont, Ill., Aug. 5, 2013
The writers, both doctors, are presidents of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons and the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, respectively.

HEADLINE: Firms Sue City Over Mortgage Plan

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
An investor group filed a federal lawsuit against Richmond, Calif., to prevent the city from using eminent domain to seize mortgages of local residents who owe more than their properties are worth in a bid to keep them in their homes. 
The lawsuit was filed on Wednesday in a Northern California court by the mortgage bond trustees Wells Fargo and Deutsche Bank on behalf of an investor group that includes Pacific Investment Management Company, or Pimco, BlackRock and DoubleLine Capital.
The city recently sent notice to the holders of more than 620 so-called underwater home mortgages in the city, asking them to sell the loans to the city. It would buy the mortgages for 80 percent of the fair value of the homes, write them down and help the homeowners refinance their loans.
The investor group said if the city of Richmond was allowed to go ahead with its plan, it might result in steeper down payment requirements and higher interest rates.

HEADLINE: Milton Friedman, Unperson

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: What happened to the colossus of yore? 

 BODY:
David Glasner has been making a series of posts on the legacy of Milton Friedman, some of them in response to Scott Sumner; they're interesting if you want to delve into the intellectual history. I'm not personally big on such things - in general, what people thought Keynes or Friedman meant ends up being more important than what they turn out, on close reading, to (maybe, possibly) actually have meant. For what it's worth, I think Glasner makes a good case that Friedman was indeed more or less a Keynesian, or maybe Hicksian - certainly that was the message everyone took from his Monetary Framework, which was disappointingly conventional. And Friedman's attempts to claim that Keynes added little that wasn't already in a Chicago oral tradition don't hold up well either.
But never mind. What I think is really interesting is the way Friedman has virtually vanished from policy discourse. Keynes is very much back, even if that fact drives some economists crazy; Hayek is back in some sense, even if one has the suspicion that many self-proclaimed Austrians bring little to the table but the notion that fiat money is the root of all evil - a deeply anti-Friedmanian position. But Friedman is pretty much absent. 
This is hardly what you would have expected not that long ago, when Friedman's reputation bestrode the economic world like a colossus, when Greg Mankiw declared Friedman, not Keynes, the greatest economist of the 20th century, when Ben Bernanke concluded a speech praising Friedman with the famous line,
Let me end my talk by abusing slightly my status as an official representative of the Federal Reserve. I would like to say to Milton and Anna: Regarding the Great Depression. You're right, we did it. We're very sorry. But thanks to you, we won't do it again.
Best wishes for your next ninety years.
So what happened to Milton Friedman?
Part of the answer is that at this point both of Friedman's key contributions to macroeconomics look hard to defend. 
First, on monetary policy: Even if you give him a pass on the 3 percent growth in M2 thing, which was abandoned by almost everyone long ago, Friedman was still very much associated with the notion that the Fed can control the money supply, and controlling the money supply is all you need to stabilize the economy. In the wake of the 2008 crisis, this looks wrong from soup to nuts: the Fed can't even control broad money, because it can add to bank reserves and they just sit there; and money in turn bears little relationship to GDP. And in retrospect the same was true in the 1930s, so that Friedman's claim that the Fed could easily have prevented the Great Depression now looks highly dubious.
Second, on inflation and unemployment: Friedman's success, with Phelps, in predicting stagflation was what really pushed his influence over the top; his notion of a natural rate of unemployment, of a vertical Phillips curve in the long run, became part of every textbook exposition. But it's now very clear that at low rates of inflation the Phillips curve isn't vertical at all, that there's an underlying downward nominal rigidity to wages and perhaps many prices too that makes the natural rate hypothesis a very bad guide under depression conditions.
So Friedman's economic analysis has taken a serious hit. But that's not the whole story behind his disappearance; after all, all those economists who have been predicting runaway inflation still have a constituency after being wrong year after year.
Friedman's larger problem, I'd argue, is that he was, when all is said and done, a man trying to straddle two competing world views - and our political environment no longer has room for that kind of straddle.
Think of it this way: Friedman was an avid free-market advocate, who insisted that the market, left to itself, could solve almost any problem. Yet he was also a macroeconomic realist, who recognized that the market definitely did not solve the problem of recessions and depressions. So he tried to wall off macroeconomics from everything else, and make it as inoffensive to laissez-faire sensibilities as possible. Yes, he in effect admitted, we do need stabilization policy - but we can minimize the government's role by relying only on monetary policy, none of that nasty fiscal stuff, and then not even allowing the monetary authority any discretion.
At a fundamental level, however, this was an inconsistent position: if markets can go so wrong that they cause Great Depressions, how can you be a free-market true believer on everything except macro? And as American conservatism moved ever further right, it had no room for any kind of interventionism, not even the sterilized, clean-room interventionism of Friedman's monetarism.
So Friedman has vanished from the policy scene - so much so that I suspect that a few decades from now, historians of economic thought will regard him as little more than an extended footnote.

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: JPMorgan's Latest Legal Threat

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase faces criminal and civil investigations into sales of mortgage securities. | Hilton Worldwide, the hotel company owned by the Blackstone Group, has begun preparations for an I.P.O. | Carl C. Icahn is bolstering his assault on the Dell buyout effort. 

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it faced a criminal and civil investigation into whether it sold shoddy mortgage securities to investors before the financial crisis, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess report in DealBook. The investigation is the latest legal threat to the bank and one of several mortgage-related problems for the industry.
JPMorgan said the civil division of the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of California had "preliminarily concluded" that JPMorgan flouted federal laws with its sale of subprime mortgage securities from 2005 to 2007. The parallel criminal inquiry is in a preliminary stage, according to a person briefed on the matter.
"Adding to scrutiny of the bank, federal prosecutors in Philadelphia are examining whether JPMorgan duped investors into buying troubled mortgage securities that later imploded, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity," DealBook writes. "The prosecutors are investigating whether JPMorgan churned out the mortgage-backed securities without ensuring that the investments met underwriting standards, the people said." 
BLACKSTONE MOVES TO SELL HILTON IN I.P.O. | Hilton Worldwide, the giant hotel company that the Blackstone Group bought in the summer of 2007 for $26 billion, has begun preparations for an initial public offering, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. That includes hiring four banks - Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley - to start the process, according to people briefed on the matter. An offering for Hilton would probably come in the first half of next year, one of these people said.
"Private equity firms have been eager to sell their companies, either outright or through an initial offering, to take advantage of booming stock markets and generate realized profits for themselves and their limited partners," Mr. de la Merced writes. "That has served to bolster the financials of the alternative investment giants. Last month, Blackstone reported a tripling of its second-quarter profit, thanks in part to cashing out of its investments."
ON THE AGENDA | 
T-Mobile US and Apollo Global Management report earnings before the market opens. Eric Lefkofsky, the newly named chief executive of Groupon, is on CNBC at 10:15 a.m. Joan Solotar, senior managing director at Blackstone, is on CNBC at 5 p.m.
ICAHN BOLSTERS ASSAULT ON DELL | Carl C. Icahn is not giving up his fight against the effort by Michael S. Dell to buy the computer maker he founded. The question is whether Mr. Icahn's latest moves shore up his assault as the odds stack up against him, Mr. de la Merced writes in DealBook. On Monday, Mr. Icahn disclosed that he bought an additional four million shares in Dell late last week, bringing his stake to roughly 9 percent. He has also filed a lawsuit in an effort to prevent a special committee of Dell's board from altering the rules of the proposed leveraged buyout.
"By buying the additional shares, Mr. Icahn has cemented himself as Dell's biggest outside investor with an 8.9 percent stake, surpassed only by the company's eponymous founder and his 15.7 percent stake," Mr. de la Merced writes. "But the Dell special committee's move greatly diminished Mr. Icahn's power to block the deal."

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: JPMorgan's Latest Legal Challenge

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: JPMorgan Chase faces criminal and civil investigations into sales of mortgage securities. | Hilton Worldwide, the hotel company owned by the Blackstone Group, has begun preparations for an I.P.O. | Carl C. Icahn is bolstering his assault on the Dell buyout effort. 

 BODY:
JPMorgan Chase disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it faced a criminal and civil investigation into whether it sold shoddy mortgage securities to investors before the financial crisis, Jessica Silver-Greenberg and Ben Protess report in DealBook. The investigation is the latest legal threat to the bank and one of several mortgage-related problems for the industry.
JPMorgan said the civil division of the United States attorney's office for the Eastern District of California had "preliminarily concluded" that JPMorgan flouted federal laws with its sale of subprime mortgage securities from 2005 to 2007. The parallel criminal inquiry is in a preliminary stage, according to a person briefed on the matter.
"Adding to scrutiny of the bank, federal prosecutors in Philadelphia are examining whether JPMorgan duped investors into buying troubled mortgage securities that later imploded, according to people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity," DealBook writes. "The prosecutors are investigating whether JPMorgan churned out the mortgage-backed securities without ensuring that the investments met underwriting standards, the people said." 
BLACKSTONE MOVES TO SELL HILTON IN I.P.O. | Hilton Worldwide, the giant hotel company that the Blackstone Group bought in the summer of 2007 for $26 billion, has begun preparations for an initial public offering, DealBook's Michael J. de la Merced reports. That includes hiring four banks - Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley - to start the process, according to people briefed on the matter. An offering for Hilton would probably come in the first half of next year, one of these people said.
"Private equity firms have been eager to sell their companies, either outright or through an initial offering, to take advantage of booming stock markets and generate realized profits for themselves and their limited partners," Mr. de la Merced writes. "That has served to bolster the financials of the alternative investment giants. Last month, Blackstone reported a tripling of its second-quarter profit, thanks in part to cashing out of its investments."

HEADLINE: After Going All In During Mining Boom, BHP Cuts Its Ambitions

BYLINE: WILLIAM MACNAMARA


HIGHLIGHT: BHP Billiton, the world&#8217;s largest mining company, sits atop a sector that is deeply out of favor with investors, and it is aggressively curtailing its spending in hopes of winning them over. 

 BODY:
BHP Billiton, the world's largest mining company, was willing to spend big in early 2012. It was building new mines and upgrading old ones, at a cost of $18 billion. It considered a potential expansion of its copper and uranium mine, Olympic Dam, which could have cost as much as $20 billion. It proposed a deepwater extension of Port Hedland, its iron ore port, an estimated $10 billion or more.
But BHP has significantly scaled back its ambitions in the last year, replacing its multibillion-dollar spending spree with an austere program of cost cuts and efficiency drives. It shelved the plans for Port Hedland and Olympic Dam, both in Australia, noting the need to find "a less capital-intensive design." The mergers and acquisitions department is now referred to as the "D department" internally, to signify its focus on disposals, according to a person close to BHP who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The U-turn from expansionary spending to aggressive pullback has swept the global mining industry with brutal speed and force. With fixed costs rising, commodities prices slumping and profit shrinking, the chief executives of four of the biggest multinationals - BHP, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Barrick Gold - have all been replaced. And pinched companies are scrambling to sell off assets and raise money, with mixed results. On Thursday, Rio Tinto shelved plans to sells some aluminum assets, citing the tough environment.
In short, the commodities boom has ended.
BHP now sits atop a sector that is deeply out of favor with investors. Their central complaint is that the big companies, during a period of high metals prices and strong profit from 2009 to 2011, spent too much money building mines instead of returning money to shareholders. In the current environment, these expensive new mines look ill advised, perhaps dangerously so, given that the new capacity could drive down prices further.
"Investors are more than entitled to be concerned about the productivity of the capital they have invested in our business," said Andrew Mackenzie, the new chief executive of BHP. "They are more than entitled to ask us to think long and hard about every piece of new investment we make, relative to whether we make cash returns to them."
"If there is a new wind blowing through my part of the sector," he said, "it is the emphasis now - given that we invested quite a lot during a period of slightly higher prices - on maximizing the returns from the investments we have already made."
Mr. Mackenzie, a Scotsman who speaks five languages, is the new, somber voice of the industry. He speaks in the BHP style of academic understatement, referring to the boom as "a period of slightly higher prices." For a decade, the company's top ranks have been filled with doctorate-holding economists, management consultants and former academics who become animated when discussing long-term Chinese consumption trends or pricing structures for iron ore.
Given that atmosphere, BHP executives see the rise and fall of commodity prices as part of the typical economic cycle, stressing that the downward pressure should not prompt panic. A longtime industry executive who has experienced the previous ups and downs, Mr. Mackenzie says his job is not to change the company's strategy but rather to mold it to today's market realities.
BHP can afford to take the long view. Despite the industry volatility, the company has maintained stable profits, thanks to an unusually diverse variety of commodities. BHP produces oil and gas in addition to iron ore, copper, coal, nickel, aluminum, uranium, diamonds and manganese. In their zeal for economic data, executives constantly highlight a chart that they call "the spaghetti chart" or "the Jackson Pollock chart," a mess of squiggly lines showing the volatile earnings for each commodity BHP produces, and a smooth line through the middle representing the company's relatively stable profit.
The diversification has helped BHP weather the harsh downturn better than peers like Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Vale.
BHP never cut its dividend during the financial crisis. And the company's $5.5 billion in write-downs over the last two years have proven manageable given its earnings. BHP, which will report its annual results later this month, is expected to make $12.5 billion in profits for the latest fiscal year that ended in June.
By comparison, Rio Tinto took a $14 billion write-down this year on two bad investments in Canadian aluminum and African coal. On Thursday, the miner reported a 18 percent drop in profit for the first half of the year, reflecting the weakness in the prices of metals.
Although BHP is holding up better than many rivals, its stock is still suffering. Shares of BHP, which have recovered modestly in recent weeks are still off 15 percent this year.
"What investors are upset about is how these mining companies burned billions of dollars through write-downs," said Rob Clifford, a mining analyst at Deutsche Bank. "It's this idea of the companies having too much money and then squandering it."
With their stocks down, Mr. Mackenzie and other mining chiefs are trying to be highly attuned to investors. In recent months, Mr. Mackenzie has talked to his universe of shareholders, from global institutions to pensioners. The common theme is increasing their cash returns.
When he started in his new role in May, he set the tone by taking a base salary 20 percent lower than that of his predecessor, Marius Kloppers. "I felt that was in keeping with the expectations of the marketplace right now," he said. "I have a lot to do to move the company forward in terms of productivity and value for money."
He spent his first day on the job visiting BHP's complex of iron ore mines, railways and ports in the badlands of Western Australia. As he toured the vast industrial complex, he quizzed managers about how efficiently the haul trucks were moving ore, he said, because "trucks are a big part of our $36 billion cost base."
New projects have also been frozen indefinitely. The company has announced $1.9 billion in cost savings since July 2012. Within two or three years, Mr. Mackenzie said, he wants capital expenditures to fall to $15 billion or less, compared with $18 billion today.
"His reign should be marked by nothing radical," said Mr. Clifford of Deutsche Bank. "It should be marked by bludgeoning, boring, good old cost-cutting."
But BHP and other big mining companies can't rein in spending overnight. Capital expenditures in the mining business mushroomed from $20 billion in 2003 to $120 billion in 2012, according to Goldman Sachs. Much of the money is tied up in incomplete projects. So the spending can only roll off gradually, as mining projects approved in the heady days are finished in 2014 or 2015. Then there is always the possibility that some projects will take more money and more time."BHP is in a pincer for the time being," said Jeff Largey, a mining analyst at Macquarie. He estimated that BHP's capital expenditures would drop to $17 billion during its fiscal year starting in July, roughly in line with its cash flows. "So there is not much left over for shareholders."
"All that said, I think BHP will be the first to emerge," he added.

HEADLINE: Woes of Detroit Hurt Borrowing by Its Neighbors

BYLINE: MARY WILLIAMS WALSH


HIGHLIGHT: Two weeks after Detroit declared bankruptcy, cities, counties and other local governments in Michigan are getting a cold shoulder in the municipal bond market. 

 BODY:
The Detroit Effect has rippled all the way to Wall Street.
Two weeks after Detroit declared bankruptcy, cities, counties and other local governments in Michigan are getting a cold shoulder in the municipal bond market.
The judgment has been swift and brutal. Borrowing costs are up around the state, in some cases drastically. On Thursday, Saginaw County became the latest casualty when it said it was delaying a $60 million bond sale planned for Friday. It had hoped to put the proceeds into its pension fund.
It was the third postponed bond sale in Michigan since Detroit dropped its bombshell on July 18. Earlier this week, the city of Battle Creek said it would postpone a $16 million deal scheduled for August because of concerns that investors would demand interest rates that were too high. And the previous week, Genesee County withdrew a $54 million bond sale from the market for the same reason. 
Detroit's bankruptcy, the largest ever by a municipality, has raised fundamental concerns about the safety and security of municipal bonds, certainly in Michigan but potentially elsewhere in the country, too. The municipal bond market appears to be sending Michigan's cities a message that no matter how well rated they are, they are going to have to postpone their plans and projects or pay more for them.
When Jefferson County, Ala., declared bankruptcy in 2011, there were warnings it had tainted the credit of all other municipalities in the state, but the expected fallout never materialized. After Orange County, Calif., came through its bankruptcy in the 1990s, its borrowing costs actually fell. But Michigan appears to have something new - a bankruptcy that makes it harder for others in the state to borrow.
Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has proposed imposing deep cuts on some bondholders - treating them the same, in effect, as retired Detroit workers who have been receiving city-paid health insurance that will now end. Mr. Orr's bankruptcy plan would put them all at the back of the line for whatever money is available, as unsecured creditors.
And because the city's bankruptcy filing was approved by the governor, Rick Snyder, it is seen as the best distillation of how Michigan will treat certain bondholders in times of trouble.
Putting a city's "full faith, credit and taxing power" behind a bond no longer means what it did in the past, anywhere in the state, critics say. The governor and Mr. Orr have said they are not concerned about the effect of the bankruptcy plan on the municipal bond market as a whole. But other participants find their treatment of indebtedness profoundly disturbing, and their anxiety has spilled over to other Michigan municipalities.
"A lot of the people I talk to are investors who are just very angry about this," said Matt Fabian, a managing director at Municipal Market Advisors. "Bonds are so cheap everywhere across the whole market, there's no reason to put anyone in Michigan bonds right now."
Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Governor Snyder, acknowledged the concerns, but said they were overblown. She called Detroit's financial breakdown "an incredibly unique situation," and said the bond rating agencies would continue to rate Michigan's other municipalities individually, each on its own strengths and weaknesses no matter what went on in Detroit.
"Michigan is home to hundreds of local communities across our state, rated by the credit agencies," she said. According to a recent analysis by Standard & Poor's, she said, "only two of those aren't investment grade. There continue to be an abundance of sound, smart investments to make in Michigan and our local communities. Michigan's fiscal house is in order and sound."
Mr. Fabian and others who work with municipal bonds cited two main concerns coming out of Detroit. First was the city's plan to put several different kinds of bonds, plus the retirees, into one big category - unsecured creditors - even though bonds were issued with many different ratings and promised investors different interest rates accordingly. If Detroit succeeds in lumping them all together in a single bankruptcy class, then by logic, the bonds of other Michigan cities should have their ratings changed to reflect that. The ratings would go down, and the investors holding the bonds would take losses.
Creditors recalled that Michigan's state treasurer helped to market some of Detroit's debt, encouraging investors to buy it as very safe.
"Now they're saying that the investors are getting what they deserve, and they should have known better," Mr. Fabian said. "So you can't really trust the statements of the state government."
The other concern was that the federal bankruptcy court might ultimately approve Detroit's treatment of bondholders, setting a precedent that distressed cities in other states might be tempted to follow. Their borrowing costs would then also rise, and that would undercut the way most of the country's roads, bridges and schools are built - planned and financed at the local level.
Local officials in Michigan were putting on brave faces Thursday, saying the chill in the market might prove to be temporary, or to have been caused by broad credit conditions unrelated to Detroit. As the Federal Reserve has signaled a coming end to its easy-money policies, interest rates have been rising, making it more expensive for almost everyone to borrow.
"There's been a lot of things going on in the market," said Linda Morrison, the city finance manager for Battle Creek. Since last spring, her city had been planning to raise $16 million to pay for a new roof and better seating for the Kellogg Arena, among other improvements. She said that none of the projects were needed urgently and that Battle Creek could afford to wait for more favorable market conditions.
She said she was aware that Detroit's bankruptcy plan had dealt a blow to longstanding beliefs about a city's "full faith, credit and taxing power." But, she added, maybe the judge would decide things in the bondholders' favor, and the markets would come back.
"Who's to say that the court won't decide it that way?" she said.

HEADLINE: Abortion in America and Europe

BYLINE: ROSS DOUTHAT


HIGHLIGHT: A response to critics on the lessons of Europe&#8217;s abortion laws. 

 BODY:
My column two weeks ago on what other developed countries' abortion laws tell us about the impact of abortion restrictions prompted a number of rebuttals, most notably from Scott Lemieux at The American Prospect and Katha Pollitt at The Nation. To my point that a number of European countries restrict second and third-trimester abortions without producing any obviously disastrous consequences for women's health and professional advancement, both Lemieux and Pollitt argue that the European bans only work because the countries in question make first-trimester abortion more accessible and affordable than does the United States. Here's Lemieux:
... You can't discuss the restrictive aspects of abortion policy in some European countries without acknowledging other policies that make abortion more accessible. Adopting French abortion policy would require not only additional regulations on abortion in some states and fewer in others; we'd need to repeal of the Hyde Amendment and enact provisions to make abortion providers much more accessible in general. 
Similarly, one cannot simply compare the language of statutes without considering how they are implemented. A waiting period requirement works very differently in a context in which most women can obtain safe abortions for free at local public hospitals and are protected by labor laws than in a context where many women live hundreds of miles from the nearest abortion provider and can be fired at will for missing a day of work. Counseling requirements work differently in countries where there isn't a large, politically potent anti-choice lobby dedicated to ensuring that doctors "inform" their patients with scientifically inaccurate anti-choice propaganda. And so on.
And here's Pollitt, making a similar point:
Here's what's really different about Western Europe: in France, you can get an abortion at any public hospital and it's paid for by the government. In Germany, you can get one at a hospital or a doctor's office, and health plans will pay for it for low-income women. In Sweden, abortion is free through eighteen weeks. Moreover, unlike the time limits passed in Texas and some other states, or floating around in Congress, the European limits have exceptions, variously for physical or mental health, fetal anomaly or rape. Contrast that with what anti-choicers want for the United States, where Paul Ryan memorably described a health exception to a proposed late-term abortion ban as "a loophole wide enough to drive a Mack truck through it." If a French or German or Swedish 12-year-old, or a traumatized rape victim, or a woman carrying a fetus with Tay-Sachs disease shows up after the deadline, I bet a way can often be found to quietly take care of them. If not, Britain or the Netherlands, where second trimester abortion is legal, are possibilities.
A few observations. First off, Pollitt is slightly misinformed about the Texas legislation. Like many of the European laws she mentions, it does include exceptions related to maternal health and fetal anomalies: Its post-viability ban does not apply (and I quote) "to abortions that are necessary to avert the death or substantial and irreversible physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnant woman or abortions that are performed on unborn children with severe fetal abnormalities." (You can read an anti-abortion critique of the fetal-abnormality provision here.) Obviously there is disagreement about the appropriate scope of such provisions, and there Pollitt and Paul Ryan would certainly differ. But the Texas ban is not actually absolute, and its exceptions do cover at least some of the hard cases that pro-choice advocates tend to cite in opposition to such laws.
Second, Lemieux and Pollitt are absolutely right that first-trimester abortion is more accessible and affordable in some parts of continental Europe than it is in some regions of the United States, and the accessibility question does matter when it comes to assessing the ultimate impact of second and third-trimester bans. At the same time, though, in Europe as in the United States there's a lot of variation in the accessibility of abortion, and (to borrow Lemieux's point) the way statutes are implemented matters as much as how they're written. (This Planned Parenthood survey from 2009 provides a high-level, country-by-country skim of some of these accessibility issues, obviously from a pro-choice perspective.) This is true within countries - it's easier to get an abortion in Berlin than in Bavaria, not surprisingly - and also true when you make cross-country comparisons. Germany's counseling/waiting period regime arguably puts more official limits on first-trimester abortion than Italy's laws, for instance, but as Pollitt herself allows, "in much of Italy, it's hard to find an abortion because so many doctors refuse to perform them." In Spain, where abortion is very much a live political issue, there was a near-absolute ban (the only exception was for rape) until the last decade, when a Socialist government passed a first-trimester legalization - but the older ban included a health exception that was interpreted permissively enough to basically allow for first-trimester elective abortions, mostly in private clinics, in many parts of the country. And then of course there's Ireland, where abortion is clearly more restricted, at least for now, than in even the deepest-red U.S. states.
So yes, it is an oversimplification to suggest that France or Germany are somehow obviously more "pro-life" overall than the United States, given the multiplicity of differences between our system and theirs. But it's also an oversimplification to say that the U.S. is unique among developed nations in having significant variations in abortion access, or robust political debate on the issue. And the reason to look at the European experience is not because the continent is somehow an exemplar of exactly the policies that pro-life American conservatives are pushing now, or would put in place if given constitutional license. Rather, it's because it provides examples of many different approaches to the issue - stringently pro-life with a stronger welfare state (Ireland), expansively pro-choice with a much stronger welfare state (Sweden), more pro-life in law but relatively pro-choice in practice (Spain, until recently), relatively pro-choice in law but more culturally pro-life (Italy, arguably), and so on - that don't necessarily map on to America's right vs. left debate at all.
This variation, in turn, gives us more data on the original question that my column asked: What happens to a modern society when abortion is restricted? And I don't think that either Pollitt or Lemieux offered much of a rebuttal to my suggestion that Europe's variations and their apparent consequences pose a problem for two commonplace pro-choice assumptions: That restrictions on abortion don't actually reduce abortion rates (which appears to be true in neither the U.S. nor in Europe), and more importantly, that any restrictions on abortion are necessarily threats to female professional advancement and bodily health.
The example of Ireland, in particular, provides no evidence for the latter contention: No one seriously disputes that Ireland has long had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the developed West, and yet there is no clear sign in the data that Irish women are suffering relative to the Western counterparts in the obvious ways that pro-choice arguments would lead one to expect. Lemieux responds to my points about Ireland by falling back on a philosophical defense of abortion rights, which is fine (and deserving of a response a later date) but not really responsive to the empirical question. Pollitt responds by noting that many Irish women go abroad for abortion - but those numbers are small relative to the abortion rates in other countries, and in any event they don't change the fact that Ireland throws up much more severe impediments to abortion than the kind of restrictions that inspired Wendy Davis's filibuster. So I will re-submit my question: If abortion rights and easy abortion access are essential to female advancement, why have Irish women advanced without them?
And then finally I'll note, again, that the European experience poses a challenge for conservative abortion opponents as well, who need to consider the possibility that restrictions on abortion might work better - or, perhaps, only work at all - with more generous public provisions for maternal health care. But that's a subject for another post.

HEADLINE: Getting Big Banks Out of the Commodities Business

BYLINE: SIMON JOHNSON


HIGHLIGHT: Allowing the nation&#8217;s largest banks to own physical commodities increases both their power and their potential to disrupt the economy, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Simon Johnson, former chief economist of the International Monetary Fund, is the Ronald A. Kurtz Professor of Entrepreneurship at the M.I.T. Sloan School of Management and co-author of "White House Burning: The Founding Fathers, Our National Debt, and Why It Matters to You." 
A debate has broken out over whether the country's largest banks should be allowed to own physical commodities, including the facilities used to transport, store and process these goods. This may be the strangest debate we have had about banking in the United States in the last five years, because the answer is completely obvious: it is a new and very bad idea to allow big banks to also dominate any dimension of the commodities business. It is also not sustainable politically, and the big banks will soon have to divest themselves of these activities. 
The headlines are attention-grabbing and the investigations are substantive. Goldman Sachs is reported to be slow-walking aluminum out of warehouses that it controls. JPMorgan Chase is settling accusations that it manipulated energy prices and may also face pressure to get out of the metals and oil business more broadly. Big companies that buy aluminum, like MillerCoors, are not happy with the way banks have been operating, and these nonfinancial companies have an important political voice also. The political changes afoot may also affect Morgan Stanley and Barclays, which both have significant involvement in commodities.
Senator Sherrod Brown, Democrat of Ohio and a leader among those who want a safer and better run financial system, asked recently, "What do we want our banks to do, make small-business loans or refine and transport oil? Issue mortgages or corner the metals market?" 
Banks have not always been allowed so many tentacles. Go back, for example, to the political deal behind the founding of the Federal Reserve System in 1913. After the crisis of 1907, there had been wide-ranging arguments on whether the United States should have a central bank, along the lines that already existed in some parts of Western Europe. 
One major and legitimate concern expressed by some of Senator Brown's predecessors (including Louis Brandeis, then a prominent skeptic of banking practices and later a Supreme Court justice) was that providing bankers with a government backstop would enable some of them - particularly those already running large financial institutions in New York - to become even more powerful. 
This concern was shared by others, more to the right of the political spectrum, who worried that anyone who could borrow from the Fed would gain an unfair advantage in nonfinancial activities. The financier J.P. Morgan was seen as a dominant force in sectors like railroads and steel, and there was a great deal of broader concern about what was regarded as the "money trust."
The ultimate quid pro quo was, not unreasonably, that while the newly created Fed would act as a lender of last resort to banks, it would also help to constrain the activities in which these banks could engage. The consensus was that the United States needed a stable banking system for intermediation (from savers to borrowers) and to run the payments system. Outside of that, a freer market - without downside protection provided by the Fed - was the choice.
In part, the restrictions on banks' activities were about limiting risk, but these constraints were also very much about commercial fairness. The Fed was not offering any kind of backstop to manufacturing or transportation companies, and if banks were to enter those activities, they would presumably have an unfair advantage.
In recent decades, unfortunately, this picture changed drastically. In part, firms known as "investment banks" (which were not banks in a legal sense) were allowed to become more like regular Federal Reserve System banks, becoming larger and financing themselves with short-term liabilities (including what are known as repo transactions). 
As Thomas Hoenig, the vice chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, put it recently about the financial crisis of 2008, 
The facts are, however, whether the institutions were called a "commercial bank," "investment bank" or "shadow bank," it was by the time of the crisis a distinction without a difference.
When the crisis hit, Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley were allowed to become bank-holding companies, with access to funds from the Federal Reserve. They were not, however, required to divest their commodities activities (or anything else that we can discern).
At the same time, existing large banks were allowed to add a wide range of commodities-related activities. Citigroup was allowed to expand into commodities after 2003, and its competitors followed suit. A great deal of JPMorgan Chase's expansion into commodities actually took place after the financial crisis, with the acquisition of Bear Stearns as a key step in that direction. (See this 2010 profile of Blythe Masters, a key executive.)
When you allow any companies both cheap government-backed financing and carte blanche to take over other sectors, what would you expect to happen? And if you allow any kind of unfair market power to develop, surely it would be a shock if this did not result in higher prices or less good service - or even some kind of manipulation.
All of the above was on the table at a recent Senate hearing conducted by Senator Brown. For details on the history and policy choices, see the testimony of Joshua Rosner, an executive at Graham Fisher & Company. For a view that is more supportive of the banks' current structure, read this column by Gregory Meyer. I also recommend this definitive essay, "The Merchants of Wall Street: Banking, Commerce, and Commodities," by Saule Omarova.
In my assessment, there is no case for banks to own physical commodities, let alone crucial parts of the nation's infrastructure. This is an unacceptable concentration of power that has led to abuses - and will again.
Big banks are not even good at running financial services - remember the crisis of 2007-8 and the never-ending run of scandals since. Why would anyone think he can do a better job running any aspect of the commodity business?
As for diversifying their risks, if that is your goal for big banks, why not allow them to go into the production of cellphones, trash removal or operating hospitals? Seriously, once you let banks acquire assets in any sector, that Federal Reserve backstop will carry them a long way.
Who in private business wants to go head-to-head with JPMorgan Chase or Goldman Sachs in any nonfinancial sector? Unless you are seriously considering offering Fed support to Apple or U.P.S. or Wal-Mart or all commodity traders, get the banks out of the nonfinancial sector.
Camden R. Fine, head of the Independent Community Bankers of America, puts it well in a recent blog post:
The bottom line is that these huge financial firms have grown so large and become so interconnected in our economy that they are demonstrating classic signs of monopoly power: collusive and anticompetitive behavior that pushes prices up and reduces the social surplus provided by free markets. Not only are these institutions driving up consumer costs, they are doing so with the insurance of a taxpayer-funded backstop if their businesses ever sour. And make no mistake about it, the time will come again.
Don't rely on the banks to pick and choose which parts of the commodity business they would like to keep. As Bart Chilton of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission said this week, the Federal Reserve "can and should reverse" the policy that lets banks own and trade physical commodities.
"I don't want a bank owning an electric service, or cotton, corn or feedlots," he said. "I don't want banks owning warehouses, whether they have aluminum, gold, silver or anything else in them."

HEADLINE: Inequality and Opportunity

BYLINE: PHILLIP SWAGEL


HIGHLIGHT: Two proposals by President Obama, expanded early-childhood education and vocational training, could have promise if well aimed, but need to go beyond partisan talking points, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Phillip Swagel is a professor at the School of Public Policy at the University of Maryland and was assistant secretary for economic policy at the Treasury Department from 2006 to 2009. 
I agree with President Obama's assertion in his (sadly partisan and seemingly interminable) July 24 speech in Galesburg, Ill., that inequality is an important concern for the nation and that American economic policies should take this issue into account. This is especially the case for the "inequality of opportunity" that Mr. Obama says "undermines the very essence of America."
I am not convinced, however, that the president's proposals are well matched to the problem he describes. Indeed, Mr. Obama is better at describing the outcomes he seeks than at putting forward a coherent set of policies to reach those outcomes. But I think I see what he has in mind. 
Mr. Obama is looking at two horizons. The main determinant of inequality is what the Harvard economics professors Claudia Goldin and Lawrence Katz call a "race between technological change and educational attainment." Technology has increased the demand for skilled workers but educational attainment has not kept up, leading to rising payoffs for those at the top. Widening inequality reflects the fact that too many Americans do not have the skills needed for today's economy. But changing this takes time. So while he proposes universal preschool to benefit the future work force and new training programs delivered through community colleges for existing workers, Mr. Obama seeks to foster a stronger economy here and now, to drive higher earnings for people at all income levels rather than just those at the top.
The training proposal seems well targeted, with the potential to improve participants' earnings. The problem, however, is that the federal government already spends around $18 billion a year on training programs with modest evidence of success. The new program might be useful, but it would be better to first focus existing federal training dollars on programs with the best payoff (for a proposal, see a paper I wrote with Kenneth Troske, a professor at the University of Kentucky). 
There is reason to believe that appropriate interventions in early childhood such as quality preschool could improve lifetime outcomes for disadvantaged children: a good start in life has the potential to translate into more of the good later on such as higher earnings and less of the bad such as remedial education. The problem again is that it is difficult to know exactly which efforts to support. 
The administration pushes Head Start, but the evidence for the long-term impact of the program is decidedly mixed, with most evaluations not finding sustained improvements in participants' educational outcomes and earnings. Without better information on which programs succeed and can be scaled up, the president's preschool initiative has the feel of his earlier efforts to create green jobs, which five years later looks to have been a colossal waste. Even worse, the preschool proposal too readily turns into a political ploy to brand people who want to aim before spending billions of taxpayer dollars as being against poor children. This is a familiar tack for the president's team.
Still, once better developed, the preschool and training proposals have the possibility of eventually increasing earnings for those who have been left behind by technological change.
Over the shorter term, President Obama has in mind that a vibrant economy will lead to gains at all income levels. This was the case in the 1990s expansion, as the booming economy propelled across-the-board wage gains until the Internet bubble burst in 2000.
The president might say that all of his proposals would lift the economy. But the focus in his recent speeches has been on subsidies for manufacturing, government spending on infrastructure for transportation and information networks, and most recently money to lower interest rates for some homeowners and rehabilitate rundown homes. It is difficult to go from this grab bag of Obama policies that were proposed at different times for different reasons to an economy in which employers are competing for workers and bidding up wages. Establishing new government centers for manufacturing, for example, seems more like a political talking point than a proposal to make a meaningful impact on the overall economy or on inequality.
Like anyone who travels through the nation's airports or over its highways and bridges, I can see the point of increased infrastructure spending. The problem is that it is hard to take seriously an infrastructure proposal from a president who still seeks to burn taxpayer dollars on wasteful ventures such as the high-speed train to nowhere in California. A sustained program of government spending on infrastructure can make sense even in the face of the federal budget gap - after all, the Treasury has little trouble financing federal activities. But the quality of the expenditure matters.
Moreover, the positive economic impact of such focused new spending will be greatest if done in tandem with a credible program to address the fiscal imbalance over time. This combination would help the economy directly with (socially useful) government spending and indirectly as it reduces private sector uncertainty by making more clear the path of future deficits and thus the taxes that will be needed to cover those deficits. This is textbook economics to combine near-term stimulus and long-term adjustment. One can only hope that Mr. Obama will put forward a proposal for the needed fiscal changes before the end of his term rather than his approach of "whistling past the graveyard" and leaving a mess for his successor.
A cautionary note for Mr. Obama is that achieving a stronger economy might actually increase inequality rather than reduce it. This too is familiar from the 1990s. As calculated by the economics professors Emmanuel Saez and Thomas Piketty, real incomes grew on average by 31.5 percent from 1993 to 2000, but this involved 98.7 percent real income growth for the top 1 percent and 20.3 percent income growth for the other 99 percent. Some 45 percent of total growth accrued to the top 1 percent.
This outcome might actually be acceptable, even to President Obama. While inequality widened in the 1990s expansion as those at the top achieved larger gains than the rest, what appears to have mattered most to Americans is that the income gains were widespread. The strong economy meant opportunity for all, despite having the gains accrue disproportionately across society.
The difficulty is to find political common ground to move forward on both of the policy horizons identified by President Obama: for the recovery to strengthen considerably further while putting into place education and training programs that will get at the root causes of the slow income growth experienced by too many Americans. This task of finding common ground moves beyond the realm of economics, but one way to start would be for the president to work with Republicans to enact a bipartisan fiscal program that replaces the sequester with a credible adjustment over time.
The White House promises three more speeches on economic issues, focusing on education, health care and retirement security. These topics seem ripe for Mr. Obama to emphasize partisan differences. It would be more useful for the economy and for the president's supposed priority of expanding opportunity for him to take a different approach.

HEADLINE: More on Sequestration's Effects on the Private Sector

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: The industries most reliant on the military have lagged behind the rest of the private sector in employment trends, and certain states may be particularly vulnerable. 

 BODY:
Back in June I wrote about the private industries whose employment was most dependent on defense funds, and which were therefore most likely to suffer from sequestration. 
Over at the Oregon Office of Economic Analysis blog, Josh Lehner has taken this analysis further. He calculated the share of the work force in each state that is employed in five defense-sensitive industries. 
He found that Washington State is ranked first in terms of share of employment reliant on military-dependent industries, followed by New Mexico. (In sheer numbers of military-reliant employees, California and Washington State are the top two.) 
He also charted the changes in the private sector over all versus those in just the defense-sensitive industries:
Of course, these numbers alone will not capture the full extent of the employment consequences of the sequestration. 
First, there are layoffs and furloughs within the federal government itself, which has ripple effects on the spending done by those affected workers.
Second, the nondefense portion of Congress's budget cuts will also affect employment at private companies, although the effects are probably not concentrated in as few industries as the defense-side spending cuts are, and so will be harder to isolate in the data. For example, cutbacks in federal employee travel would affect the hotel industry, but a vast majority of hotel guests are not government employees, so the overall effect on that particular industry would be small.

HEADLINE: Top McConnell Aide 'Holding My Nose' to Help Rand Paul

BYLINE: JONATHAN MARTIN


HIGHLIGHT: Senator Mitch McConnell will retain his campaign manager, Jesse Benton, even though Mr. Benton acknowledged saying he was only working on the campaign to help a Rand Paul presidential bid. 

 BODY:
Senator Mitch McConnell's campaign manager on Thursday confirmed the authenticity of a recording from earlier this year in which he said, quite vividly, that he was reluctantly working for Mr. McConnell to help the presidential prospects of Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky.
"Between you and me, I'm sort of holding my nose for two years because what we're doing here is going to be a big benefit to Rand in '16, so that's my long vision," said Jesse Benton, who is leading Mr. McConnell's re-election bid, to Dennis Fusaro, a fellow Republican operative. Mr. Benton and Mr. Fusaro worked together on the presidential campaign of Mr. Paul's father, Representative Ron Paul, Republican of Texas. 
Mr. Fusaro apparently taped the January call, the contents of which were first reported on EconomicPolicyJournal.com.
Mr. Benton's criticism of Mr. McConnell to a fellow member of the Paul wing of the party underscores the uneasy relationship between establishment and insurgent Republicans. Mr. Benton is a Paul family loyalist: he is married to one of Ron Paul's granddaughters and was a top aide in the younger Mr. Paul's Senate race. His hiring by Mr. McConnell last year was seen as a signal that the Senate minority leader wanted to reach out to Tea Party Republicans. 
Mr. McConnell enjoys the support of the younger Mr. Paul, Kentucky's junior senator, but that was not enough to prevent a primary challenge from his right. Matt Bevin, a wealthy Louisville businessman, announced last month that he would run against Mr. McConnell in next year's Republican primary.
Mr. McConnell is also facing a threat from the left: Alison Lundergan Grimes, Kentucky's Democratic secretary of state, announced her candidacy in July. 
In a statement, Mr. Benton said, "It is truly sick that someone would record a private phone conversation I had out of kindness and use it to try to hurt me."
He continued, "I believe in Senator McConnell and am 100 percent committed to his re-election. Being selected to lead his campaign is one of the great honors of my life, and I look forward to victory in November of 2014."
Another top McConnell aide, Josh Holmes, said Mr. Benton would "absolutely" keep his job. He declined to say if Mr. Benton had apologized to Mr. McConnell.
That Mr. McConnell is retaining an aide who disparaged his candidacy underscores how badly he needs the help of both Mr. Paul and the right more broadly. Those close to Mr. McConnell suggest that Mr. Benton was simply trying to sympathize with a fellow Paul loyalist. But political aides caught criticizing their boss typically face termination, or at least a reprimand. 
Given Mr. Benton's close ties to the Paul family, however, this is a unique case. Mr. Benton has far more leverage than a mere campaign staffer. Facing dismal poll numbers at home and something close to an insurrection from both purists and pragmatists in the Senate, Mr. McConnell has seemingly made the calculation that he can't risk angering his base by dismissing Mr. Benton. 
The phone call itself is connected to an episode from the elder Mr. Paul's 2012 presidential campaign. An Iowa state senator, Kent Sorenson, has been accused of taking money to switch his allegiance to Mr. Paul from Representative Michele Bachmann, Republican of Minnesota.

HEADLINE: Obama Urges Greece to Grow Its Economy

BYLINE: MICHAEL D. SHEAR


HIGHLIGHT: In a meeting in the Oval Office on Thursday, President Obama told Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, that policies focused only on spending reductions would not help Greece return to economic prosperity. 

 BODY:
WASHINGTON - President Obama on Thursday urged Greece to find ways to grow its economy even as it continues to cut spending in an effort to recover from a debt-driven economic crisis. 
In a meeting in the Oval Office, Mr. Obama told Antonis Samaras, the Greek prime minister, that policies focused only on spending reductions would not help Greece return to economic prosperity.
"In dealing with the challenges that Greece faces, we cannot simply look to austerity," Mr. Obama said in brief remarks to reporters after the two leaders met. "It's important that we have a plan for fiscal consolidation to manage the debt, but it's also important that growth and jobs are a focus."
Mr. Samaras echoed Mr. Obama's concerns, noting that youth unemployment in his country had reached 60 percent. He said that Greece must reach for policies that encourage "growth and the creation of new jobs."
"We've gone through thick and thin," Mr. Samaras said. "The sacrifices made by the Greek people are huge, but they're not going to be in vain."
Mr. Obama waved aside questions from reporters on other topics, but announced that he planned to hold a news conference on Friday before leaving Washington the next day for a weeklong vacation on Martha's Vineyard.
The news conference will give the president an opportunity to weigh in on a number of issues, including the cancellation of his summit with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, further revelations about government monitoring of e-mails, and the ongoing terror threat that has closed embassies around the world.
Mr. Obama has given several interviews in recent weeks and sometimes makes statements on particular topics, as when he discussed race after the verdict in the killing of Trayvon Martin, an unarmed black teenager in Florida. But his last news conference was in April.

HEADLINE: Paid Notice: Deaths WILLIAMS, EUGENE F.

 BODY:
WILLIAMS--Eugene F.,Jr., former CEO and chairman of St. Louis Union Trust Company and a St. Louis civic leader, passed away at his house in East Hampton, N.Y., on August 7, 2013 at age 90. Mr. Williams is survived by his loving wife of 66 years, Evelyn Neidringhaus Williams. 
He was the devoted father of Rebecca (Loic) deKertanguy, of New York; Eugene III (Jacqueline) Williams, of New York; John (Lacey) Williams, of Los Angeles, CA.; Evelyn (John) McNiff, of Plymouth Meeting, PA; and Edward (Lisa) Williams, of Ross CA; his fifteen grandchildren and three great-grandchildren. He also leaves his sisters, Georgie (Henry) Lewis, of Essex, CT and Marie (Adalbert) von Gontard, of Greenwich, CT; six nephews and nieces; and many friends. Mr. Williams was born in St. Louis, the son of Eugene F. Williams, a prominent banker, and Marie Wight Williams. He attended St. Louis Country Day School and went on to Phillips Academy in Andover, MA and then Yale University. He interrupted his education to join the Army Air Corps, where he trained as a fighter pilot. When the war ended, he returned to Yale, graduating in 1947. Mr. Williams began his 40-year career with St. Louis Union Trust Company in 1947 as an investment officer and subsequently became President, CEO and Chairman of the Board serving in the latter role until his retirement in 1988. He served on the boards of the Olin Corporation, American Airlines, Bristol-Myers Squibb, as well as Emerson Electric, Boatmen's Trust Company, and the John M. Olin Foundation. He assumed the leadership of NILO Plantation in Albany, GA in 1982. He served as chairman of the board of his family's cattle ranch in Texas and Oklahoma, Pitchfork Land and Cattle Company. In 2002, he was awarded the highest honor from the National Ranching Heritage Association. Mr. Williams' civic contributions include serving as Board Chair of St. Lukes Hospital, Blue Cross Blue Shield, St. Louis Country Day School, and St. Louis Municipal Opera (Muny). He served on the board of St. Louis University. He was actively involved in the founding of Washington University's John M. Olin School of Business. His philanthropy included leadership support of the United Way, the St. Louis Art Museum, the St. Louis Symphony, and the Today and Tomorrow Educational Foundation, as well as establishing scholarship funds at St. Louis University and St. Luke's Hospital. In addition, he endowed a chair at the Yale University School of Management to teach market economics. He was a beloved husband, father and friend and will be remembered for his warmth, compassion and humility. There will be a memorial service in St. Louis in late September. In lieu of flowers, the family suggests memorial contributions be made to the Today and Tomorrow Educational Foundation, St. Louis, MO.

American Folk Art Museum: 'Bill Traylor: Drawings From the Collections of the High Museum of Art and the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts' and 'Traylor in Motion: Wonders From New York Collections' (through Sept. 22) The achievement of this great American artist -- a former slave and sharecropper -- unfolds in exceptional side-by-side exhibitions. The hundreds of drawings Traylor made starting in 1939, at 85, while living on the streets of Montgomery, Ala., reveal a natural stylist and a born storyteller who pushed stories of everyday life toward abstraction with no loss of vivacity. At once modern and archaic, Traylor's indelible vision is rich both in its formal invention and its witnessing of the South before the civil rights movement. American Folk Art Museum, 2 Lincoln Square, Columbus Avenue at 66th Street, (212) 595-9533, folkartmuseum.org. (Roberta Smith) 
&#x2605; Bronx Museum of the Arts: 'State of Mind: New California Art Circa 1970' (through Sept. 8 ) California in the 1960s and '70s was one of the weirder places on the planet, home to radical strains of both right- and left-wing politics, a hub of the national defense industry and a breeding ground for alternative cultures from Beat to hippie. It also produced its own strain of Conceptualism, the international art style that valued ideas and actions over things. This Bronx Museum show gives a vivid sense of the West Coast version, with its gawky rawness, sense of moral purpose, humor, and dovetailing of braininess and zaniness. 1040 Grand Concourse, at 165th Street, Morrisania, the Bronx, (718) 681-6000, bronxmuseum.org. (Holland Cotter)
Brooklyn Museum: 'The Bruce High Quality Foundation: Ode to Joy, 2001-2013' (through Sept. 22) The New York collective of anonymous young artists known as the Bruce High Quality Foundation has generated much buzz and some puzzlement since emerging in 2004. This messy retrospective answers few questions, but brings enough together for provisional assessment. Mostly there are not very provocative parodies of works by famous artists like Picasso and Warhol. The group's best efforts are videos, including a short zombie movie called ''Isle of the Dead'' that exudes an affecting, generational pathos. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Ken Johnson)
Brooklyn Museum: 'Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt' (through Dec. 2014) If your dream of heaven is eternity spent with the pets you love, ''Divine Felines: Cats of Ancient Egypt'' is a show for you. All of its 30 objects, sifted from the museum's renowned Egyptian collection, are of cats, big and little, feral and tame, celestial and not. Whether cast in bronze or carved in stone, their forms and personalities were meant to outlast time, and so they have. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Brooklyn Museum: 'Gravity and Grace: Monumental Works by El Anatsui' (through Aug. 18) Born in Ghana and long a resident of Nigeria, where he maintains a productive studio, El Anatsui has for the past decade been creating spectacularly large, fabriclike sculpture from countless numbers of liquor-bottle caps linked together with twists of copper. The work weaves together ideas about colonialism, politics and economics, and it is absolutely gorgeous. The Brooklyn show, which originated at the Akron Art Museum in Ohio, also includes a number of the artist's earlier and now-overlooked carved wood pieces, which are well worth studying. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; The Cloisters: 'Search for the Unicorn: An Exhibition in Honor of The Cloisters' 75th Anniversary' (through Aug. 18) The lonely subject of the ''Unicorn Tapestries'' is united with others of its species in ''Search for the Unicorn,'' honoring the 75th anniversary of the Cloisters. Drawn from the Met's holdings and from other public and private collections, it includes manuscripts, paintings, decorative objects and ''unicorn horns'' (actually the tapered, spiral-patterned tusks of the narwhal). The show is a gateway to various fantasy worlds, some of them beyond the scope of medieval Western Europe; a page from the ''Shahnama,'' the Persian ''Book of Kings,'' shows the monarch Iskandar (otherwise known as Alexander the Great) fighting off the one-horned, equine Monster of Habash. 99 Margaret Corbin Drive, Fort Tryon Park, Washington Heights, (212) 923-3700, metmuseum.org. (Karen Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Guggenheim Museum: 'James Turrell' (through Sept. 25) At once ravishing and hokey, ''Aten Reign,'' the show's centerpiece, turns the museum's famed rotunda into the bliss-out environmental art hit of the summer: an immense, elliptical, nearly hallucinatory play of light and color achieved with elaborate scrims and computerized lighting that might oxymoronically be called a meditative spectacle. Four other installation works from the 1960s and '70s outline the single-minded trajectory of this leading proponent of the Light and Space movement and also provide a simpler, more direct, more mindful experience of, in his words, ''seeing yourself see.'' 1071 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 423-3500, guggenheim.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; International Center of Photography: 'A Different Kind of Order: The ICP Triennial' (through Sept. 22) The fourth, and best, edition of the International Center of Photography's triennial turns out to be that extremely rare thing in New York City these days, an exhibition of contemporary art for adults. The up-to-the-minute emphasis is on the continuing and enveloping impact of digital technology on photography. The results, as seen here, couldn't be more varied and gripping in content. This is a show that's in touch with the big, live, real world out there beyond Frieze New York. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212) 857-0000, icp.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Jewish Museum: 'Jack Goldstein x 10,000' (through Sept. 29) The first American museum retrospective of this brilliant but elusive artist, organized by the Orange County Museum of Art, is both a celebration and a cautionary tale. It revels in Goldstein's posthumous influence as it reveals the tragic disconnect of his life and his art, the desire to disappear complicated by an intense careerist drive. This exhibition offers (in addition to paintings, sculptures and Goldstein's signature films of the late 1970s) a rare look at the early, performance-based films: works like ''Milk,'' in which the persistent banging of a fist on a table finally topples a glass, or ''Spotlight,'' in which a beam chases the artist around an empty room. 1109 Fifth Avenue, at 92nd Street, (212) 423-3200, thejewishmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'African Art, New York, and the Avant-Garde' (through Sept. 2) Timed to the centennial of the Armory Show of 1913, this exhibition tells the story of African art's debut in cutting-edge New York museums and galleries with exceptional candor. It makes clear that early-20th-century Americans received Modern art and African art as a single import, derived from French and Belgian colonies, distilled in Paris and presented on these shores by a few tastemaking dealers and collectors. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Civil War and American Art' (through Sept. 2) If you've seen ''Photography and the American Civil War'' at the Met, you might suppose that viewing another exhibition about the war would be redundant. It's not. With outstanding works by Frederic Edwin Church, Sanford Robinson Gifford and Winslow Homer, this gripping show sheds expansive light on the nation's experience of its own fratricidal conflict. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Photography and the American Civil War' (through Sept. 2) As intellectually fascinating as it is emotionally wrenching, this exhibition is sure to be remembered as one of the great museum photography shows ever. Its more than 200 photographs include expansive images of battlefields and war-ruined towns; wallet-size portraits of soldiers; preciously framed daguerreotypes; political campaign buttons; a doctor's documents of horrifically wounded soldiers; portraits of loved ones in lockets; and a series depicting the hanging of five co-conspirators in the assassination of President Abraham Lincoln by the photographer Alexander Gardner. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Ken Price: A Retrospective' (through Sept. 22) Tableware? Toys? Genetic accidents? Objets d'art? The ceramic sculptures of Ken Price suggest all these possibilities. To the market's old, divide-and-label query ''Is this art or craft?,'' Price offered one, finessing answer: ''Yes.'' And right he was. You see the rightness instantly in the Met retrospective, which is one of those ideal shows: perfect size, great design (by Frank Gehry), pretty near faultless art. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. Ideal, too, in a plainer way, is a concurrent survey of the artist's works on paper, ''Ken Price: Slow and Steady Wins the Race,'' running through Aug. 18 at the Drawing Center, 35 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212) 219-2166, drawingcenter.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'The Roof Garden Commission: Imran Qureshi' (through Nov. 3) Visitors to the Met's rooftop will discover something shocking: the stone terrace is splattered with paint the color of dried blood so that it resembles the scene of some terrible crime. Looking closer at the areas of spillage, viewers will find they have been delicately altered. With deft white and red brush strokes, the Pakistani artist Imran Qureshi has worked into the raw paint a pattern suggestive of leafy shrubbery and flower petals, turning the whole into a politically fraught, allegorical mix symbolizing dualities of life and death and hope and despair. (212) 535-7710, metmuseum.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; MoMA PS1: 'Expo 1: New York' (through Sept. 2) A sprawling, multisite extravaganza including a multitude of installations, shows-within-shows and events, ''Expo 1: New York'' offers few answers but raises many provocative questions about the current and future state of our planet's unsettled human and natural ecology. Attractions at PS1 range from a beautiful show of pictures by the beloved nature photographer Ansel Adams to a refrigerated room containing chunks from an Icelandic glacier by Olafur Eliasson. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, (718) 784-2084, ps1.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Illuminating Faith: The Eucharist in Medieval Life and Art' (through Sept. 15) Spring-into-summer was the season for open-air processions in medieval Europe. The one staged annually for the feast of Corpus Christi, celebrating the bodily presence of Jesus Christ in the bread and wine of the Mass, was among the most ardent, elaborate and politically loaded of all. And it retains all those qualities in this ravishing, superbly documented survey of sacramental imagery, mostly in the form of exquisitely painted books. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
Morgan Library & Museum: 'Old Masters, Newly Acquired' (through Oct. 6) This celebration of new acquisitions includes about a hundred pre-1900 drawings, all donated, bequeathed or purchased from 2009 to 2012. Dispensing with themes and chronology, the show groups works by patron: Astor, von Bülow and so on. The late-19th-century selections are especially strong; here are not one but two early Degas self-portraits in black chalk; prismatic watercolors by Cézanne and Renoir; a vibrant Gauguin pastel of two Breton girls; and a Seurat horse and landscape in his mossy shadings of conté. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street; (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Morgan Library & Museum: 'Subliming Vessel: The Drawings of Matthew Barney' (through Sept. 8) With its Gospels and reliquaries, the Morgan Library is at the right place for the first survey of graphic work by the most medievalizing of American contemporary artists. Encased in thick, pale, plastic frames, Mr. Barney's drawings of the past two decades have the look of precious pages from sacred books displayed on iPads. His images, with their emphasis on redemption through fleshly mortification, suggest sources in heroic epics and penitential religion, filtered through Sade and extreme sports. A display of collagelike storyboards for his films confirms the occult glamour of the personal cosmology he has developed, which feels as artificial and addictive as a video game. 225 Madison Avenue, at 36th Street, (212) 685-0008, themorgan.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; El Museo del Barrio: 'La Bienal 2013: Here Is Where We Jump' (through Jan. 4) Much of the work by the 37 artists in the seventh edition of El Museo's Bienal is budget-conscious in its materials and modest in size, scaled to small studios. Maybe exactly because of such restrictions, the show is thoughtful and personal, uneven in parts, solid as a whole. It's also a product of that old-fashioned thing, the ethnically specific museum. Even with definitions of ethnicity stretched all kinds of ways -- what does ''Latino'' really mean anymore, anyway? -- the issue of identity remains at the core of such institutions and informs much of the work in this show. 1230 Fifth Avenue, at 104th Street, East Harlem, (212) 831-7272, elmuseo.org. (Cotter)
&#x2605; Museum of Arts and Design: 'Against the Grain: Wood in Contemporary Art, Craft and Design' (through Sept. 15) This sixth show in the museum's Materials and Process series is a big improvement on its predecessors, mostly because it feels more artist- and designer-driven. Representing the Chelsea gallery contingent are Alison Elizabeth Taylor, with marquetry installations; Phoebe Washburn and Leonardo Drew, with scrap-wood sculptures; and Roy McMakin, with slyly repurposed found furniture. From the design-fair circuit come functional works like Mark Moskovitz's ''Facecord,'' a sideboard that looks like a stack of firewood when the drawers are closed, and Maarten Baas's knife block in the shape of a head (which seems destined for the MoMA design store). 2 Columbus Circle, (212) 299-7777, madmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Ellsworth Kelly: Chatham Series' (through Sept. 8) Together again for the first time in 40 years, the 14 two-panel Chatham paintings from 1971 offer giddy instruction in the weights, measures and balances of strong color -- red, blue, green, yellow, black and white. The works -- abutting rectangles that form an inverted L -- seem to expand or contract as you move around the gallery. An adjoining display of 40 small collages from 1951 shows Mr. Kelly laying out some of the stringent abstract vocabulary that he has mined ever since. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Museum of Modern Art: 'Walker Evans: American Photographs' (through Jan. 26) In 1938, the Museum of Modern Art mounted its first one-person photography exhibition: ''American Photographs,'' by Walker Evans. This gripping, 75th-anniversary reprisal of that show presents more than 50 images from that body of work. It is accompanied by a reissue of the original catalog, which includes a wonderfully insightful essay by Evans's friend and supporter Lincoln Kirstein. Together, the show and the book reverberate now in a time when the idea of America is subject to debates as fractious and far-reaching as at any time since the Civil War. (212) 708-9400, moma.org. (Johnson)
National Academy Museum: 'Jeffrey Gibson: Said the Pigeon to the Squirrel' (through Sept. 8) The work of Mr. Gibson, an abstract painter who often works on animal hides in homage to his American Indian heritage (he is a member of the Mississippi Band of Choctaw Indians and is half Cherokee), embodies two sweeping trends in contemporary art: feverishly bright geometric abstraction and the creative reuse of found objects. The animal hides are stretched over antique mirrors and ironing boards, and even wrapped around fluorescent light tubes in a nod to Dan Flavin. His works have plenty of visual pizazz but can be weak conceptually; the better ones evoke performance of various kinds, from raves to traditional American Indian dances. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212) 369-4880, nationalacademy.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Neue Galerie: 'Koloman Moser: Designing Modern Vienna 1897-1907' (through Sept. 2) Along with his better-known colleague, Josef Hoffmann, Moser was a founder of the Wiener Werkstätte, the consortium of designers and artisans that produced some of the 20th century's most beautiful objects. Focusing on Moser's most productive years, this gorgeous exhibition presents more than 200 exquisitely elegant works, including books, glassware, metal pieces, ceramics, jewelry and furniture. 1048 Fifth Avenue at 86th Street, (212) 628-6200, neuegalerie.org. (Johnson)
New Museum: 'Ellen Gallagher: Don't Axe Me' (through Sept. 15) Ellen Gallagher emerged in the early 1990s with memorable paintings that yoked Minimalism to minstrelsy by scattering tiny caricatures of eyes and mouths across creamy expanses of paper and canvas. More recently she has branched out from painting and collage to film, and from pop-culture imagery to literary and science-fiction references. For ''Osedax'' (2010), made with her partner, Edgar Cleijne, visitors crouch to enter a black-box theater and settle in to view two simultaneous projections: one of glass slides hand-painted with watery abstractions, the other a 16-millimeter film incorporating footage of a shipwreck off Rhode Island. It's the most interesting part of a piecemeal, sometimes arbitrary-feeling show that coincides with a larger retrospective at Tate Modern. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
New Museum: 'Llyn Foulkes' (through Sept. 1) Although poorly organized, this exhibition devoted to a great American original contains several one-of-a-kind masterpieces. Displayed in a small, dark corner room where it glows uncannily, partly by virtue of real lights built into it, ''Pop'' (1985-1991) is a 10-foot-wide marvel of comic magic realism and meticulous craftsmanship. In a homey, wood-paneled living room, the main character, a portrait of the middle-aged artist, sits in a paisley-patterned armchair, staring with bugged-out eyes, evidently driven to catatonic paralysis by what he's seeing on the television. 235 Bowery, at Prince Street, Lower East Side, (212) 219-1222, newmuseum.org. (Johnson)
New-York Historical Society: 'Swing Time: Reginald Marsh and Thirties New York' (through Sept. 1) A Social Realist with satiric leanings, Marsh (1898-1954) painted the seamy side of life in New York during the Great Depression. Using egg tempera with a skittery touch, he made flickering, cartoonish images in a palette ranging from sooty to garishly bright; he painted burlesque performers, people on busy sidewalks and crowded subway stations, Coney Island amusement seekers and the homeless and destitute. His voyeuristic eye for fiercely self-assertive, full-figured young women adds an intriguing, creepy psychology. 170 Central Park West, at 77th Street, (212) 873-3400, nyhistory.org. (Johnson)
Rubin Museum of Art: 'Fiercely Modern: Art of the Naga Warrior' (through Sept. 16) The Naga were a diverse collection of peoples speaking similar languages and residing in a mountainous area in northeastern India. Headhunting was one of their most prized pursuits until they were almost entirely Christianized in the early 20th century. They also created extraordinarily beautiful textiles, jewelry and ceremonial objects, as this intriguing, introductory show demonstrates. 150 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 620-5000, rmanyc.org. (Johnson)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Hopper Drawing' (through Oct. 6) With more than 200 drawings, two dozen sketchbook pages and an essential bonus of 21 paintings, this landmark exhibition takes us behind the curtain of stillness that makes Hopper's art so riveting to reveal as never before how he used preparatory studies to synthesize reality, memory and imagination. Some of his greatest paintings -- ''New York Movie,'' ''Nighthawks'' -- and other gems are here. An overview indicates how the young Hopper shaped and toughened his versatile gifts into a singular vision. (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
&#x2605; Whitney Museum of American Art: 'Robert Irwin: Scrim Veil -- Black Rectangle -- Natural Light' (through Sept. 1) Prior to handing its Breuer building over to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Whitney installs one of the masterpieces of Light and Space, if not all Minimalism: an eye-filling yet barely-there low-tech mirage from 1977 that is spectacular in size, but not in its means. Overseen by the chief curator Donna Salvo, it uses a bit of black paint and some polyester scrim anchored by a gallery-long black aluminum beam; it illuminates the very act of perception by simply riffing on the architecture. 945 Madison Avenue at 75th Street, (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Smith)
Whitney Museum of American Art: 'I, YOU, WE' (through Sept. 1) The Whitney's latest collection show (and the last one for the Breuer building before the museum decamps to the meatpacking district) finds artists reacting to AIDS, Reagan-era social policies, urban blight and gentrification, and a stock market boom and bust. Everything here dates from the 1980s and early '90s, otherwise known as the era of identity politics. Included are numerous self-portraits, a room of AIDS-related artworks, and Nan Goldin's 45-minute slide installation ''The Ballad of Sexual Dependency.'' (212) 570-3600, whitney.org. (Rosenberg)
Galleries: Uptown
Luis Molina-Pantin: 'Modus Operandi' (through Aug. 17) Luis Molina-Pantin's photographs of Disneyesque drug-baron mansions in Colombia are stand-outs in the International Center of Photography's terrific 2013 triennial. In a solo show at Henrique Faria Fine Art we are given a larger context for an artist, based in Caracas, Venezuela, who specializes in images that simultaneously project and undercut illusions of confident social and political power. 35 East 67th Street, Manhattan, (212) 517-4609, henriquefaria.com. (Cotter)
Galleries: Chelsea
'Reinventing Abstraction: New York Painting in the 1980s' (through Aug. 30) This worthy show reconsiders 15 painters who did not fit into fashionable categories in the 1980s. It includes humorously updated Surrealism by Carroll Dunham and Elizabeth Murray; canny play with Modernist devices by Thomas Nozkowski, Jonathan Lasker, Mary Heilmann and David Reed; botanical imagery by Bill Jensen and Terry Winters; gesture and process by Louise Fishman and Pat Steir; abstracted landscapes by Joan Snyder and Stanley Whitney; and enigmatic symbolism by Gary Stephan, Jack Whitten and Stephen Mueller. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, (212) 242-7727, cheimread.com. (Johnson)
Hank Willis Thomas (through Aug. 23) This show includes some recent sculptures and photographic pieces by an artist who has made the complexities of race and the pathologies of racism his subject. These themes are directly addressed in the exhibition's major piece, the five-channel video installation ''Question Bridge: Black Males,'' conceived by the artist Chris Johnson, and created in its present form by him, Mr. Thomas, Bayeté Ross Smith and Kamal Sinclair. Consisting of interviews with some 150 African-American men, the video grapples, optimistically and pessimistically, with questions about why racism in America exists, and how, and if, it can be changed.

Galleries: Other
&#x2605; Simon Dinnerstein: 'The Fulbright Triptych' (ongoing) This little-known masterpiece of 1970s realism was begun by the young Simon Dinnerstein during a Fulbright fellowship in Germany in 1971 and completed in his hometown, Brooklyn, three years later. Incorporating carefully rendered art postcards, children's drawings and personal memorabilia; a formidable worktable laid out with printmaking tools and outdoor views; and the artist and his family, it synthesizes portrait, still life, interior and landscape and rummages through visual culture while sampling a dazzling range of textures and representational styles. It should be seen by anyone interested in the history of recent art and its oversights. German Consulate General, 871 United Nations Plaza, First Avenue, at 49th Street, (212) 610-9700, germany.info/nyevents. (Smith)
'Lat. 41° 7' N., Long. 72° 19' W' (through Sept. 2) The annual campground-casual show organized by the independent curator Bob Nickas in the Bridgehampton summer home of Jose Martos, an art dealer, and Servane Mary, an artist, was always an odd fit for the fussy, privet-hedged Hamptons. Fortunately, this seasonal event (now in its fourth year) has found a more suitable home on the North Fork, in East Marion, where the couple bought a late-19th-century Victorian on 10 acres abutting the idyllic Dam Pond Maritime Reserve. The show includes many outdoor projects that call attention to the beauty of the landscape. Aaron Suggs's ''Untitled (Transparent Dinghy),'' an almost invisible vessel made of clear acrylic, floats on the pond; nearby, G. William Webb's thin steel hoop frames the water view. Martos Gallery, 12395 Main Road, East Marion, N.Y., (212) 560-0670, martosgallery.com. (Rosenberg)
Public Art
&#x2605; Thomas Hirschhorn: 'Gramsci Monument' (through Sept. 15) With the paid help of local residents, Mr. Hirschhorn has built a scruffy, ramshackle complex out of plywood, two-by-fours, blue tarps, brown tape and plexiglass on the grass outside the Forest Houses apartment complex. Resembling a home for postapocalyptic survivors, it has a library stocked with books of political and social theory; a radio station; a space for producing a daily newspaper; a snack bar; a computer room; and a stage for musical and theatrical performances. Improbably, it is all dedicated to the Italian communist and Marxist philosopher Antonio Gramsci. On the grounds of Forest Houses, Tinton Avenue between 163rd and 165th Streets, Morissania, Bronx; gramsci-monument.com. (Johnson)
Out of Town
&#x2605; 'Winslow Homer: Making Art, Making History' (through Sept. 8) Winslow Homer (1836-1910) was America's first great post-God landscape painter. Before the Civil War, successful artists like Frederic Church and Asher B. Durand made pictures of unpopulated New World vistas bathed in transcendental light. In Homer's early landscapes, done when the barbarous war was over, ordinary people -- chic young ladies, sportsmen-hunters and farm kids -- are center stage. Later, the ocean, dark and unfathomable, is his subject. The Clark is especially interesting for its wealth of Homer's journalistic prints. And for a taste of transcendentalism living on, see a blissful selection of landscapes by George Inness (1825-94) in an adjoining gallery. Sterling and Francine Clark Art Institute, 225 South Street, Williamstown, Mass., (413) 458-2303, clarkart.edu. (Cotter)
Thomas Houseago: 'As I Went Out One Morning' (through Nov. 11) Mr. Houseago's obstreperous, monumental sculptures of exaggeratedly masculine figures rendered in early Modernist styles are too often weighed down by art historical reverence, but the best ones are funny and outlandish. At 15 ½ feet, ''Striding Figure II (Ghost)'' is a broad-shouldered, barrel-chested, block-headed colossus made of bronze and steel. It resembles a cinematic monster emerging from a junkyard where some extraterrestrial energy brought it to life. Storm King Art Center, 1 Museum Road, New Windsor, N.Y., (845) 534-3115, stormking.org. (Johnson)
Helen Marten: 'No Borders in a Wok that Can't Be Crossed' (through Sept. 22) The American solo debut of an immoderately gifted young British artist is light, airy and seductive, like rococo postmodernism, and oh-so smart. Sleekly beautiful sculptural arrangements flit among different mediums, segue seamlessly from analog to digital and evoke a world of suave design rife with dazzling new materials. This perfection is thankfully disturbed by well-used found objects and even trash. The totality exposes unexplored territory along the well-worn path between ready-made and remade ready-made. Center for Curatorial Studies at Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Smith)
'Angels, Demons, and Savages: Pollock, Ossorio, Dubuffet' (through Oct. 27) This all-too-rare meeting of Ab-Ex and Art Brut sweeps away myths surrounding both movements and their central figures, Jackson Pollock and Jean Dubuffet, who never met but interacted through the artist and collector Alfonso Ossorio. It pivots around Ossorio (1916-90), a go-between who is fascinating in his own right. His frantic, radiant, spontaneous works on paper -- some made on pieces of torn Tiffany stationery, or whatever was at hand -- are one of the show's revelations. In them, angels, heads of Christ and other Christian icons give off orange and magenta auras or vibrations. Parrish Art Museum, 279 Montauk Highway, Water Mill, N.Y., (631) 283-2118, parrishart.org. (Rosenberg)
Haim Steinbach: 'Once Again The World Is Flat' (through Dec. 20) This overdue 40-year survey celebrates a sculptor who put his own spin on the Duchampian ready-made, and anticipated the current interest in unattached assemblage by displaying domestic items and toys, along with the odd artifact, on jutting Formica-clad shelves. The 80-work show includes many unfamiliar early works and is inserted into a selection of works from the museum's collection, some of which have been absorbed into new Steinbachian arrangements. Hessel Museum of Art at the Center for Curatorial Studies, Bard College, Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y., (845) 758-7598, bard.edu/ccs. (Smith)
Last Chance
Brooklyn Museum: 'LaToya Ruby Frazier: A Haunted Capital' (closes on Sunday) This preternaturally mature body of work by a 31-year-old photographer connects bedrooms and streetscapes, the suffering of loved ones and the afflictions of a ''distressed municipality'' (the state's official term for Ms. Frazier's hometown, Braddock, Pa.). Simultaneously introspective and extroverted, it's composed of arresting black-and-white photographs that sometimes look like studio portraits or social documentaries but aren't fully at home in either category. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, Brooklyn, (718) 638-5000, brooklynmuseum.org. (Rosenberg)
&#x2605; Francis Cape: 'Utopian Benches' (closes on Friday) An artist long preoccupied with the physical and the spiritual aspects of craft and design offers a fascinating excursion into faith-based furniture: 17 meticulous poplar copies of benches built and used in communal, mostly religious societies in North America from the 18th century to the present. Such ''shared seating'' encouraged both community and equality. Here it also forms an illuminating study of joinery, scale, detailing, proportion and comfort -- comprehended almost as much by sitting as by looking. Murray Guy, 453 West 17th Street, Chelsea, (212) 463-7372, murrayguy.com. (Smith)
Jimmy DeSana: 'Party Picks' (closes next Friday) Mr. DeSana's funny and mysteriously erotic photographs from the 1970s and '80s are sampled here. In an image luridly illuminated by red and green lights, a naked man bends over with his feet and hands inserted into red cones. The figure looks like a quadruped in a dream David Lynch might have. ''Sweatshirt'' depicts two pantless men wearing motorcycle helmets with their bodies joined back to back by a single, stretchy red shirt. It appears as if they are performing a goofy gymnastic exercise. Salon 94 Bowery, 243 Bowery, at Stanton Street, Lower East Side, (212) 979-0001, salon94.com. (Ken Johnson)
'Ecce Homo: Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt and the Art of Rebellion' (closes on Friday) Thomas Lanigan-Schmidt's 2012 career retrospective at MoMA PS1 was a plenitudinous affair, and now, happily, there's more of him at Pavel Zoubok, along with work by several younger gay artists he has, directly or indirectly, influenced, including Nayland Blake, Arch Connelly (1950-93), Tony Feher, Oliver Herring, Christian Holstad, Greer Lankton (1958-96), Hunter Reynolds and Christopher Tanner. Pavel Zoubok Gallery, 531 West 26th Street, Chelsea, (212) 675-7490, pavelzoubok.com. (Cotter)
Martín Gutierrez: 'Martin(e)' (closes next Friday) Just a year out of Rhode Island School of Design with a bachelor of fine arts in printmaking, Martín Gutierrez is having a strong first New York show, and printmaking has nothing to do with it, though photography, video, performance, fashion, music do. In a series of photographs, he acts the roles of female sex dolls that are dressed and posed to fulfill specific fantasies. In three short videos he stars as Martine who, after introducing herself with the mantralike statement ''There's something to be said for those who get what they want,'' wanders an empty-looking city in search of fulfillment.

'Made in Space' (closes on Friday) The second part of this intergenerational, multiple-medium survey of mostly recent art made in and around Los Angeles includes nearly all the artists represented in the first, at Gavin Brown's Enterprise downtown, but overall is not as lively. It still has its moments, among them Laeh Glenn's small schematic paintings, Patrick Jackson's ceramic sculptures and John Seal's exuberant embrace of both these mediums at once. Venus Over Manhattan, 980 Madison Avenue at 76th Street, (212) 980-0700, venusovermanhattan.com. (Smith)
'Made in Space' (closes on Saturday) A survey of art made in and around Los Angeles, the most spacious of major American art scenes, sprawls through this gallery and Venus Over Manhattan on the Upper East Side. Organized by the painter Laura Owens and Peter Harkawik, a sort-of painter, it has an ecumenical breadth in terms of mediums, styles and generations. But it is youth that carries the day. Make note of the new names because you may be hearing them again. Gavin Brown's Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, West Village, (212) 627-5258, gavinbrown.biz. (Smith)
Beverly McIver (closes on Friday) Beverly McIver's self-portraiture, her signature mode, is sometimes disarming, other times wearyingly theatrical. In ''Pre-Breast Surgery,'' her most powerful painting, she sits up in a hospital bed naked to the waist, looking down at her large, pendulous breasts, which bear markings for an impending operation. In two more cheerful works, both called ''My New Breasts,'' she smilingly displays her reduced bosom. Betty Cuningham, 541 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212) 242-2772, bettycuninghamgallery.com. (Johnson)
Metropolitan Museum of Art: 'Punk: Chaos to Couture' (closes on Wednesday) This entertaining exhibition proves that high fashion rarely looks quite as frivolous and cluelessly 1 percent-ish as when it upgrades aspects of the obstreperous punk sartorial mode, adding gold-plated safety pins, careful rips and holes, and a feigned DIY look that can involve materials like garbage bags or cellophane. Cleverness abounds. A few designers absorb and transform punk attributes, but most garments simplistically scream punk.

There is a comical asymmetry between his efforts and theirs, but also something mysterious, as if his were made for a voodoo dollhouse.

Eliot Porter (closes next Friday) Trained in medicine, the photographer Eliot Porter (1901-90) brought a quiet naturalism to the dye-transfer print, a technique more closely associated with in-your-face colorists like William Eggleston. His muted shots, which have been published in photography books alongside Thoreau's writings, seem to flatten out the landscape without reducing its meditative complexity. (In that, they have much in common with the paintings of his brother, Fairfield Porter). This exhibition of vintage prints, organized by Jack Macrae and Kristoffer Haynes, includes some lush, accomplished and wonderfully unobtrusive images of nesting birds and unruly thickets of foliage.

'Salvaging the Past: Georges Hoentschel and French Decorative Arts From the Metropolitan Museum of Art' (closes on Sunday) This sometimes arcane but highly effective assemblage of rare furnishings, artifacts and a smattering of art and printed matter resurrects a once-renowned French interior designer whose collections -- and displays -- of 18th-century French decorative material and medieval art were purchased en bloc by J.P. Morgan and given to the Met. They formed the nuclei of the museum's holdings in these areas, helped shape its departmental structure and influenced the arrangement of its galleries.

It makes clear that contemporary artists like Christian Marclay, Jon Kessler, Cory Arcangel, Ryan Trecartin and Haroon Mirza owe a great deal to Mr. Paik's tweaked TV sets and frenetic, technically innovative videos.

HEADLINE: Woes of Detroit Hurt Borrowing By Its Neighbors

BYLINE: By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH

 BODY:
The Detroit Effect has rippled all the way to Wall Street.
Two weeks after Detroit declared bankruptcy, cities, counties and other local governments in Michigan are getting a cold shoulder in the municipal bond market.
The judgment has been swift and brutal. Borrowing costs are up around the state, in some cases drastically. On Thursday, Saginaw County became the latest casualty when it said it was delaying a $60 million bond sale planned for Friday. It had hoped to put the proceeds into its pension fund.
It was the third postponed bond sale in Michigan since Detroit dropped its bombshell on July 18. Earlier this week, the city of Battle Creek said it would postpone a $16 million deal scheduled for August because of concerns that investors would demand interest rates that were too high. And the previous week, Genesee County withdrew a $54 million bond sale from the market for the same reason. 
Detroit's bankruptcy, the largest ever by a municipality, has raised fundamental concerns about the safety and security of municipal bonds, certainly in Michigan but potentially elsewhere in the country, too. The municipal bond market appears to be sending Michigan's cities a message that no matter how well rated they are, they are going to have to postpone their plans and projects or pay more for them.
When Jefferson County, Ala., declared bankruptcy in 2011, there were warnings it had tainted the credit of all other municipalities in the state, but the expected fallout never materialized. After Orange County, Calif., came through its bankruptcy in the 1990s, its borrowing costs actually fell. But Michigan appears to have something new -- a bankruptcy that makes it harder for others in the state to borrow.
Detroit's state-appointed emergency manager, Kevyn Orr, has proposed imposing deep cuts on some bondholders -- treating them the same, in effect, as retired Detroit workers who have been receiving city-paid health insurance that will now end. Mr. Orr's bankruptcy plan would put them all at the back of the line for whatever money is available, as unsecured creditors.
And because the city's bankruptcy filing was approved by the governor, Rick Snyder, it is seen as the best distillation of how Michigan will treat certain bondholders in times of trouble.
Putting a city's ''full faith, credit and taxing power'' behind a bond no longer means what it did in the past, anywhere in the state, critics say. The governor and Mr. Orr have said they are not concerned about the effect of the bankruptcy plan on the municipal bond market as a whole. But other participants find their treatment of indebtedness profoundly disturbing, and their anxiety has spilled over to other Michigan municipalities.
''A lot of the people I talk to are investors who are just very angry about this,'' said Matt Fabian, a managing director at Municipal Market Advisors. ''Bonds are so cheap everywhere across the whole market, there's no reason to put anyone in Michigan bonds right now.''
Sara Wurfel, a spokeswoman for Governor Snyder, acknowledged the concerns, but said they were overblown. She called Detroit's financial breakdown ''an incredibly unique situation,'' and said the bond rating agencies would continue to rate Michigan's other municipalities individually, each on its own strengths and weaknesses no matter what went on in Detroit.
''Michigan is home to hundreds of local communities across our state, rated by the credit agencies,'' she said. According to a recent analysis by Standard & Poor's, she said, ''only two of those aren't investment grade. There continue to be an abundance of sound, smart investments to make in Michigan and our local communities. Michigan's fiscal house is in order and sound.''
Mr. Fabian and others who work with municipal bonds cited two main concerns coming out of Detroit. First was the city's plan to put several different kinds of bonds, plus the retirees, into one big category -- unsecured creditors -- even though bonds were issued with many different ratings and promised investors different interest rates accordingly. If Detroit succeeds in lumping them all together in a single bankruptcy class, then by logic, the bonds of other Michigan cities should have their ratings changed to reflect that. The ratings would go down, and the investors holding the bonds would take losses.
Creditors recalled that Michigan's state treasurer helped to market some of Detroit's debt, encouraging investors to buy it as very safe.
''Now they're saying that the investors are getting what they deserve, and they should have known better,'' Mr. Fabian said. ''So you can't really trust the statements of the state government.''
The other concern was that the federal bankruptcy court might ultimately approve Detroit's treatment of bondholders, setting a precedent that distressed cities in other states might be tempted to follow. Their borrowing costs would then also rise, and that would undercut the way most of the country's roads, bridges and schools are built -- planned and financed at the local level.
Local officials in Michigan were putting on brave faces Thursday, saying the chill in the market might prove to be temporary, or to have been caused by broad credit conditions unrelated to Detroit. As the Federal Reserve has signaled a coming end to its easy-money policies, interest rates have been rising, making it more expensive for almost everyone to borrow.
''There's been a lot of things going on in the market,'' said Linda Morrison, the city finance manager for Battle Creek. Since last spring, her city had been planning to raise $16 million to pay for a new roof and better seating for the Kellogg Arena, among other improvements. She said that none of the projects were needed urgently and that Battle Creek could afford to wait for more favorable market conditions.
She said she was aware that Detroit's bankruptcy plan had dealt a blow to longstanding beliefs about a city's ''full faith, credit and taxing power.'' But, she added, maybe the judge would decide things in the bondholders' favor, and the markets would come back.
''Who's to say that the court won't decide it that way?'' she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: New Claims By Jobless Are Lowest Since 2007

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- A measure of Americans who applied for unemployment benefits over the last month has fallen to its lowest level in almost six years, signaling fewer layoffs.
The Labor Department said on Thursday that the average number of people who applied for benefits over the last four weeks dropped by 6,250, to 335,500. That is the lowest level since November 2007, the month before the Great Recession began. 
The four-week average smooths week-to-week fluctuations.
Weekly applications for unemployment aid increased by 5,000 last week to a seasonally adjusted 333,000. But that is up only slightly from the previous week's five-and-a-half-year low.
The decrease in the four-week average points to a positive trend in recent months. Applications, which are a proxy for layoffs, have fallen more than 10 percent since the start of the year. That has helped drive net job gains this year, which are the number of people hired minus the number who lose or quit their jobs.
Employers added 162,000 jobs last month, the smallest monthly gain since March. And most of the job growth came in lower-paying industries or part-time work. Since January, the economy has added an average of 192,000 jobs a month. But the pace has slowed to 175,000 in the last three months.
When employers are cutting few workers, as they are now, it does not take many hires to create a high net gain.
The job market is improving, largely because layoffs have fallen to pre-recession levels. But while employers are no longer cutting jobs, many remain reluctant to hire in the face of tax increases, federal spending cuts and slower global growth.

HEADLINE: Housing Stronger, Fannie Mae Posts $10 Billion Profit

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The mortgage giant Fannie Mae earned $10.1 billion in the second quarter, aided by a recovery in the housing market. The company, which is controlled by the government, has turned a profit in each of the last six quarters. 
Fannie said on Thursday that it would pay a dividend of $10.2 billion to the United States Treasury next month. It made no request for additional federal aid.
The company said the rise in home prices during the quarter enabled it to reduce reserves set aside for losses on mortgages, helping to bolster its net income.
The earnings for the period from April through June compared with the company's net income of $5.1 billion in the second quarter of 2012.
The government rescued Fannie and its smaller sibling, Freddie Mac, during the financial crisis after both incurred major losses on risky mortgages. The companies received loans totaling about $187 billion.
Fannie said it expected to remain profitable ''for the foreseeable future.''
Once the second-quarter dividend is paid, Fannie will have repaid $105 billion of the roughly $116 billion it received from taxpayers.
The latest quarterly gain followed a record $58.7 billion net income in the first quarter, when Fannie capitalized on tax benefits it had saved from its losses on loans during the crisis. It paid a first-quarter dividend of $59.4 billion to the Treasury.
The housing recovery that began last year has made Fannie and Freddie profitable again. Together they will have paid back about $146 billion of their government loans by next month. Those payments are helping make this year's federal budget deficit the smallest since President Obama took office in 2009.

HEADLINE: Egypt on the Edge

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
It's hard to imagine things getting worse in Egypt, but they could. The generals who now call the shots in the world's leading Arab country and their handpicked civilian government have halted efforts to reach a compromise with the Islamist supporters of the man they ousted -- Mohamed Morsi, the country's first democratically elected president. Instead, they have threatened to forcibly disperse tens of thousands of pro-Morsi civilians from two sit-ins in Cairo. 
Such an intemperate response could end disastrously. Nearly 300 people have been killed in political violence since July 3, when the military overthrew Mr. Morsi; among the dead were 80 Morsi backers shot by security forces on July 27. The government has carried out a sweeping crackdown against the Brotherhood, jailing Mr. Morsi in an unknown location, and blamed the group for inviting the crackdown even though the two main sit-ins, which are demanding Mr. Morsi's reinstatement, are open and seemingly nonviolent.
After working its back-channel ties to the army with little obvious effect, the Obama administration sent one of its ablest diplomats, William Burns, the deputy secretary of state, to Cairo to join a European Union representative and envoys from other Arab states in presenting both sides with sensible, face-saving proposals to calm the crisis. The army, they suggested, would release some Brotherhood leaders from detention and allow the Brotherhood to participate in elections; in exchange, the Islamists would forswear violence.
The generals and some civilian leaders, however, refused to budge, despite warnings in Cairo from two prominent visiting Republican senators, John McCain and Lindsey Graham, that America's $1.5 billion aid package could be at risk.
It is difficult to understand why the army, which considers itself the guardian of the state, would think that crushing the Brotherhood could benefit the country. Egypt is existing hand-to-mouth on donations from gulf allies when what it needs is to rebuild a strong economy that provides jobs, housing and education to its people. Tourism and foreign investment will never rebound if there is persistent violence and turmoil.
The Brotherhood, having been tossed out in a coup, might legitimately wonder whether the democratic process can ever be trusted. But that process offers the only path to long-term stability. The United States, which has gone too far in accepting the coup, must keep making the case for a political solution. With Europe and the Arab world, it must also be prepared to condemn the army and consider stronger action if more bloodshed occurs.

HEADLINE: For Mugabe and Britain, Ties That Bind

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL

 BODY:
LONDON -- When armed white settlers thrust into southern Africa in 1890 to raise the British flag over a land they named Rhodesia, they were lured by promises of gold beneath the ground and land aplenty above it.
More than 120 years later, the contest for the continent's resources in the land now called Zimbabwe seems undiminished, though China, not Britain, leads the scramble.
And, as the elections last week in Zimbabwe showed, a parallel battle is still being waged, at least in President Robert G. Mugabe's preoccupation -- some might say obsession -- with the decades of colonial and quasi-colonial rule that ended with independence in 1980. 
Throughout his tenure, Mr. Mugabe has prevailed, securing his seventh consecutive term in office last week.
Neither his years -- he is 89 -- nor his political foes, nor sanctions imposed by his Western adversaries in London, Washington and elsewhere have been able to end the increasingly personalized and autocratic rule he has secured through a blend of guile, an iron fist and what his critics call a lust for power.
''Robert Mugabe has survived for so long because he is more clever and more ruthless than any other politician in Zimbabwe,'' the former U.S. ambassador in Harare, Christopher W. Dell, said in a confidential 2007 cable made public by the WikiLeaks anti-secrecy group.
From another perspective, the outcome of Zimbabwe's election -- labeled as flawed by London and Washington -- showed the constraints on postimperial power and, more broadly, the limits of the West's ability to bend defiant regimes from North Korea to Syria to its will.
But Mr. Mugabe's survival has again conjured the conflicted and intimate flavor of his relationship with Britain, profoundly hostile and yet marked by what the late Heidi Holland, a biographer, called ''the peculiar intensity of a family quarrel.''
The Zimbabwean leader, for instance, is said to admire Britain's royal family, and is wont to use the regal ''we'' in speaking of himself. He upholds British traditions, like afternoon tea, but accuses Britain of harboring neocolonial ambitions. ''I've thought about retirement, but not when the British are saying, 'We want regime change,''' he said before the vote. ''I won't be changed by the British.''
The ties that bind European powers to their former African possessions are often a tangle of resentment, selfinterest, guilt, dependence and emulation, shaded by the dictates of realpolitik.
France, for instance, has long practiced a muscular neocolonialism, underpinned by the deployment of its troops, most recently on a relatively large scale to repulse an Islamist advance in Mali.
Even though it has sent forces to Sierra Leone, Afghanistan and Iraq, however, Britain has never been prepared to risk a similar military campaign in southern Africa.
Yet, by imputing continued colonial aspirations to Britain, Mr. Mugabe has been able to harness Africa's deep-rooted resentment of foreign dominance, casting his political survival as part of the elemental contest between slave and master, rather than as one more skirmish in the war of democracy versus tyranny portrayed by his enemies.
''More than many other African leaders,'' wrote the filmmaker Roy Agyemang, who made an award-winning documentary about the Zimbabwean leader last year, ''Mugabe draws cheers across the continent.''
The origins of Britain's fraught relationship with Mr. Mugabe long predate the Lancaster House conference that Britain convened in London in 1979 to broker a settlement after seven years of guerrilla warfare, during which Mr. Mugabe led the biggest of two rival insurgent forces.
Citing the Maoist adage that political power flows from the barrel of a gun, he showed little interest in ending the war. Britain, for its part, acknowledged that Mr. Mugabe and his armed followers could not be ignored, but it sought to blunt his claim on exclusive power through constitutional provisions that some in London hoped would sideline him.
The British miscalculated.
In the elections in 1980, Mr. Mugabe won outright victory. When the Union Jack flag the settlers had lofted in 1890 was finally lowered, it was Mr. Mugabe who officiated at the handover of power from Prince Charles.
In those early years, the seeds of bitterness between London and Harare, sown under white rule, spread their dark blooms.
Even as British advisers trained the bulk of a new national army, elements of the separate, North Korean-trained Fifth Brigade started a murderous spree against Mr. Mugabe's ethnic foes in the western Matabeleland region, killing thousands. Britain looked on, powerless.
''There is a limit to what this country can do to impose its will,'' Britain's former foreign secretary, Geoffrey Howe, said later, ''and to some extent a greater limit in an ex-colony with an extremely sensitive government.''
But there was also a phenomenon that Ms. Holland called Britain's ''unresolved colonial feelings'' of condescension and hostility toward Mr. Mugabe, contributing to ''postcolonial toxicity on both sides.''
Promises of land reform enshrined at Lancaster House went unredeemed. Indeed, Mr. Mugabe initially seemed to seek an accommodation with the country's 4,500 white farmers while Britain did little to redress the huge imbalances in land ownership before the explosion of farm expropriations ordered by the Zimbabwean leader starting in 2000.
Last week, Britain greeted Mr. Mugabe's victory with what Foreign Secretary William Hague called ''grave concern'' over the conduct and credibility of the vote.
But his remarks served to highlight the ambivalence of British perceptions blending revulsion at Mr. Mugabe's tyranny with frustrated impotence toward the corruption, economic decline and brutality that have been the hallmark of his tenure.
''There may be little that Britain can do,'' wrote the columnist Stephen Glover in the conservative Daily Mail, ''but William Hague should at least speak like a decent human being appalled by the activities of a man who was put into power by a British government and has caused so much suffering to a once bountiful country.''

HEADLINE: Trade Data Suggest a More Stable China

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Surprisingly strong rebounds in China's exports and imports in July offered some hope that the economy might be stabilizing, government data showed Thursday, after more than two years of slowing growth, although an imminent rebound still looks improbable.
Data from the Customs Administration showed exports had risen 5.1 percent in July from the same month last year. Analysts had expected a 3 percent rise. It was a sharp turnaround from June, when exports had declined for the first time in 17 months. 
Exports to the United States rose at an annual rate of 5.3 percent and those to Europe were up 2.8 percent, as China's two biggest markets posted their strongest gains since February. Shipments to Southeast Asia were also up.
Imports fared even better, with a 10.9 percent jump from a year earlier, more than five times what analysts had forecast. The surprising strength in imports left China with a smaller-than-expected trade surplus of $17.8 billion.
''July seems to reflect a return to a 'normal,' relatively uninspiring trend,'' analysts from Moody's said in a note. ''In other words, while the worst seems to be over, the upturn will be relatively flat.'' Exports in the three months ended July 31 posted the slowest annual increase since October 2009, a Reuters calculation showed.
Imports of crude oil and iron ore rebounded from multimonth lows to record highs last month, as more raw materials were shipped in to rebuild depleted stocks, and soybean purchases hit a record for a second month.
A steadying of the economy would be a relief to China's leaders, who have scrambled to shore up growth in the past couple of months. There had been concerns that a sharp slowdown could derail their attempts to shift the economy to being driven more by consumption than debt-funded investment and manufacturing.
Asian stocks rebounded on the data on hopes that Chinese demand might have found a floor.
China's trade performance has whipsawed this year after figures were inflated by companies reporting fake deals to disguise illicit cash transfers, and then subsequently deflated by the government as it quashed the fictitious transactions.
Analysts said the July data probably had minimal distortions, but some cautioned against concluding that the upbeat performance had been driven by an actual improvement in final demand.
Commodity imports rose sharply last month, with iron ore purchases jumping 17 percent from June. Some commodity analysts said July shipments may have been inflated by unprocessed deals from June.
''I would think it has something to do with the fact that the June number was low and there was some catch-up tonnage coming through,'' said Graeme Train, analyst with Macquarie in Shanghai.
Soy imports also hit a record high for the second straight month, though again analysts said that was partly due to delayed shipments finally arriving from congested Brazilian ports.
Crude oil imports, on the other hand, were likely lifted by refiners replenishing stocks after a three-month lull and as some new refineries started business.
''The monthly data is very volatile. I wouldn't read too much into it and say that domestic demand is strong,'' said Zhang Zhiwei, an economist at Nomura in Hong Kong.
Exports to the United States rose an annual 5.3 percent and those to Europe were up 2.8 percent, as China's two biggest markets posted their strongest gains since February. Shipments to southeast Asia were also up on the year.
With the United States economy showing signs of a gradual recovery, Ting Lu, an economist at Bank of America-Merrill Lynch, said Chinese exporters could benefit further in coming months.
The trade figures were seen as a positive sign for industrial output data on Friday, with economists expecting production to show an annual rise of 9 percent in July.
Fixed asset investment is forecast to have risen 20 percent in the first seven months of the year, in line with growth in the first six months, while inflation is forecast to have quickened to a five-month high of 2.8 percent.
Top leaders in Beijing have made clear they will accept a slowdown in growth as they restructure the Chinese economy, but have indicated that annual growth should not be allowed to slip below 7 percent.
The economy has slowed in nine of the past 10 quarters, but the government has stressed it is confident of meeting its 7.5 percent growth target this year -- the lowest in 23 years.

HEADLINE: To American Watchdog on Afghan Reconstruction, Bluntness Is a Weapon

BYLINE: By MATTHEW ROSENBERG

 BODY:
KABUL, Afghanistan -- John F. Sopko is a 61-year-old former prosecutor who believes ''embarrassing people works.''
As the special inspector general for Afghan reconstruction, he has made a full-time job of doing just that. He and his team spend their days cataloging the waste, mismanagement and fraud that have plagued American reconstruction projects in Afghanistan.
Then they go out and publicize what they have found -- aggressively. If they upset the generals and diplomats running the war, so much the better. Most officials ''would love to have it all triple-wrapped in paper, classified and slipped under a door so it goes away -- then they don't have to do anything,'' he said during a recent interview.
He added, ''I'm into accountability.'' 
Mr. Sopko may lack the name recognition of those who have shaped the war in the American imagination: Osama bin Laden, President Hamid Karzai, generals like Stanley A. McChrystal and David H. Petraeus. But Mr. Sopko has been as instrumental as anyone in shaping the now-prevalent view among Americans that the war in Afghanistan has become an expensive boondoggle no longer worth fighting.
After a few minutes with Mr. Sopko, it is easy to see why. He is blunt in a way that is rare for American officials, and his directness often hits just the right notes when he makes his case to Congress, journalists or others who help shape public opinion.
His success in effecting change is harder to measure, though. Mr. Sopko's take-no-prisoners approach has alienated many officials whose work he scrutinizes. Many seethe at what they characterize as his grandstanding and bullying. Some throw out the occasional expletive to make their point.
His work, they say, lacks depth and nuance and too often emphasizes problems instead of solutions. A number of officials said they had begun to tune him out, though at the same time they said they did not want to attract Mr. Sopko's attention.
The nicest thing many officials will say about Mr. Sopko is that he is not always wrong.
Mr. Sopko ''does tell everyone, 'U.S.A.I.D. can't manage its programs because they can't get off the embassy compound,' '' Larry Sampler, a senior official at the United States Agency for International Development, told reporters at a briefing in Kabul last month. ''I can't say that's not true.''
''But it's not universally true,'' Mr. Sampler added. As an example, he cited the fact that American officials based in Herat, in western Afghanistan, were allowed to drive their own vehicles because the area had become relatively tranquil.
Mr. Sopko has ''created a perception that we're just pushing money out the door and not paying any attention,'' Mr. Sampler said, ''and that couldn't be further from the truth.''
Mr. Sopko, who works from an office tower a few blocks from the Pentagon and makes occasional trips to Afghanistan, bristles at suggestions that he mainly seeks the limelight. He insisted that his goal was to help salvage the war effort by highlighting the need to stop spending money when its impact could not be gauged, or it was simply being stolen.
His critics should ''spend less time complaining'' about negative news media coverage, he said, ''and fix it.''
He was more amused by a State Department effort to have a public affairs official sit in on interviews conducted at the American Embassy in Kabul. The embassy said it was standard procedure at missions around the world for any government employees speaking with the press.
Mr. Sopko, unsurprisingly, had a different take: ''The last time I dealt with minders was in the Soviet Union,'' he said, chuckling. No State Department officials were present during the interview.
Inspectors general, the government's internal watchdogs, are usually reserved, issuing reports that tend to be dense and rather dry. Their public statements are often few and far between.
The Afghanistan special inspector general's office was no different before the arrival of Mr. Sopko. Created by Congress in 2008 and modeled after a similar program in Iraq, the office produced a single audit in its first year. It soon improved, but not enough for Congress, which in 2011 forced out the first special inspector general, Arnold Fields.
Mr. Sopko took over a year ago and immediately stepped up the agency's metabolism. In his first year, his office has issued more reports, alerts, audits and other items than were put out in the agency's first four years of existence.
But the work, in Mr. Sopko's estimation, is pointless unless someone is reading it. ''I don't put out reports just to kill a bunch of trees,'' he said. ''If you want to make a change, you need to get to the American people.''
That philosophy is evident in the steady stream of reports produced by his office. They are made for easy consumption with executive summaries and clearly stated conclusions, and Mr. Sopko's public affairs staff aggressively flags them to reporters. The New York Times has cited the work of the special inspector general in multiple stories.
Sometimes, though, the power of embarrassment goes only so far. But ''putting people in jail also works -- it gets their attention,'' Mr. Sopko said. Since he took the job, investigations by his office have resulted in nine people being jailed.
A sampling of his team's findings in the past month offers a guide to the kind of work it is doing. There was what is known as an ''alert letter'' warning of ''serious deficiencies'' in a $47 million State Department program to develop Afghanistan's justice system; an audit found that $47 million spent to help stabilize contested areas in Afghanistan had yielded little stabilization; another alert letter highlighted the $34 million spent to build a state-of-the-art headquarters for the Marines in southern Afghanistan that is never going to be used.
The reports do garner attention. The Marine headquarters, for instance, has quickly become another data point for skeptics of the Afghan war.
Raised in Cleveland, Mr. Sopko described his parents as New Deal Democrats who imbued him with the belief that the government could do good. His father was a meteorologist for the National Weather Service; his mother was a homemaker.
He became a lawyer, and started out prosecuting mobsters in Ohio. Then, in 1982, he decided to work as a Congressional staff member in Washington. There, he discovered he ''loved doing the work that changed policy.''
Three decades later, Mr. Sopko is still in Washington, and still looking to shape policy. ''I wish to goodness I had this opportunity four years ago,'' he said. ''That said, it still has to be done, and now more than ever.''
The troop drawdown may be well under way, but the United States is still committed to spending billions of dollars in Afghanistan in the coming years. Without ''lots of troops protecting our people,'' Mr. Sopko said, they ''won't have that ability to get out into the country.''
''We could just pump money out the door if we don't keep at this,'' he said.

&#x2605; Paquito D'Rivera and Panamericana (Friday through Sunday) The clarinetist, alto saxophonist and longtime Cuban exile Paquito D'Rivera favors bright extroversion in his music, which usually incorporates Latin rhythm.

&#x2605; Christian McBride Trio (Tuesday) The bassist Christian McBride holds fast to a mood of generous bonhomie with this trio, featuring Christian Sands, a pianist of urgent effervescence, and Ulysses Owens Jr., a drummer of knockabout composure.

Next Collective (Friday through Sunday) As heard on a recent album, ''Cover Art'' (Concord Jazz), Next Collective is an assembled whole, a product of good corporate design. The group features young (or youngish) musicians recasting tunes by the likes of D'Angelo and Bon Iver, with a little less substance than style. But there is reason to get excited about the talent involved -- like the saxophonists Logan Richardson and Walter Smith III, the guitarist Matt Stevens and the pianist Gerald Clayton, who all surface here.

King Blues Club & Grill on Saturday. Following his death this week, at 67, the evening has been reconfigured as a tribute, with his fellow 1970s jazz-funk pioneer the vibraphonist Roy Ayers leading the way. Among the guests joining Mr. Ayers's band is the guitarist John Scofield, above, a former sideman to Mr. Duke and a longtime friend. At 8 p.m., 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan, (212) 997-4144, bbkingblues.com; $30. (Chinen)

Vijay Iyer brings a similarly freethinking integrity to his engagement. At 8:30 and 11 p.m., Birdland, 315 West 44th Street, Clinton, (212) 581-3080, birdlandjazz.com; $30 and $40 cover, with a $10 minimum. (Chinen)
&#x2605; Steve Wilson Quartet (Friday through Sunday) The alto and soprano saxophonist Steve Wilson combines economy and modernity in his playing, whatever the setting.

HEADLINE: Surge in Commodities Prices Helps End Slump on Wall St.

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
Mining companies and others dealing in commodities helped pull the stock market out of a three-day slump on Thursday.
News that China's trade rebounded last month signaled the end of a six-month slowdown for the world's biggest buyer of raw materials. The report drove prices up for copper and other commodities, and that helped lift Newmont Mining, Freeport-McMoRan and other stocks in the materials industry. 
''The one thing that stands out today is the better news out of China,'' said David Joy, the chief market strategist at Ameriprise Financial. ''It comes as a pleasant surprise.''
The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index edged up 6.57 points, or 0.4 percent, to 1,697.48.
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 27.65 points, or 0.2 percent, to 15,498.32. The Nasdaq composite gained 15.12 points, or 0.4 percent, to 3,669.12.
With little other news to drive trading, the stock market had meandered lower this week. The S.& P. 500 fell three days straight and remains down 0.7 percent for the week. It is still up 19 percent this year.
Brad McMillan, chief investment officer for Commonwealth Financial Network in Waltham, Mass., said a number of concerns weighed on the market this week. Comments from Federal Reserve officials have convinced many investors that the bank will begin pulling back its support for the economy in the coming months.
In an interview on CNBC after the market closed, Richard W. Fisher, head of the Fed's Dallas branch, reaffirmed his view that it was time to wind down the bank's stimulus effort.
At the same time, companies are warning of slower sales and turning in tepid second-quarter results. Mr. McMillan said it was starting to look as though corporate earnings had not kept up with the stock market's strong pace this year.
''I think people are realizing that stock values are getting disconnected from earnings growth,'' Mr. McMillan said. ''For the rally to continue, people will have to pay more for earnings that aren't growing that much.''
Investors are paying more for profits. A year ago, the price-earnings ratio for the S.& P. 500 was 13.4, according to the data provider FactSet. Now it is 15.6, which is still near the long-run average.
In other trading on Thursday, the better economic news out of China sent copper, widely used for electronics and to wire buildings, up 10 cents, or 3 percent, to $3.27 a pound. Gold rose $24.60, or 2 percent, to $1,309.90 an ounce.
In the bond market, the price of the 10-year Treasury note rose 10/32, to 93 1/32, while its yield fell to 2.59 percent, from 2.60 late Wednesday.

HEADLINE: After Going All In During Mining Boom, BHP Cuts Its Ambitions

BYLINE: By WILLIAM MACNAMARA

 BODY:
BHP Billiton, the world's largest mining company, was willing to spend big in early 2012. It was building new mines and upgrading old ones, at a cost of $18 billion. It considered a potential expansion of its copper and uranium mine, Olympic Dam, which could have cost as much as $20 billion. It proposed a deepwater extension of Port Hedland, its iron ore port, an estimated $10 billion or more.
But BHP has significantly scaled back its ambitions in the last year, replacing its multibillion-dollar spending spree with an austere program of cost cuts and efficiency drives. It shelved the plans for Port Hedland and Olympic Dam, both in Australia, noting the need to find ''a less capital-intensive design.'' The mergers and acquisitions department is now referred to as the ''D department'' internally, to signify its focus on disposals, according to a person close to BHP who spoke on the condition of anonymity. 
The U-turn from expansionary spending to aggressive pullback has swept the global mining industry with brutal speed and force. With fixed costs rising, commodities prices slumping and profit shrinking, the chief executives of four of the biggest multinationals -- BHP, Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Barrick Gold -- have all been replaced. And pinched companies are scrambling to sell off assets and raise money, with mixed results. On Thursday, Rio Tinto shelved plans to sells some aluminum assets, citing the tough environment.
In short, the commodities boom has ended.
BHP now sits atop a sector that is deeply out of favor with investors. Their central complaint is that the big companies, during a period of high metals prices and strong profit from 2009 to 2011, spent too much money building mines instead of returning money to shareholders. In the current environment, these expensive new mines look ill advised, perhaps dangerously so, given that the new capacity could drive down prices further.
''Investors are more than entitled to be concerned about the productivity of the capital they have invested in our business,'' said Andrew Mackenzie, the new chief executive of BHP. ''They are more than entitled to ask us to think long and hard about every piece of new investment we make, relative to whether we make cash returns to them.''
''If there is a new wind blowing through my part of the sector,'' he said, ''it is the emphasis now -- given that we invested quite a lot during a period of slightly higher prices -- on maximizing the returns from the investments we have already made.''
Mr. Mackenzie, a Scotsman who speaks five languages, is the new, somber voice of the industry. He speaks in the BHP style of academic understatement, referring to the boom as ''a period of slightly higher prices.'' For a decade, the company's top ranks have been filled with doctorate-holding economists, management consultants and former academics who become animated when discussing long-term Chinese consumption trends or pricing structures for iron ore.
Given that atmosphere, BHP executives see the rise and fall of commodity prices as part of the typical economic cycle, stressing that the downward pressure should not prompt panic. A longtime industry executive who has experienced the previous ups and downs, Mr. Mackenzie says his job is not to change the company's strategy but rather to mold it to today's market realities.
BHP can afford to take the long view. Despite the industry volatility, the company has maintained stable profits, thanks to an unusually diverse variety of commodities. BHP produces oil and gas in addition to iron ore, copper, coal, nickel, aluminum, uranium, diamonds and manganese. In their zeal for economic data, executives constantly highlight a chart that they call ''the spaghetti chart'' or ''the Jackson Pollock chart,'' a mess of squiggly lines showing the volatile earnings for each commodity BHP produces, and a smooth line through the middle representing the company's relatively stable profit.
The diversification has helped BHP weather the harsh downturn better than peers like Rio Tinto, Anglo American and Vale.
BHP never cut its dividend during the financial crisis. And the company's $5.5 billion in write-downs over the last two years have proven manageable given its earnings. BHP, which will report its annual results later this month, is expected to make $12.5 billion in profits for the latest fiscal year that ended in June.
By comparison, Rio Tinto took a $14 billion write-down this year on two bad investments in Canadian aluminum and African coal. On Thursday, the miner reported a 18 percent drop in profit for the first half of the year, reflecting the weakness in the prices of metals.
Although BHP is holding up better than many rivals, its stock is still suffering. Shares of BHP, which have recovered modestly in recent weeks are still off more than 15 percent this year, closing on Thursday at $65.96.
''What investors are upset about is how these mining companies burned billions of dollars through write-downs,'' said Rob Clifford, a mining analyst at Deutsche Bank. ''It's this idea of the companies having too much money and then squandering it.''
With their stocks down, Mr. Mackenzie and other mining chiefs are trying to be highly attuned to investors. In recent months, Mr. Mackenzie has talked to his universe of shareholders, from global institutions to pensioners. The common theme is increasing their cash returns.
When he started in his new role in May, he set the tone by taking a base salary 20 percent lower than that of his predecessor, Marius Kloppers. ''I felt that was in keeping with the expectations of the marketplace right now,'' he said. ''I have a lot to do to move the company forward in terms of productivity and value for money.''
He spent his first day on the job visiting BHP's complex of iron ore mines, railways and ports in the badlands of Western Australia. As he toured the vast industrial complex, he quizzed managers about how efficiently the haul trucks were moving ore, he said, because ''trucks are a big part of our $36 billion cost base.''
New projects have also been frozen indefinitely. The company has announced $1.9 billion in cost savings since July 2012. Within two or three years, Mr. Mackenzie said, he wants capital expenditures to fall to $15 billion or less, compared with $18 billion today.
''His reign should be marked by nothing radical,'' said Mr. Clifford of Deutsche Bank. ''It should be marked by bludgeoning, boring, good old cost-cutting.''
But BHP and other big mining companies can't rein in spending overnight. Capital expenditures in the mining business mushroomed from $20 billion in 2003 to $120 billion in 2012, according to Goldman Sachs. Much of the money is tied up in incomplete projects. So the spending can only roll off gradually, as mining projects approved in the heady days are finished in 2014 or 2015. Then there is always the possibility that some projects will take more money and more time. ''BHP is in a pincer for the time being,'' said Jeff Largey, a mining analyst at Macquarie. He estimated that BHP's capital expenditures would drop to $17 billion during its fiscal year starting in July, roughly in line with its cash flows. ''So there is not much left over for shareholders.''
''All that said, I think BHP will be the first to emerge,'' he added.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Independent Agencies, Sometimes In Name Only

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
In 1985, President Ronald Reagan had to fill a Democratic slot on the Securities and Exchange Commission. He chose a young lawyer and economist, Joseph A. Grundfest.
He did not have to look very far to find Mr. Grundfest, who is now a law professor at Stanford. ''At the time,'' Mr. Grundfest recalled this week, ''I was working in the Reagan White House as counsel and senior economist at the Council of Economic Advisers.''
Under the law, no more than three members of the S.E.C. can be from the same party, so the seat had to go to someone who was not a Republican. Mr. Grundfest was a registered Democrat. The fact that he was serving in a Republican administration did not disqualify him, and he easily won Senate confirmation.
This year, two new members of the S.E.C., one Democrat and one Republican, have been confirmed by the Senate and are about to be sworn in. They were each nominated by President Obama. But the reality appears to be that he did not really choose them. 
Instead, they were effectively chosen by senior senators. Both the Republican, Michael S. Piwowar, and the Democrat, Kara M. Stein, were aides on the Senate Banking Committee. It appears that their former bosses, Senator Michael D. Crapo of Idaho, the ranking Republican on the committee, and Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island, the former chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance and Investment, were instrumental in their selection.
That helps to explain why the S.E.C. has in recent years splintered into factions far more than ever before. ''They tend,'' said Arthur Levitt, the chairman of the S.E.C. from 1993 to 2001, ''to embrace the philosophy of their mentors.''
I asked the Democrat whom Mr. Grundfest replaced, Bevis Longstreth, how he was chosen. The answer had nothing to do with a senator. In 1981, Mr. Longstreth, a partner in Debevoise & Plimpton, a New York-based law firm, knew James A. Baker III, President Reagan's chief of staff at the time, who shepherded his appointment through the process.
Another former commissioner recalled never having talked to anyone on Capitol Hill before being nominated.
Of course, members of Congress always had influence, and presidents have sought advice and engaged in horse trading. But Harvey Pitt, who worked on the S.E.C. staff from 1968 to 1978, rising to general counsel, said things had changed by the time he returned as chairman in 2001. By then, he said, presidents were expected to nominate the people chosen by the opposition party's senior senators, unless there was something clearly wrong with the person.
Mr. Pitt said he thought that began on a more formal basis after the Republicans took control of Congress in 1994, when Bill Clinton was president.
Mr. Pitt, who was appointed chairman by President George W. Bush, said that his recommendations and approval were sought by the White House for prospective Republican commissioners, but that while he met with Democratic choices before they were nominated, he did not feel he -- or the White House -- had much leeway in choosing whether to appoint them.
Now, there is some evidence that the president generally gets to choose the chairmen of independent commissions, but the other majority members are picked on Capitol Hill.
The result has been that chairmen of commissions can find it difficult to accomplish anything. Last year, Mary L. Schapiro, the chairwoman of the S.E.C. at the time, tried and failed to push changes in money market funds through the commission in the face of strong opposition from the money market fund industry. She could not get the Republican votes, and one of the Democrats on the commission also refused to go along.
That infuriated other financial regulators. The Financial Stability Oversight Council, composed of 10 top regulators including the S.E.C. chairman, looked for ways to force actions it thought were needed to assure such funds would not need federal support during a crisis, as happened in 2008.
This year, under the new chairwoman, Mary Jo White, the commission voted unanimously to seek comment on two possible changes, saying it might adopt either or both of them. Those proposals were severely diluted from the original proposal, and the industry appears to be ready to accept some change.
What has happened to the S.E.C. appears to have happened, in varying degrees, at other regulatory agencies.
Such agencies are called ''independent'' agencies because they are required to have members from both parties, keeping them from being strictly accountable to the president, as cabinet members are.
But while the agency may be formally independent, individual commissioners are widely expected to be anything but independent. William H. Donaldson, who was President George W. Bush's second S.E.C. chairman, was forced out after Republicans complained that he had sided with the Democratic members on some 3-to-2 votes. His successor, Christopher Cox, always sided with the other Republicans on divided votes.
One sign of the continuing link of commissioners to their Congressional sponsors came in 1994, when Senator Richard C. Shelby of Alabama crossed the aisle and became a Republican. His former chief of staff in the Senate, Richard Y. Roberts, had been appointed to a Democratic seat on the S.E.C. by President George H. W. Bush in 1990. Mr. Roberts immediately reclassified himself as a Republican member after Senator Shelby made his own switch.
''I worked for Senator Shelby for a good part of my life,'' Mr. Roberts told me this week, when I asked why he switched. ''It was just a matter of loyalty.'' Fortunately, at the time there was a Republican vacancy that he could fill.
The independent agencies always had contentious issues to settle and sometimes were subject to heavy lobbying. At the S.E.C., for years market structure battles pitted the New York Stock Exchange against the Nasdaq market. There was lobbying by institutional investors, banks and mutual funds. But those issues generally did not seem like partisan ones, on which you would expect Democrats to necessarily have differing views from Republicans.
''There was a wide variety of constituencies, and as a consequence the S.E.C. was more refereelike, and sort of stood outside politics,'' said Roderick M. Hills, who was appointed chairman by President Gerald R. Ford.
Now, that is less true. ''The polarization in the legislative branch is being reflected in every agency,'' Mr. Levitt said.
''It is a lot more partisan than when I was there,'' agreed Mr. Roberts, who is now a principal at Roberts, Raheb & Gradler, a regulatory and legislative consulting firm that he helped to found. ''All the agencies, everything is partisan. You just can't get away from it.''
One clear indication of the expectation that independent agencies will not be independent of politics came when Republicans vowed not to confirm anyone to lead the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, which was established by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law in 2010. They demanded that the law be changed to put the bureau under a commission that would have Republican members. Under a deal worked out last month, the Senate finally confirmed Richard Cordray as the chairman, two years after President Obama picked him for the job.
I've been covering the S.E.C. for a long time. Once it was taken for granted that the chairman could set the agenda and largely get his or her way. Commission rules give the chairman, not the full commission, the power to appoint people to run the various parts of the commission, so the chairman could control what the staff recommended. There were times when commissioners vigorously dissented, but it was almost unheard-of for a chairman to be unable to get the backing of at least two other members.
But starting in the George W. Bush administration, 3-to-2 votes became much more common. And while secret votes on enforcement issues used to remain secret, there began to be leaks -- to the news media and sometimes to members of Congress -- about such splits.
It is inconceivable that President Obama could get away with what President Reagan did and appoint one of his White House aides as a representative of the opposition party.
But there are changes that could be made to make the independent agencies more functional even in the current partisan atmosphere. At a minimum, President Obama could seek to assure that Democratic members he appoints to commissions have similar priorities and a willingness to work with the chairman, even if that means sometimes saying no to powerful members of his own party.

Previews and Openings
'Avi Hoffman's Still Jewish After All These Years' (previews start on Saturday; opens on Aug. 19) You really needed to be told? After all, Mr. Hoffman began performing at the Folksbiene Yiddish Theater at the age of 10 and has enjoyed long runs in shows like ''Too Jewish?'' After a 15-year hiatus from the New York stage, the bigger news is that he is still performing through story and song after all these years. Stage 72, 158 West 72nd Street, Manhattan, (800) 838-3006, brownpapertickets.com. (Eric Grode) 
'The Hill Town Plays' (previews start on Wednesday; opens on Sept. 5) Seemingly every space in the West Village that isn't hosting the New York International Fringe Festival will be part of this ambitious cycle of five related plays by Lucy Thurber (''Scarcity,'' ''Ashville,'' ''Where We're Born,'' ''Killers and Other Family,'' and ''Stay''). In addition to Rattlestick Playwrights Theater, Ms. Thurber's most reliable base of operations in New York (three of these plays have previously been staged there), Axis Theater and the New Ohio Theater and both Cherry Lane Theater spaces will present important stages in one fictional woman's life. Various locations, (866) 811-4111, theatervillage.com. (Grode)
'Love's Labour's Lost' (in previews; opens on Monday) Shakespeare in the Park hit it big in 1971 when it set some of its young talent loose on a lesser-known Shakespeare comedy: ''Two Gentlemen of Verona,'' which was turned into a Tony Award-winning delight by Galt MacDermot and John Guare. Now the Public Theater's summer outpost has deputized the ''Bloody Bloody Andrew Jackson'' team of Michael Friedman (music and lyrics) and Alex Timbers (adaptation and direction) to musicalize this even more obscure comedy. A batch of ''Bloody Bloody'' performers are on board, along with Daniel Breaker and Rachel Dratch. Delacorte Theater, Central Park, enter the park at 81st Street and Central Park West, (212) 539-8750, shakespeareinthepark.org. (Grode)
New York International Fringe Festival (starts on Friday) Theater, dance, clowning, performance art and puppetry fans will once again have 20 different downtown Manhattan sites to choose from for this sprawling festival, now in its 17th year. The star quality isn't as high as in past years -- Bruce Vilanch of ''The Hollywood Squares'' is probably the biggest name -- but there does seem to be a preponderance of racy offerings, among them ''Inexcusable Fantasies,'' ''Mercedes Benz Awkwardly'' and ''A Fallopian Fairy Tale.'' Theater fans might take note of ''Waiting for Waiting for Godot'' and ''Who's Afraid of Me, Myself, and Edward Albee?'' Various locations, (866) 468-7619, fringenyc.org. (Grode)
'Soul Doctor' (in previews; opens on Thursday) This musical odyssey -- after engagements in South Florida and New Orleans, as well as Off Broadway -- examines the life of ''The Singing Rabbi,'' Shlomo Carlebach, a key figure in popular Jewish music, and his friendship with Nina Simone. The show is written and directed by Daniel S. Wise, with choreography by Benoit-Swan Pouffer. Circle in the Square Theater, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (800) 432-7780, telecharge.com. (Grode)
'Under the Greenwood Tree' (in previews; opens on Sunday) Don't let the pastoral title, the time of year and the subject matter (Shakespearean adaptation) fool you. This ''musical reimagining'' of ''As You Like It'' is one of the few examples of summer Shakespeare being presented indoors. This will presumably help the acoustics for one of the production's main selling points, an indie-Americana score performed by the 17-member cast. Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (866) 811-4111, theflea.org. (Grode)
Broadway
'Annie' James Lapine's revival of the singing comic strip from 1977 is merely serviceable. But its smiley-faced mixture of hope and corn scratches an itch in a city recovering from a recession and a hurricane. Theatergoers may occasionally feel the urge both to mist up and throw up, but Lilla Crawford is a nigh irresistible Orphan Annie. With Anthony Warlow and Faith Prince as Miss Hannigan (2:25). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Ben Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Kinky Boots' Cyndi Lauper has created a love-and-heat-seeking score that performs like a pop star on Ecstasy. This Harvey Fierstein-scripted tale of lost souls in shoe business, in which a young factory owner (Stark Sands) teams up with a drag queen (Billy Porter), sometimes turns into a sermon. But it's hard to resist the audience-hugging charisma of the songs in this Tony winner for best new musical (2:20). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Let It Be' Another Beatles tribute on Broadway? But this concert is the best of the bunch by far, with a rotating cast, 40 or so songs, and a burst of musical magical realism (2:20). St. James Theater, 246 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212) 239-6200, letitbebroadway.com. (Anita Gates)
&#x2605; 'Matilda the Musical' The most satisfying and subversive musical ever to come out of Britain. Directed by Matthew Warchus, with a book by Dennis Kelly and addictive songs by Tim Minchin, this adaptation of Roald Dahl's novel is an exhilarating tale of empowerment, told from the perspective of that most powerless group, little children. Bertie Carvel is priceless as their schoolmistress nemesis (2:35). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Motown: The Musical' A dramatically slapdash but musically vibrant joy ride through the glory days of the Detroit music label founded by Berry Gordy. Mr. Gordy's book is sketchy and obvious -- you want to plug your ears whenever the music stops. But the music is, of course, some of the greatest R&B ever recorded, and the performers mostly electric (2:40). Lunt-Fontanne Theater, 205 West 46th Street, (877) 250-2929, ticketmaster.com. (Charles Isherwood)
'Pippin' Diane Paulus sends in the acrobats for her exhaustingly energetic (and now Tony-winning) revival of Stephen Schwartz and Roger O. Hirson's 1972 musical. As for the 99-pound story at the center of this muscle-bound spectacle -- the one about the starry-eyed son of Charlemagne (Matthew James Thomas) -- that's there too, if you look hard. With Patina Miller and a delightful Andrea Martin (2:35). Music Box Theater, 239 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella' This ultimate and most enduring of makeover stories, via the team who gave us ''Oklahoma!,'' has been restyled by the director Mark Brokaw and the writer Douglas Carter Beane into a glittery patchwork of snark and sincerity, with a whole lot of fancy ball gowns. Laura Osnes and Santino Fontana are the appealing leading lovers (2:20). Broadway Theater, 1681 Broadway, at 53rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Trip to Bountiful' Michael Wilson's slow-handed staging of Horton Foote's 1953 drama about an old woman's journey into the past is most notable for its remarkable star, Cicely Tyson, who seems thoroughly rejuvenated by her return to Broadway. The attractive supporting cast includes Cuba Gooding Jr., Vanessa Williams and Adepero Oduye (2:10). Stephen Sondheim Theater, 124 West 43rd Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'Vanya and Sonia and Masha and Spike' Portraying a woman mired in what appears to be a permanent midlife crisis, the marvelous comic actor Kristine Nielsen provides much of the laughing gas in Christopher Durang's uneven but intermittently delightful riff on Chekhovian themes. David Hyde Pierce and Julie White also star in this Tony-winning play directed by Nicholas Martin (2:30). John Golden Theater, 252 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Isherwood)
Off Broadway
'Around the World in 80 Days' This stage version of the Jules Verne novel is an odd combination of steampunk and vaudeville. The actors' shameless mugging grows annoying after a while, but the pace stays brisk and the energy level high (1:30). New Theater at 45th Street, 354 West 45th Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, aroundtheworldinnyc.com. (Neil Genzlinger)
'Bill W. and Dr. Bob' Making the story of the founding of Alcoholics Anonymous 99 percent preachiness-free is quite an accomplishment. Samuel Shem and Janet Surrey's purpose-driven script, which never forgets the humor of the human experience, goes a long way toward making this a satisfying revival (2:15). SoHo Playhouse, 15 Van Dam Street, South Village, (866) 811-4111, billwanddrbob.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'Buyer & Cellar' Jonathan Tolins has concocted an irresistible one-man play from the most peculiar of fictitious premises -- an underemployed Los Angeles actor goes to work in Barbra Streisand's Malibu, Calif., basement -- allowing the playwright to ruminate with delicious wit and perspicacity on the solitude of celebrity, the love-hate attraction between gay men and divas, and the melancholy that lurks beneath narcissism. In the capable hands of the director Stephen Brackett and the wickedly charming actor Michael Urie, this seriously funny slice of absurdist whimsy creates the illusion of a stage filled with multiple people, all of them with their own droll point of view (1:30). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, at Seventh Avenue South, West Village, (212) 868-4444, smarttix.com. (David Rooney)
'Cougar the Musical' Three older women find themselves attracted to younger men, two against their better judgment. The concept seems made for bus tours, but imagination, appealing numbers with original melodies and theme-transcending jokes lift this show well above the level of ''Menopause: The Musical'' and its ilk (1:30). Fridays and Saturdays only. St. Luke's Theater, 308 West 46th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Cuff Me: The Fifty Shades of Grey Musical Parody' What can I possibly say that isn't said by the title of this production? Here's one thing: It's not exactly great theater, but I'd still rather see ''Cuff Me'' than read the novel upon which it's based (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Claudia La Rocco)
&#x2605; 'The Designated Mourner' This revival of Wallace Shawn's anatomy of a survivor in a totalitarian country makes the definitive case for its author as one of the most complex and uncompromising moralists of the American theater. André Gregory, who directed the New York premiere in 2000, returns with the same first-rate cast: Deborah Eisenberg, Larry Pine and Mr. Shawn (3:00). Public Theater, 425 Lafayette Street, at Astor Place, East Village, (212) 967-7555, publictheater.org. (Brantley)
'I Forgive You, Ronald Reagan' This overwrought new play, about the aftermath of the 1981 air-traffic controller strike, wants very much to be a modern-day ''Death of a Salesman.'' It has its own working-class hero who loses his identity (and ultimately his sanity) after being forced out of his livelihood, and who compensates by pinning unrealistic hopes on his coddled, lazy offspring. But problems with John S. Anastasi's script keep us from fully empathizing with its everyman protagonist and agreeing that attention must be paid (2:00). Beckett Theater at Theater Row, 410 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Catherine Rampell)
'It's Just Sex' Jeff Gould's lightweight comedy, a long-running hit in Los Angeles, is about three married couples whose party turns into an evening of spouse-swapping and postcoital navel-gazing (metaphorically). The cast is personable, but the script's only deep thought is that if women were told they could talk only to one person for the rest of their lives, they would understand why sexual fidelity is so stifling for men (1:30). Actors Temple Theater, 339 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Gates)
'Me and Jezebel' Kelly Moore (that's Mr. Kelly Moore) is great fun to watch as Bette Davis in Elizabeth Fuller's real-life ''Man Who Came to Dinner'' story. Too bad Ms. Fuller, who plays herself, isn't really an actress. This comedy about a movie star taking over the guest room and the lives of a Connecticut family one month in 1985 is admirably self-deprecating (1:45). Snapple Theater Center, 210 West 50th Street, Manhattan, (212) 921-7862, ticketmaster.com. (Gates)
&#x2605; 'Murder for Two' A virtuosic Jeff Blumenkrantz plays all the suspects, and Brett Ryback the investigating officer, in this nifty mystery musical comedy by Joe Kinosian and Kellen Blair. The actors also provide the music, taking turns at the piano, under Scott Schwartz's fleet direction (1:30). McGinn/Cazale Theater, 2162 Broadway, at 76th Street, fourth floor, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
'My Name Is Asher Lev' Aaron Posner's adaptation of Chaim Potok's novel feels like a well-made play from the era in which the story takes place: the 1950s. Set in a Hasidic neighborhood in Brooklyn, this tale of an artistic prodigy has been directed with an attention to emotional nuance by Gordon Edelstein and features strong performances from its three-person cast: Ari Brand, Mark Nelson and Jenny Bacon (1:30). Westside Theater/Upstairs, 407 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Rachel Saltz)
&#x2605; 'Natasha, Pierre and the Great Comet of 1812' Dave Malloy's transporting pop opera dramatizes an emotionally potent slice of Tolstoy's ''War and Peace.'' Rachel Chavkin directs a superb young cast who bring the loves and losses of 19th-century Russian aristocrats to vibrant, intimate life in a stylish cabaret setting expressly built for the production (2:30). Kazino, West 13th Street, at Washington Street, West Village, (877) 704-2821, thegreatcometof1812.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Peter and the Starcatcher' The most exhilarating and inventive example of story theater since the Royal Shakespeare Company's ''Life and Adventures of Nicholas Nickleby.'' This production, about the boy who became Peter Pan, is an enchanted anatomy of the urge to defy gravity. Roger Rees and Alex Timbers direct (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Potted Potter' With no new Harry Potter adventures to pore over, what's a Muggle in need of a fix to do? One answer: this gloriously goofy parody by Daniel Clarkson and Jefferson Turner, which compresses a retelling of the seven books into 70 minutes, complete with a game of Quidditch. Clearly the two comics attended Professor Flitwick's charms class, because they cast the perfect spell over the audience: reductio ad absurdum (1:10). Little Shubert Theater, 422 West 42nd Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Daniel M. Gold)
&#x2605; 'rogerandtom' From a conventional start -- Penny waits in her apartment for Roger to arrive so they can go see the new play by their brother Tom -- Julien Schwab's witty absurdist comedy quickly gets surreal, with a subtle plot that twists and folds back on itself. Smartly using meta-theatrical devices like a broken ''fourth wall'' and benefiting from excellent performances, the play reminds us that acting doesn't only take place onstage (1:10). Here, 145 Avenue of the Americas, at Dominick Street, South Village, (212) 352-3101, here.org. (Gold)
'Shida' This one-woman musical, written and performed by Jeannette Bayardelle, is an earnest portrait of Shida, a young woman who survives sexual abuse and drugs to reach adulthood with newfound hope. The structure, though, racing from scene to scene and song to song, doesn't allow Shida to emerge as a distinct individual; she feels instead like a generic compilation (1:10). Ars Nova, 511 West 54th Street, Clinton, (866) 811-4111, shidathemusical.com. (Genzlinger)
'Storyville' This Ed Bullins and Mildred Kayden musical may begin with a funeral procession, but in this production, set in New Orleans in 1917, the mood is not mournful. The contrived plot concerns a boxer-trumpeter and a singer trying to escape the confinements of the Crescent City demimonde. But the show is really about atmosphere and music, which its costume and scenic designers and spirited cast generously deliver (2:15). Theater at St. Peter's Lutheran Church, 619 Lexington Avenue, at 54th Street, (212) 935-5820, yorktheatre.org. (Andy Webster)
Summer Shorts 2013 (Series A) The first set in this year's edition of short plays at 59E59 Theaters -- a tasty and astringent foray into show-business rivalry by Neil LaBute, an imagining of Sarah Palin's job interview with John McCain by Lucas Hnath, and a fairy tale satire by Tina Howe -- is consistently entertaining without dramatic histrionics or knee-slapping hilarity (1:45). 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212) 279-4200, ticketcentral.com. (Webster)
&#x2605; 'The Two-Character Play' Playing strung-out sibling theater troupers in Tennessee Williams's rarely seen fever dream of an eternal folie à deux, Amanda Plummer and Brad Dourif don't just strike sparks. They're a raging conflagration that keeps changing form and direction. Gene David Kirk directs this revival of a demented, messy and oddly affecting self-portrait from an American master (2:10). New World Stages, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
'The Unavoidable Disappearance of Tom Durnin' David Morse gives a precise, chilling performance as the title character, a mini-Madoff, in Steven Levenson's downbeat drama about a man trying to make amends for the damage his crime inflicted on his family (1:40). Laura Pels Theater, Harold and Miriam Steinberg Center for Theater, 111 West 46th Street, (212) 719-1300, roundaboutunderground.org. (Isherwood)
'Unbroken Circle' Eve Plumb, a k a Jan of ''The Brady Bunch,'' demonstrates a flair for grown-up comedy as a born-again Christian with drinking and divorce habits in James Wesley's comic drama. Too bad the production is uncertainly paced and a little unpolished, because this story of a 1970s Texas family dealing with the death of an abusive patriarch has a lot going for it (1:50).

&#x2605; 'Then She Fell' Inspired by Lewis Carroll's ''Alice'' books, this transporting immersive theater work occupies a dreamscape where the judgments and classifications of the waking mind are suspended.

'Wanda's Monster' Making Books Sing, which turns children's books into musicals, has adapted Eileen Spinelli's 2002 picture book about Wanda, a little girl who knows that a monster lives in her closet. Barbara Zinn Krieger, who wrote the script, has transformed Wanda's Granny -- the only adult who acknowledges the truth of Wanda's perception -- from a sensible soul into a kick-out-the-jams rocker. This characterization works beautifully with the show's upbeat score and lyrics by the children's pop star Laurie Berkner. This charming production brings home a point worth considering at any age: embrace what you fear, and you just may find a friend (1:00).

Last Chance
&#x2605; 'Choir Boy' (closes on Sunday) A supremely gifted cast of singing actors breathes vivid life into Tarell Alvin McCraney's appealing but diffuse play about a gay teenager, played with beaming intensity by Jeremy Pope, trying to come to terms with his sexuality at an all-black boys prep school (1:30). City Center Stage II, 131 West 55th Street, (212) 581-1212, nycitycenter.org. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'The Civil War' (closes next Friday) Presented by Theatreworks USA's free summer theater program, this earnest and absorbing musical for families illuminates history through period songs and the perspectives of a handful of well-chosen characters: a girl who disguises herself as a man to join the Confederate army; a struggling Irish immigrant and Union corporal; a plantation owner's son and his former best friend, who was also his father's slave. With a book by Arthur Perlman and musical arrangements and one new Broadway-style number by Jeff Lunden, the production is stronger in its intense, intimate moments than in its bids for comic relief. You sense the weight of the carnage in America's bloodiest war: the Union, fortunately, won, but everybody lost (1:15). Lucille Lortel Theater, 121 Christopher Street, West Village, twusa.org. (Laurel Graeber)
'The Nance' (closes on Sunday) Playing a gay burlesque performer whose onstage specialty is mincing effeminacy, Nathan Lane combines shiny expertise and dark conviction to sometimes devastating effect, in this strained if heartfelt play by Douglas Carter Beane. Not even Mr. Lane, though, can reconcile all the disparities the script asks him to weave together. Jack O'Brien is the estimable director (2:25). Lyceum Theater, 149 West 45th Street, (212) 239-6200, telecharge.com. (Brantley)
&#x2605; 'Nobody Loves You' (closes on Sunday) A perky new musical, by Itamar Moses and Gaby Alter, spoofing the seemingly spoof-proof world of reality television. Heath Calvert, as the gorgeous and dumb host, and Rory O'Malley, as a swooning fan boy Tweeting himself into a happy stupor as he watches, highlight the director Michelle Tattenbaum's terrific cast (1:30). Second Stage Theater, 305 West 43rd Street, Clinton, (212) 246-4422, 2st.com. (Isherwood)
&#x2605; 'Patti Issues' (closes on Thursday) In his funny, tender coming-of-age monologue, Ben Rimalower traces the obsessive Patti LuPone fandom that provided him with an empowering role model. That inspiration proved perhaps most useful to Mr. Rimalower in processing the fallout after his father kicked down the closet door and bailed on the family. While on one hand, this is the story of many young gay men's propensity for diva worship, the tartly observed show goes several steps further by exploring the wide-eyed experiences that result when the acolyte gets to interact with his idol (1:00).

HEADLINE: A Noisy Representative Seeks a Place in the Sun

BYLINE: By ROSS RAMSEY. 
rramsey@texastribune.org

 BODY:
Ross Ramsey, the executive editor of The Texas Tribune, writes a regular column for the Tribune.
The model for Jonathan Stickland isn't what you might expect.
The freshman state representative is a conservative Republican from Tarrant County and a thrower of political bombs -- usually from the podium toward the back of the House's center aisle from which members question legislative authors and presiding officers.
The questions can be political or substantive; they're always pointed. Members who want to know about policy implications of this or that go to the back mike. Members who want to call out the speaker, whether their intent is hostile or helpful, also go to the back mike. 
The last guy to have the unofficial post of reliably noisy House outsider was Representative Trey Martinez Fischer, Democrat of San Antonio. T.M.F., as he is known, had tried to prod the House with the only tools available to political minorities -- by not going along to get along, by making everyone focus on that crazy person who's messing up their business, by throwing sand in the gears. He has moved on to another role, quietly dealing with the speaker and other Republicans in the current governing coalition in the House.
On the other side, shut out on all but the most partisan things, is a small group of very conservative Republicans. The loud one? That's Mr. Jonathan Stickland.
As a freshman, Mr. Stickland didn't spend a lot of time at the back mike, but he did spend more time there than you would expect from a new member of the House. He was elected in 2012 and took the oath of office in January.
Among his allies and foes, he has made a name for himself and hopes to do the same outside the Capitol. He's part of the third-biggest faction in the House: the populist conservatives who are bucking the traditional ''moderate'' wing of the Republican Party of Texas, and who often find themselves on the losing end of votes.
In the 2011 legislative session, Republicans had a supermajority, outnumbering Democrats 102 to 48, and really had no reason to deal with them on most issues. The working coalition was contained within the Republican Party, with the traditional folks in one seat and the populists in the other. The Democrats were in the back seat.
The 2012 elections changed that. The Republican supermajority disappeared. This is still a Republican property: the House split was 95 to 55 during the regular session. But the traditional Republicans -- House Speaker Joe Straus of San Antonio is one -- found a different ruling coalition this year. During the regular session, it was the Democrats and the traditional Republicans working together, with the populists on the outs much of the time.
In 2011, with his team in the ditch, Mr. Martinez Fischer was the face of the opposition. His mere presence in line to use the back mike was enough to make House leaders grimace. He and other Democrats, assisted by a team of aides that included a couple of the Capitol's top experts in House rules, pestered the majority and slowed the machinery of the Legislature in a way that sometimes forced Republicans to accommodate their wishes.
That doesn't always work, and it doesn't usually last long when it does. In 2011, the Legislature cut billions from public education spending in the face of a tight, recession-induced budget. Legislators passed redistricting maps that attempted to institutionalize their supermajority. The opposition was fully engaged, if often flattened, by the Republicans.
The Democrats had some small but significant gains in last year's legislative elections, coming into the 2013 session with about the same number of Democrats and traditional Republicans in the House. Before Mark Strama of Austin resigned this summer, there were 55 Democrats in the House. Earlier this week, Representative Dan Branch, Republican of Dallas, presented a list of 53 Republicans who have endorsed his 2014 bid for attorney general.
Mr. Stickland is neither a Democrat nor an endorser of Mr. Branch's statewide campaign. He's just the guy at the back mike, clogging up the works when he can, and trying -- like Mr. Martinez Fischer and others before him -- to slow down legislation that isn't going his way in a House that seems inhospitable to some of his political ideas.
And he's hoping for an election year that will put him or one of his allies where Mr. Martinez Fischer was this year.

HEADLINE: Bank of Japan Stands Pat On Monetary Easing Plan

BYLINE: By AGENCE FRANCE-PRESSE

 BODY:
TOKYO -- The Bank of Japan on Thursday left its vast monetary easing program unchanged as it issued an upbeat assessment of Tokyo's efforts to counter growth-sapping deflation. 
In a widely expected move, the central bank said its board voted unanimously to stand pat after a two-day policy meeting, as investors keep a close eye on the Federal Reserve of the United States amid growing speculation that it will soon start tapering its large stimulus program.
The Bank of Japan, which unveiled its own gigantic bond-buying program in April, said the outlook for the country -- the world's third-biggest economy -- was looking brighter, while early signs of rising prices were good news for its efforts to hit a 2 percent inflation target within two years.
Many analysts have expressed doubts on the Bank of Japan's ambitious timeline, given that the country has been struggling with deflation for more than 15 years. The inflation target is a crucial part of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's plan, known as Abenomics.
''Japan's economy is starting to recover moderately,'' the Bank of Japan said on Thursday, pointing to better times ahead for important export markets. ''Overseas economies as a whole are gradually heading toward a pickup, although a lackluster performance is partly seen.''

HEADLINE: Commodity Imports Rise, Giving China Good News

BYLINE: By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's trade rebounded in July in a possible sign that its economy is stabilizing after a slowdown over the last year.
The improvement offers small but encouraging hope for China's leaders, who are struggling to arrest a downturn that dragged growth to a two-decade low in the latest quarter. 
China's exports rose 5.1 percent in July from a year earlier and imports were up 10.9 percent, according to customs data. China is the world's second-largest economy, after the United States.
Economists had expected trade to grow after it shrank in June, but the rate of growth surpassed expectations.
China's politically delicate global trade surplus narrowed to $17.8 billion.
Economists said the surge in imports suggested that domestic demand was holding up, a major goal for China's policy makers, who are trying to reduce the economy's dependence on trade and investment in favor of more self-sustaining domestic consumption.
Imports of iron ore, an important commodity used to make steel, surged 24 percent by volume, while copper imports grew 12 percent. Both figures were the fastest rates in more than a year, said Yao Wei, China economist at Société Générale.
She said the return to growth was a sign of ''some stabilization in external demand, at best -- not yet a solid recovery.''
Analysts said the figures were a sign of improvement but cautioned about reading too much into a single set of numbers.
''July seems to reflect a return to a normal, relatively uninspiring trend after a weak June, rather than the beginning of acceleration in growth,'' said Alistair Chan, an economist at Moody's Analytics. ''While the worst seems to be over, the upturn will be relatively flat.''
Chinese leaders are facing pressure to meet a goal of 7.5 percent growth for the year, which is far stronger than the forecasts for the United States, Europe and Japan, but would be the country's weakest performance since 1991.
Exports to the United States, China's biggest foreign market, edged up 2.3 percent, leaving a trade surplus of $19.1 billion. Exports to the 27-nation European Union shrank 2.8 percent, for a trade gap of $10 billion.

HEADLINE: A Woman Who Showed It All Yet Hid Everything

BYLINE: By MANOHLA DARGIS

 BODY:
''Lovelace,'' a movie about the chasm between public perception and private experience, pulls off a sly bait and switch. It's inspired by the autobiography of one Linda Boreman, who when she was young, permed and under the spell of a violent pimp earned her place in hard-core history by suppressing her gag reflex in the 1972 film ''Deep Throat.'' With its ''Boogie Nights'' typeface and mustachioed dudes as slick and artificial as their Qiana threads, ''Lovelace'' promises the down-and-dirty best (or worst) with a snigger and pulsating beats. It delivers just as promised only to do a 180 in order to tell another, uglier story, this one involving beatings, rape and 24/7 terror. 
In the contemporary pornotopia, when explicit sexual entertainments are a mouse click away, it can be difficult to appreciate the impact that ''Deep Throat'' had in the United States on its release. Released in June 1972 in a Times Square theater, this hourlong dirty movie became a sensation, a touchstone, a disgrace, providing ample fodder for snickering late-night talk shows and bloviating editorial writers alike. Norman Mailer weighed in as did Bob Hope, who's seen briefly in ''Lovelace'' joking that he thought it was about a giraffe. In The New York Review of Books, the feminist Ellen Willis said it best, finding the movie ''witless, exploitative and about as erotic as a tonsillectomy.'' Then as now, though, few seemed interested in the actual woman on screen.
The directors Rob Epstein and Jeffrey Friedman first pull the curtain back when Boreman (Amanda Seyfried, poignantly melancholic) was at the height of her porn career and known as Linda Lovelace, the It (or Ick) Girl for the sexual revolution. She's sitting and smoking in a bubble bath and, if you don't look at her too closely -- and, at the time, apparently few did -- you might miss the cuts and bruises. This is the Linda that the world didn't see and who, even as her body became a public spectacle, nursed her wounds in private. She was the queen of the dirty movies, but here, as this symbolic purification suggests, her life would soon receive a cleansing.
It does, in a way, though without the sanctimony other filmmakers might have brought to the story. Instead, Mr. Epstein and Mr. Friedman, whose credits, together and separately, include the documentary ''The Times of Harvey Milk'' and the fact-informed fiction ''Howl'' (about the times of Allen Ginsberg), have directed a movie that embraces the idea that history belongs both to those who live and those who write it, and that all histories, no matter how they cling to the facts, are necessarily incomplete, contingent, interpreted and shaped into stories. The philosopher Paul Ricoeur, who in his book ''Memory, History, Forgetting,'' put it beautifully:
Under history, memory and forgetting.
Under memory and forgetting, life.
But writing a life is another story.
Incompletion.
After that ritual bath, ''Lovelace'' gets its mojo going with a flashback to 1970, opening on a scene of Linda and her close and apparently only friend, Patsy (Juno Temple), sunbathing in the Boreman family's Florida backyard. When Patsy innocently unties Linda's bikini top, Linda demurs. Don't be such a prude, Patsy teases. In most other stories, this line as well as Linda's resistance might register as insignificant, but here it initiates a counter-narrative that runs quietly through the first half and rises to a roar in the second. Adding foreboding piquancy, as well as psychological clues, is a looming, oversize statue of the Virgin Mary and the weirdly twinned figure of Linda's rampaging, hectoring mother, Dorothy Boreman (Sharon Stone, simmering with dark hair and scowl).
Working from a script by Andy Bellin, Mr. Epstein and Mr. Friedman bring on the putative good times and vibes with narrative economy and period flair. (The real Boreman wrote several memoirs, including ''Ordeal.'') Structurally, the story they tell resembles an 18th-century tale of sexual liberation (like the Marquis de Sade's novel, ''Juliette'') that becomes a tale of exploitation (like Sade's ''Justine''), with Boreman's later marriage to Larry Marchiano, her children and anti-pornography activism little more than a coda. Mostly, it's girl meets pimp-husband (an excellent Peter Sarsgaard as Chuck Traynor), who ushers her into the world of sexual pleasure and pornography that becomes a hell. It's a story that, as the porn director Candida Royalle once said of ''Ordeal,'' has more to do with domestic abuse than pornography.
Boreman later characterized her appearance in ''Deep Throat'' as rape, yet she also wrote that it was ''at once a low point and a salvation.'' That's a difficult, complex idea, and there's a lot in this story about victimization and agency that Mr. Epstein and Mr. Friedman never satisfactorily address. It's perhaps inevitable that they seem happier when nothing yet feels at stake, including during the production of ''Deep Throat.'' (The excellent troika of Hank Azaria, Chris Noth and Bobby Cannavale enliven the proceedings.) Once the movie flips to present Linda's take on the same events, it grows grim and then grimmer, which may do justice to her story even as it fails to illuminate the woman who was Linda Boreman -- a k a Linda Traynor a k a Linda Marchiano -- a k a Linda Lovelace.
''Lovelace'' is rated R (Under 17 requires accompanying parent or adult guardian). Rape and other violence.

HEADLINE: More On The Disappearance Of Milton Friedman

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: It&#8217;s the things he got right that conservatives can&#8217;t accept. 

 BODY:
It seems that many people misunderstood my post on Milton Friedman. It was not intended as Friedman-bashing, as a claim that MF was a bad economist; in fact, I'm on record declaring Friedman a "great economists' economist". His work aimed primarily at a professional audience - the permanent income theory of consumption, the case for flexible exchange rates, the natural rate (even if it does break down at low inflation), the optimum quantity of money - was often, maybe even usually, brilliant, and will live on. 
What isn't living on, however, is Friedman's role as a guiding light for conservative economic policy.
Think about Paul Ryan, who is, like it or not, the leading economic intellectual of the modern GOP. Ryan sometimes drops Friedman's name - but when he does, it's to cite Capitalism and Freedom, not A Monetary History of the United States. When it comes to monetary policy, Ryan has said that his views are based on fictional characters in Atlas Shrugged. No, really.
Or think about the economics rap video of Keynes versus Hayek everyone had fun with. Never mind that back in the 30s nobody except Hayek would have considered his views a serious rival to those of Keynes; the real shock should be, what happened to Friedman? 
Partly this disappearance reflects real problems with Friedman's analysis. His views on the omnipotence of monetary policy,let alone the adequacy of a simple quantity-of-money rule, haven't withstood the test of time. As far as stabilization policy is concerned, he was indeed, as Brad DeLong archly puts it, a minor post-Hicksian.
But the bigger issue, I'd argue, is that modern conservatives can't accept the things Friedman was right about. Take, in particular, his essay on flexible exchange rates, in which he argued that a country that finds its wages and prices out of line should devalue its currency rather than rely on unemployment to push wages down, "until the deflation has run its sorry course." Contrast this with Ryan's declaration that "There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens than debase its currency."
The point is that Friedman was, when all is said and done, a pragmatist; he leaned right ideologically, but was willing to make room for awkward realities. And these days reality has a well-known liberal bias. Hence, Friedman has become an unperson.

HEADLINE: U.S. Said to Plan to Arrest Pair in Big Bank Loss

BYLINE: BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: Government authorities plan to arrest two former employees suspected of masking the size of a multibillion-dollar trading loss. 

 BODY:
Updated, 9:30 p.m. | Government authorities are planning to arrest two former JPMorgan Chase employees suspected of masking the size of a multibillion-dollar trading loss, a dramatic turn in a case that tarnished the reputation of the nation's biggest bank and spotlighted the perils of Wall Street risk-taking.
The former employees, who worked in London, could be arrested in the coming days, according to people briefed on the matter. The action, the people said, would involve criminal fraud charges.
The employees - Javier Martin-Artajo, a manager who oversaw the trading strategy, and Julien Grout, a low-level trader in London - could ultimately be extradited under an agreement with British authorities. Yet the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that it is unclear whether British authorities will be able to locate the men, who are natives of other European countries. 
Representatives for the F.B.I. and the United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment, as did a spokesman for JPMorgan. A lawyer for Mr. Martin-Artajo did not respond to an e-mail. A lawyer for Mr. Grout could not be located.
The plan to arrest the traders hints at an aggressive new stance from the government, which has come under fire for prosecuting only a few Wall Street employees tied to the 2008 financial crisis. Taking aim at employees of a Wall Street giant like JPMorgan, even when they fall below the executive ranks, could send a warning shot across the financial industry.
The losses at the heart of the JPMorgan case stemmed from outsize wagers made by the traders at the bank's chief investment office in London. The traders used derivatives - complex financial contracts whose value is typically tied to an asset like corporate bonds - to bet on the health of large corporations like American Airlines.
Those trades soured last year, racking up steep losses for the bank. JPMorgan, which initially disclosed the problem last May, has since announced that the losses reached more than $6 billion.
After more than a year of gathering evidence about the losses, federal prosecutors and the F.B.I. in Manhattan have concluded that the two employees understated the value of their trades to hide the problem from executives in New York. Studying internal e-mails and phone recordings that shine a light on how the employees valued the trades, authorities came to believe that Mr. Martin-Artajo directed Mr. Grout to falsify internal records.
Those actions, JPMorgan told authorities, caused the bank to lowball the losses. Last July, the bank restated its first-quarter 2012 earnings downward by $459 million, conceding errors in the valuations.
The charges hinge on the cooperation of another JPMorgan trader, Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because of his role in the unusually large bet. Despite initially personifying the trade - the blowup is referred to colloquially as "the London Whale" - some investigators concluded that he was unfairly blamed.
After giving multiple interviews to authorities, first at a meeting in Brussels and then New York, Mr. Iksil secured a cooperation agreement from the government. It is unclear, however, whether he will face separate charges.
While authorities are not pursuing charges against JPMorgan's top executives, according to the people briefed on the matter, the bank is nonetheless bracing for civil charges from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected to cite the bank for lax controls that allowed the traders to undervalue the bets, could strike a settlement with the bank as soon as this fall.
The Financial Conduct Authority, a British regulator, also plans to fine the bank in the coming months, one person said.
In an unusually aggressive move, the S.E.C. is seeking to extract an admission of wrongdoing from the nation's biggest bank. If JPMorgan concedes to that demand, such an admission would reverse a longtime practice at the S.E.C., which has allowed defendants for decades to "neither admit nor deny wrongdoing." The people briefed on the case added that the agency had not threatened to file civil charges against JPMorgan executives.
As the criminal case progresses, the government could face challenges in the courtroom. For one, Wall Street cases are unusually difficult to prove to jurors who must grapple with financial jargon.
That hurdle is particularly high in this case, which centers on the vagaries of rules that even seasoned Wall Street employees struggle to interpret. Under the rules, traders are granted some leeway to value their trades on derivatives contracts because actual prices may not be readily available, presenting a challenge to prosecutors who must prove that employees intentionally cloaked losses.
Even though JPMorgan itself is not the target of criminal scrutiny, the case casts an unwelcome spotlight on the bank. The case could highlight the way the traders breached the bank's own risk limits to make their bets - suggesting that JPMorgan, once hailed for its risk management, had porous controls.
The case also comes at a time when JPMorgan, which recently reported record quarterly profits, is already grappling with an array of regulatory woes. The bank faces inquiries from at least eight federal agencies, a state regulator and two European nations. Adding to its headaches over the trading losses, authorities are investigating the bank in connection with its financial crisis-era mortgage business. The bank, for example, recently disclosed that federal prosecutors in California are investigating whether it sold troubled mortgage securities to investors before the crisis. Regulators are also examining flaws in the bank's debt collection practices.
The investigation into the trading losses stems from early 2012. As their bet worsened, JPMorgan has said, the traders started to underestimate the losses.
Since announcing the losses, the bank has overhauled its controls and ousted the employees involved in the bet. The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has apologized for the breakdown.
The bank also commissioned an internal investigation into the trades, ultimately turning over its findings to federal authorities and a Senate subcommittee examining the losses.
An ensuing subcommittee report concluded that Mr. Martin-Artajo's team of traders stopped recording the value of their bet in a "middle range," shifting to some of the most generous possible figures.
In one recorded phone call referred to in the report, the London Whale, Mr. Iksil, told a colleague that the bank's estimated losses were "getting idiotic." Mr. Iksil added that "I can't keep this going" and that he did not know where his boss in London "wants to stop."
Reflecting concerns about the estimates, Mr. Grout kept a spreadsheet that tracked the difference between his valuations and the midpoint. The documents, according to the subcommittee's report, showed that his valuations underestimated the losses by more than $400 million.
Mr. Grout, the subcommittee said, told Mr. Iksil in a recorded conversation, "I am not marking at mids as per a previous conversation."

HEADLINE: The Economics of a Higher Wage Floor

BYLINE: JARED BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Arguments that raising the minimum wage will force layoffs and automation, or that the earned-income tax credit alone is enough to help low-wage workers, do not pass muster, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
There have been a number of recent articles and commentaries about daylong strikes by fast-food workers demanding higher wages. That has brought out the usual arguments about why we should or shouldn't increase the legal wage floor, which these days comes in various flavors. There's the national minimum wage, which President Obama would like to increase to $9 an hour, there are 18 states (and the District of Columbia) with their own minimums above the federal, and there are many cities with living-wage ordinances, which typically mandate a higher wage floor to workers in a particular sector.
The strikers themselves have articulated why they need higher pay. Many are single parents or second earners from low-income households working in an industry where the median wage is about $9 an hour (and they're not kids; 73 percent of low-wage restaurant workers are at least 20 years old). In speeches over the last few weeks, the president has argued for a higher minimum as a weapon against working poverty. 
These ideas typically poll very well. In a Gallup poll in March, 71 percent said the minimum should go up to $9; even 54 percent of conservatives agreed. A recent study of economists, a group congenitally much less predisposed to price mandates (with the wage being the price of labor), also revealed that many were pretty much O.K. with the president's proposal. Less than half agreed that it would hurt low-skilled workers' employment prospects (none "strongly agreed" with that possibility), and among those who professed high confidence in their responses, 62 percent agreed that the benefits of such an increase outweighed its costs.
So, why not just raise the wage floor, right? 
Opposition exists, of course, particularly from those whose profits take a hit when their labor costs go up. In fact, while running the other day, I listened to a radio program on which a representative from a think tank with ties to the restaurant lobby trotted out the usual arguments (isn't that what you listen to when you run?).
-If you raise workers' wages, they'll just be replaced by machines. I think of this as the "third-world wage" strategy: let's keep wages low enough so that employers won't invest in labor-saving technology. It's a destructive, low-road idea that's wholly inconsistent with the history of our economy and the people in it, as we've consistently benefited from capital deepening.
Moreover, there's no correlation in the data between periods of high productivity and a shrinking share of low-wage jobs. The fact is, we'll have people working in fast food and retail in good times and bad, in periods of high innovation and otherwise. The question is what the quality of their jobs will be.
-They don't need higher wages; we've got the E.I.T.C. The earned-income tax credit is an important pro-work wage subsidy that's actively lifting the living standards of low-wage workers from low-income families. Since its receipt is linked to income, it's very well aimed at low-income working families. And it adds, on average, about $3,000 to the earnings of low-income workers with children.
But here's the thing. It is not enough to cite the existence of the tax credit as a rationale for not increasing the minimum wage. Those of us calling for an increase in the minimum recognize that the credit is a great complement to the wage floor. But working families need more to get ahead, not just what they have now. So if minimum wage opponents want to bring up the earned-income tax credit, they have to argue for increasing it, and that's an argument I do not hear them make (they also need to oppose efforts to reduce it).
One other point here. I chose the word "complement" above for a reason, one that I think is very important. The earned-income tax credit is great, but let's be clear: it's income redistribution through the tax code. If opponents of raising the minimum wage believe that we can prevent low-wage workers from falling behind on the back of the tax credit alone, they must realize that they're talking about increasing the credit every few years. That's not going to happen, and ultimately, it would imply a large and growing subsidy from taxpayers to low-wage employers. It takes two hands to lift the burden of low pay: the minimum wage and the earned-income tax credit (actually, it takes a lot more hands than that; other work supports, like help with child care, health care, transportation and housing also matter).
-A higher wage floor will hurt its intended beneficiaries, because it forces employers to lay them off. Ah, that old saw. Even most economists don't believe that anymore. Remember way back at the beginning when I told you about all those different states and cities that have their own wage floors above the federal level? Well, that variation has provided something rare in economics: an opportunity for pseudo-experimental tests of the disemployment theory (i.e., we can compare employment outcomes in states with similar economies and different minimum wages). And while there's lots of arguing among economists about the best way to run such tests (surprise!), their results almost all hover around zero.
That's not to say every study finds no effect. Some find positive, some negative. But the reason you get that economists' result cited above about the benefits' outweighing the costs is that these studies overwhelmingly find that on net, raising the minimum wage lifts the earnings and the incomes of a vast majority of affected workers (the economist John Schmitt provides an excellent review of the literature; see his Figure 1 for the "hovering around zero" effect).
Why don't they lose their jobs? In part, because some of the cost of the higher wage comes out of profits, which, as noted, explains the "who and why" of the people fighting the hardest against this idea.
There is this, however: across all of these studies, our experience with higher minimum wages is that the increases don't reach far beyond the low end of the low-wage sector, and thus don't significantly affect employment. Typically, the "affected range" - the share of the work force affected by the increase - amounts to no more than 10 percent of the work force, which is about what you'd get if you phased in an increase in the $9-to-$10 range. To go much higher would take us beyond what we've learned from the research.
So, fear not an increase in the minimum wage. In fact, it's one of the few things we can do that would help a lot of people who are struggling to stay afloat, if not get ahead, and would not increase government spending. I challenge you to come up with a better idea that meets those two criteria.

HEADLINE: Unemployed? No Food Stamps for You

BYLINE: DAVID FIRESTONE


HIGHLIGHT: The House G.O.P. wants to remove up to 4 million people from the food stamp program by cutting off those unable to find a job. 

 BODY:
Earlier this year, Eric Cantor, the House majority leader, announced plansto rebrand the Republican Party, improving "health, happiness and prosperity for more Americans and their families." In case you took any of that seriously, take a good look at the food stamp proposal Mr. Cantor unveiled a few days ago, one of the more brutal actions Republicans have taken against the poor since they took over the House in 2011. 
In June, the Republican plan to cut food stamps by $2 billion a year led to the failure of the farm bill-because House conservatives wanted even bigger cuts. House leaders then revived the billto provide $196 billion to big agriculture, dropping the food stamp program entirely and promising to bring it back "later."

Later has arrived, andthe plan is worse than ever. Mr. Cantor wants to cut $4 billion a year, double the earlier cut, by removing up to 4 million people from the food stamp program. His method of kicking all those people off is particularly diabolical, considering the Republican refusal to stimulate the economy: he wants to punish those unable to find a job. Anyone who is unemployed and not raising children will be limited to three months of food stamps every three years.
This requirement has been on the books since 1996, but it was routinely waived by most states during and after the recession, as high unemployment caused widespread suffering. Mr. Cantor wants to eliminate those waivers, with no exceptions. Under Mr. Cantor's plan, it won't matter how hard people are looking for work, or how high unemployment might be in their state.
Mr. Cantor's plan would slash benefits for many of the poorest people in the United States, according to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. Their average annual income is $2,500; many are desperate for work but cannot find any. Joblessness may have been reduced in the last two years but it is still far too high, particularly among those with the least skills.
"As a result of the proposed cuts, many of these individuals would fall deeper into destitution,"according to an analysis by the center issued on Wednesday. "Some would likely experience hunger as well as homelessness; money spent on food isn't available to pay the rent, and with income this low, it can be very difficult to do both."
As David Rogers explained in Politico this morning, the 1996 proposal to take away food stamps from the jobless assumed that most states would offer workfare programs in exchange for the benefits. But Washington never provided enough money to allow states to create those programs. Only five states offered workfare or job training programs last year.
The House Republicans' pointless and heartless demands for more austerity are holding back economic growth. Now they want to strip government relief for those who are left behind.

HEADLINE: Killing Lions, Buying Bombs

BYLINE: By JOHAN BERGENAS, RACHEL STOHL and OCHIENG ADALA. 
Johan Bergenas is the deputy director of the Managing Across Boundaries initiative at the Stimson Center. Rachel Stohl is a senior associate with the initiative. Ochieng Adala, the acting executive director of the Africa Peace Forum and a visiting fellow at the Stimson Center, is a former Kenyan ambassador to the United Nations.

 BODY:
PRESIDENT OBAMA and former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton recently stepped up the fight against poachers, who kill tens of thousands of animals worldwide every year, selling their body parts for enormous profits. As well as bringing much needed political focus to the issue, their efforts include more resources to train and equip anti-poaching forces.
This attention is part of a new understanding that poachers pose a threat not only to endangered species, but to American national security. A portion of the profits from poaching is funneled to terrorist groups, including Al Shabab, based in Somalia, and the Lord's Resistance Army, which has killed more than 3,000 people and displaced another 400,000 in Central Africa in recent years. 
Despite anti-poaching efforts across the developing world, the illegal killing of wild animals continues: the Wildlife Conservation Society says that 35,000 African elephants were killed illegally last year, and that the number of elephants on the continent has fallen to only 420,000, from 1.2 million in 1980.
Although it is impossible to know for sure how much money flows to terrorists from poaching, some reports suggest that the monthly profit for Al Shabab from the illegal ivory trade alone is $200,000 to $600,000. In the case of the Lord's Resistance Army, witnesses report that Joseph Kony, the group's leader, ordered the shooting of elephants in order to trade their tusks for arms, cash, food and medical supplies.
The poaching-terrorist link is not new: in 1998 a Somali warlord tied to poachers reportedly provided safe haven to operatives of Al Qaeda responsible for the bombings of the American Embassies in Kenya and Tanzania, which killed hundreds of people. But as both the global reach of terrorist groups and the market for illegal animal parts have grown, the nexus between the two has tightened.
Before stepping down as secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton began an effort, led by the director of national intelligence, to determine the impact of trafficking in animal products on American security.
The results of the report, which was finished this summer, have not been released. But its conclusions are easy to guess, as shortly after its completion President Obama created an interagency task force to develop an anti-poaching strategy and pledged $10 million to help African states combat poaching.
That's a welcome contribution, but far below what is needed. To be sure, poaching is a complex, transnational threat, and cracking down on poaching is simply too big a job for the United States, or any government, to handle alone.
It is therefore noteworthy that Mrs. Clinton has continued to generate awareness of the issue since leaving office. On July 15 she announced she would use her influence to rally support from national leaders around the world behind anti-poaching endeavors. Her effort should catalyze other states to step up their own efforts against poaching and wildlife trafficking in Africa.
But the best shot at combating poaching must include nontraditional partners working together. This means that governments, multilateral organizations and technology innovators -- from the Pentagon and United Nations counterterrorism units to the World Bank and conservation groups -- must play a part in addressing the problem by coordinating strategies and sharing information.
A collaborative response is also needed to achieve development goals in Africa. Tourism is a key part of many African economies, and diminished wildlife populations, especially of popular animals like elephants and rhinos, is a direct threat to their prosperity.
Another key to any anti-poaching strategy should be to equip law enforcement and other authorities with the technology necessary to counter high-tech poachers, who use helicopters, night-vision goggles and automatic weapons. The United States, for example, should work with African governments to deploy unarmed surveillance drones to track poachers and identify their illicit networks.
President Obama's and Mrs. Clinton's engagement on poaching deserves credit. But to ensure the link between poaching and terrorism is severely disrupted, their words need to be followed by a serious commitment of money and resources, not only from the United States, but from conservation, development and security organizations worldwide.

HEADLINE: Journalists in Syria Face Dangers of War and Rising Risk of Abduction

BYLINE: By RICK GLADSTONE

 BODY:
Abductions of journalists inside Syria have increased sharply this year as the ravages of the conflict have worsened and the insurgency has turned more jihadist and chaotic, making the country one of the most hostile conflict zones for news gatherers in recent memory, according to news media advocacy organizations, rights workers and veteran correspondents.
Some appear to have been carried out by armed insurgent extremist groups and criminal networks seeking ransom in cash, weapons or both. But others have no declared motive. 
Foreign journalists are particular targets, mostly Europeans who have ventured into Syria, usually without the permission of the Syrian government, to cover a conflict now well into its third year. Syrian journalists have been taken, too, as have Syrians working with foreign news organizations.
Foreign reporters were initially welcomed by many insurgents and Syrian civilians, taken for advocates who could publicize grievances against President Bashar al-Assad. Now they are sometimes viewed as interlopers who have no stake in the outcome of the conflict, which has left more than 100,000 people dead.
Spreading economic desperation in Syria has increased the possibility of betrayal, extortion and abduction, according to news media advocacy and rights groups. Some translators, drivers and local guides have reported that criminal groups or jihadists have tried to recruit them to lure journalists into Syria with promises of scoops.
''There have been more abductions and there have been nastier abductions,'' said Donatella Rovera, a senior investigator for Amnesty International who has spent long periods traveling in Syria to document rights abuses in the conflict. ''There is no denying that the fragmentation of armed groups, and the increased visibility of radical groups, have coincided with an increase in abductions,'' she said. ''It's fair to assume there is a relationship there.''
The Committee to Protect Journalists, a New York-based advocacy group, has reported at least 14 cases of local and international journalists who are missing or have been abducted this year. Reporters Without Borders, based in Paris, has recorded 15 cases of foreign journalists who are missing or have been abducted or arrested. But the total number of abductions is believed to be significantly higher because many cases have not been publicly disclosed, usually at the request of the victims' families, partly for fear of angering the kidnappers or emboldening them to demand higher ransom payments.
Even at the reported numbers, the pace of abductions of foreign journalists appears on a trajectory to surpass the 25 cases in Iraq in 2007, at the height of the conflict there.
''We see more journalists not abducted by the government, but by independent militias who are going after money, and this is worrying,'' said Sherif Mansour, the Middle East and North Africa program coordinator for the Committee to Protect Journalists. The trend toward cash ransom, he said, started in late 2012, ''but we can see from the targeting that basically they're going after nationalities that are going to pay.''
Jonathan Alpeyrie, a French-American photojournalist for the Polaris agency, was abducted by Islamist fighters near Damascus on April 29 and released nearly three months later. He said a $450,000 ransom had been paid on his behalf.
''The rebels are so desperate they don't care about their reputation abroad,'' he said in an interview published on Wednesday by the Paris-based Journal de la Photographie. ''They see guys like us as an opportunity.''
Ricardo Garcia Vilanova, a photojournalist and cameraman who has spent more than 13 months in Syria over multiple trips since the conflict began in 2011, said he had sensed a new mistrust toward the foreign news media on his most recent visit. He said many Syrians who opposed Mr. Assad resented the Western military reluctance to intervene.
The list of cases in the past few months includes both Syrian and foreign journalists. On July 25, three Syrian employees of Orient TV, an opposition television channel, were abducted in the northern town of Tel Rifaat: Obeida Batal, Hosam Nizam al-Dine and Aboud al-Atik. On July 24, a Polish photojournalist, Marcin Suder, was taken in the northwestern province of Idlib. On June 6, two French journalists employed by the Europe 1 radio station, Didier François and Edouard Elias, disappeared near Aleppo. On April 24, a Belgian academic, Pierre Piccinin de Prata, who was reporting for the Brussels newspaper Le Soir, disappeared. On April 9, Domenico Quirico, an Italian journalist for the newspaper La Stampa, went missing near the western city of Homs.
Two Americans journalists were publicly acknowledged to be missing in the past year. Austin Tice, a freelancer who had written for The Washington Post, McClatchy newspapers and Al Jazeera's English-language channel, disappeared near Damascus almost one year ago. And James Foley, who had worked for GlobalPost, a Boston-based news Web site, disappeared Thanksgiving Day in Idlib.
In Mr. Foley's case, an initial decision was made to withhold news of his disappearance, said Phil Balboni, the chief executive and co-founder of GlobalPost, while it quietly investigated what might have happened. Six weeks later, after consultations with Mr. Foley's family, GlobalPost announced in a news article that he had been kidnapped by unidentified gunmen.
''We reached the point where we concluded that his likely abductors weren't going to harm him in any way if we went public,'' Mr. Balboni said. Based on information from what he described as credible sources, Mr. Balboni said he believed Mr. Foley had been abducted by pro-Assad militiamen and later turned over to the government in Damascus, despite official Syrian denials.
Peter N. Bouckaert, the emergencies director at Human Rights Watch, said overall abductions began to increase when fighting broke out last year in Aleppo, the country's once-flourishing commercial hub.
The abductions have increased as the insurgency's reliance on jihadist groups, like the Nusra Front and the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, has grown. ''They try to kidnap wealthy Syrians and some journalists for ransom,'' Mr. Bouckaert said in an interview in June with Syria Deeply, an independent blog about the conflict. ''The kidnappers tend to know the wealth of their victims,'' he said.
Mr. Bouckaert said a second category of abduction, in which Sunnis and Shias kidnap each other in tit-for-tat hostilities, has also increased. Unexplained disappearances have proliferated as well, he said, ''where people are taken by unknown gunmen and never seen again,'' as in the case of two archbishops from Aleppo who vanished in April.
''In general, instability is on the rise in Syria, and these kidnappings are part of this instability,'' he said. ''Kidnappings are a part of the dangers that civilians in general face in this conflict.''

HEADLINE: 'A Town Without Pity'

BYLINE: By CHARLES M. BLOW. 
Joe Nocera is off today.

 BODY:
America was once the land of Lady Liberty, beckoning the world: ''Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free, the wretched refuse of your teeming shore. Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me. I lift my lamp beside the golden door!''
No more. 
Today's America -- at least as measured by the actions and inactions of the pariahs who roam its halls of power and the people who put them there -- is insular, cruel and uncaring.
In this America, people blame welfare for creating poverty rather than for mitigating the impact of it. An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll in June found that the No. 1 reason people gave for our continuing poverty crisis was: ''Too much welfare that prevents initiative.''
In this America, the House can -- as it did in July -- pass a farm bill that left out the food stamp program at a time when a record number of Americans, nearly 48 million, are depending on the benefits.
In this America, a land of immigrants, comprehensive immigration reform can be stalled in The People's Branch of government, and anti-reform mouthpieces like Ann Coulter and Pat Buchanan can warn that immigration reform will be the end of the country.
And in today's America, poverty and homelessness can easily seep beneath the wall we erect in our minds to define it.
A December report by the United States Conference of Mayors that surveyed 25 cities found that all but 4 of them reported an increase in requests for emergency food aid since 2011, and three-fourths of them expected those requests to increase in 2013.
The report also found that 60 percent of the cities surveyed had seen an increase in homelessness, and the same percentage of cities expected homelessness to increase in 2013.
But poverty isn't easily written off as an inner-city ailment. It has now become a suburban problem. A report this week by the Brookings Institution found that ''during the 2000s, major metropolitan suburbs became home to the largest and fastest-growing poor population in America.''
Nor can economic insecurity be written off as a minorities-only issue. According to survey results published last month by The Associated Press:
''Nonwhites still have a higher risk of being economically insecure, at 90 percent. But compared with the official poverty rate, some of the biggest jumps under the newer measure are among whites, with more than 76 percent enduring periods of joblessness, life on welfare or near-poverty.''
How did we come to such a pass? Why aren't more politicians -- and people in general -- expressing outrage and showing empathy?
Part of our current condition is obviously partisan. Republicans have become the party of ''blame the victim.'' Whatever your lesser lot in life, it's completely within your means to correct, according to their logic. Poverty, hunger, homelessness and desperation aren't violence to the spirit but motivation to the will. If you want more and you work harder, all your problems will disappear. Sink or swim. Pull yourself up. Get over it. Of course, that narrow conservative doctrine denies a broader reality: that there are working poor and chronically unemployed -- people who do want and who do work and who do want to work, but who remain stuck on the lowest rungs of the economic ladder.
In this regard, Republicans have all but abandoned the idea of compassionate conservatism and are diving headlong into callous conservatism.
But another problem may be more broad-based: the way that many Americans look at the poor with disgust.
As Susan Fiske, a Princeton professor who has studied people's attitudes toward the poor for more than a decade, told me on Friday:
''The stereotypes of poor people in the United States are among the most negative prejudices that we have. And people basically view particularly homeless people as having no redeeming qualities -- there's not the competence for anything, not having good intentions and not being trustworthy.''
Fiske's research shows that people respond not only to the poor and homeless with revulsion, but they also react negatively to people they perceive as undocumented immigrants -- essentially anyone without an address.
If some people's impulse is to turn up a nose rather than extend a hand, no wonder we send so many lawmakers empty of empathy to Congress. No wonder more people don't demand that Congress stand up for the least among us rather than on them.
As Fiske so aptly put it: ''It seems like Washington is a place without pity right now. A town without pity.''

HEADLINE: U.S. Companies Thrive As Workers Fall Behind

BYLINE: By FLOYD NORRIS. 
Floyd Norris comments on finance and the economy at nytimes.com/economix.

 BODY:
AMERICAN companies are more profitable than ever -- and more profitable than we thought they were before the government revised the national income accounts last week. Wage earners are making less than we thought, in part because the government now thinks it was overestimating the amount of income not reported by taxpayers.
The major change in the latest comprehensive revision of the national income and product accounts -- known as NIPA to statistics aficionados -- is to treat research and development spending as an investment, similar to the way the purchase of a new machine tool would be treated by a manufacturer, rather than as an expense. That investment is then written down over a number of years. 
The result is to make the size of the economy, the gross domestic product, look bigger, and to appear to be growing faster, in years when new research spending is greater than the amount being written down from previous years. For the same reason, corporate profits also look better in those years.
A lot of money is spent on research and development. Nicole Mayerhauser, the chief of the national income and wealth division of the Bureau of Economic Analysis, which compiles the figures, said that in 2012 the total was $418 billion, about one-third of which was spent by governments. That amounted to about 2.6 percent of G.D.P.
The other major conceptual change deals with pensions. Until now, corporate and government contributions to pension plans were counted as personal income only when the contributions were made. Under the revision, the government estimates how much should have been contributed to meet the promises made to workers, and counts that amount, whether it is higher or lower than the amount actually put into the pension plan. That causes personal income to appear larger in years when pension contributions are lower than they should be.
The revised numbers also reflect some better information as new data becomes available. Ms. Mayerhauser said that it now appeared that in recent years the government might have overestimated the amount of income that went unreported by taxpayers, including the amounts of unreported tips received by restaurant employees. Revising those figures down meant that workers as a group appeared to be doing even worse than they had appeared to be doing.
And that was none too well. Before the figures were revised, it appeared that wages and salary income in 2012 amounted to 44 percent of G.D.P., the lowest at any time since 1929, which is as far back as the data goes.
But the revisions cut that to 42.6 percent, which matched the revised 2010 figure as the lowest ever.
The flip side of that is that corporate profits after taxes amounted to a record 9.7 percent of G.D.P. Each of the last three years has been higher than the earlier record high, of 9.1 percent, which was set in 1929.
The charts help to demonstrate how the postrecession economy differs from the one before the downturn. In the three years from 2005 through 2007, the share of G.D.P. going to corporate profits was 1.5 percentage points lower than it was during the years 2010 through 2012. The share going to workers was 1.1 percentage points higher during the earlier years.
Corporate taxes, as a proportion of corporate profits, rose to a four-year high of 21.6 percent in 2012, but remained well below the long-term average level. Personal taxes also hit a four-year high, at 14.1 percent of personal income, but were still well below the historical average.

HEADLINE: U.S. Said to Plan To Arrest Pair In Big Bank Loss

BYLINE: By BEN PROTESS and JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG; Mark Scott contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Updated, 9:30 p.m. | Government authorities are planning to arrest two former JPMorgan Chase employees suspected of masking the size of a multibillion-dollar trading loss, a dramatic turn in a case that tarnished the reputation of the nation's biggest bank and spotlighted the perils of Wall Street risk-taking.
The former employees, who worked in London, could be arrested in the coming days, according to people briefed on the matter. The action, the people said, would involve criminal fraud charges.
The employees -- Javier Martin-Artajo, a manager who oversaw the trading strategy, and Julien Grout, a low-level trader in London -- could ultimately be extradited under an agreement with British authorities. Yet the people briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, cautioned that it is unclear whether British authorities will be able to locate the men, who are natives of other European countries. 
Representatives for the F.B.I. and the United States attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment, as did a spokesman for JPMorgan. A lawyer for Mr. Martin-Artajo did not respond to an e-mail. A lawyer for Mr. Grout could not be located.
The plan to arrest the traders hints at an aggressive new stance from the government, which has come under fire for prosecuting only a few Wall Street employees tied to the 2008 financial crisis. Taking aim at employees of a Wall Street giant like JPMorgan, even when they fall below the executive ranks, could send a warning shot across the financial industry.
The losses at the heart of the JPMorgan case stemmed from outsize wagers made by the traders at the bank's chief investment office in London. The traders used derivatives -- complex financial contracts whose value is typically tied to an asset like corporate bonds -- to bet on the health of large corporations like American Airlines.
Those trades soured last year, racking up steep losses for the bank. JPMorgan, which initially disclosed the problem last May, has since announced that the losses reached more than $6 billion.
After more than a year of gathering evidence about the losses, federal prosecutors and the F.B.I. in Manhattan have concluded that the two employees understated the value of their trades to hide the problem from executives in New York. Poring over internal e-mails and phone recordings that shine a light on how the employees valued the trades, authorities came to believe that Mr. Martin-Artajo directed Mr. Grout to falsify internal records.
Those actions, JPMorgan told authorities, caused the bank to lowball the losses. Last July, the bank restated its first-quarter 2012 earnings downward by $459 million, conceding errors in the valuations.
The charges hinge on the cooperation of another JPMorgan trader, Bruno Iksil, nicknamed the London Whale because of his role in the unusually large bet. Despite initially personifying the trade -- the blowup is referred to colloquially as ''the London Whale'' -- some investigators concluded that he was unfairly blamed.
After giving multiple interviews to authorities, first at a meeting in Brussels and then New York, Mr. Iksil secured a cooperation agreement from the government. It is unclear, however, whether he will face separate charges.
While authorities are not pursuing charges against JPMorgan's top executives, according to the people briefed on the matter, the bank is nonetheless bracing for civil charges from regulators. The Securities and Exchange Commission, which is expected to cite the bank for lax controls that allowed the traders to undervalue the bets, could strike a settlement with the bank as soon as this fall.
The Financial Conduct Authority, a British regulator, also plans to fine the bank in the coming months, one person said.
In an unusually aggressive move, the S.E.C. is seeking to extract an admission of wrongdoing from the nation's biggest bank. If JPMorgan concedes to that demand, such an admission would reverse a longtime practice at the S.E.C., which has allowed defendants for decades to ''neither admit nor deny wrongdoing.'' The people briefed on the case added that the agency had not threatened to file civil charges against JPMorgan executives.
As the criminal case progresses, the government could face challenges in the courtroom. For one, Wall Street cases are unusually difficult to prove to jurors who must grapple with financial jargon.
That hurdle is particularly high in this case, which centers on the vagaries of rules that even seasoned Wall Street employees struggle to interpret. Under the rules, traders are granted some leeway to value their trades on derivatives contracts because actual prices may not be readily available, presenting a challenge to prosecutors who must prove that employees intentionally cloaked losses.
Even though JPMorgan itself is not the target of criminal scrutiny, the case casts an unwelcome spotlight on the bank. The case could highlight the way the traders breached the bank's own risk limits to make their bets -- suggesting that JPMorgan, once hailed for its risk management, had porous controls.
The case also comes at a time when JPMorgan, which recently reported record quarterly profits, is already grappling with an array of regulatory woes. The bank faces inquiries from at least eight federal agencies, a state regulator and two European nations. Adding to its headaches over the trading losses, authorities are investigating the bank in connection with its financial crisis-era mortgage business. The bank, for example, recently disclosed that federal prosecutors in California are investigating whether it sold troubled mortgage securities to investors before the crisis. Regulators are also examining flaws in the bank's debt collection practices.
The investigation into the trading losses stems from early 2012. As their bet worsened, JPMorgan has said, the traders started to underestimate the losses.
Since announcing the losses, the bank has overhauled its controls and ousted the employees involved in the bet. The bank's chief executive, Jamie Dimon, has apologized for the breakdown.
The bank also commissioned an internal investigation into the trades, ultimately turning over its findings to federal authorities and a Senate subcommittee examining the losses.
An ensuing subcommittee report concluded that Mr. Martin-Artajo's team of traders stopped recording the value of their bet in a ''middle range,'' shifting to some of the most generous possible figures.
In one recorded phone call referred to in the report, the London Whale, Mr. Iksil, told a colleague that the bank's estimated losses were ''getting idiotic.'' Mr. Iksil added that ''I can't keep this going'' and that he did not know where his boss in London ''wants to stop.''
Reflecting concerns about the estimates, Mr. Grout kept a spreadsheet that tracked the difference between his valuations and the midpoint. The documents, according to the subcommittee's report, showed that his valuations underestimated the losses by more than $400 million.
Mr. Grout, the subcommittee said, told Mr. Iksil in a recorded conversation, ''I am not marking at mids as per a previous conversation.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Economists Lower Sights On Growth

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- Wholesale inventories in the United States fell unexpectedly for a second straight month in June, prompting economists to trim their second-quarter economic growth estimates.
The Commerce Department said on Friday that wholesale inventories fell 0.2 percent after declining 0.6 percent in May. 
This was weaker than the government had assumed in its advance estimate of the second-quarter gross domestic product published last week, which put growth at a 1.7 percent annual pace.
Inventories are a crucial component of G.D.P. changes. As a result of the unexpected decline in stocks at wholesalers in June, economists pared their estimates for second-quarter G.D.P. growth by one-tenth of a percentage point.
They had raised their estimates to as high as a 2.5 percent pace after manufacturing inventories in June came in slightly higher and the United States trade deficit narrowed more than the government had estimated in its first G.D.P. reading.
Jim O'Sullivan, chief United States economist at High Frequency Economics in Valhalla, N.Y., said the June wholesale data ''subtract a little from the likely upward revision to second-quarter real G.D.P. growth.''
Barclays lowered its second-quarter G.D.P. estimate to a 2.4 percent pace from 2.5 percent. JPMorgan now expects growth will be revised to a 2.2 percent rate instead of 2.3 percent.
Wholesale inventories in June were pulled down by auto stocks, which tumbled 1.5 percent, the most since December. Stocks of electrical goods, hardware, paper, metals and apparel also fell.
''This softer inventory accumulation in the second quarter is modestly favorable for third quarter growth,'' said Daniel Silver, an economist at JPMorgan in New York.
Sales at wholesalers rose 0.4 percent in June after increasing 1.5 percent in May. The rise in June was below economists' expectations for a 0.7 percent gain.

HEADLINE: Pollution Economics

BYLINE: By DIRK FORRISTER and PAUL BLEDSOE. 
Dirk Forrister is president and chief executive officer of the International Emissions Trading Association. Paul Bledsoe is a senior fellow in the energy and climate program at the German Marshall Fund of the United States.

 BODY:
WITH more than a million people in China dying prematurely each year from breathing its dirty air, and with warming temperatures portending rising sea levels and disruptions to food production, the centrally planned Communist country is experimenting with a capitalist approach to address the problem: it is creating incentives so that the market -- and not the government -- will force reductions in emissions.
The United States invented this approach in the 1990s to deal with acid rain. The effort was tremendously successful in reducing sulfur dioxide emissions that were poisoning lakes and streams, contaminating soils and accelerating the decay of buildings, at a cost lower than even its advocates anticipated. 
But the United States has taken a policy detour that has hurt its efforts to reduce greenhouse gases. Congress has spurned the cap-and-trade approach China is trying, even though it is widely recognized as a cheaper way to lower emissions. As a result, President Obama has had little choice but to turn to government regulation to reduce these pollutants. Consumers will pay a higher price for electricity as a consequence.
China, the world's largest emitter of carbon dioxide, has begun its effort in the southern city of Shenzhen, paving the way for a national Chinese market in a few years. Like Europe, which voted to extend and improve its emissions market, and Australia and New Zealand, Shenzhen chose a carbon market as the most efficient way to lower its greenhouse gas emissions.
Under the Shenzhen program, the government will set limits on carbon dioxide discharges for 635 industrial companies and 197 public buildings that together account for about 40 percent of the city's emissions. Polluters whose emissions fall below the limit can sell the difference in the form of pollution allowances to other polluters. These companies must decide whether it is cheaper to reduce emissions or pollute above their limit by buying allowances, whose price will be set by supply and demand. But the pressure will be on, because the limits will decrease over time. Six more regional pilot programs are planned over the next year.
More than 20 percent of global greenhouse gas emissions are now subject to carbon pricing systems. About 60 other states, provinces or countries are considering similar approaches, according to a recent World Bank report.
Carbon cap-and-trade programs align environmental goals with market incentives. Conventional regulatory approaches ''cannot ensure achievement of emissions targets, create problematic unintended consequences, and are very costly for what they achieve,'' says the economist Robert N. Stavins, director of the Harvard Environmental Economics Program.
So how did America detour away from emissions markets, which are the preferred approach of many economists, climate and consumer advocates, and many electric utility companies that own and operate power plants?
It all comes down to politics. Before the last recession, political support was building for a carbon market, with various Republicans, including Senator John McCain, his party's 2008 presidential nominee, supporting a market-based approach. After House Democrats approved a cap-and-trade bill in 2009 that put a price on fossil-fuel emissions, the issue became a target of the Tea Party. In the midst of the worst economy in 75 years, the Senate declined to take up the measure, and cap and trade became a dirty term on Capitol Hill.
Even so, several states already have turned to this approach. California's effort began in January. Nine mid-Atlantic and Northeast states use it under the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.
In Washington, faint whispers of a carbon tax are still occasionally heard as a solution for budget and environmental problems in a single policy. But even if that were to happen, the tax would probably be small and would not guarantee the reduction in emissions needed. Like a tax, carbon markets can also generate revenue that can be rebated to consumers or used to lower other taxes.
The United States can still move back into a leadership position in the effort to reduce carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Learning from the experiences of the European Union and other programs, America can avoid the hiccups that hampered early efforts.
As the effects of a warming climate become increasingly apparent and the costs of adaptation rise, inaction will become an untenable political position. Markets play to America's strengths. As the first President Bush said about his policy of emissions markets for controlling acid rain, markets ''harness the creativity and ingenuity of the private sector.'' What could be more American than that? Just ask the Chinese.

HEADLINE: In Germany, Little Appetite to Change Troubled Banks

BYLINE: By JACK EWING

 BODY:
FRANKFURT -- One of the most battered banking systems in Europe has a history of mismanagement, corruption and politically connected lending, and it has cost taxpayers hundreds of billions of euros.
Is it Italy, Spain or perhaps Greece? No. That description is of Germany's banking sector.
While the country's economy is often held up as a model, German banks are among Europe's most troubled. They required a bailout bigger than the one American banks received, and many are still struggling to recover.
But there is remarkably little discussion about fundamentally changing the structure of the German banking system. On the contrary, Europe's economic leaders criticize Germany for slowing progress toward unifying the Continent's patchwork system of bank regulation, an effort seen as crucial to restoring faith in the euro zone and averting future globe-threatening crises. Ailing German banks are also a dead weight on the euro zone economy as it struggles to crawl out of recession.
''Germany was actually hit very hard by the financial crisis,'' said Jörg Rocholl, president of the European School of Management and Technology, a business school in Berlin. But the debate about the future of banking in Germany is ''alarmingly nonintense,'' Mr. Rocholl said. 
Banks in Germany invested in seemingly every bad asset that came their way, including American subprime assets and Greek bonds. ''There is no sense of pride that Germans were especially thorough or prudent,'' said Sven Giegold, a German who is a member of the Economic and Monetary Affairs Committee in the European Parliament.
Some 646 billion euros, or about $860 billion, was spent or set aside to rescue German banks from 2008 through September 2012, according to European Commission figures. That is the second-highest bailout in Europe after Britain and more than the $700 billion authorized for the Troubled Asset Relief Program in the United States, of which $428 billion has been spent, according to the Congressional Budget Office.
In one recent example of German banking dysfunction, German authorities indicted Bernie Ecclestone, the chief executive of the Formula One auto racing series, in connection with a $44 million bribe said to have been paid to the former chief risk officer of BayernLB, a so-called landesbank owned jointly by the state of Bavaria and community savings banks.
Mr. Ecclestone, accused of making the payoff in 2006 so that the bank would sell its stake in Formula One to his favored buyer, has said he did nothing illegal.
The landesbanks, typically owned by state governments and local institutions, have a long history of corruption and mismanagement. BayernLB already required a 10 billion euro bailout from state taxpayers, and several other of its former top managers were under investigation for insider trading. Six former top managers of HSH Nordbank, a landesbank in Hamburg, are on trial for charges that include fraud and illegally concealing the bank's true financial state, including losses on loans to the depressed shipping industry.
''Germany's banking industry has improved its capitalization significantly and is now better off than before the crisis,'' said Christopher Pleister, chairman of the German Financial Market Stabilization Agency. He said Germany's bank restructuring law included strong protections for taxpayers and rigorous oversight. Mr. Pleister said it should be the model for the rest of Europe.
Yet there is little appetite for change in Germany because the banking system is so deeply intertwined with its politics, serving as a rich source of patronage and financing for local projects.
The landesbanks and the country's roughly 400 local savings banks, known as sparkassen, are controlled by state and municipal politicians. All told, about 45 percent of the German banking industry is in government hands. That is not counting a 25 percent stake in Commerzbank, the country's second-largest commercial bank, acquired by the federal government in the course of a bailout.
''All the parties in Germany are connected. That applies from the Left Party to the F.D.P. -- all of them,'' said Mr. Giegold of the European Parliament, referring to the far left party in Germany and the business-friendly Free Democrats.
Mr. Giegold, the Green Party's banking expert in the European Parliament, did not exclude his own party from those with a stake in the system.
Other euro zone leaders have accused Germany of dragging its feet on the creation of a banking union to shield its banks from tougher scrutiny by a central regulator based at the European Central Bank. The E.C.B. is supposed to take over that task at the beginning of 2014, but is still waiting for the European Parliament to pass the necessary laws so it can start hiring staff.
German officials say they just want to make sure that reform of bank supervision is done right. ''It's the biggest step since the introduction of the euro,'' said Andreas Dombret, a member of the executive board of the Bundesbank, the German central bank. Germany wants to ''make it waterproof but not to delay it or derail it,'' he said.
Mr. Dombret, who is responsible at the Bundesbank for monitoring stability of the financial system, said German banks remained vulnerable to distressed loans in commercial real estate and shipping. Banks in Germany are also overly dependent on borrowed money, he said, and some need to raise more capital or reduce the size of their financial holdings.
On average, Germany's largest banks borrow 50 euros for every one of their own, according to Bundesbank figures, a ratio considered dangerously high.
Unlike their counterparts in countries like Spain or Italy, though, German banks have benefited from a strong national economy. They have not had to cope with as many bad home loans and have generally not had trouble raising money to lend to their customers.
While the bank bailout in Germany was the largest in the euro zone in absolute terms, it equaled only 25 percent of gross domestic product. Ireland's bailout, while smaller, equaled more than three years of economic output and effectively bankrupted the economy. Unlike many of its neighbors, Germany could afford its banking crisis.
''We have seen quite positive changes in the German banking system because the German economy moved positively,'' Mr. Dombret said.
Representatives of the publicly owned banks argue that, despite what critics say, there has been significant change in the German banking system since the financial crisis.
Under pressure from European Union authorities, the landesbanks have abandoned ambitions to compete in international investment banking and drastically reduced their financial holdings. WestLB, a landesbank in Düsseldorf that was once the country's third-largest bank over all, shut down altogether last year following losses tied to American real estate.
''Some landesbanks had to suffer criticism for mistakes during the financial crisis, sometimes with justification,'' Gunter Dunkel, president of the Association of German Public Banks, said in an e-mail. ''The fact is that the banks have not only learned from their mistakes but also made the right corrective measures.''

HEADLINE: The Cambodian People Have Spoken

BYLINE: By KHEANG UN

 BODY:
Cambodia is at a standstill. Although the National Election Committee has yet to announce the official results of the July 28 general election, the ruling party has already claimed victory. It announced soon after polling closed that the governing Cambodian People's Party (C.P.P.) had won 68 seats and the Cambodia National Rescue Party (C.N.R.P.) 55. But the opposition contests the count, alleging massive fraud, and it says it will boycott the new National Assembly if an independent investigation isn't conducted. Prime Minister Hun Sen opposes any inquiry not overseen by the very election commission the opposition accuses of vote-rigging, and he has threatened to redistribute to the C.P.P. any seats the C.N.R.P. leaves vacant.
Even going by the government's numbers, these results are a serious setback for Hun Sen's party: a loss of 22 seats -- it used to hold 90 -- and of a two-thirds majority, the threshold for amending the Constitution. And it is a stunning turn of events considering that just one month ago a decisive victory for the C.P.P. seemed like a foregone conclusion. 
The ruling party had many advantages. After years of war, Cambodia is firmly at peace and its economy is doing well. According to a survey by the International Republican Institute early this year, 79 percent of Cambodians believed that the country was headed in ''the right direction.'' The C.P.P., a former Communist party that has been in power since the fall of the Khmer Rouge regime in 1979, has far greater financial and organizational resources than any other party. It has a near-monopoly over the media, the security forces and all government institutions, national and local, including the election committee.
Yet an appetite for change had been growing, most visibly among the youth. Approximately 50 percent of eligible voters are under 25, and many of them rallied behind the C.N.R.P., a party formed last year after the merger of two opposition groups led by Sam Rainsy and Kem Sokha. This spring, while Sam Rainsy, the party leader, was in self-imposed exile in France -- to avoid a prison sentence on criminal charges he says are politically motivated -- Kem Sokha, the C.N.R.P.'s number two and a longtime human rights activist, crisscrossed the country, campaigning from the back of a pickup truck.
And then Sam Rainsy received a pardon, likely thanks to pressure from the U.S. government. After he returned to Cambodia, the C.N.R.P.'s popularity took off. On July 19, over 100,000 people, mostly young, lined the streets from the airport all the way to the center of Phnom Penh to welcome him back. That day and at subsequent C.N.R.P. rallies, the crowds were exuberant. Many supporters had made small donations and volunteered to canvas for the party. All were answering its populist and nationalist call to mobilize against the C.P.P.'s entrenched interests.
Discontent is widespread among ordinary Cambodians, despite improved living conditions. Growth in Cambodia, as in many developing countries, has been based largely on crony capitalism. Development has created a newly rich class -- business tycoons, government elites, the military -- while dispossessing the rural and the urban poor. Yet instead of addressing growing inequality and corruption, the C.P.P. campaigned on the memory of the Khmer Rouge, using the brutal regime as a yardstick for its own achievements, and reasserted the traditional Khmer patronage system. It built infrastructure and doled out social services selectively to reward communities that supported it. On visits to rural areas, party members would distribute small gifts, like cash, clothing and small packets of MSG.
Meanwhile, the C.P.P. underestimated the opposition. Since the introduction of a multiparty system in 1993, Hun Sen managed to divide the opposition with dubious lawsuits or outright bribery. But this time the opposition showed a united front.
The C.N.R.P. also relied on populist policies to mobilize Cambodia's have-nots, its have-too-littles and its highly expectant youth. Its platform promised better health care, higher salaries for state employees and factory workers, and lower prices for commodities like gasoline and fertilizer. Its program was clear, practical, appealing. When asked how all this would be funded, party leaders said state revenues could be increased simply by curbing corruption. The line resonated with voters.
The C.N.R.P. played the populist card even when that meant peddling xenophobia. It capitalized on widespread anti-Vietnamese sentiment, the result of wars fought centuries ago and of Vietnam's occupation of Cambodia in 1979-89. The party linked popular fears over immigration from Vietnam to growing concerns that the government is selling country's rich land in the form of economic concessions, often to Vietnamese companies. That argument allowed the C.N.R.P. to turn discrete reports about farmers and villagers being expropriated into a much broader case against the wholesale exploitation of Cambodia's natural resources by an ill-intentioned neighbor.
Other things had also changed in the countryside, the C.P.P.'s traditional base. Cambodian farmers still tend to be cautious, but many have become more tactically astute: While they might still express outward support for the C.P.P., many wanted change. When the party offered them gifts in exchange for a promise to vote for the C.P.P., they took the gifts and promised. But come election day, many cast their ballots against the ruling party.
If this election shows anything it's that Cambodian voters -- once easy to manipulate in the name of stability -- now expect much more from their leaders.
What can they expect now of Hun Sen and the C.P.P.? Even if current election results stand, despite challenges by the opposition, the C.P.P. is due for some soul-searching. The party is on notice that Cambodians expect substantial reforms regarding inequality, corruption and social justice. Addressing these issues will be a great challenge, as it will undermine the C.P.P.'s vested interests, no least its monopoly over state resources and institutions. But if the party refuses to budge it will soon face an even more vocal opposition, backed by an even more restless youth. However flawed or unfair this election, the Cambodian people have spoken.
Update: This article was updated to reflect the National Election Committee's announcement on Friday that it would delay the release of official election results.

HEADLINE: Shares Slip on Speculation Over Fed Cuts

BYLINE: By REUTERS

 BODY:
Stocks fell on Friday and posted their biggest weekly decline since June as investors focused on when the Federal Reserve would begin to scale back its stimulus.
All but one of the 10 Standard & Poor's 500 sector indexes ended lower. 
Richard W. Fisher, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, reiterated late Thursday that the central bank would probably begin cutting back on its extensive bond-buying stimulus next month, as long as economic data continued to improve.
The lack of clarity over the Fed's plans gave investors reason to pull a record $3.27 billion out of funds based in the United States that hold Treasuries in the latest week, ended Wednesday, data from the Lipper service of Thomson Reuters showed on Thursday.
Michael Sheldon, chief market strategist at RDM Financial, in Westport, Conn., said investors were looking ahead to the Fed's meeting in September, ''and the prospect that the Fed begins its long-awaited exit strategy.''
Also on Friday, the stock of J. C. Penney skidded 5.8 percent to $12.87 and ranked as the S.& P. 500's biggest percentage decliner after William A. Ackman, the company's top investor, urged the retailer's board to replace its chairman.
The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 72.81 points, or 0.47 percent, to end at 15,425.51. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index declined 6.06 points, or 0.36 percent, to 1,691.42. The Nasdaq composite index fell 9.02 points, or 0.25 percent, to close at 3,660.11.
For the week, stocks posted their biggest declines since mid-June. The Dow fell 1.5 percent, snapping a six-week string of gains. The S.& P. 500 dropped 1.1 percent for the week and the Nasdaq slid 0.8 percent.
A week ago, both the Dow and the S.& P. 500 ended at record closing highs.
Stocks extended losses late in the session. On Friday afternoon at a news conference, President Obama said he would decide on the nomination for the Federal Reserve chairman in the fall. The Fed chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, is expected to step down when his second four-year term ends on Jan. 31.
Mr. Bernanke rattled markets in late May by saying the Fed would begin to ease back on its stimulus program once the economy showed some improvement.
While many investors are concerned that economic growth will stall without the Fed's help, stock prices have been supported by some strong earnings and encouraging data overseas.
The S.& P. 500 is up 18.6 percent for the year so far.
In China, industrial output rose more than expected, adding to a string of data that indicated the economy might be stabilizing after an extended period of tepid growth.
In the bond market, the price of the Treasury's 10-year note rose 3/32, to 93 4/32. The yield fell to 2.58 percent from 2.59 late Thursday.

HEADLINE: Win the Lottery? Dream On

BYLINE: By TARA SIEGEL BERNARD

 BODY:
When those exceedingly lucky people come forward to claim this week's Powerball lottery jackpot, which swelled to $448 million on Wednesday, it's hard not to think: Somebody is winning these things, right? It could be me.
This is exactly the sort of logic that, over the last year, led millions of people to spend $5.9 billion of their hard-earned dollars on Powerball alone. They spent nearly $69 billion on all lottery games in 2012, according to two lottery trade groups. 
It is also precisely the kind of mental trap the Powerball people want you to fall in; they tweaked the game rules last year, doubling the price of tickets to $2 to raise more revenue and create more eye-catching jackpots.
And the state agencies running the games advertise heavily that it could be you making off with millions of dollars.
The odds of winning, however, remain infinitesimal: Powerball players, for instance, have a 1 in 175 million chance of winning. You have roughly the same chance of getting hit by lightning on your birthday.
Even though some people may be able to intellectually grasp what that means, the Multi-State Lottery Association can predict with clocklike certainty that on Saturday night, with a jackpot worth about $40 million, 13 million to 15 million people will buy tickets. Those ticket buyers are all thinking they have a shot of defying the odds.
That is why the lottery is called a tax on people who don't understand math. Lower-income individuals who play but don't win are hurt the most because they're wasting a greater share of their income on the games. That's also why the lottery is often called a regressive tax on the poor.
Sure, last year the games returned $19.41 billion to the states that sponsored them, according to the North American Association of State and Provincial Lotteries, which represents 52 lottery groups. But that's not why anyone plays them.
What's the big motivation to volunteer to pay this tax? Psychologists say it has more to do with our all-too-human propensity to run with the dreamlike possibilities it creates in our minds.
''For emotionally significant events, the size of the probability simply doesn't matter,'' said Daniel Kahneman, the Nobel-prize winning psychologist. ''What matters is the possibility of winning. People are excited by the image in their mind. The excitement grows with the size of the prize, but it doesn't diminish with the size of the probability.''
So ticket buyers allow themselves some momentary escapism since it costs only $2, thinking about what they would do with all that money. And they'll ignore all of the well-known horrors and pitfalls that many lottery winners encounter, whether it's a severe depression or blowing through all of the money in a form of self-sabotage that ends with them living in a trailer down by the river. This phenomenon of feeling anxious and undeserving, among other things, is what some experts call ''sudden wealth syndrome.'' It may afflict people who benefit from all sorts of success or windfalls, whether from the sale of a valuable business, signing an N.F.L. contract or inheriting a huge sum from a maiden aunt.
''Money that is much more than you're used to sounds unlimited,'' said Susan Bradley, a financial planner and founder of the Sudden Money Institute, who has worked with several lottery winners. ''If you don't have someone to help you, yes, you can go through extraordinarily large amounts of money, and, even worse, you can be in debt. It can really happen.''
Plugging some numbers into this dream provides some perspective. Winners wanting to be able to safely spend $1 million a year for 55 years (adjusted for inflation) would need about $36 million, after taxes, to invest, according to calculations by Northern Trust. (Those numbers also factor in annual taxes and investment expenses.) They would need to set aside nearly $15 million in high-quality bonds to know they would always have 15 years of spending in stable investments. To cover the remaining 40 years, they would need to put another $21 million in a diversified stock portfolio.
So in thinking about it, it's not even worth playing unless the jackpot is more than $75 million, because the state and federal government take about half in taxes.
Part of that fantasy is that winners would start buying fast cars and big homes, not to mention stuff for all of your family members along with their children's education. It's easy to see how they could run through the money, as hard as that may seem to believe with $36 million in hand. Of course, if you want to live even larger -- more homes, more cars, more ex-spouses, servants, accountants, lawyers, other lawyers to watch the lawyers -- you'll need far more. Probably more like $100 million, after taxes.
''If they make it to the fifth year with enough money to securely handle their life going forward and all of their relationships are intact, they are probably going to make it long term,'' Ms. Bradley said.
So let's get back to the probability of all of this ever even happening.
Buying more tickets improves your odds, but not by much. So if you want the fantasy, just buy one. Buying more doesn't make the fantasy any richer.
It would take centuries of ticket buying before you even make a dent. If you purchased roughly 126,000 tickets a month for the next 80 years, for example, you could improve your odds to 50 percent, explained Gary A. Lorden, emeritus professor of math at California Institute of Technology (who, for the record, has bought a single ticket three times over the last decade; he split the last one with his grandson).
''The difference is like moving from a big house to a small house to make it less likely a meteor will strike your roof,'' he said.
Good luck with that.

HEADLINE: Obama's Remarks at a News Conference

 BODY:
The following is a transcript of President Obama's statement and responses to reporters' questions at a news conference on Friday, as provided by the White House.
MR. OBAMA: Good afternoon, everybody. Please have a seat.
Over the past few weeks, I've been talking about what I believe should be our number-one priority as a country -- building a better bargain for the middle class and for Americans who want to work their way into the middle class. At the same time, I'm focused on my number-one responsibility as Commander-in-Chief, and that's keeping the American people safe. And in recent days, we've been reminded once again about the threats to our nation.
As I said at the National Defense University back in May, in meeting those threats we have to strike the right balance between protecting our security and preserving our freedoms. And as part of this rebalancing, I called for a review of our surveillance programs. Unfortunately, rather than an orderly and lawful process to debate these issues and come up with appropriate reforms, repeated leaks of classified information have initiated the debate in a very passionate, but not always fully informed way. 
Now, keep in mind that as a senator, I expressed a healthy skepticism about these programs, and as President, I've taken steps to make sure they have strong oversight by all three branches of government and clear safeguards to prevent abuse and protect the rights of the American people. But given the history of abuse by governments, it's right to ask questions about surveillance -- particularly as technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives.
I'm also mindful of how these issues are viewed overseas, because American leadership around the world depends upon the example of American democracy and American openness -- because what makes us different from other countries is not simply our ability to secure our nation, it's the way we do it -- with open debate and democratic process.
In other words, it's not enough for me, as President, to have confidence in these programs. The American people need to have confidence in them as well. And that's why, over the last few weeks, I've consulted members of Congress who come at this issue from many different perspectives. I've asked the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board to review where our counterterrorism efforts and our values come into tension, and I directed my national security team to be more transparent and to pursue reforms of our laws and practices.
And so, today, I'd like to discuss four specific steps -- not all inclusive, but some specific steps that we're going to be taking very shortly to move the debate forward.
First, I will work with Congress to pursue appropriate reforms to Section 215 of the Patriot Act -- the program that collects telephone records. As I've said, this program is an important tool in our effort to disrupt terrorist plots. And it does not allow the government to listen to any phone calls without a warrant. But given the scale of this program, I understand the concerns of those who would worry that it could be subject to abuse. So after having a dialogue with members of Congress and civil libertarians, I believe that there are steps we can take to give the American people additional confidence that there are additional safeguards against abuse.
For instance, we can take steps to put in place greater oversight, greater transparency, and constraints on the use of this authority. So I look forward to working with Congress to meet those objectives.
Second, I'll work with Congress to improve the public's confidence in the oversight conducted by the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, known as the FISC. The FISC was created by Congress to provide judicial review of certain intelligence activities so that a federal judge must find that our actions are consistent with the Constitution. However, to build greater confidence, I think we should consider some additional changes to the FISC.
One of the concerns that people raise is that a judge reviewing a request from the government to conduct programmatic surveillance only hears one side of the story -- may tilt it too far in favor of security, may not pay enough attention to liberty. And while I've got confidence in the court and I think they've done a fine job, I think we can provide greater assurances that the court is looking at these issues from both perspectives -- security and privacy.
So, specifically, we can take steps to make sure civil liberties concerns have an independent voice in appropriate cases by ensuring that the government's position is challenged by an adversary.
Number three, we can, and must, be more transparent. So I've directed the intelligence community to make public as much information about these programs as possible. We've already declassified unprecedented information about the NSA, but we can go further. So at my direction, the Department of Justice will make public the legal rationale for the government's collection activities under Section 215 of the Patriot Act. The NSA is taking steps to put in place a full-time civil liberties and privacy officer, and released information that details its mission, authorities, and oversight. And finally, the intelligence community is creating a website that will serve as a hub for further transparency, and this will give Americans and the world the ability to learn more about what our intelligence community does and what it doesn't do, how it carries out its mission, and why it does so.
Fourth, we're forming a high-level group of outside experts to review our entire intelligence and communications technologies. We need new thinking for a new era. We now have to unravel terrorist plots by finding a needle in the haystack of global telecommunications. And meanwhile, technology has given governments -- including our own -- unprecedented capability to monitor communications.
So I am tasking this independent group to step back and review our capabilities -- particularly our surveillance technologies. And they'll consider how we can maintain the trust of the people, how we can make sure that there absolutely is no abuse in terms of how these surveillance technologies are used, ask how surveillance impacts our foreign policy -- particularly in an age when more and more information is becoming public. And they will provide an interim report in 60 days and a final report by the end of this year, so that we can move forward with a better understanding of how these programs impact our security, our privacy, and our foreign policy.
So all these steps are designed to ensure that the American people can trust that our efforts are in line with our interests and our values. And to others around the world, I want to make clear once again that America is not interested in spying on ordinary people. Our intelligence is focused, above all, on finding the information that's necessary to protect our people, and -- in many cases -- protect our allies.
It's true we have significant capabilities. What's also true is we show a restraint that many governments around the world don't even think to do, refuse to show -- and that includes, by the way, some of America's most vocal critics. We shouldn't forget the difference between the ability of our government to collect information online under strict guidelines and for narrow purposes, and the willingness of some other governments to throw their own citizens in prison for what they say online.
And let me close with one additional thought. The men and women of our intelligence community work every single day to keep us safe because they love this country and believe in our values. They're patriots. And I believe that those who have lawfully raised their voices on behalf of privacy and civil liberties are also patriots who love our country and want it to live up to our highest ideals. So this is how we're going to resolve our differences in the United States -- through vigorous public debate, guided by our Constitution, with reverence for our history as a nation of laws, and with respect for the facts.
So, with that, I'm going to take some questions. And let's see who we've got here. We're going to start with Julie Pace of AP.
Q Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted to ask about some of the foreign policy fallout from the disclosure of the NSA programs that you discussed. Your spokesman said yesterday that there's no question that the U.S. relationship with Russia has gotten worse since Vladimir Putin took office. How much of that decline do you attribute directly to Mr. Putin, given that you seem to have had a good working relationship with his predecessor? Also will there be any additional punitive measures taken against Russia for granting asylum to Edward Snowden? Or is canceling the September summit really all you can do given the host of issues the U.S. needs Russian cooperation for? Thank you.
MR. OBAMA: Good. I think there's always been some tension in the U.S.-Russian relationship after the fall of the Soviet Union. There's been cooperation in some areas; there's been competition in others.
It is true that in my first four years, in working with President Medvedev, we made a lot of progress. We got START done -- or START II done. We were able to cooperate together on Iran sanctions. They provided us help in terms of supplying our troops in Afghanistan. We were able to get Russia into the WTO -- which is not just good for Russia, it's good for our companies and businesses because they're more likely then to follow international norms and rules. So there's been a lot of good work that has been done and that is going to continue to be done.
What's also true is, is that when President Putin -- who was prime minister when Medvedev was president -- came back into power I think we saw more rhetoric on the Russian side that was anti-American, that played into some of the old stereotypes about the Cold War contests between the United States and Russia. And I've encouraged Mr. Putin to think forward as opposed to backwards on those issues -- with mixed success.
And I think the latest episode is just one more in a number of emerging differences that we've seen over the last several months around Syria, around human rights issues, where it is probably appropriate for us to take a pause, reassess where it is that Russia is going, what our core interests are, and calibrate the relationship so that we're doing things that are good for the United States and hopefully good for Russia as well, but recognizing that there just are going to be some differences and we're not going to be able to completely disguise them.
And that's okay. Keep in mind that although I'm not attending the summit, I'll still be going to St. Petersburg because Russia is hosting the G20. That's important business in terms of our economy and our jobs and all the issues that are of concern to Americans.
I know that one question that's been raised is how do we approach the Olympics. I want to just make very clear right now I do not think it's appropriate to boycott the Olympics. We've got a bunch of Americans out there who are training hard, who are doing everything they can to succeed. Nobody is more offended than me by some of the anti-gay and lesbian legislation that you've been seeing in Russia. But as I said just this week, I've spoken out against that not just with respect to Russia but a number of other countries where we continue to do work with them, but we have a strong disagreement on this issue.
And one of the things I'm really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we're seeing there. And if Russia doesn't have gay or lesbian athletes, then it probably makes their team weaker.
Q Are there going to be any additional punitive measures for Russia, beyond canceling the summit?
MR. OBAMA: Keep in mind that our decision to not participate in the summit was not simply around Mr. Snowden. It had to do with the fact that, frankly, on a whole range of issues where we think we can make some progress, Russia has not moved. And so we don't consider that strictly punitive.
We're going to assess where the relationship can advance U.S. interests and increase peace and stability and prosperity around the world. Where it can, we're going to keep on working with them. Where we have differences, we're going to say so clearly. And my hope is, is that over time, Mr. Putin and Russia recognize that rather than a zero-sum competition, in fact, if the two countries are working together we can probably advance the betterment of both peoples.
Chuck Todd.
Q Thank you, Mr. President. Given that you just announced a whole bunch of reforms based on essentially the leaks that Edward Snowden made on all of these surveillance programs, is that change -- is your mindset changed about him? Is he now more a whistle-blower than he is a hacker, as you called him at one point, or somebody that shouldn't be filed charges? And should he be provided more protection? Is he a patriot? You just used those words. And then just to follow up on the personal -- I want to follow up on a personal --
MR. OBAMA: Okay, I want to make sure -- everybody is asking one question it would be helpful.
Q No, I understand. It was a part of a question that you didn't answer. Can you get stuff done with Russia, big stuff done, without having a good personal relationship with Putin?
MR. OBAMA: I don't have a bad personal relationship with Putin. When we have conversations, they're candid, they're blunt; oftentimes, they're constructive. I know the press likes to focus on body language and he's got that kind of slouch, looking like the bored kid in the back of the classroom. But the truth is, is that when we're in conversations together, oftentimes it's very productive.
So the issue here really has to do with where do they want to take Russia -- it's substantive on a policy front. And --
Q (Inaudible.)
MR. OBAMA: No. Right now, this is just a matter of where Mr. Putin and the Russian people want to go. I think if they are looking forward into the 21st century and how they can advance their economy, and make sure that some of our joint concerns around counterterrorism are managed effectively, then I think we can work together. If issues are framed as if the U.S. is for it then Russia should be against it, or we're going to be finding ways where we can poke each other at every opportunity, then probably we don't get as much stuff done.
See, now I've forgotten your first question, which presumably was the more important one. No, I don't think Mr. Snowden was a patriot. As I said in my opening remarks, I called for a thorough review of our surveillance operations before Mr. Snowden made these leaks.
My preference -- and I think the American people's preference -- would have been for a lawful, orderly examination of these laws, a thoughtful fact-based debate that would then lead us to a better place. Because I never made claims that all the surveillance technologies that have developed since the time some of these laws had been put in place somehow didn't require potentially some additional reforms. That's exactly what I called for.
So the fact is, is that Mr. Snowden has been charged with three felonies. If, in fact, he believes that what he did was right, then, like every American citizen, he can come here, appear before the court with a lawyer and make his case. If the concern was that somehow this was the only way to get this information out to the public, I signed an executive order well before Mr. Snowden leaked this information that provided whistleblower protection to the intelligence community -- for the first time. So there were other avenues available for somebody whose conscience was stirred and thought that they needed to question government actions.
But having said that, once the leaks have happened, what we've seen is information come out in dribs and in drabs, sometimes coming out sideways. Once the information is out, the administration comes in, tries to correct the record. But by that time, it's too late or we've moved on, and a general impression has, I think, taken hold not only among the American public but also around the world that somehow we're out there willy-nilly just sucking in information on everybody and doing what we please with it.
That's not the case. Our laws specifically prohibit us from surveilling U.S. persons without a warrant. And there are a whole range of safeguards that have been put in place to make sure that that basic principle is abided by.
But what is clear is that whether, because of the instinctive bias of the intelligence community to keep everything very close -- and probably what's a fair criticism is my assumption that if we had checks and balances from the courts and Congress, that that traditional system of checks and balances would be enough to give people assurance that these programs were run probably -- that assumption I think proved to be undermined by what happened after the leaks. I think people have questions about this program.
And so, as a consequence, I think it is important for us to go ahead and answer these questions. What I'm going to be pushing the IC to do is rather than have a trunk come out here and leg come out there and a tail come out there, let's just put the whole elephant out there so people know exactly what they're looking at. Let's examine what is working, what's not, are there additional protections that can be put in place, and let's move forward.
And there's no doubt that Mr. Snowden's leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than would have been the case if I had simply appointed this review board to go through, and I had sat down with Congress and we had worked this thing through. It would have been less exciting. It would not have generated as much press. I actually think we would have gotten to the same place, and we would have done so without putting at risk our national security and some very vital ways that we are able to get intelligence that we need to secure the country.
Major Garrett.
Q Thank you, Mr. President. I'd like to ask you about this debate that's playing itself out in editorial pages, in the blogosphere, even in the Senate Democratic caucus, about the choice you eventually will make for the next Federal Reserve chairman. There is a perception among Democrats that Larry Summers has the inside track, and perhaps you've made some assurances to him about that. Janet Yellen is the vice chair of the Federal Reserve. There are many women in the Senate who are Democrats who believe that breaking the glass ceiling there would be historic and important.
MR. OBAMA: Right.
Q Are you annoyed by this sort of roiling debate? Do you find it any way unseemly? And do you believe this will be one of the most important -- if not the most important -- economic decisions you'll make in the remainder of your presidency?
MR. OBAMA: It is definitely one of the most important economic decisions that I'll make in the remainder of my presidency. The Federal Reserve chairman is not just one of the most important economic policymakers in America, he or she is one of the most important policymakers in the world. And that person presumably will stay on after I'm President. So this, along with Supreme Court appointments, is probably as important a decision as I make as President.
I have a range of outstanding candidates. You've mentioned two of them -- Mr. Summers and Mr. Yellen -- Ms. Yellen. And they're both terrific people.
I think the perception that Mr. Summers might have an inside track simply had to do with a bunch of attacks that I was hearing on Mr. Summers preemptively, which is sort of a standard Washington exercise, that I don't like. Because when somebody has worked hard for me and worked hard on behalf of the American people, and I know the quality of those people, and I see them getting slapped around in the press for no reason -- before they've even been nominated for anything -- then I want to make sure that somebody is standing up for them. I felt the same way when people were attacking Susan Rice before she was nominated for anything. So I tend to defend folks who I think have done a good job and don't deserve attacks.
But I consider them both outstanding candidates. My main criteria -- I've stated this before, but I want to repeat it -- my main criteria for the Fed Reserve chairman is somebody who understands they've got a dual mandate. A critical part of the job is making sure that we keep inflation in check, that our monetary policy is sound, that the dollar is sound. Those are all critical components of the job. And we've seen what happens when the Fed is not paying attention. We saw, prior to Paul Volcker coming into place, inflation shooting up in ways that really damaged the real economy.
But the other mandate is full employment. And right now, if you look at the biggest challenges we have, the challenge is not inflation; the challenge is we've still got too many people out of work, too many long-term unemployed, too much slack in the economy, and we're not growing as fast as we should. And so I want a Fed chairman who's able to look at those issues and have a perspective that keeps an eye on inflation, makes sure that we're not seeing artificial bubbles in place, but also recognizing, you know what, a big part of my job right now is to make sure the economy is growing quickly and robustly, and is sustained and durable, so that people who work hard in this country are able to find a job.
And, frankly, I think both Larry Summers and Janet Yellen are highly qualified candidates. There are a couple of other candidates who are highly qualified as well. I'll make the decision in the fall.
Q Can you see how the perception of you defending Larry Summers as vigorously as you just did and in other quarters lead some to believe you've already made up your mind?
MR. OBAMA: Well, except I just told you I haven't. Major, I'd defend you if somebody was saying something that wasn't true about you. (Laughter.) I really would. In fact, I've done that in the White House some times. (Laughter.)
Carol Lee. And, Carol, congratulations on Hudson.
Q Thank you, Mr. President.
MR. OBAMA: Do you have pictures?
Q I do. I'll have to show you --
MR. OBAMA: Okay, I'm going to have to see them.
Q I appreciate you making it a slow news week.
I wanted to ask you about your evolution on the surveillance issues. I mean, part of what you're talking about today is restoring the public trust. And the public has seen you evolve from when you were in the U.S. Senate to now. And even as recently as June, you said that the process was such that people should be comfortable with it, and now you're saying you're making these reforms and people should be comfortable with those. So why should the public trust you on this issue, and why did you change your position multiple times?
MR. OBAMA: Well, I think it's important to say, Carol, first of all, I haven't evolved in my assessment of the actual programs. I consistently have said that when I came into office I evaluated them. Some of these programs I had been critical of when I was in the Senate. When I looked through specifically what was being done, my determination was that the two programs in particular that had been at issue, 215 and 702, offered valuable intelligence that helps us protect the American people and they're worth preserving. What we also saw was that some bolts needed to be tightened up on some of the programs, so we initiated some additional oversight, reforms, compliance officers, audits and so forth.
And if you look at the reports -- even the disclosures that Mr. Snowden has put forward -- all the stories that have been written, what you're not reading about is the government actually abusing these programs and listening in on people's phone calls or inappropriately reading people's emails. What you're hearing about is the prospect that these could be abused. Now, part of the reason they're not abused is because these checks are in place, and those abuses would be against the law and would be against the orders of the FISC.
Having said that, though, if you are outside of the intelligence community, if you are the ordinary person and you start seeing a bunch of headlines saying, U.S.-Big Brother looking down on you, collecting telephone records, et cetera, well, understandably, people would be concerned. I would be, too, if I wasn't inside the government.
And so in light of the changed environment where a whole set of questions have been raised, some in the most sensationalized manner possible, where these leaks are released drip by drip, one a week, to kind of maximize attention and see if they can catch us at some imprecision on something -- in light of that, it makes sense for us to go ahead, lay out what exactly we're doing, have a discussion with Congress, have a discussion with industry -- which is also impacted by this -- have a discussion with civil libertarians, and see can we do this better.
I think the main thing I want to emphasize is I don't have an interest and the people at the NSA don't have an interest in doing anything other than making sure that where we can prevent a terrorist attack, where we can get information ahead of time, that we're able to carry out that critical task. We do not have an interest in doing anything other than that. And we've tried to set up a system that is as failsafe as so far at least we've been able to think of to make sure that these programs are not abused.
But people may have better ideas and people may want to jigger slightly sort of the balance between the information that we can get versus the incremental encroachments on privacy that if haven't already taken place might take place in a future administration, or as technologies develop further.
And the other thing that's happening is, is that as technology develops further, technology itself may provide us some additional safeguards. So, for example, if people don't have confidence that the law, the checks and balances of the court and Congress are sufficient to give us confidence that government is not snooping, well, maybe we can embed technologies in there that prevent the snooping regardless of what government wants to do. I mean, there may be some technological fixes that provide another layer of assurance.
And so those are the kinds of things that I'm looking forward to having a conversation about.
Q Can you understand, though, why some people might not trust what you're saying right now about wanting to --
MR. OBAMA: No, I can't.
Q -- that they should be comfortable with the process?
MR. OBAMA: Well, the fact that I said that the programs are operating in a way that prevents abuse, that continues to be true, without the reforms. The question is how do I make the American people more comfortable.
If I tell Michelle that I did the dishes -- now, granted, in the White House I don't do the dishes that much -- (laughter) -- but back in the day -- and she's a little skeptical, well, I'd like her to trust me, but maybe I need to bring her back and show her the dishes and not just have her take my word for it.
And so the program is -- I am comfortable that the program currently is not being abused. I'm comfortable that if the American people examined exactly what was taking place, how it was being used, what the safeguards were, that they would say, you know what, these folks are following the law and doing what they say they're doing.
But it is absolutely true that with the expansion of technology -- this is an area that's moving very quickly -- with the revelations that have depleted public trust, that if there are some additional things that we can do to build that trust back up, then we should do them.
Jonathan Karl.
Q Thank you, Mr. President. You have said that core al Qaeda has been decimated, that its leaders are on the run. Now that we've seen this terror threat that has resulted in embassies closed throughout the Arab world, much of Africa, do you still believe that al Qaeda has been decimated? And if I can ask in the interest of transparency, can you tell us about these drone strikes that we've seen over the last couple of weeks in Yemen?
MR. OBAMA: What I said in the same National Defense University speech back in May that I referred to earlier is that core al Qaeda is on its heels, has been decimated. But what I also said was that al Qaeda and other extremists have metastasized into regional groups that can pose significant dangers.
And I'd refer you back to that speech just back in May where I said specifically that although they are less likely to be able to carry out spectacular homeland attacks like 9/11, they have the capacity to go after our embassies. They have the capacity, potentially, to go after our businesses. They have the capacity to be destabilizing and disruptive in countries where the security apparatus is weak. And that's exactly what we are seeing right now.
So it's entirely consistent to say that this tightly organized and relatively centralized al Qaeda that attacked us on 9/11 has been broken apart and is very weak and does not have a lot of operational capacity, and to say we still have these regional organizations like AQAP that can pose a threat, that can drive potentially a truck bomb into an embassy wall and can kill some people.
And so that requires us, then, to make sure that we have a strategy that is strengthening those partners so that they've got their own capacity to deal with what are potentially manageable regional threats if these countries are a little bit stronger and have more effective CT and so forth. It means that we've got to continue to be vigilant and go after known terrorists who are potentially carrying out plots or are going to strengthen their capacity over time -- because they're always testing the boundaries of, well, maybe we can try this, maybe we can do that.
So this is a ongoing process. We are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is to weaken it and to strengthen our partnerships in such a way that it does not pose the kind of horrible threat that we saw on 9/11.
And I'm not going to discuss specific operations that have taken place. Again, in my speech in May, I was very specific about how we make these determinations about potential lethal strikes, so I would refer you to that speech.
Q So you won't even confirm that we carried out drone strikes in Yemen?
MR. OBAMA: I will not have a discussion about operational issues.
Ed Henry.
Q I hope you would defend me as well.
MR. OBAMA: I would.
Q Okay, thank you. I want to ask you about two important dates that are coming up. October 1st you've got to implement your signature health care law. You recently decided on your own to delay a key part of that. And I wonder, if you pick and choose what parts of the law to implement, couldn't your successor down the road pick and choose whether they'll implement your law and keep it in place?
And on September 11th we'll have the first anniversary of Benghazi. And you said on September 12th, ''Make no mistake, we'll bring to justice the killers who attacked our people.'' Eleven months later, where are they, sir?
MR. OBAMA: Well, I also said that we'd get bin Laden, and I didn't get him in 11 months. So we have informed, I think, the public that there's a sealed indictment. It's sealed for a reason. But we are intent on capturing those who carried out this attack, and we're going to stay on it until we get them.
Q And you're close to having suspects in custody?
MR. OBAMA: I will leave it at that. But this remains a top priority for us. Anybody who attacks Americans, anybody who kills, tragically, four Americans who were serving us in a very dangerous place, we're going to do everything we can to get those who carried out those attacks.
With respect to health care, I didn't simply choose to delay this on my own. This was in consultation with businesses all across the country, many of whom are supportive of the Affordable Care Act, but -- and many of whom, by the way, are already providing health insurance to their employees but were concerned about the operational details of changing their HR operations, if they've got a lot of employees, which could be costly for them, and them suggesting that there may be easier ways to do this.
Now, what's true, Ed, is, is that in a normal political environment, it would have been easier for me to simply call up the Speaker and say, you know what, this is a tweak that doesn't go to the essence of the law -- it has to do with, for example, are we able to simplify the attestation of employers as to whether they're already providing health insurance or not -- it looks like there may be some better ways to do this; let's make a technical change to the law. That would be the normal thing that I would prefer to do.
But we're not in a normal atmosphere around here when it comes to ''Obamacare.'' We did have the executive authority to do so, and we did so. But this doesn't go to the core of implementation. Let me tell you what is the core of implementation that's already taken place. As we speak, right now, for the 85 percent of Americans who already have health insurance, they are benefiting from being able to keep their kid on their plan if their kid is 26 or younger. That's benefiting millions of young people around the country, which is why lack of insurance among young people has actually gone down. That's in large part attributable to the steps that we've taken.
You've got millions of people who have received rebates, because part of the Affordable Care Act was to say that if an insurance company isn't spending 80 percent of your premium on your health care, you get some money back. And, lo and behold, people have been getting their money back. It means that folks who have been bumping up with lifetime limits on their insurance, that it leaves them vulnerable. That doesn't exist.
Seniors have been getting discounts on their prescription drugs. That's happening right now. Free preventive care -- mammograms, contraception. That's happening right now. I met a young man today on a bill signing I was doing with the student loan bill who came up to me and said thank you -- he couldn't have been more than 25, 26 years old -- thank you; I have cancer, thanks to the Affordable Care Act working with the California program, I was able to get health care and I'm now in remission. And so right now people are already benefiting.
Now, what happens on October 1st, in 53 days, is for the remaining 15 percent of the population that doesn't have health insurance, they're going to be able to go on a website or call up a call center and sign up for affordable quality health insurance at a significantly cheaper rate than what they can get right now on the individual market. And if even with lower premiums they still can't afford it, we're going to be able to provide them with a tax credit to help them buy it. And between October 1st into March there will be an open enrollment period in which millions of Americans for the first time are going to be able to get affordable health care.
Now, I think the really interesting question is why it is that my friends in the other party have made the idea of preventing these people from getting health care their holy grail, their number-one priority. The one unifying principle in the Republican Party at the moment is making sure that 30 million people don't have health care and, presumably, repealing all those benefits I just mentioned -- kids staying on their parents' plan; seniors getting discounts on their prescription drugs; I guess a return to lifetime limits on insurance; people with preexisting conditions continuing to be blocked from being able to get health insurance.
That's hard to understand as an agenda that is going to strengthen our middle class. At least they used to say, well, we're going to replace it with something better. There's not even a pretense now that they're going to replace it with something better.
The notion is simply that those 30 million people, or the 150 million who are benefiting from the other aspects of Affordable Care, will be better off without it. That's their assertion -- not backed by fact, not backed by any evidence. It's just become an ideological fixation.
Well, I tell you what, they're wrong about that. There is no doubt that in implementing the Affordable Care Act, a program of this significance, there are going to be some glitches. No doubt about it. There are going to be things where we say, you know what, we should have thought of that earlier. Or this would work a little bit better. Or this needs an adjustment. That was true of Social Security. That was true of Medicare. That was true of the Children's Health Insurance Program. That was true of the prescription drug program, Part D, that was rolled out by a Republican President and supported by Republicans who are still in the House of Representatives. That's true, by the way, of a car company rolling out a new car. It's true of Apple rolling out the new iPad.
So you will be able to, whenever you want during the course of the next six months and probably the next year, find occasions where you say, ah-ha, you know what, that could have been done a little bit better. Or that thing, they're kind of making an administrative change; that's now how it was originally thought this thing was going to work. Yes, exactly. Because our goal is to actually deliver high-quality, affordable health care for people and to reform the system so costs start going down and people start getting a better bang for the buck. And I make no apologies for that.
And let me just make one last point about this. The idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea. What you should be thinking about is how can we advance and improve ways for middle-class families to have some security so that if they work hard, they can get ahead and their kids can get ahead.
Jessica Yellin.
Q Thank you, Mr. President. And following on what you just said, Republicans in the House might give you that choice soon to either allow the government to shut down or see Obamacare defunded. Would you choose to let the government shut down to ensure that Obamacare remains funded?
MR. OBAMA: Well, I'm not going to engage in hypotheticals. I can tell you that the American people would have difficulty understanding why we would weaken our economy, shut down our government, shut down vital services, have people who are not getting paid who then can't go to restaurants or shop for clothes, or all the other things that we're doing here because Republicans have determined that they don't want to see these folks get health care.
Again, they used to say they had a replacement. That never actually arrived, right? I mean, I've been hearing about this whole replacement thing for two years -- now I just don't hear about it, because basically they don't have an agenda to provide health insurance to people at affordable rates. And the idea that you would shut down the government at a time when the recovery is getting some traction; where we're growing, although not as fast as we need to; where the housing market is recovering, although not as fast as we would like; that we would precipitate another crisis here in Washington that no economist thinks is a good idea -- I'm assuming that they will not take that path. I have confidence that common sense, in the end, will prevail.
Q And if they do, sir, you will have to make that choice?
MR. OBAMA: We'll see what happens. We've got a couple of months.
Q When's the last time you spoke to Speaker Boehner about the budget?
MR. OBAMA: Fairly recently, yes. Probably right before they left.
Okay. Scott Horseley.
Q Thank you, Mr. President. Part of the political logic behind immigration reform was the strong showing by Latino voters last November. That doesn't seem to resonate with a lot of House Republicans who represent overwhelmingly white districts. What other political leverage can you bring to bear to help move a bill in the House?
MR. OBAMA: Well, we've got an economic report that shows that our economy would be a trillion dollars stronger if we get immigration reform done. We've got evidence that our housing market would be stronger if immigrants are in a situation in which, having paid a fine, having paid back taxes, that they now have the ability to actually enter into the housing market. We've got strong evidence that our technological and research edge would be better if we get immigration reform done.
We know that the Senate bill strengthens border security, puts unprecedented resources on top of the unprecedented resources I've already put into border security. So if your main priority is border security, I'd think you'd want to vote for this bill. We know that the Senate bill creates a system in which employers are held accountable for when they hire undocumented workers. This is something that people say is a bad thing. I agree. Let's make sure that that system for holding employers accountable is in place.
So when I hear the opposition to immigration reform, I just run through the list of things they're concerned about, I look at what the Senate bill does, and I say to myself, you know what, the Senate bill actually improves the situation on every issue that they say they're concerned about.
Now, what they may argue is it doesn't solve the problem 100 percent. I don't know a law that solves a problem 100 percent. Social Security lifted millions of seniors out of poverty, but there are still some poor seniors. The Civil Rights Act and the Voting Rights Act drastically reduced discrimination in America, but there's still discrimination. That doesn't make them bad laws, it just means that there are very few human problems that are 100 percent solvable.
So what I see right now is a strong bipartisan vote coming out of the Senate. I think that the Speaker and others have said they need to do something, and I'd urge, when they get back, to do something -- put forward a bill that has an opportunity to actually pass. It may not be precisely what's in the Senate bill. My preference would be for them to go ahead and call the Senate bill. But if they've got some additional ideas, I think the Senate is happy to consider them. And get that bill on the floor, put it up for a vote.
I am absolutely certain that the votes for the Senate bill -- which strengthens border security; demands responsibility from undocumented workers to pay a fine, pay a penalty and get to the back of the line; reforms our legal immigration system; holds employers accountable -- I am absolutely confident that if that bill was on the floor of the House, it would pass.
So the challenge right now is not that there aren't a majority of House members, just like a majority of Senate members, who aren't prepared to support this bill. The problem is internal Republican caucus politics. And that's what the American people don't want us to be worrying about. Don't worry about your Washington politics. Solve problems.
And this is one where you've actually got some pretty broad consensus. I don't know an issue where you've got labor, the Chamber of Commerce, evangelicals, student groups -- you name it -- supportive of a bill. Let's get it done.
Thank you very much, everybody.

HEADLINE: Postal Service Is Still Losing Money, but Not Quite as Much

BYLINE: By RON NIXON

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- The Postal Service on Friday reported a net loss of $740 million in the third quarter, compared with a $1.9 billion loss in the previous quarter, a better-than-expected performance for the agency, which has been shackled by falling revenues and a Congressional mandate that requires it to annually pay billions of dollars into a health fund for future retirees.
Over all, the post office reported operating revenues of $16.2 billion in the third quarter, which ended June 30, compared with $15.6 billion over the same period last year, a 3.6 percent increase. It attributed the increase to cost-cutting measures and strong growth in e-commerce deliveries. 
Postal officials said the service's expenses were $16.9 billion, compared with $20.8 billion over the same time last year. Expenses were lowered by a $918 million decrease in workers' compensation costs because of lower interest rates.
''The Postal Service's latest quarterly report makes clear that Postal Service finances are rebounding strongly as the U.S. economy improves,'' said Fredric V. Rolando, president of the National Association of Letter Carriers. He said that the post office would have made a profit of $660 million without the health fund payments required by Congress.
Mail volume continues to fall, but not as sharply as in the past. Total volume for the quarter was 37.9 billion pieces, compared with 38.3 billion over the same period last year. The volume of first-class mail, the largest revenue source for the post office, declined about 3.4 percent. Revenues generated by first-class mail were about $6.9 billion, down about 1 percent, or $60 million, from the same period last year.
Revenue from advertising mail -- many call it junk mail -- increased by $117 million, or 3 percent, compared with the same period a year earlier. Revenue from package deliveries also continued to grow. Revenue was $2.9 billion, up $237 million, or 8.8 percent, over last year.
Despite a somewhat better financial picture, the post office said it continued to suffer from the 2006 Congressional mandate that requires it to pay $5.5 billion annually into a health fund for future retirees.
The service defaulted on two payments last year for the first time and said it would not be able to make payments into the fund this year.
To increase revenues, postal officials have asked Congress for the authority to enter into new lines of business like beer and wine delivery, which are now forbidden. It has also asked Congress to change the mandate for the retirees' health fund.
Congress has recently begun working on a postal overhaul bill after similar legislation failed last year. The Senate passed its version of the bill last year, but a House measure never made it out of committee.
Last month, a House committee passed a bill that would allow the post office to phase out letter delivery on Saturday, but six-day delivery would continue for packages and medicine. The bill would also end delivery to individual homes in favor of cluster boxes. It would also forgive the two health fund payments the post office missed last year, but would not end the payments. The Senate has not begun work on its version of the postal overhaul.
''We are encouraged that comprehensive postal reform legislation has started making its way through the legislative process in both the House and Senate,'' said Patrick R. Donahoe, the postmaster general.

HEADLINE: Japan's Debt Looks Like This: 1,000,000,000,000,000 Yen

BYLINE: By JOHN SCHWARTZ

 BODY:
Japan's soaring national debt, already more than twice the size of its economy, has reached a new milestone, surpassing one quadrillion yen.
Let the word quadrillion roll around in your brain for a moment or two, because it is not something you hear every day. Quadrillion. 1,000,000,000,000,000. Really. 
A paltry million is the numeral one followed by six zeros. A billion? Nine zeros. A trillion is getting up there: 12 zeros. But the mighty quadrillion has 15 of them.
The mind boggles. (Though it doesn't googol: that one is followed by 100 zeros. And that's the actual spelling. You can Google it.)
A quadrillion is a million billion, putting it into the kind of language used by middle schoolers to describe really humongous sums, along with gazillion and bazillion.
Measuring any currency in quadrillions brings to mind the hyperinflation of Germany between the wars, or Zimbabwe in the last decade. But a country with a real currency?
It is such a big and unusual word, describing such a big and unusual number, that its use is inconsistent: Bloomberg News used quadrillion in the headline of an early story on Friday about Japan's debt, but later in the day the stories and headlines referred to a ''thousand trillion,'' which is not nearly as much fun.
Questions e-mailed to the Bloomberg editors responsible for those stories were not returned, suggesting perhaps a lexicographical quadrilliongate.
How much is a quadrillion? The entire human body is said to have just 100 trillion cells; it takes 10 of us to make a quadrillion. Jeff Bezos has a personal fortune of some $25 billion, allowing him to plunk down $250 million for The Washington Post, which is essentially how much money he might find by looking behind his sofa cushions. To get to a quadrillion dollars, however, we would have to have 40,000 Bezoses, or as many people as live in Prescott, Ariz.
Neil deGrasse Tyson, the astrophysicist and director of the Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, helpfully offered a few other ways to think about a quadrillion. ''It would take you 31 million years to count to a quadrillion -- one number per second, never sleeping,'' he said in an e-mail, adding that ''a quadrillion yen, stacked in 1,000-yen notes, would ascend 70,000 miles high.''
He also wrote, though it is not clear how he would know such a thing, that ''the total number of all sounds and words ever uttered by all humans who have ever lived is about 100 quadrillion.''
''This figure includes all Congressional debates and filibusters,'' Mr. Tyson wrote.
Compared with Japan, the United States national debt is a mere $16 trillion or so. But if you convert that number into yen, it comes to about 1.5 quadrillion. So it's good to have a currency that conserves its zeros. Of course, that also means the total American debt is even larger than Japan's (though not, it should be noted, as a percentage of gross domestic product).
Hmm. Let's not talk about that.

HEADLINE: Cable Customers as Collateral Damage

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
CBS and Time Warner Cable have been engaged in a contract fight that has left millions of residents in cities like New York, Los Angeles and Dallas without access to the network's programming on their TVs and computers for almost a week. 
There is no claim to moral high ground here, just dollars and cents. CBS wants Time Warner Cable to pay more for its programming, and it also wants the ability to sell that programming to other distributors of TV shows and movies like Netflix and Intel, which is planning a new television service. Time Warner Cable says it is willing to pay more but does not want to change its contracts with CBS. The terms of the contracts have not been made public.
Lost in such cable battles are frustrated consumers, who pay for TV shows through their cable bills but have no representation at the negotiating table even though media and cable companies rely on public resources like spectrum and rights of way. (On Friday, the chairwoman of the Federal Communications Commission said she would intervene if the two sides did not reach a deal.)
There were 91 blackouts of TV networks on cable and satellite systems across the country last year, up from 12 in 2010, according to the American Television Alliance, a group backed by cable companies. Contract disputes are increasing because new technology has strengthened the hands of networks like CBS by giving them other outlets, including Netflix, Amazon and Apple, through which to sell their content. The networks are rapidly becoming less dependent on traditional distributors like cable and satellite companies.
While Time Warner Cable customers could find ways to watch CBS by, for instance, buying antennas, why should they have to when their cable bill includes the cost of that programming? In fact, the cost of expanded basic cable, the most popular service, has risen 3.4 times faster than inflation from 1995 to 2009, according to a 2011 report by the F.C.C. (The number of channels in cable plans has also gone up during that time, but most consumers watch only a fraction of the networks to which they have access.) Not surprisingly, those higher bills have led to rising profits for both broadcasters like CBS and distributors like Time Warner Cable.
We don't presume to advise media or cable companies on their negotiating tactics. But infuriating customers who are already annoyed at ever higher costs and have other options -- like giving up their cable connections and relying only on broadcast signals and Netflix -- seems a bad business move for both sides. These disputes can only make those options seem more appealing.

HEADLINE: Taiwan Ends Sanctions Against Philippines Over Shooting Death

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ

 BODY:
BEIJING -- Taiwan has ended sanctions against the Philippines after accepting an apology from Manila for the fatal shooting of a Taiwanese fisherman in May by the Philippine Coast Guard. 
Amadeo R. Perez, the chairman of the Manila Economic and Cultural Office, which operates as the Philippines' de facto embassy in Taipei, the Taiwanese capital, flew to Taiwan on Thursday and offered an ''official apology'' on behalf of President Benigno S. Aquino III for the killing of the fisherman, Hung Shih-cheng, 65, who died from a bullet wound in the neck. The sanctions had hurt migrant Filipino laborers, who were barred from Taiwan's lucrative labor market, and curbed the vibrant travel business between Taiwan and the Philippines.
Philippine investigators this week recommended homicide charges against eight Philippine Coast Guard members for Mr. Hung's killing. Taiwan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said the Philippines had also agreed to pay compensation to Mr. Hung's family.
The Philippine economy relies on remittances from overseas workers. In 2011, the last year for which data is available, 41,896 Filipinos went to work in Taiwan, according to the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration.
The diplomatic squabble over the shooting touched on competing claims between the Philippines and Taiwan in waters in and around the South China Sea, where China, Brunei, Vietnam, Malaysia and other nations are also at loggerheads.
The Philippines said the Taiwan fishing vessel had entered waters in its exclusive economic zone and had tried to ram a Philippine Coast Guard ship. Taiwan said the shooting occurred within exclusive economic zones claimed by both countries.
Mr. Hung's killing prompted calls in Taiwan for tough action against the Philippines. Politicians and editorial writers said that Taiwan could not afford to suffer in silence out of fear of antagonizing the United States, an ally of the Philippines, and that a soft stance would only mean further international marginalization of the self-governing island, which China considers a renegade province and which enjoys formal diplomatic relations with few countries.
Mr. Aquino offered an informal apology soon after the shooting, an effort that Taiwan rejected as inadequate. But on Thursday, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Taipei said, ''Effective today, relations between our two countries are back to normal.''
The reconciliation between the Philippines and Taiwan stands in clear contrast to the increasingly chilly relations over the South China Sea between China and the Philippines. Manila has filed an arbitration case against China's territorial claims to the South China Sea at the international tribunal that governs the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.

HEADLINE: Comptroller Rivals Meet, And Hold Nothing Back

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
In their first face-to-face confrontation, Scott M. Stringer attacked Eliot Spitzer on Friday as a wealthy lawbreaker whom the voters should not trust with managing New York City's money. Mr. Spitzer, in turn, described Mr. Stringer as a career politician who had accomplished little in his 20 years in elected office.
The two Democratic candidates for city comptroller sparred over substance and personal style in the spirited hourlong debate, recorded for broadcast this weekend. Mr. Stringer accused Mr. Spitzer of spying on his enemies and clashing with allies, and Mr. Spitzer portrayed Mr. Stringer as a ''go-along-to-get-along'' member of the political establishment. 
Mr. Stringer, who when Mr. Spitzer first entered the race said that he would not talk about the prostitution scandal that led to Mr. Spitzer's resignation as governor, raised that issue early and often, asserting that Mr. Spitzer had evaded responsibility for his actions because of his wealth and influence.
''Right now there's two tiers of justice in this city,'' said Mr. Stringer, who is the Manhattan borough president. ''There's one for the rich and powerful, and there's one for the rest of us. The truth of the matter is Eliot Spitzer represents the tier where he can escape prostitution -- uh, prosecution.''
There were several sharp exchanges. In response to a question about whether the comptroller should be the ''sheriff'' or ''cheerleader'' of Wall Street, Mr. Stringer said that the comptroller should be ''the steward, a responsible manager of our pension system.''
When it was his turn to speak, Mr. Spitzer said that the comptroller needed to be more than a ''shepherd.''
''Steward,'' Mr. Stringer interrupted, wagging his index finger.
Mr. Spitzer began to laugh.
''Scott, I guess the simple question I would ask is, where were you?'' he said, listing the investigations of Wall Street institutions that he conducted as attorney general in the years leading up to the financial crisis.
''I credit you for the past but you've been on the sidelines for five years,'' Mr. Stringer replied, adding, ''Maybe you should go run for attorney general and lose to Eric Schneiderman.''
Later, Mr. Spitzer spoke dismissively of Mr. Stringer's 20 years in office, asking,"What indelible mark have you left on policy?''
Mr. Stringer shot back that Mr. Spitzer had been ''a colossal failure as governor.''
In a preview of what is most likely going to be a major topic in the Democratic mayoral debates, Mr. Spitzer accused Mr. Stringer of ''subverting democracy'' by supporting the lifting of term limits that allowed Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg to run for a third term. (In 2008, Mr. Stringer testified in favor of lifting term limits before the City Council.)
''Mr. Stringer was there to go along to get along, to give a third term, contrary to the will and wishes of the public, contrary to law, contrary to what democracy demanded,'' Mr. Spitzer said.
Asked later to respond, Mr. Stringer said he had always opposed term limits.
''I don't support term limits, never have, never will,'' he said. ''I've been consistent on that.''
The debate was held at the Manhattan studios of WABC-TV, which co-sponsored it. It will be broadcast on Sunday morning.

HEADLINE: Amid Domestic Deadlines and Global Crises, Obama Begins a Shorter Break

BYLINE: By JACKIE CALMES

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- President Obama heads to Martha's Vineyard on Saturday for his family's almost-annual August vacation, toting the usual baggage of unrelenting global crises but stealing a week's break before dealing with looming deadlines for the budget, his health care law and the appointment of a new Federal Reserve chairman.
The getaway will be Mr. Obama's fourth in five years; he skipped last year during the presidential campaign. Like his predecessors, he is leaving as pundits and partisan opponents question whether it is a good time for him to be away -- once again showing that for presidents, there never seems to be a good time. 
When the White House disclosed that Mr. Obama would limit his stay to one week instead of two, there was speculation that the Obama team was worried that a longer vacation would be politically unseemly when across-the-board budget reductions, known as sequestration, are forcing furloughs and other cutbacks in military and domestic programs. But in the days before his departure, the administration's global alert of potential terrorism attacks raised new questions about the vacation's timing, and among the aides with Mr. Obama will be his national security adviser, Susan E. Rice.
Mr. Obama and his wife, Michelle, will first fly on Saturday to Orlando, Fla., where each will speak at a convention of disabled veterans. It will be the president's second trip this week to speak to members of the military, after Wednesday's pep talk to about 3,000 Marines and sailors at Camp Pendleton, Calif.
In a news conference on Friday, Mr. Obama addressed some of the issues that he will confront after he returns.
He held to his earlier timetable in saying he would decide ''in the fall'' on his choice to succeed Ben S. Bernanke as chairman of the Fed -- ending any speculation that he might announce his choice while he is on Martha's Vineyard, as he did in 2009 when he went before cameras with Mr. Bernanke to say that he wanted the Fed chairman, a Bush appointee, to serve another term.
Mr. Obama called the much-anticipated nomination to replace Mr. Bernanke ''definitely one of the most important economic decisions that I'll make in the remainder of my presidency.''
''The Federal Reserve chairman is not just one of the most important economic policy makers in America, he or she is one of the most important policy makers in the world,'' Mr. Obama added. ''And that person presumably will stay on after I'm president. So this, along with Supreme Court appointments, is probably as important a decision as I make as president.''
The president's use of ''he or she'' was no accident, given that the two main candidates are Lawrence H. Summers -- who was Mr. Obama's White House economic adviser during his first term and a Treasury secretary in the Clinton administration -- and Janet Yellen, another former Clinton economic adviser and now vice chairman of the Fed.
Mr. Obama reiterated that ''there are a couple of other candidates who are highly qualified as well,'' but the contest has been between Mr. Summers and Ms. Yellen. Liberal Democrats, especially women, have called for Ms. Yellen -- she would be the first woman to lead the Fed -- but people familiar with Mr. Obama's deliberations give the edge to Mr. Summers.
The president, however, said his recent public comments supportive of Mr. Summers should not be taken as a signal of his intent, but only as a defense of his former adviser against what Mr. Obama sees as unfair criticism.
''When somebody has worked hard for me and worked hard on behalf of the American people, and I know the quality of those people, and I see them getting slapped around in the press for no reason -- before they've even been nominated for anything -- then I want to make sure that somebody is standing up for them,'' Mr. Obama said.
Anticipating one of the biggest fights ahead, the president all but dared Congressional Republicans to follow through on their threats to shut down the government unless the annual spending bills due Oct. 1, the start of the fiscal year, defund the health care law, his signature domestic achievement.
Oct. 1 also is the starting date for a crucial piece of the law -- when people among the 15 percent of uninsured Americans can begin signing up for coverage in state-based marketplaces, known as exchanges, where insurance companies will compete to offer policies.
''The idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea,'' Mr. Obama said.
He emphasized, too, the law's benefits already in effect for the 85 percent of Americans who have coverage, and provisions barring companies from refusing insurance to those with pre-existing medical conditions.
Republicans ''used to say they had a replacement,'' Mr. Obama said, adding, ''Now I just don't hear about it, because basically they don't have an agenda to provide health insurance to people at affordable rates.''

HEADLINE: New Data Suggest a Pause in China's Slowdown

BYLINE: By BETTINA WASSENER

 BODY:
HONG KONG -- China's economy faces major structural challenges in the coming years, but for now, the slowdown of the recent past may have bottomed out.
A new batch of economic data released Friday provided additional signs of buoyancy in an economy that has been weighed down by lackluster international demand. The Chinese government has also taken a tough-love approach, eager to wean the country from its reliance on exports and cheap credit.
Industrial output growth, which had been languishing around 9 percent for the past few months, jumped to 9.7 percent in July, the National Bureau of Statistics reported. The figure easily beat expectations for a rise of 9 percent, and helped support tentative signs that conditions in the country's manufacturing sector were starting to show a moderate improvement. 
Retail sales grew 13.2 percent from a year earlier, slightly less than the 13.5 percent that analysts polled by Reuters had expected, but in line with the performance of the past few months.
And investment in fixed assets, like buildings and machinery, in urban areas also was in line with expectations, growing 20.1 percent in the first seven months of this year.
Together with unexpectedly solid import and export data released Thursday, this week's data appeared to show that the Chinese economy has stabilized, at least for now, and prompted some analysts to project a modest pickup in the coming months.
''The better-than-expected July activity data has largely dampened the concern of a hard landing of China's economy,'' economists at Australia and New Zealand Banking Group wrote in a note. It suggests that China's economy ''is bottoming out.''
China had been gradually losing steam for many months as it left behind the supercharged growth that turned it into the world's second-largest economy, after the United States. Economic growth is likely to come in at about 7.5 percent this year, a far cry from the double-digit annual increases the country enjoyed for much of the past three decades.
Still, the data for July appeared to indicate that some of the recent drags on growth have eased.
Export demand from the West has improved as the United States and other economies have gained momentum. And domestically, the authorities in Beijing have clarified in recent weeks that while they are prepared to tolerate slower growth, they will also step in to prevent growth from slowing too rapidly.
Beijing has also announced a string of small-scale measures aimed at propping up activity -- tax cuts for small businesses, for example, and measures aimed at speeding up railroad construction in inland and poor areas.
The improved policy clarity and support measures appear to have encouraged the increased activity, especially in the private sector, said Stephen Schwartz, chief economist for Asia at the Spanish bank BBVA in Hong Kong.
The latest reports on Friday ''gives us more confidence in our forecast that growth will stabilize in the third quarter, and pick up gradually in the fourth quarter,'' Mr. Schwartz said. However, like many other analysts, he said that the outlook for next year and beyond remained uncertain as China battles with the tough overhauls that are needed as the country tries to shift toward more efficient, balanced and sustainable growth.
Economic turmoil in the West and rising wages at home have undermined the export growth that formed the bedrock of China's growth for decades. The fact that China's population is aging and its labor force is shrinking means there is an urgent need to raise labor productivity and reduce the inefficiencies and misallocations of capital that have marred growth for years. And overcapacity, corruption and poor allocation of assets continue to affect growth.
Inflation figures released Friday underlined the challenges facing many industries. While consumer price inflation remained muted in July, at 2.7 percent, the price of goods as they leave the factory gate fell 2.3 percent from a year ago, continuing a decline that has lasted for more than a year.
Beijing has sought to rein in credit in a bid to tackle the flow of easy money that fueled growth in recent years, but that has generated worries about asset quality and potentially destabilizing defaults further down the line.
These challenges will weigh on China for years, prompting some analysts to warn -- despite the apparent stabilization in July -- that growth will slow to well below the current official target of 7.5 percent.
''While we believe the government could delay sub-7 percent growth into 2014, we do not believe it can be avoided,'' Zhang Zhiwei, China economist at Nomura, wrote in a note, adding that he believed the government was likely to cut its growth target for next year to 7 percent.
''Leverage in the economy remains high, and many industries continue to face overcapacity problems,'' Mr. Zhang said. ''The resolution of these problems will inevitably require a period of constructive destruction -- expect some bankruptcy cases.''

HEADLINE: At Newtown Starbucks, A Gun Event Is Shut Out

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME and ELIZABETH MAKER; Elizabeth Maker contributed reporting from Newtown.

 BODY:
The nation's gun owners declared Friday Starbucks Appreciation Day, but in Newtown, Conn., not everyone seemed very appreciative.
Instead, the local Starbucks closed five hours early, disappointing some gun owners who had planned to show up wearing holstered pistols to make a statement in favor of gun rights and Starbucks' policies.
The event had already infuriated many residents still reeling from the murder of 26 children and educators at Sandy Hook Elementary School in December. 
A sign at the coffee shop read: ''Out of respect for Newtown and everything our community has been through, we have decided to close our store early today.''
Earlier, however, more than two dozen gun rights supporters, some wearing pistols, camouflage or Connecticut Citizens Defense League T-shirts, showed up to show their support. The company said it had no participation in the event. Gun critics also turned out to voice their opposition.
Long after the store shut down around 4:30, people on both sides of the gun divide stayed outside in the heavy rain, the gun supporters standing on the left, many smoking cigarettes, and the gun opponents to the right, holding lighted candles.
''Little do these ignorant people know that we come in here every day for coffee, carrying our weapons,'' said Tom Catalina, 64, of Newtown. ''Starbucks has always been open about their support of the Second Amendment and our right to carry, whether open or concealed. Guns make people safer.''
The anti-gun crowd wound up getting their coffee and doughnuts from Dunkin' Donuts down the road, and passed out pins that read, ''Moms Demand Action for Gun Sense in America.''
One of them was Barbara Kraushaar, 62, who lives around the corner from the home of Adam Lanza, the gunman who killed the students and school employees at Sandy Hook on Dec. 14. ''Hey! Did you know you're not allowed to smoke on Starbucks property?'' she yelled to one of the men carrying a gun. ''You don't care about anything, just what pertains to you!''
The man walked away a bit but did not put out his cigarette.
Tears started streaming down Ms. Kraushaar's cheeks. ''How can they even think of being here?'' she asked. ''It is so 'In your face!' It's plain disgusting and heartless.''
Earlier, the Newtown Action Alliance issued a statement, discouraging gun rights groups from holding Starbucks Appreciation Day in Newtown.
''Our community is still healing, and we find it reprehensible that they are picking Newtown to rally,'' the statement said.
Po Murray, vice chairwoman of the group, called the plan ''tasteless and insensitive'' and said that just as Starbucks does not allow smoking within 25 feet of its buildings, it should take a stand on gun violence by not allowing customers to carry weapons there.
Usually associated with latte and cappuccino rather than Smith & Wesson, Starbucks has drawn praise from gun owners and criticism from anti-gun groups for its policy allowing people to openly carry guns in states, like Connecticut, that allow it.
The National Gun Victims Action Council said that unlike companies like California Pizza Kitchen, Peet's Coffee and Tea and Ikea, Starbucks had declined to ban guns from its stores. Starbucks said it simply follows the laws as they exist in all states.
The anti-gun group has identified Starbucks as its first economic target and has sponsored a two-year-old boycott of the company by ''gun victims, survivors, their friends, family members, faith groups and all who want sane gun laws.'' It says that the boycott has cost the company $11.5 million a year, and that it plans to step up its pressure on Starbucks in the future.
The group says the efforts to openly display handguns at restaurants and coffee shops are part of a national effort to ''normalize the carrying of guns in public places.''
It said: ''Starbucks' pro-gun policy on open carry makes it an active supporter of the gun lobby's agenda to put more guns in more places in American life -- and it must stop.''
On the other hand, gun owners have singled out Starbucks for praise and support. A Facebook page said gun supporters should thank Starbucks ''for standing up for our right to bear arms by going there on Friday.''
Starbucks has found itself in the middle of controversy before, mostly on the other side of the political spectrum, over its support for gay marriage.
''Our longstanding approach to the open carry debate has been to comply with local laws and statutes in the communities we serve,'' said Zack Hutson, a company spokesman. ''We continue to encourage customers and advocacy groups from all sides of the debate to share their input with their elected officials, who make the open carry laws that our company follows.''

HEADLINE: Globalization and Keynesianism

BYLINE: PAUL KRUGMAN


HIGHLIGHT: Not such a big deal. 

 BODY:
Looking at some of the comments on yesterday's column, I see that a fair number of readers believe that Keynes is no longer valid because any increase in domestic demand will simply "leak" abroad. This is a widespread view, but it's wrong. Globalization has been impressive, but it has not proceeded far enough to make Keynesian analysis irrelevant. 
Actually, you should realize this point immediately just by thinking about the Great Recession itself. If domestic spending all goes on stuff made in China, the one-two punch of plunging home construction and falling consumer spending should have done all its damage abroad, not here in America. Obviously that didn't happen.
But we can also look at the issue directly. The fact is that despite rising trade, a large majority of workers in America still produce goods and services that can't be traded. My favorite estimates here come from Jensen and Kletzer (pdf), who use geographical variation across the United States to estimate which industries and occupations are tradable (Silicon Valley has a way disproportionate number of software engineers, demonstrating that those engineers are producing stuff that can be exported to other locations; retail employs about the same fraction of the labor force everywhere, demonstrating that it can't be traded). Their results look like this:
Add to this the point that even tradable industries are strongly affected by domestic demand, and you find that globalization has not, in fact, changed the rules all that much.
I should also mention Nakamura and Steinsson (pdf), who use regional variation to estimate the size of the fiscal multiplier; they find that for U.S. regions, it comes in at around 1.5. And the U.S. economy as a whole is much less open than any one of its regions, so the overall multiplier should be larger. Again, globalization apparently doesn't change the basics.
In the long run, Keynes is still alive.

HEADLINE: Some Quick Runs On Indian's Bikes

BYLINE: By JERRY GARRETT

 BODY:
The latest attempt to revive the historic Indian motorcycle brand was unveiled Saturday evening in Sturgis, S.D., where the massive annual biker rally was under way.
The newest Indian Motorcycle lineup -- created by Polaris Industries after the company acquired all the rights to the Indian name, trademarks and bikes two years ago -- consists of three models: the Chief Classic, which starts at $18,999; the Chief Vintage, a soft bagger at $20,999; and the $22,999 Chieftain, the brand's first hard bagger.
In a sneak preview last week near the company's headquarters outside of Minneapolis, I had a chance to view, evaluate and test-ride the bikes. I will reserve final judgment until after a more thorough chance to spend time on the bikes, but I can say my initial impressions were entirely favorable. 
Polaris, which also owns the Victory brand of motorcycles it started about 15 years ago, brings the kind of engineering know-how, deep financial reserves, styling expertise and marketing muscle that Indian has been starved for almost since its founding in 1901.
The original Indian marque went bust in the 1950s, and other groups have tried to resuscitate the brand, without lasting success, since then. One of the limiting factors has been trying to honor Indian's classic styling, with thick, valanced fenders -- a look that has been frozen in time, like a fly in amber.
Polaris has managed to walk the fine styling line between character and caricature. Its Indian motorcycles feature the requisite gobs of chrome, lavishly sculptured parts and voluptuous lines. The ''wow'' factor when first seeing the bikes cannot be understated. They exude the essential amounts of charisma, cachet and mystique that I believe are needed for this Indian revival to have staying power, not to mention giving rival Harley-Davidson a run for its customers.
The beating heart of all three bikes is the new Thunder Stroke 111 engine -- the first all-new Indian powerplant in 70 years, Gary Gray, Indian's product director, told me in an interview last week.
''It is a 49-degree, air-cooled V-twin with 6-speed overdrive transmission,'' he said. ''It produces 119 foot-pounds of torque, and it will fly.''
Horsepower is a nonpublished number, but there certainly seemed to be plenty of punch available during a two-hour test ride on rural roads around sections of historic Highway 61. The engine delivers immediate and substantial bursts of power when prompted in any gear. The exhaust notes are deftly tuned to deliver optimum, but not deafening, amounts of burble, howl and wail -- critical aural components of any cruiser-style motorcycle aspiring to compete for the hearts, minds and ears of the ''loud pipes save lives'' Harley crowd.
The engine felt as if it could tolerate a lot of hard riding; it has the equivalent of 2.5 million miles of development behind it, Mr. Gray said.
Even when ridden at high speed on badly worn washboard pavement, the bike kept its composure. It cornered well and felt much more maneuverable and nimble than its substantial curb presence might suggest.
The riding position was perfect for my 5-foot-11 frame, and I felt like I could ride long distances without fatigue -- a good thing, considering the bike has a range of well over 200 miles per fill-up. Mr. Gray said the bike had a 5.5-gallon tank, and fuel economy ''in the low- to mid-40s.''
The designers have ticked the correct nostalgia boxes in styling the bikes.
The Thunder Stroke has the traditional Indian left side air intake and straight down exhausts. The bike has the valanced fenders and war bonnet chief logo on the front fender, said Steve Menneto, Polaris's vice president for motorcycles, in an interview. ''We decided it had to have five or six traditional styling cues, sort of like Chevrolet keyed on in the revival of the Camaro -- only with those cues brought forward and updated with modern-day technology.''
For instance, the war bonnet lights up with LEDs; in fact, all the lighting on the new Indian models employ LEDs exclusively. Although I did not ride the bikes at night, the lighting brightly illuminated the darkened barn in which the bikes were stashed.
Polaris has tried to anticipate every argument a potential customer might have against giving the new Indian a try.
''We are offering a one-year unlimited warranty and four years of extended service,'' Mr. Gray said. ''We will also offer trade-in assurance: 70 percent of its original value after two years, 60 percent after three years.''
A television ad developed for the introduction shows a Harley owner lavishly cleaning, buffing and shining his bike; in the ad's punchline, he slaps a For Sale sign on it and walks away. After riding the new Indian, I get it.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: A Game of Catch, or Hot Potato?

BYLINE: By JESSICA BENNETT

 BODY:
It started like most, with a call from the wedding D.J. for the unattached to make their way to the dance floor. The group of women gathered slowly, in silk and taffeta, arms ceremoniously outstretched. The bouquet went flying, the California desert sky in the background. Then it fell, bounced and rested squarely at the group's feet.
The women looked at one another, then back at the floor, then back at one another, then back at the floor. Finally, there was a nudge, a grimace, and a hand went down and the bouquet came up. The room clapped, the music went back on and the so-called lucky woman tossed the flowers onto a dining table and knocked back a chardonnay.
''Thank God that's over,'' another guest said with a shudder. 
In truth, it was a good bouquet toss; any one of the women could have caught it. But none of them wanted to.
''I don't think any of us had any intention of catching it,'' said Crystal Cappuccio, the 31-year-old school counselor who rescued the wilted succulents from the floor. ''I like tradition and I like ceremony, but most of my friends have stopped throwing bouquets at this point, to spare their single female friends the torture.''
Remember the days of women elbowing for the chance to catch the wedding bouquet? Of reveling in the silly symbolism of being the next in line? The bouquet toss has been around for centuries as a ritual of good fortune. And yet today many women are not so subtly rejecting it, the latest tradition teetering on irrelevance, thanks in part to women's rising economic status and changing views on marriage.
''There's something about jumping for a bouquet that reflects the era, not so long ago, when getting married was seen as the pinnacle of a woman's existence,'' said Sara Wilson, a former editor of the wedding and divorce sections of The Huffington Post.
She has noticed that the tradition had disappeared from most of the dozen weddings she has attended in the last two years. ''Despite what rom-coms might have us believe, most women who are old enough to have C-suite jobs and mortgages don't relish the opportunity to catch airborne hydrangeas,'' she said.
Sure, catching a bouquet might have been fun in your early 20s -- when you could make a joke out of it, and nobody expected you to marry. But for some women in urban circles, where the ages of those marrying for the first time tend to be higher than average, the mere act of tossing a bouquet (and even more so, any attempt to catch it) has been inching toward becoming all but taboo.
Let's face it, in a group of women in their 30s, who among them wants to risk being viewed as desperate?
''As someone who was among the last of my friends to get married at 34, I hated when I was expected to go out onto the dance floor as a single adult woman and wait for someone to throw her bouquet in hopes that it would mean I might be the next to get married,'' said Lauren Kattany Black, a trauma nurse. So out went the tradition when she was wed on Cape Cod in April. ''I didn't want my single girlfriends to be subjected to that,'' she said.
Diana Nguyen, a 31-year-old television producer in Los Angeles, said, ''I don't like the idea that my value might be attributed to what place in line I am to be married.''
In many parts of the country, the bouquet toss is thriving. Jessen Myburgh, 27, a bride-to-be from Seattle, said, ''I will guarantee that there will be a crowd of barefoot, elbowing women jumping when I throw those flowers.''
But wedding planners and photographers say that the popularity of this ritual has been sliding for some time. In Minnesota, Natasha Frost became a local celebrity when, at her wedding in April, she presented her bouquet to her lesbian sister and her sister's partner, as a statement of support for same-sex marriage, which became legal in the state earlier this month.
Kate Middleton didn't throw her bouquet, opting instead to place it at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior at Westminster Abbey. (In this case, tradition dictated she should follow the pattern set by the mother of Queen Elizabeth II.)
''Yes, I think that this particular ritual is either treated as camp or mildly embarrassing where it's still used at all, which is quite a contrast from the 1950s and 1960s,'' said Stephanie Coontz, author of ''Marriage, a History: How Love Conquered Marriage.'' ''There are some rituals that, despite their unsavory origins, have a bit of sense today. I don't see anything very positive about the idea that every woman who is not married is desperately waiting to be.''
Philip N. Cohen, a sociologist at the University of Maryland at College Park, said: ''People increasingly see marriage as a part of their whole life package, something that follows educational and career achievement. If that is the attitude, then the idea that a woman would be thrilled by an early, unplanned marriage proposal seems anachronistic. Catching a bouquet doesn't mean you or your boyfriend has a secure job. It doesn't mean your relationship is stable.''
As it turns out, expressing even the faintest desire to catch a bouquet these days is like a giant red warning label.
There was a time when you were a freak if you didn't dive in for the catch. As late as the 1950s, Ms. Coontz said, almost 90 percent of Americans believed that a woman who didn't want to marry was ''maladjusted.'' But nowadays, it's the overeager bridesmaid with her elbows out who's the laughingstock.
''This tradition pulls at two competing societal messages,'' said Ms. Cappuccio. ''First, that we should get married and want to get married to have a full and complete life. And second, that it's O.K. not to be married by age 30, but just don't be the type of person who is pursuing marriage, because that is desperate.''
Like many a tradition before it, perhaps the bouquet toss will fade from view -- replaced, instead, by varying attempts at ritual deconstruction in the hope that it can disperse the symbolism of the toss.
Rebecca Dolgin, the editor in chief of theKnot.com, said she has heard of a number of brides who had tossed loose bouquets, so that everybody got a flower, and lesbian couples who had each opted to carry a bundle.
At one recent wedding, the bridesmaid who caught the flowers proceeded to unfasten and hand them out to the crowd. And at least three recently married women who were interviewed said they could not remember whether they had tossed their bouquets or not.
Ms. Nguyen is not prepared to give up having and passing on a bouquet for her own wedding next summer. But she won't throw it. ''I might gently give it to someone who likes flowers,'' she said.
But even as these women back away from the bouquet toss, others who were long denied the pleasures of this and other wedding traditions may be ready to embrace them.
Liba Rubenstein, 29, who works in social media in Los Angeles, said, ''I can say that of the dozen weddings I've been to in the last few years, only one of them has included a bouquet toss.'' She added, ''Naturally, it was caught by a gay man.''

HEADLINE: As a City Flounders, Its Art Scene Flourishes

BYLINE: By COURTNEY BALESTIER

 BODY:
The night of June 20 was the Detroit native and photographer Sebastian Sullen's first art exhibition, a group show called ''Art Ethereal: Beauty and the Beast,'' named for his contradictory subject: his city's majestic architecture and scarred urban blight. Part of a monthly event called Third Thursday, the show packed the Detroit Mercantile Company, a retro general store and event space. There were carrot cake, beer from a nano-brewery and, in the storefront, ''You Gotta Save Art!'' stickers ($2.50) and T-shirts ($25) for sale in support of the Detroit Institute of Arts.
It was an apt message, even more so now. On July 18, Detroit, the cradle of the country's automobile industry, filed for bankruptcy, the largest American city to ever do so. The tumble into insolvency has left officials pondering the likely fallout. For example, the Detroit Institute of Arts, which is owned by the city, faces the possibility of the sale of artwork from its impressive collection, which includes gems by van Gogh, Diego Rivera, Caravaggio, Breugel, Rembrandt, Rodin and Picasso, to help pay down the city's crippling debts. 
How Detroit's bankruptcy will affect cultural life, and the 20 million tourists who visit the metro region a year, remains to be seen. But the city's tourism bureau and others say that what the local government does has little bearing on what attracts people to Detroit. ''Private investment in the city is at an all-time high, and while the bankruptcy process will be painful in the short run, officials know that the key to a successful city are the assets that draw visitors and residents,'' said Renee Monforton, the communications director at the Detroit Metro Convention and Visitors Bureau, a privately funded organization that has had concerned calls from convention groups but as of Aug. 5 no cancellations.
Tourism officials are still promoting attractions like the arts institute, the North American International Car Show, the Detroit Zoo and the sites downtown where the Detroit Tigers, Lions and Red Wings play. According to a February 2013 report from the nonprofit D:hive, 10.5 million people visit the greater downtown Detroit area a year for sites like the River Walk and the Detroit Opera House.
Jeanette Pierce, the director of community relations at D:hive, which assists visitors and new residents, said that this is not the first time that there has been dire news about Detroit. ''It's not a top-down city,'' she said. ''There's nothing the government is doing that is why somebody would visit here.''
The bankruptcy has added an odd layer onto what has become a thriving, albeit complicated, local art scene.
Detroit's dismal financial situation has been a subject of minimal regard for many artists, who said that their city is far from the ghost town some might assume from the news. They point out that a rich cultural undercurrent has grown only stronger in recent years, with a rise in contemporary art. They say that the arts, in the end, may propel economic development in Detroit, as it has from Asheville, N.C., to Bilbao, Spain.
''I think we'll have a little cloud for a while, but I don't think it's going to be long-lasting,'' said George N'Namdi, the founder of the N'Namdi Center for Contemporary Art and a part of the city's artistic life for decades. ''We have too many forces working on art that supersede that.''
Artists have flocked to cheap rents and have converted shuttered storefronts and abandoned buildings into studio spaces and galleries as private money has poured into the local art scene. The John S. and James L. Knight Foundation began a $19.25-million commitment to local arts projects last fall, the Kresge Foundation has awarded annual fellowships to artists since 2009, and Red Bull opened its first domestic House of Art, an emerging-artist incubator, here in May 2012.
Several suburban galleries have moved back to the city, and arts hubs are solidifying. A notable one is Midtown, home to the Detroit Institute of Arts and the Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, as well as galleries like the Butcher's Daughter, Re:View, and the N'Namdi center. In Southwest, a white box called What Pipeline opened in April, down the street from community-focused spaces like 555 Nonprofit Gallery and Studios, housed in a former police precinct. In Eastern Market, two new destinations, Inner State Gallery and Trinosophes, opened in the spring on busy Gratiot Avenue, blocks from the Red Bull House of Art.
Third Thursday, the event that the photographer Sebastian Sullen participated in in June, is run by a local organization called Art Detroit Now. Third Thursday currently includes 62 galleries, cafes and storefronts; it is part of a growing arts ecosystem, one where those involved expect to continue expanding outside the shadow of the bankruptcy proceedings.
Monica Bowman, the director of the Butcher's Daughter, said the bankruptcy filing does not change her mission or her market. ''Since the announcement, I've had multiple national news inquiries and record numbers of new visitors,'' she said. ''I believe a renewed curiosity about what is possible when cultural capital is put first will fuel sustainability and growth.''
The Detroit Institute of Arts, the city's premier museum, had almost 50,000 out-of-town visitors last fiscal year, a modest increase from the year before. (Only 11 percent of its visitors came from out of state.) The Museum of Contemporary Art Detroit, a k a MOCAD, always has a strong local audience, said its executive director, Elysia Borowy-Reeder, but this year visitors from Canada, Germany and Sweden have come for the ''Mobile Homestead,'' by the late Mike Kelley. International artists also exhibit in Detroit, Ms. Bowman said; What Pipeline's inaugural show featured the Europeans Lucie Stahl and Tom Humphreys.
On the day the bankruptcy was announced, Mr. Sullen, whose photos contrasted the city's grandeur with its decline, replaced his Web site's lead image with a colorful mural depicting the Detroit flag, its official motto proclaiming: ''We hope for better things. It shall rise from the ashes.'' In his view, it still sums up the people of Detroit. ''Nothing has changed for me as an artist.''

HEADLINE: How to Read Afghanistan

BYLINE: By VANESSA M. GEZARI. 
The author of ''The Tender Soldier: A True Story of War and Sacrifice.''

 BODY:
ON a sunny, crisp November day in 2008, three American civilians joined a platoon of United States soldiers on a foot patrol in Maiwand District, a flat, yellow patch of earth crowned by black-rock mountains in southern Afghanistan. The civilians were part of the Human Terrain System, an ambitious, troubled Army program that sends social scientists into conflict zones to help soldiers understand local culture, politics and economics.
That day, the team planned to interview shoppers coming and going from a nearby bazaar. Afghans had complained about the high price of flour, so the Human Terrain Team members were creating a consumer price index. They also wanted to find out whether Afghan officials were asking shopkeepers for bribes, and how merchants protected themselves and their goods in a place where insurgents and local security forces threatened civilians in equal measure.
The team's social scientist that day was Paula Loyd, a 36-year-old Wellesley graduate and Army veteran with degrees in anthropology and diplomacy and years of experience as a development worker in Afghanistan. Through her interpreter, she struck up a conversation with an Afghan man who was carrying a jug of fuel, asking how much he had paid for it. They talked genially until her interpreter was called away. Suddenly, the man doused Ms. Loyd with gas from his jug and lit her on fire. 
It was one stunning act of violence in a conflict that has killed more than 2,100 American troops and wounded more than 19,000. As the United States drawdown approaches, stalled peace talks with the Taliban, Afghan political maneuvering and the waste of billions in taxpayer dollars dominate headlines. Each new attack stokes our yearning for a quick exit. But the more assiduously we seek to put the pain and hard-won lessons of this conflict behind us, the more likely we will be to repeat the same mistakes in the next war.
Paula Loyd died of her injuries a few months after the attack, in January 2009. Soon after, I flew to Kandahar to try to figure out who had set her on fire, and why. It seemed obvious that the Taliban were behind it, but the assault was unusual, to say the least. She was unarmed, interviewing people and taking notes, something I'd often done in villages around Afghanistan. I couldn't remember a Taliban attack that resembled it. Neither, it turned out, could anyone else.
Over the next two years, I would hear nearly a dozen accounts of what had motivated Ms. Loyd's assailant. (He couldn't tell me why he did it, because minutes after the attack, he was shot by one of Ms. Loyd's grief-stricken colleagues.) The stories often conflicted, but each one illuminated the crisscrossing narratives of the war. I spent my formative years as a journalist in Afghanistan, and reporting there taught me something that would pass for heresy in many American newsrooms: finding the truth is not just about gathering facts. It is also an interpretive and imaginative effort.
Afghans have a knack for the nonliteral. They value stories for reasons that have nothing to do with the practical information they contain. In his recent memoir, ''A Fort of Nine Towers,'' Qais Akbar Omar writes of a Dari literature teacher who helped him see that ''there is more to a story than its plot. She told us that images created by words can have hidden meanings.'' The scion of a prosperous Kabul family, Mr. Omar is that rare Afghan lucky enough to have grown up in a house full of books.
In the countryside, where three out of four Afghans live, some 90 percent of women and 63 percent of men cannot read or write. Afghanistan is a predominantly oral culture, where stories may be read aloud once, then memorized, told and retold, changing slightly or significantly with each telling. The door between literature and everyday language has long been ajar; even in casual exchanges, Afghans rely on allegory, metaphor, parables and jokes to convey meaning.
Such indirection is common in violent and repressive societies, but after more than 30 years of war, the Afghan penchant for elegant and oblique expression is particularly well honed. Stories give the teller power over the chaos that surrounds him. They are also a kind of code. Knowing how to read them separates Afghans from the people known in Dari as haraji, outsiders -- namely, everyone else.
American soldiers often fail to make sense of these stories, or simply dismiss them as meaningless. They're nothing like the Excel spreadsheets and acronym-heavy briefing slides that military people are trained to read. A prime example is captured in a brilliant video by the photojournalist John D. McHugh for The Guardian. In 2008 near the Pakistani border, an American sergeant becomes convinced that the rockets plaguing his men are being fired from a ridge just outside a nearby village. He marches into the sandy hamlet in search of answers. An Afghan translator flags down a red-bearded elder, who gestures toward the nearby mountains.
''The Taliban are over there -- not far away,'' the old man says in Pashto. ''I would like to tell [the Americans] a story. In our country, we grow wheat and we have ants. There is no way we can stop the little ants from stealing the wheat. There are so many little ants it is almost impossible to stop them. I've told this story to help the Americans understand the situation in Afghanistan.''
The American sergeant, waiting, shifts uneasily. ''He's giving many examples,'' the translator finally says. ''The main point is that if you want to get the [Taliban] they are behind this road, behind this mountain.''
The video is about the perils of inaccurate translation, and indeed, the translator fails mightily. But it's worth asking what the sergeant would have made of the story had it reached him. The Afghan is saying something crucial about the inseparability of insurgents from everyone else, and about the dangers of fighting in the weeds, where bullets can strike the wrong targets, like pesticides that kill the very crops they're designed to protect. The story might not supply coordinates for an insurgent safe house, but it certainly helps an attentive listener understand what the world looks like to a villager in a contested part of the country.
GOOD intelligence requires good reading; you can't have one without the other. Paula Loyd understood this. Years earlier, in her anthropology honors thesis at Wellesley, she described how marginalized people -- servants, slaves, women in male-dominated societies -- quietly pushed back against the dominant social order. Drawing on the work of the Yale political scientist James C. Scott, she wrote that they tended to be ''cautious about expressing their resistance openly when they perceive the power of the dominant group to be very strong.'' But ''when they are among their own, the peasants carry on an entirely different dialogue.'' In such situations, she observed, people talk in ''jokes, metaphors, folk tales, and codes,'' artfully conveying meaning while preserving maximum deniability.
For years before Paula Loyd landed in Maiwand, the United States had been mismanaging the political situation in southern Afghanistan, ignoring the poor and powerless and propping up local commanders who exploited them. Her clarity about the subtle, indirect ways people talk in dangerous times was part of what made her such an asset. There weren't enough like her.
The Human Terrain System sought to bring a degree of anthropological and interpretive acumen to a military that badly needed it. But it came too late, alienated too many anthropologists and was thrown together too quickly and sloppily to achieve many of its goals in Afghanistan. Taxpayers have spent more than $600 million on the deeply flawed program; it has occasionally benefited soldiers, but its slipshod construction and murky aims have also put Afghans and Americans at risk. Today, 14 Human Terrain field teams remain in Afghanistan, down from a high of 30; as more American troops leave, the teams will go with them. Policy makers should seize this moment to overhaul the military's cultural-knowledge efforts.
What happened to Paula Loyd reminds us that understanding what motivates our enemies and the people we're fighting among is a long and painful undertaking. But turning away from this effort, as many in the military did in the wake of Vietnam, ensures only that more Americans will die in other wars, in other far-flung corners of the world.

HEADLINE: Changing Attitudes on Labor Color Bay Area Transit Dispute

BYLINE: By NORIMITSU ONISHI; Malia Wollan contributed reporting.

 BODY:
OAKLAND, Calif. -- With the threat of a railroad shutdown looming, Alice Jorgensen was at the Bay Area Rapid Transit's MacArthur Station here on a recent morning, waiting for the service she uses 8 to 10 times a week to run errands and go to the library. A strike, she said, would be ''a real inconvenience.''
Like most people in the San Francisco Bay Area, a liberal, Democratic stronghold that has traditionally been supportive of organized labor, she favors unions.
''But I can see how people without unions feel burned because their wages aren't going up,'' said Ms. Jorgensen, 59, who worked as a receptionist in a veterinary clinic until 2005, when a thyroid problem forced her to go on disability. ''I'm slightly less pro-union than I was in the past, because I think unions can be so supportive of their members that they are not looking at the entire picture of society.'' 
The labor dispute at the transit system, known as BART, is taking place against a backdrop of changing attitudes toward organized labor in California.
Union membership and support for labor remain higher in this state, and especially in the Bay Area, than in most of the rest of the country. But unions have lost backing here, as in the rest of the country, labor experts say. People are less inclined to view labor's gains as those of the wider public's, they say, particularly as many have suffered reductions in wages and benefits in the past half decade.
Ms. Jorgensen had a similar view. ''Given the economy, I think the unionized people should be breaking even, not necessarily getting ahead,'' she said. ''There are a lot of workers out there who don't even have a union or a pension or health care benefits.''
On Friday, Gov. Jerry Brown said he would impose a 60-day cooling-off period in the negotiations if both sides failed to reach an agreement by Sunday night, guaranteeing service for the next couple of months. But if no progress is made in the talks, the decision could simply postpone a strike until October, when more commuters will be back at work and students return to class; then, the economic impact on the Bay Area would be greater.
Last Sunday, Mr. Brown appointed a fact-finding panel charged with submitting a report on the dispute, averting a strike at the last minute. BART's management and its two largest unions, the Service Employees International Union and the Amalgamated Transit Union, resumed negotiating on Thursday, a day after a public hearing showed how far apart the two sides stood on crucial issues -- so far that they could not even agree on how many tens of millions of dollars separated them from a deal.
Mark Stillman, 54, who worked as a mechanical engineer before suffering a disability, was one of many BART users at the hearing, during which both sides presented their positions to the fact-finding panel. He described himself as a union supporter, but said the BART unions needed to ''modernize.''
The BART employees' public pensions -- to which employees make no contribution -- should be closer to what workers in the private sector get, he said.
''I think their pensions are too protected and idealistic,'' Mr. Stillman said. ''If you look at commercial businesses and companies, the employees are more responsible for their pensions. The BART employees don't pay anything into their pensions, and I think they ought to be assuming more of the risk.''
BART negotiators are asking workers to start pension contributions, with the share increasing annually over a four-year contract; they are offering a 9 percent pay raise over four years.
The unions are demanding a 15 percent raise over three years and an additional 6.5 percent raise the first year as a condition for making pension contributions.
''This is just another example of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer,'' said Dana McMillan, 42, who was at the MacArthur BART station with her twin daughters in a double stroller. ''The people working at BART are homeowners.''
''Why should I be the one who suffers for their strike?'' said Ms. McMillan who during a four-day strike by BART workers in early July was unable to commute to San Francisco, where she works as an optician's assistant for about $15 an hour.
About 400,000 people ride BART every day, with most commuting to San Francisco from here and other eastern suburbs.
Unlike transit workers elsewhere in the country, BART's 2,400 workers have the right to strike under a California law that covers many public employees. But many municipalities, including San Francisco, prohibit their transportation workers from striking.
Unions in California have been able to offset eroding support in recent years by winning the backing of Hispanic workers through their strong advocacy of immigration rights.
''Unions in California have not been immune to the general tide against organized labor,'' said William B. Gould IV, an emeritus professor of law and a labor expert at Stanford University. ''But they have a more solid base than organized labor elsewhere because California has a greater immigrant and Latino population.''
At the public hearing, BART management officials said they wanted to rein in rising benefit costs to be able to upgrade BART's 40-year-old infrastructure and buy new trains for projected increases in ridership.
But union officials countered that BART must invest in its employees.
''We are not ashamed to be bargaining to defend a middle-class wage and benefit package,'' said Vincent Harrington, a lawyer for the Service Employees International Union.
The statement elicited strong applause from the union members in the audience. But in the continuing dispute, many people and newspaper editorials have pointed out that BART employees rank among the nation's highest-paid transit workers, with train operators and station agents earning on average more than $70,000 a year in salary and overtime.
Joseph Adair, 28, relies on BART for his work as a freelance handyman. He lost 40 percent of his business in 2008, he said, a situation that had favorably altered his views of unions. ''I'm a self-starter, and I did not understand relying on a system like that to get by,'' Mr. Adair said. ''Now I understand the appeal of the kind of security a union gives you. It's a safety net.''
Another BART rider, Doug Boyd, an actor who is a member of two guilds, had a similar view. ''When times get really hard and things get really squeezed economically,'' he said, ''you're happy that the unions are there to say, stop, you cannot take away anything more from the workers.''
Nonetheless, he has found it hard to be sympathetic toward BART employees. ''They make $70,000 without a college degree,'' he said. ''I'm less pro-union than I used to be, because unions can be inflationary.''

Fixing a Facade?
Last week's Streetscapes column, ''Ring Around the Collar,'' recounted the history of 535 Park Avenue, a co-op built in 1910 that was home to the painter Lydia Field Emmet. It also discussed how the terra-cotta facade on the building's two lower floors had become fractured and soiled and how the current owners are coating the facade with a layer of white stucco. Following are edited excerpts of reader comments from nytimes.com: 
Lydia Field Emmet seems like an amazing lady! Doing yoga way before its time here, riding her horse to Massachusetts (!) from NYC, charging up to $22,000 for a painting back then? She must've been quite something, quite a character.
Southamptoner, East End
It's a shame. The original terra cotta was beautiful and reflected the building's history. It's as if the building was saying ''I have pedigree and stability through my age.'' Now the building will have a phony-baloney look, as if it has had a bad Botox job.
Despina, Leandrou
It might gall the denizens of Park Avenue to know that a ride on the Jerome Avenue #4 line in the Bronx reveals the same styles of facades one sees on the more exalted thoroughfare. There is Florentine, Tudor, Georgian and variants of Neoclassical. Of course the buildings are only six stories and the interiors of no comparison, but Park Avenue is architecturally less unique than some imagine.
David, Flushing
What a pity that the co-op board at 535 Park elected to cover over with thick makeup the aging face of its terra-cotta masonry units. The co-op board at 998 Fifth handled a similar problem with far more sensitivity and economic foresight. Rather than covering over the problem, it resolved it permanently (or at least for the next 100 years) by replacing the entire worn-out terra-cotta cornice with a brand-new replica constructed to precisely the same profiles and color as the original, and made by hand in the same way that the original had been made. What a pity that the 535 residents have elected merely to hide the symptoms of the problem instead of curing the cause of them. Oversight by the Landmarks Preservation Commission would have prevented this mistake.
Architorney, New York
Mr. Gray once wrote in a column something to the effect that ''only die-hard prewar fans'' miss the buildings on Park Avenue from the Helmsley building northward that were demolished after the city changed the zoning rules to allow commercial construction along this corridor.
I much prefer Park Avenue after it turns residential than the section in the 40s and 50s that went commercial. A few of the new modern freaks like Lever House are interesting and playful, but most of them to me are banal hulks. Perhaps 535 is at the start of the respectful section of Park Avenue?

WASHINGTON -- Representative Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky with little experience in the intricacies of Wall Street, was among the lucky House freshmen to secure a seat on the powerful Financial Services Committee.
Now, half a year into his first term, he has emerged as a telling example of why the panel is sometimes called ''the cash committee'' -- a place, critics say, where there are big incentives for freshmen to do special favors for the industry.
Mr. Barr, 40, a first-time elected official, has raised nearly as much money this year from political action committees run by major banks, credit unions and insurance companies as longtime lawmakers like Speaker John A. Boehner and other party leaders.
The flood of financial industry cash -- $150,000 in political action committee donations to Mr. Barr in just six months -- is hardly an accident. 
One afternoon in April, Mr. Barr hosted credit union lobbyists and executives in his House office just before a committee hearing, promising that he would help protect a federal tax break worth $500 million a year, the executives said. Last month, he introduced legislation to eliminate a new federal rule intended to prevent banks from issuing mortgages to customers who could not afford to repay the debt -- a measure pushed by bank lobbyists who had visited his office.
''People support him because they agree with him,'' Catherine Gatewood, Mr. Barr's spokeswoman, said after he declined requests for an interview.
But Brad Miller, a North Carolina Democrat who served on the Financial Services Committee until January, when he left Congress, said the intense focus on fund-raising by freshman lawmakers like Mr. Barr is a potent sign of the harmful way that money distorts priorities in Washington, for both Republicans and Democrats.
''Freshmen are pushed and pushed and pushed to raise money -- it's how they are judged by the leadership and the political establishment in Washington,'' said Mr. Miller, who added that he felt the same pressure when he joined the Financial Services Committee in 2003 as a freshman. ''It's only natural that it has got to be on your mind that a vote one way or other is going to affect the ability to raise money.''
After the elections in November, Democratic Party leaders gave a PowerPoint presentation urging their freshman members to spend as much as four hours a day making fund-raising calls while in Washington, and an additional hour of ''strategic outreach'' holding breakfasts or ''meet and greets'' with possible financial supporters. That adds up to more time than these first-term lawmakers were advised to spend on Congressional business.
Much of this reflects the political reality that freshmen like Mr. Barr, particularly those from districts in which neither party dominates, are considered vulnerable. And that explains why a seat on the Financial Services Committee is so coveted.
Political action committees -- set up by lobbying firms, unions, corporations and other groups trying to push their agenda in Congress -- have donated more money to Financial Services Committee members in the first six months of this year than to members of any other committee. The $9.4 million total is nearly $2 million more than the total for the Armed Services Committee, the only House panel with more members.
With so many lawmakers clamoring to be on the Financial Services Committee, it has grown to 61 members from 44 since 1980, forcing the installation of four tiered rows of seats in the Rayburn House Office Building -- with the first row of lawmakers on the floor, just in front of the tables used for witnesses.
The committee's chairman, Representative Jeb Hensarling, Republican of Texas, remains the top recipient of donations from industry PACs this year, taking in $282,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics, a nonprofit group that tracks the influence of money in politics. But three Republican freshmen -- Mr. Barr and Representatives Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Ann Wagner of Missouri -- have raised more money from industry PACs than many longtime committee members like Representative Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican who served as the panel's chairman until the end of last year.
The imbalance is apparent on the Democratic side as well. Each of the seven freshman Democrats on the committee has raised more industry PAC money so far this year than the committee's top Democrat, Representative Maxine Waters of California, who has had a testy relationship with the industry.
These freshman Democrats joined this year with Republicans on the committee -- over the objection of Ms. Waters and the Obama administration -- to support measures advocated by Wall Street banks that would roll back some of the strictest provisions of the landmark Dodd-Frank financial regulations, which were passed in 2010 in the aftermath of the global recession.
A spokeswoman for Representative Patrick Murphy, a Florida Democrat who has taken in more industry PAC money than any other Democratic freshman, $53,500, said his votes had been cast based on what he believed was in the best interest of his constituents, not to please potential contributors. But she agreed that the pressure to raise money was intense.
''The system is what the system is,'' said Tiffany Muller, Mr. Murphy's deputy chief of staff, adding that her boss supported changing campaign finance rules.
Mr. Barr's industry outreach started even before he was sworn in to office -- at a ''debt retirement'' luncheon at Charlie Palmer Steak, two blocks from the Capitol, that he co-sponsored with a lobbyist who represents companies like Bank of America and MasterCard International. Tens of thousands of dollars came in to help Mr. Barr eliminate his campaign debt, including large checks from the American Bankers Association and PNC Bank, among others.
In one closed meeting with credit union executives in April, which took place after the PAC for the national credit union trade association donated $5,000, Mr. Barr promised to help defend the special tax-exempt status enjoyed by credit unions and fight new regulations.
Mr. Barr, in the five minutes he was allotted to speak during the April committee hearing, asked a series of friendly questions of an industry representative and made comments that echoed the points the credit union executives had raised. ''The regulatory burden is very challenging for credit unions today,'' Mr. Barr said, and then asked the credit union executives to describe what it was like before Dodd-Frank.
The credit union group gave Mr. Barr an additional $5,000 contribution two months after the hearing.
Mr. Barr has introduced separate legislation that would permanently exempt banks that keep mortgages in their own portfolio from a requirement in Dodd-Frank that they follow a prescribed set of steps to ensure that customers can afford the loans. Mr. Barr's proposal, introduced with no co-sponsors, moved with extraordinary speed through the legislative process. Within two weeks, Mr. Barr boasted, it was wrapped into a larger House bill that was passed by the entire Financial Services Committee, a coup for a House freshman.
Ms. Gatewood, Mr. Barr's spokeswoman, said his proposals were intended to make sure that Kentucky businesses and residents had sufficient access to credit, which has been harder to come by since Congress passed the new regulations.
Mr. Barr is hardly the only freshman to introduce bills that would benefit the industry. Ms. Wagner of Missouri, another Republican freshman on the committee who has pulled in a large number of industry contributions, sponsored a bill that would block or delay Labor Department rules intended to prevent life insurance agents and other brokers from selling financial products that they know may not be in the client's best interest.
Consumer groups like AARP have joined with groups representing investment advisers -- who are already required to meet this so-called fiduciary standard -- to protest the legislation, saying the bill Ms. Wagner introduced is an unnecessary gift to the industry. ''If you want to carry industry water, carry industry's water,'' said Barbara Roper, director of investor protection for the Consumer Federation of America. ''But don't pretend you are doing it to protect investors.''
A spokesman for Ms. Wagner said her legislation would ensure that consumers had access to a range of financial services.
One industry lobbyist, who asked not to be named because client matters are supposed to be confidential, said his political action committee was sizing up all of the Financial Services Committee freshmen as it tried to determine who could best help deliver on the industry's agenda.
''It is almost like investing in a first-round draft pick for the N.B.A. or N.F.L.,'' the lobbyist said. ''There is potential there. So we make an investment, and we are hopeful that investment produces a return.''

HEADLINE: Kansas and Al Qaeda

BYLINE: By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN

 BODY:
SALINA, Kan. -- I'VE spent the last few months filming a Showtime documentary about how climate and environmental stresses helped trigger the Arab awakening. It's been a fascinating journey because it forced me to look at the Middle East through the lens of Arab environmentalists instead of politicians. When you do that, you see the problems and solutions very differently. Environmentalists always start by thinking about the health of the ''commons'' -- the shared air, soil, forests and water -- that are the basis of all life, which, if not preserved, will undermine the whole society. The notion that securing the interests of any single group -- Shiite or Sunni, Christian or Muslim, secular or Islamist -- over the health of the commons is nuts to them. It's as laughable as pictures of gun-toting fighters strutting on the rubble of broken buildings in Aleppo or Benghazi, claiming ''victory,'' only to discover that they've ''won'' a country with eroding soil, degrading forests, scarce water, shrinking jobs -- a deteriorating commons. 
Our film crew came to look at the connection between the drought in Kansas and the rise in global food prices that helped to fuel the Arab uprisings. But I stumbled upon another powerful environmental insight here: the parallel between how fossil fuels are being used to power monoculture farms in the Middle West and how fossil fuels are being used to power wars to create monoculture societies in the Middle East. And why both are really unhealthy for their commons.
My teacher here was Wes Jackson, the MacArthur award winner, based in Salina, where he founded The Land Institute. Jackson's philosophy is that the prairie was a diverse wilderness, with a complex ecosystem that supported all kinds of wildlife, not to mention American Indians -- until the Europeans arrived, plowed it up and covered it with single-species crop farms, mostly wheat, corn, or soybeans. Jackson's goal is to restore the function of the diverse polyculture prairie ecosystem and rescue it from the single-species, annual monoculture farming, which is exhausting the soil, the source of all prairie life. ''We have to stop treating soil like dirt,'' he says.
Jackson knows this has to be economically viable. That's why his goal is to prove that species of wheat and other grains that scientists at The Land Institute are developing can be grown as perennials with deep roots -- so you would not need to regularly till the soil or plant seeds. The way to do that, he believes, is by growing mixtures of those perennial grains, which will mimic the prairie and naturally provide the nutrients and pesticides. The need for fossil-fuel-powered tractors and fertilizers would be much reduced, with the sun's energy making up the difference. That would be so much better for the soil and the climate, since most soil carbon would not be released.
Annual monocultures are much more susceptible to disease and require much more fossil fuel energy -- plows, fertilizer, pesticides -- to maintain. Perennial polycultures, by contrast, notes Jackson, provide species diversity, which provides chemical diversity, which provides much more natural resistance and ''can substitute for the fossil fuels and chemicals that we've not evolved with.''
Jackson maintains some original prairie vegetation. As we walk through it, he explains: This is nature's own ''tree of life.'' This prairie, like a forest, ''features material recycling, runs on sunlight, and does not have an epidemic that wipes it all out. You know during the Dust Bowl years of the '30s, the crops died, but the prairie survived.'' Then he points to his experimental perennial grain crops: ''That's the tree of knowledge.'' Our challenge, and it will take years, he notes, is to find a way to blend the tree of life with the tree of knowledge to develop domestic prairies that could have high-yielding fields planted once every several years, whose crops would only need harvesting and species diversity could ''take care of insects, pathogens and fertility.''
And that brings us back to the Middle East. Al Qaeda often says that if the Muslim world wants to restore its strength, it needs to go back to the ''pure'' days of Islam, when it was a monoculture unsullied by foreign influences. In fact, the ''Golden Age'' of the Arab/Muslim world was when it became a polyculture between the 8th and 13th centuries. Of that era, Wikipedia says, ''During this period the Arab world became an intellectual center for science, philosophy, medicine and education. ...'' It was ''a collection of cultures, which put together, synthesized and significantly advanced the knowledge gained from the ancient Roman, Chinese, Indian, Persian, Egyptian, Greek, Byzantine and Phoenician civilizations.''
What is going on in the Arab world today is a relentless push, also funded by fossil fuels, for more monocultures. It's Al Qaeda trying to ''purify'' the Arabian Peninsula. It's Shiites and Sunnis, funded by oil money, trying to purge each other in Iraq and Syria. It's Alexandria, Egypt, once a great melting pot of Greeks, Italians, Jews, Christians, Arabs and Muslims, now a city dominated by the Muslim Brotherhood, with most non-Muslims gone. It makes these societies much less able to spark new ideas and much more susceptible to diseased conspiracy theories and extreme ideologies. To be blunt, this evolution of Arab/Muslim polycultures into monocultures is a disaster.
Pluralism, diversity and tolerance were once native plants in the Middle East -- the way the polyculture prairie was in the Middle West. Neither ecosystem will be healthy without restoring its diversity.

HEADLINE: Dr. Google Will See You Now

BYLINE: By SETH STEPHENS-DAVIDOWITZ. 
Seth Stephens- Davidowitz recently received a Ph.D. in economics at Harvard.

 BODY:
FEELING good today? You are not alone. We're approaching Aug. 11, which is, excluding Christmastime, the happiest day of the year in this country. Or at least the day with the lowest rate of depression, according to our Google searches.
I recently explored what Google searches tell us about depression, by which I mean, loosely, dips in mood. Using anonymous, aggregate data from tens of millions of queries, I measured what proportion of searches included the word ''depression'' and were categorized by Google's algorithms as health related on each day of the year, across the United States, over a period of nine years. (This method counts searches like ''depression symptoms'' and ''depression treatment'' but not searches like ''The Great Depression.'') Not every health-related search using ''depression'' is a sign that someone is depressed, and not everyone who is depressed queries Google. But thanks to the incredibly large sample size, meaningful patterns emerge. 
According to the data, depression is highest in April. T. S. Eliot was probably right to call it ''the cruelest month.'' Depression is lowest in August. (A team of researchers led by John Ayers of San Diego State University first showed that Google searches related to many mental illnesses vary with the season.)
The state with the highest rate of depression is North Dakota; the one with the lowest, Virginia. The city with the highest rate is Presque Isle, Me.; the city with the lowest, San Francisco. Depression is, unsurprisingly, highest on Mondays and lowest on Saturdays. The date on which depression is lowest is Dec. 25, followed by a few days surrounding it.
The Great Recession appears to have caused a significant increase in depression. In 2009 and 2010, there was a large increase in depression queries in states with large increases in unemployment, like Nevada, Florida and Alabama, compared with states that were little affected, like North Dakota and Arkansas. A 1 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate was associated with a 2 percent increase in depression queries.
What factors, besides unemployment, explain an area's search rate for ''depression''? I tested dozens of variables in many different categories. The strongest predictor by far: an area's average temperature in January. Colder places have higher rates of depression, with the correlation concentrated in the colder months. The relationship between weather and mental health has been debated, but those debates have generally relied on ''small'' data. Google searches, the biggest data source we currently have, are unambiguous: when it comes to our happiness, climate matters a great deal. (I am currently an intern at Google.)
Temperature accounted for so much of an area's depression rate that there was not much room left for other factors. But some other factors did correlate. Besides temperature, the biggest predictors of ''depression'' searches were the sizes of the Hispanic population and the college-educated population. More Hispanic-Americans meant fewer searches (though this might have been a result of language factors). More college-educated people meant less depression. This finding challenges the stereotype of the overeducated, overanalyzing depressive.
There is a lesson here for public health and medical researchers. Are you investigating how weather affects migraine headaches? How chemicals in water affect autism rates? I believe we are about to enter a golden age of disease research. Many of the biggest developments will come from the analysis of big data, not from traditional experiments that survey a relatively small number of people.
There is also a lesson for people who live in cold climates and are susceptible to depression. The striking correlation between temperature and depression suggests they should consider moving to a more temperate location. Of course, people at risk for depression should hesitate to abandon a job in a cold-winter location for no job in a warm-winter clime, and they should think twice about moving away from family and friends.
But the data imply that moving, for example, from the city with the 30th coldest climate in the United States (Chicago) to the city with the warmest (Honolulu) lowers the probability of September-to-April depression by some 40 percent.
An optimistic read of the effectiveness of antidepressants would find that the most effective drugs decrease the probability of depression by only about 20 percent. To judge from the Google numbers, a Chicago-to-Honolulu move would be at least twice as effective as medication for your cold-months mood.
So, on this happiest non-holiday day of the year, ask yourself where will you be on Feb. 27, the day with the highest depression rate: Hawaii, the state with the fifth lowest rate of depression? Or will you be putting on your overcoat, shoveling your driveway and heading to the bookstore's self-help section?

HEADLINE: Housing Market Still Needs A Backbone

BYLINE: By GRETCHEN MORGENSON

 BODY:
IN a speech in Phoenix last Tuesday, President Obama finally entered the debate over the future of United States housing policy. But his talking points offered few details about how to reduce the government's giant footprint in the mortgage market.
Mr. Obama vowed to keep mortgage costs affordable for first-time home buyers and working families, pleasing those who think that the government should have a large role in this arena. His call for investment in rental housing was a welcome change from past mantras that focused solely on increasing homeownership across the country. 
Playing to taxpayers who are angered by the government's takeover of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac in 2008, Mr. Obama said he wanted to wind these companies down. That's an important goal.
But as if to prove how hard this will be, both companies later in the week announced enormous profits for the second quarter of this year, most of which go to the government in the form of dividends. Together, the companies reported $15 billion in profits; with Treasury on the receiving end of this lush income stream, it will be tempting to keep the mortgage finance giants in business.
Yet with the government backing or financing nine out of 10 residential mortgages today, it is crucial to lure back private capital, with no government guarantees, to the home loan market. Mr. Obama contended that ''private lending should be the backbone'' of the market, but he provided no specifics on how to make that happen.
This is a huge, complex problem. In fact, there are many reasons for the reluctance of banks and private investors to fund residential mortgages without government backing.
For starters, banks have grown accustomed to earning fees for making mortgages that they sell to Fannie and Freddie. Generating fee income while placing the long-term credit or interest rate risk on the government's balance sheet is a win-win for the banks.
A coming shift by the Federal Reserve in its quantitative easing program may also be curbing banks' appetite for mortgage loans they keep on their own books. These institutions are hesitant to make 30-year, fixed-rate loans before the Fed shifts its stance and rates climb. For a bank, the value of such loans falls when rates rise. This process has already begun -- rates on 30-year fixed-rate mortgages were 4.4 percent last week, up from 3.35 percent in early May. This is painful for banks that actually hold older, lower-rate mortgages.
Private investors, like mutual funds and pension managers, aren't hurrying back to the residential mortgage market, either. Deep flaws remain in the mortgage securitization machine, and it needs to be retooled before investors will begin buying these securities again.
Perhaps the largest problem for investors who might otherwise be willing to return to the mortgage market is the lack of transparency in privately issued securities. Investors interested in mortgage instruments are not allowed to analyze the loans going into these pools before they buy them.
The banks putting together the deals typically provide some data, like borrowers' incomes and credit scores, as well as whether the loans backed primary residences or second homes. But investors don't get access to actual loan files that can tell them what they need to know about the quality and types of the mortgages packed inside the deals.
A CIVIL case filed by the Justice Department last week against Bank of America highlights the downside of nondisclosure. In that matter, prosecutors accused the bank of misleading investors when it sold them a mortgage security in early 2008. Although the bank contended in marketing materials that the security contained prime loans that met its underwriting standards, more than 40 percent of those loans did not comply with those standards, prosecutors said.
Lawrence Grayson, a Bank of America spokesman, said the bank was fighting the case.
''These were prime mortgages sold to sophisticated investors who had ample access to the underlying data and we will demonstrate that,'' he said in a statement last week.
But the Justice Department contends that the bank failed to disclose important facts to investors about the quality of the mortgages in the $850 million pool, which wound up performing badly. As of June 2013, prosecutors said, 15.4 percent of those mortgages had defaulted, indicating that they were of a far lower quality than advertised. The Justice Department estimates that investors will lose more than $100 million on the deal.
Then there's another issue. Investors are also unlikely to take an interest in mortgage securities because serious conflicts of interest are still embedded in the process.
For example, in the aftermath of the crisis, investors learned that they could not rely on the trustee banks charged with overseeing these loan pools to do their jobs. The trustees are supposed to make sure that firms administering the loans treat investors fairly. These duties include taking in and distributing payments as well as foreclosing on borrowers.
Even though the trustees are supposed to work for investors, these watchdogs are actually hired by the big banks that not only package the mortgage securities but also provide administrative services for them. So it was perhaps not surprising that the trustees failed to make the big banks buy back loans that didn't meet the quality standards set out when the securities were originally sold. Such buybacks could have prevented billions in losses for investors, and the trustees' inaction indicated where their allegiances lay.
Yet another reason for investors around the country to steer clear of mortgage securities is the recent action by Richmond, Calif., to seize underwater home loans and reduce the amount of debt outstanding on the properties. Many of the loans that the city officials want to restructure are held by mutual funds and pensions.
Pimco and BlackRock, two huge mortgage investors, are among those represented in a lawsuit filed last week against Richmond, contending that such a plan would violate the contracts that investors agreed to when they purchased the loans. And the Federal Housing Finance Agency, the overseer of Fannie and Freddie, has concluded that Richmond's action could threaten the safety and soundness of the companies' operations, harming taxpayers.
Mr. Obama's views on the path forward for housing finance are welcome. But much work needs to be done before private capital will come back to this market. Eliminating conflicts of interest and increasing transparency in the securitization process will go a long way to achieving that end.

HEADLINE: Help Thy Neighbor and Go Straight to Prison

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
IF you want to understand all that is wrong with America's criminal justice system, take a look at the nightmare experienced by Edward Young.
Young, now 43, was convicted of several burglaries as a young man but then resolved that he would turn his life around. Released from prison in 1996, he married, worked six days a week, and raised four children in Hixson, Tenn.
Then a neighbor died, and his widow, Neva Mumpower, asked Young to help sell her husband's belongings. He later found, mixed in among them, seven shotgun shells, and he put them aside so that his children wouldn't find them.
''He was trying to help me out,'' Mumpower told me. ''My husband was a pack rat, and I was trying to clear things out.'' 
Then Young became a suspect in burglaries at storage facilities and vehicles in the area, and the police searched his home and found the forgotten shotgun shells as well as some stolen goods. The United States attorney in Chattanooga prosecuted Young under a federal law that bars ex-felons from possessing guns or ammunition. In this case, under the Armed Career Criminal Act, that meant a 15-year minimum sentence.
The United States attorney, William Killian, went after Young -- even though none of Young's past crimes involved a gun, even though Young had no shotgun or other weapon to go with the seven shells, and even though, by all accounts, he had no idea that he was violating the law when he helped Mrs. Mumpower sell her husband's belongings.
In May, a federal judge, acknowledging that the case was Dickensian but saying that he had no leeway under the law, sentenced Young to serve a minimum of 15 years in federal prison. It didn't matter that the local authorities eventually dismissed the burglary charges.
So the federal government, at a time when it is cutting education spending, is preparing to spend $415,000 over the next 15 years to imprison a man for innocently possessing seven shotgun shells while trying to help a widow in the neighborhood. And, under the law, there is no early release: Young will spend the full 15 years in prison.
This case captures what is wrong with our ''justice'' system: We have invested in mass incarceration in ways that are crushingly expensive, break up families and are often simply cruel. With less than 5 percent of the world's population, the United States has almost one-quarter of the world's prisoners.
This hasn't always been the case, but it is the result of policies such as mandatory minimum sentences since the 1970s.
In 1978, the United States had 307,000 inmates in state and federal prisons. That soared to a peak of more than 1.6 million in 2009. Since then, the number of inmates has declined for three consecutive years to 1.57 million in 2012. The number of juveniles detained has also begun to drop since peaking in 2000, although the U.S. still detains children at a rate five times that of the next highest country.
In short, there's some hope that this American experiment in mass incarceration has been recognized as a failure and will be gradually unwound. Among the leaders in moving away from the old policies are blue states and red states alike, including New York and Texas. But America still has twice as many prisoners today as under President Ronald Reagan.
Almost everyone seems to acknowledge that locking up vast numbers of nonviolent offenders is a waste of money. California devotes $179,400 to keep a juvenile in detention for a year, and spends less than $10,000 per student in its schools.
Granted, mass incarceration may have been one factor in reduced crime in the last couple of decades; there's mixed evidence. But, if so, the economic and social cost has been enormous -- including the breakup of families and the increased risk that children of those families will become criminals a generation later.
There's also contrary evidence that incarceration, especially of young people, doesn't work well in preventing crime, especially for young people. One careful study of 35,000 young offenders by Anna Aizer and Joseph J. Doyle Jr. reached the startling conclusion that jailing juveniles leads them to be more likely to commit crimes as adults. Milder sentences, such as electronic monitoring and home detention, were actually more effective at preventing adult crime.
Alternatives to incarceration are both cheaper and more efficient. Youth Villages has an excellent record of working with troubled youngsters and their families, and of keeping them from committing crimes. So do some job-training and education programs. Mass incarceration has been particularly devastating for blacks and members of other minority groups, as well as for the poor generally. In this case, Edward Young is white.
Conservatives often argue that there is a link between family breakdown and cycles of poverty. They're right: Boys are more likely to get into trouble without a dad at home, and we have a major problem with the irresponsibility of young men who conceive babies but don't raise them.
We also have a serious problem with the irresponsibility of mass incarceration. When almost 1 percent of Americans are imprisoned (and a far higher percentage of men of color in low-income neighborhoods), our criminal justice system becomes a cause of family breakdown and contributes to the delinquency of a generation of children. And mass incarceration interacts with other government policies, such as the way the drug war is implemented, to have a disproportionate effect on African-Americans. Black men use marijuana at roughly the same rate as white men but are more than three times as likely to be arrested over it.
Young is particularly close to his children, ages 6 to 16. After back problems and rheumatoid arthritis left him disabled, he was a stay-at-home dad while his wife worked in a doctor's office. When the judge announced the sentence, the children all burst into tears.
''I can't believe my kids lose their daddy for the next 15 years,'' his wife, Stacy, told me. ''He never tried to get a firearm in the 16 years I was with him. It's crazy. He's getting a longer sentence than people who've killed or raped.''
Young's lawyer, Christopher Varner, of Chattanooga, is appealing the sentence and says he is shaken by the outcome. ''It's shocking,'' he says. ''That's not what we do in this country.''
I asked Killian, the United States attorney, why on earth he would want to send a man to prison for 15 years for innocently possessing seven shotgun shells. ''The case raised serious public safety concerns,'' Killian said.
Oh.
The classic caricature of justice run amok is Inspector Javert in Victor Hugo's novel ''Les Misérables,'' pursuing Jean Valjean for stealing bread for hungry children. In that case, Valjean knew that he was breaking the law; Edward Young had no idea.
Some day, Americans will look back and wonder at how we as a society could be much more willing to invest in prisons than in schools. They will be astonished that we sent a man to federal prison for 15 years for trying to help a widow.

HEADLINE: Albany, Long Buried in Paper, Resolves to Save a Small Forest

BYLINE: By THOMAS KAPLAN

 BODY:
In the waning days of the legislative session this year, document clerks piled a metal cart and hand truck high with sheaves of paper and wheeled them into the Senate and Assembly chambers. Bill after bill was stashed under desks, where each remained, occasionally kicked but seldom read.
The scene is a ritual at the New York State Capitol, which is awash in paper. Even though legislators are enacting fewer laws, they are printing up a storm -- 19 million pages every two years, including the full text of all bills, published in type so small, and language so dense, that few could read or understand them.
Now, though, voters will have a chance to move the Legislature into the current century.
In June, after years of inaction even as other states moved to reduce legislative paper consumption, New York lawmakers gave their final approval to a measure that would allow the Legislature to publish bills electronically, rather than on paper. 
However, nothing in Albany is ever simple. An obscure provision in the State Constitution requires that bills ''shall have been printed and upon the desks of the members'' for three days before a vote can be taken. So delivering bills to lawmakers on tablets or laptop computers, as it turns out, requires a constitutional amendment, which the Legislature will put before voters on the statewide ballot next year.
''We need to catch up to the modern world,'' said Assemblywoman Sandra R. Galef, a former elementary schoolteacher from Ossining, who first introduced the proposal to cut down on paper in 1997, not long after the dawn of the Palm Pilot.
Ms. Galef said she had the idea after being baffled by the stacks of paper that would accumulate under her desk. But her colleagues were slow to come around. While smartphones and tablets are now prevalent at the Capitol, Ms. Galef, a 73-year-old Democrat who recently got her first iPhone, said she had once heard complaints that the presence of computer screens might mar the historical aesthetics of the legislative chambers.
''I just hope the public will be supportive and not think we're doing something strange,'' she said. ''It's going to be a little hard to explain.''
Albany is known for its bureaucratic torpor, and its hesitation to embrace technology in lieu of paper is yet another example of how New York lags behind other states.
More than half of the country's state legislatures have taken steps to go paperless or reduce paper use, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. In the Hawaii Senate, where the paper consumption in an annual session once equaled about a thousand mature trees, the chamber has reduced its use of paper by 85 percent since 2007. And at least 16 states have given iPads or other tablets to all or some of their legislators, according to the legislature association.
Still, American government has a voracious appetite for paper. Local, state and federal offices used 122 billion sheets of paper in 2011, an amount equal to roughly 400 sheets for every person in the United States, according to InfoTrends, a research and consulting firm that specializes in digital imaging and document management.
The proposal in Albany may be especially hard to explain to the paper lobby, which, although not a powerhouse there, does exist. The pulp and paper industry is responsible for more than 16,000 jobs in New York, according to the American Forest and Paper Association.
Eric Carlson, the president of the Empire State Forest Products Association, said his organization had no problem with giving the Legislature the flexibility to avoid needless printing in order to save taxpayer dollars. But at the same time, he said, he worried about any efforts to demonize the use of paper, in the Legislature or elsewhere.
''We would be very concerned about sending the message out that somehow it's wrong to use paper,'' Mr. Carlson said.
International Paper, which has lucrative contracts to supply the sprawling state government with truckloads of copy paper (although not the paper used for printing bills), lobbied against eliminating the paper bill requirement, arguing that its Ticonderoga pulp and paper mill is an essential part of the North Country economy. On the other side, a firm hired by Apple, which stands to benefit if MacBooks or iPads replace paper in the legislative chambers, reported lobbying on the measure, although it was not clear how much.
Paper is, in many ways, the lifeblood of the New York State Capitol. Legislators whose parties are out of power have bemoaned being assigned rickety photocopiers that frequently break down. At critical moments, lawmakers can be found sprawled about the Capitol as they wait for printed bills to arrive; sometimes, when the three-day waiting period is waived, they vote on legislation that is still warm to the touch.
The consumption of paper is most apparent in the Senate and Assembly chambers. At one point in the closing days of the most recent session, a senator pleaded for the proceedings to be slowed because a number of lawmakers were lost in the sea of paper on their desks.
Over all, legislative officials estimate that they spend $325,000 on paper and ink for the printing of bills during each two-year legislative term. In the last fiscal year alone, the state government complex in Albany sent 1,677 tons of mixed paper to be recycled.
''It's on our desk, it's underneath our desk, it's in our desk, it's in the hallways, it's in the document rooms -- we're surrounded by paper,'' said James N. Tedisco, a Republican assemblyman from the capital region, who has waged his own crusade against paper in recent years. To attract publicity, Assemblyman Tedisco once debated the state budget while dwarfed by twin stacks of paper resting on his desk, and another time climbed into large bins filled with paper in order to pose for photographs. He asserts that cutting down on bill printing will save the state millions of dollars, far more than legislative officials are letting on.
In Albany, the actual printing duty falls to the Legislative Bill Drafting Commission, which has its own print shop a block from the Capitol. To save paper, the commission now prints eight pages of legislation on each sheet, four per side. ''We've gone to great lengths to be a lot greener,'' said Randall G. Bluth, one of the two legislative appointees who lead the commission -- a mostly anonymous post, Mr. Bluth said, except for the rare instance when a printer breaks down and threatens to slow the Legislature to a standstill.
The proposed constitutional amendment would maintain the three-day waiting period between publication of a bill and a vote, intended to allow lawmakers and the public time to consider the legislation, but eliminate the need for the bills to be physically printed on paper. The Legislature has had to approve the measure twice -- a requirement for a constitutional amendment -- and after this year's agreement to put the measure before voters, Mr. Tedisco said, ''Mother Earth is smiling today.''

HEADLINE: Now Starring: Joe Gnome

BYLINE: By SCOTT CACCIOLA

 BODY:
ST. PETERSBURG, Fla. -- In their endless quest to get more people to show up for their games, the Tampa Bay Rays recently announced that they were revisiting one of their most popular fan giveaways: a figurine of Manager Joe Maddon dressed as a gnome.
It turned out to be wildly successful once again, as an announced crowd of 31,969 packed Tropicana Field on Aug. 3 for the Rays' game against the San Francisco Giants. Who knew the Rays had been going about their business all wrong? Joe Gnome proved more than capable of doing what Evan Longoria, David Price and one of baseball's top teams could not: rouse people in the Tampa Bay area from their summer slumber and get them to the ballpark.
''I think we have moments where we're a little frustrated or a little disappointed,'' outfielder Sam Fuld said. ''We know the framework for a good fan base is here. But I also think we're all aware of the circumstances at this point and try to make the most of it.'' 
Making the most of it means playing very good baseball in a half-empty stadium on a near nightly basis. The Rays average 18,476 fans a home game, the fewest in the American League. Only the Miami Marlins, one of the National League's worst teams, play in front of smaller crowds.
It underscores a fundamental disconnect between the Rays' on-field success -- they are in second place in the A.L. East, with a 66-49 record -- and their abject failure at the turnstiles. Fans and team officials cited a host of reasons, like a tough economy; the absence of baseball tradition; and an aging, antiseptic stadium in an isolated neighborhood across the bay from Tampa.
''I think people give lip service about this being a bad location,'' said Shannon Hillier, 58, who arrived for Joe Gnome Day with five family members, all of whom dressed in matching gnome hats. ''I live in Tampa, and the drive's not so bad. As for the stadium, is that why people come to games? For the stadium? That's not why I come to games. I come to watch baseball.''
At the All-Star Game last month, Commissioner Bud Selig said he was frustrated with the team's struggles luring fans to The Trop.
''It's very disappointing and very worrisome,'' Selig told reporters. ''The first thing I do every morning is look at the attendance at every game. It's beyond disappointing.'' He praised the Rays as having done a ''marvelous job,'' but said the situation was ''economically not tolerable.''
There is no ready-made solution on the horizon. The Rays are locked in a lease with the city to remain at Tropicana Field until 2027, though Mayor Bill Foster of St. Petersburg, in a recent interview with The Tampa Bay Times, said for the first time that he was open to letting the Rays explore new stadium options in Tampa. Any move would be a protracted process, however. Matt Silverman, the Rays' president, said the team would love to find a better location ''someday,'' and that day still appears far away.
The issue for now, and for the indefinite future, is that the team depends heavily on ticket sales to subsidize player payroll. The formula is simple, really: when fewer people pay to see the team play, the Rays have less money available to retain marquee stars like Price, the team's Cy Young Award-winning pitcher. In that sense, Tampa Bay's baseball and business sides are intertwined.
It has become one of baseball's thorniest problems, though one familiar to the Rays, who have had trouble attracting fans since their inaugural season, in 1998, when they averaged 30,942 per home game, according to Baseball-Reference.com. The novelty wore off. The Rays averaged 19,294 the next season and have not averaged more than 23,148 in any season since. Last year, they ranked 29th out of 30 teams in attendance, edging only the Marlins.
It has cost them. The Rays' $62 million player payroll is the lowest in the A.L., according to Baseball Prospectus. The Yankees, who benefit from a lucrative cable television deal, are in line to pay their players $228 million this season.
Silverman acknowledged that the Rays had learned to embrace the annual challenge of being outspent, largely because they have no choice. It has become part of their ethos -- that they must win by being smarter than everyone else. Whether that means making solid selections in the amateur draft (the Rays almost never misfire) or trading high-priced assets for up-and-coming talent (the current roster is filled with the results of such moves), the Rays have become highly adept at spending their money in the most efficient ways possible.
''Joe has been the one who gets the players hungry for the challenge of playing in the bright lights of the American League East,'' Silverman said. ''And we've had success. But it's hard to imagine that continuing without some relief from baseball.''
Silverman referred specifically to the market for international players. Though baseball has sought to restrict how much teams are allowed to spend -- there is now a sliding scale that favors the poorest-performing teams -- Silverman said it was not enough. For example, the Boston Red Sox and the Chicago Cubs still spend multiples of what the Rays do on free agents from baseball-rich countries like the Dominican Republic, Japan and Venezuela.
''Baseball's economic system is stacked against lower-revenue teams,'' Silverman said, ''and where we really see it is in access to talent.''
So the Rays are left to make tough choices. The team cracked open its piggy bank last winter to extend the contract of Longoria, its star third baseman, through 2023. The deal calls for Longoria to collect an average of $12.5 million a season, a big-time splurge for a team with bargain-bin resources.
By locking up Longoria, though, the Rays also left themselves vulnerable: What if he gets hurt? What if his performance declines?
''Greater resources would give us a margin for error,'' Silverman said. ''And we don't have that today.''
As a result, the Rays have to be spot on with their personnel decisions. A bad signing runs the risk of being an albatross; the team cannot afford to replace its mistakes. Tampa Bay caught a glimpse at one such doomsday possibility when Longoria labored through July with a .194 batting average.
For one month, at least, the Rays were able to compensate for his slump. They won 21 of 26 games by leaning on an emerging core of rookies. Outfielder Wil Myers, 22, who was acquired in a trade with the Kansas City Royals in December, hit .352 with 4 homers and 18 runs batted in. The right-hander Chris Archer, 24, went 4-0 and allowed three earned runs in 37 innings pitched.
Still, small crowds turned out to watch. It is a continuing battle. The Rays' marketing department has done yeoman's work: discounted tickets, postgame concerts, lunchbox giveaways. On Sept. 21, the Rays will host Star Wars Night, compete with a limited edition ''Jedi Zo'' bobblehead of the outfielder Ben Zobrist wielding a light saber. Zobrist said he would have preferred to be ''Zobi-Wan Kenobi,'' not that he was complaining.
''I think it's pretty cool,'' he said. ''I have some friends who are big ''Star Wars'' fans, and they think it's even cooler.''
The Rays' community outreach includes various grass-roots efforts by Maddon, who moonlights as the custodian of a quotation contest on Twitter. The fan who submits the best line of the day -- typically inspirational -- receives a Friend-O-Rays T-shirt in the mail. Maddon also includes the quotation on his lineup card. The only reason he maintains a Twitter account, he said, is to help sell the team to the public.
''I think it's good for the Rays, period,'' he said. ''I have no other agenda.''
Maddon said he would love for his team to play in front of more fans, and not just because it would increase revenue and enhance the team's ability to sign top talent. On a more fundamental level, Maddon believes that large crowds improve player performance.
''Everyone talks about it in New York, and I think it's a definite advantage,'' he said. ''You're held to a high standard, which really should draw out the best of each athlete on a daily basis. There's no moment when you can take any time off. You can't try to sneak by, because everybody is watching.''
For now, the Rays will continue to do what they have always done: their very best even when no one is around.

HEADLINE: This Ironman Market Is Still Lacking Respect

BYLINE: By JEFF SOMMER

 BODY:
UNLESS you know they're taking place, amazing feats of endurance and longevity are invisible in their early stages.
Few people paid much attention when a rookie named Lou Gehrig entered a Yankee game against the Washington Senators on June 1, 1925, and why would they? He was a pinch-hitter, and he didn't get on base. But he played the next day, and the next, and kept going for 2,130 consecutive games until nearly everybody noticed. After Gehrig's 2,000th game in 1938, this newspaper celebrated his achievement as ''a record which probably never will be surpassed.''
Records are made to be broken, of course. Cal Ripken Jr. shattered that one with an extraordinary attendance record of 2,632 consecutive games that started under everybody's radar on May 30, 1982. It ended with enormous hoopla more than 16 years later, and Ripken received credit for reviving baseball's popularity when fans deserted after the strike-shortened 1994 season.
Why bring up these stretches of workaday achievement now? It's not just that baseball, mired in another dreary steroid scandal this summer, could dearly use another quiet hero. 
As I noted in a column at the beginning of the year, making money is, arguably, the true national pastime of the United States. And for people who track the ups and downs of the financial markets, it may be time to take notice that another epic streak is well under way: the stock market rose at the opening bell of 2012, and it has never dropped below that level.
As streaks often do, this one started quietly enough. It began more than 19 months ago, on Jan. 3, 2012, the first trading day of the year. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index galloped out of the gate, immediately putting it into positive territory. While the market had many declines -- including a deep sag after President Obama's re-election in November -- the overall trend line was positive. In 2012, the stock market never fell below 1,258.86, its opening level for the year.
That seemed unusual enough when Paul Hickey, co-founder of the Bespoke Investment Group, alerted me about it at the end of last year, during what seemed to be a rocky period for the market. What's remarkable is that despite uneven and often lackluster economic reports, and amid continuing worries on Wall Street about the Federal Reserve's plans to taper its loose monetary policy, the stock market's long upward streak continues.
For the current calendar year, too, the S.& P. 500 has never closed below its January opening level. So the streak is now running strongly into its second year. How unusual is that? I asked Mr. Hickey to crunch the numbers. He's found that this is already the second-longest streak since 1928, when his records begin.
The longest lasted exactly two years. It started on the opening day of trading in 1975, extended through all of 1976, and ended on Jan. 3, 1977, the first trading day of that year, when the market fell. While the market had big gains in that period, that streak received little if any attention at the time.
The current streak has also received little fanfare. Neither, really, has the entire bull market in stocks.
''In some ways, it's the most detested bull market of all time,'' said Michael Hartnett, chief global equity strategist at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ''A big part of that comes from what preceded this market: the bursting of two large equity bubbles within a 10-year period, and the terrible trauma that caused.''
While there have been net inflows into stocks lately, many private clients and big institutional investors have never become comfortable with the current equity market, he said. The persistently weak economy has also dampened investors' enthusiasm.
''You hear more about the revival of the housing market these days than you do about the boom in the stock market,'' he said.
And yet the market has been extraordinarily strong, in a very understated way. There have been few big days in the market this year, for example, Mr. Hickey says. Big-volume days have tended to occur on down days, not when the market is rallying.
Only 10 percent of trading days in recent weeks have had gains of at least 1 percent, compared with more than 16 percent of such days since 1998, his data shows.
''There just haven't been a lot of big days that have captured headlines,'' he said.
For many market bulls, that lack of visibility is auspicious.
''I'm not seeing many signs of excess,'' said Laszlo Birinyi, president of Birinyi Associates, the stock market research firm in Westport, Conn. ''We have not reached the exuberant phase of the market cycle.''
In 2009, Mr. Birinyi was among the earliest strategists to declare that a new bull market had begun. While he says that after the big gains of recent months, it's quite possible that the market will move sideways or even decline for a time, he also says it's likely that the overall upward trend will continue.
Similarly, Richard Bernstein, formerly the chief investment strategist at Merrill Lynch and now the proprietor of his own firm and a fund manager for Eaton Vance, said, ''We're in the middle of one of the greatest bull markets of our careers, and practically no one recognizes it.''
People have been nervous about the economy, Mr. Bernstein said, ''but it's important to remember that the stock market sets prices off corporate profits, not G.D.P., and profits have been strong.''
In addition, he said, ''economists and politicians like to talk about absolutes of good or bad, but what the market cares about is better or worse, and the economy's gotten better.''
Still, the economy is troubled and the market's performance is not yet all that impressive by at least one very important measure. Adjust for inflation, and even after all of its advances since 2009, the market still isn't at a record high.
The highest that the S.& P. 500 has climbed in this cycle is 1,709.67, which it reached on Aug. 2. Taking inflation into account, Mr. Hickey says, the market's record peak occurred on March 24, 2000, when it hit roughly 2,093 in today's dollars. And on Oct. 9, 2007, it reached roughly 1,748, inflation-adjusted.
This long slog back toward the level of more than a decade ago has disillusioned many people.
''We're not seeing a lot of excitement about the market,'' Mr. Hickey said. So even if stocks keep grinding upward, it may be awhile before there's much excitement about the market streak.

HEADLINE: A Clean-Car Boom

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
In a welcome development for the planet, the cars on American streets are becoming much more climate-friendly much sooner than many had expected. Consumers are increasingly buying fuel-efficient hybrid and electric vehicles thanks to breakthrough innovations and supportive government policies. 
The transportation sector accounts for 28 percent of American greenhouse gas emissions, the most after power plants. Reducing those emissions will require many changes, including greater use of public transit. More efficient cars will almost certainly play a critical role, too; increased fuel efficiency helped reduce carbon dioxide emissions from passengers cars by 16 percent from 2005 to 2012.
Automakers sold more than 350,000 hybrid and electric cars in the first seven months of this year, up 30 percent from the same period in 2012. While these vehicles make up less than 4 percent of light vehicle sales, hybrids, which use electric motors and conventional engines, are now so mainstream that there are more than 40 models available. The most popular one, the Toyota Prius, is among the 10 best-selling passenger cars in the country.
Fully electric cars are still a niche product bought mostly by affluent drivers. But sales of even these vehicles have been growing fast, thanks in part to federal and state tax rebates. Among the best selling of these cars is the luxurious Model S produced by Tesla Motors, which has been so successful that companies like BMW and Cadillac are also rushing to bring out high-end electric cars.
Federal policy has been an important driver. The 2010 mandate requiring a doubling of new-car average fuel economy by 2025 has pushed industry to accelerate the development of more efficient cars. So has the Obama administration's program, much maligned by Republicans, of loan guarantees to renewable energy and electric-car companies. Despite a few regrettable failures, the government's $36 billion loan portfolio has suffered losses of just 2 percent; in May, Tesla paid off its $465 million loan nine years ahead of schedule.
Hybrid and electric cars still have a long way to go. That they have come this far shows that timely regulation, targeted assistance and government-private sector cooperation can pay big dividends for industry and the environment.

HEADLINE: Disorderly Conduct

BYLINE: By CHARLES ISHERWOOD

 BODY:
New plays these days tend to come in slimmed-down sizes, the better to accommodate the worrying economics of producing theater, both on Broadway and off, and at the country's major regional theaters. The Amoralists, an exuberantly iconoclastic Off Off Broadway company known for a raw, aggressive, hypertheatrical style, is, naturally, running off in the opposite direction. 
Their new show, ''The Cheaters Club,'' written and directed by the company's house playwright, Derek Ahonen, fields a cast of no less than 26 in a gothic Southern tale that promises to deliver heaping portions of the company's favorite dishes: sex, violence and disorderly family affairs. The club of the title -- three siblings and a recruit from outside the family -- high-tails it out of town once a year, leaving spouses behind, with the purpose of letting loose, or ''exorcising their sexual demons,'' as the press materials put it. This time their destination is Savannah, Ga., where these gleeful part-time adulterers find themselves in a hotel that shows signs of being haunted. (Performances start Saturday, Abrons Arts Center, 466 Grand Street, Lower East Side, 866-811-4111, theamoralists.com.)

HEADLINE: When Charter Schools Are in Churches, Conflict Is in the Air

BYLINE: By MORGAN SMITH

 BODY:
Three years, 5,000 door hangers and several garage sales after its opening, Beta Academy has a long waiting list but an empty bank account.
But if the school's founder, Latisha Andrews, has her way, Beta, a private elementary school that operates out of the Houston Christian Temple Assembly of God Church, will soon transform into a new operation: a publicly financed charter school.
If the state approves Ms. Andrews's application this fall, Beta Academy will join the many charter schools that have partnerships with religious institutions that have cropped up in cities across Texas since the charter school system was established in 1995. In the past three years, 16 of the 23 charter contracts the state has awarded have gone to entities with religious ties.
While charter school advocates say the practice often reflects no more than smart budgeting, some educators and others question whether the schools receive the proper oversight to ensure that religious groups are not benefiting from taxpayer dollars intended for public school students -- or that faith-based instruction is not entering those classrooms. 
Ms. Andrews started Beta Academy after her own church, which is across the street from Christian Temple and where her husband is a pastor, closed its private school because of declining enrollment.
While an elementary school principal there, she saw classes fill up with students from the local community, an economically depressed neighborhood near William P. Hobby Airport.
"We would enroll kids in third and fourth grade, and they couldn't read and write," she said.
Not wanting to abandon parents she said were desperate for options beyond the local public schools, she continued the school on her own. Although Christian Temple was a generous landlord, she said, she struggled to keep the school open.
"I sold everything out of my house just so kids could come, and I wasn't making a drop in the bucket," she said. ''Everyone wanted to come for free, it was hard, and I was trying to help all of them, paying half of their school tuitions.''
Because they are publicly financed, charter schools are required to teach secular, state-approved curriculums. When founded by a faith-based organization, they are also required to operate under a separate nonprofit entity. Because charter schools do not receive facilities financing from the state, a leasing agreement with a church, whose grounds often stand empty during weekdays, can be a cost-efficient arrangement for both parties.
''It's difficult to turn off the faucet of religion once it's there, whether it's in the shape of the building or the people who are running it,'' said Barry Lynn, the executive director of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State, a nonprofit advocacy group that has sued schools in Texas over this issue. ''If you are a person of faith you say, 'I am religious 24/7.' It's just really hard to turn religion off if you are as dedicated or as evangelical as many of these groups are.''
Texas Education Agency auditors have found inappropriate use of state money in such arrangements. Last summer, in the most recent example, it discovered that a San Antonio-based charter school's superintendent had used school funds to buy a former church, then leased that building to the school she led.
In June, Gov. Rick Perry signed a bill aimed at expanding the state's charter school system. Though provisions in the legislation increase state oversight of charters and beef up the vetting process for proposed schools, it does not contain language aimed at charter schools with connections to places of worship.
That is because state and federal laws already impose strict boundaries on public schools with any religious affiliations, said David Dunn, the director of the Texas Charter School Association. While there have been instances of abuse in the past, he said, charter operators overall were ''very aware'' of those restrictions.
''We think it is working appropriately now,'' Mr. Dunn said. ''The law is very clear. The agency has very clear monitoring and compliance instructions.''
He cited examples of schools going to great lengths to ensure the integrity of the church-state boundary. A church bulletin board was covered while school was in session. Leaders questioned whether a church member could walk down the hallway during the school day.
Bracy Wilson, a McKinney-based education consultant, has found a niche business helping build relationships between charter schools and churches. Since 2010, he has worked with nine clients connected with churches, including Beta Academy, through the state's charter school application process.
His professional interests evolved from a family background in the field. His father, Tom Wilson, founded Life Schools, a charter network that operates six campuses in the Dallas area. The first had its beginnings with the Oak Cliff Assembly of God Church, where he was a pastor at the time, more than a decade ago.
''When we are looking for a location, that church is often the most conservative lease structure or contract that is the least amount of money and most amount of quality for that school,'' Mr. Wilson said.
The issue is not so simple for others in the education community. In the 15 years that Jack Ammons spent auditing public schools across the state as a monitor for the education agency, he said he found it was ''nearly impossible'' for charter schools operating out of church facilities to avoid spending state funds on students in ways that also benefited the church.
While he said state supervision of charter schools with religious ties had improved, Mr. Ammons, who left the education agency in 2010, added that ''questionable practices'' still existed.
''There are schools once again where preachers are making good money off of keeping the charter schools in churches,'' he said.
Ms. Andrews said that before she approached the church across the street, she had exhausted her options trying to find an alternative location. Fifteen minutes after calling the church, she found herself sitting in the pastor's office, being told that the church had always wanted to have a school.
This is her second attempt at securing a charter school contract.
Her application failed to make it to the interview process the first time. The State Board of Education, which works with the Texas Education Agency to approve charter contracts, is not required to explain why applicants are turned down, but Ms. Andrews has a theory.
She initially applied under a nonprofit foundation that she and her husband had established, Wide Awake Ministries.
''It did have the word ministry in it,'' she said. ''The feedback I've gotten from several people was that they didn't want anyone affiliated with churches -- or Christians -- to get those charters.''
With the name of the nonprofit associated with her application now changed to the Beta Foundation, she said she hoped the outcome would be different.
She does not expect the shift from a private Christian school to public charter to be a challenge.
''I don't use a lot of Christian curriculum right now,'' she said. ''I know full well what the law says, and I have no problem being in compliance with the law.''

SON OF A GUNA Memoir
By Justin St. Germain242 pp. Random House. $26.
Justin St. Germain's spectacular memoir, ''Son of a Gun,'' calls to mind two others of the past decade: J. R. Moehringer's ''Tender Bar'' and Nick Flynn's ''Another Bull____ Night in Suck City.'' All three are about boys becoming men in a broken world. All three feature disappeared fathers. And all three dig into the reality behind the facade of the American dream: namely, that there is no glory in being a blue-collar grunt in this country, that to be working class is to live a tenuous existence, one in which the authors and half the people they know are one misstep away from surfing garage-sale sofas in other people's living rooms. 
Moehringer's and Flynn's books were set firmly in the humid, crowded American East. ''Son of a Gun,'' by stark contrast, is set in Arizona, the scorched, vast landscape of the new West -- populated, in St. Germain's skillful rendering, with people washed out of the East and determined to begin afresh. It's as if the characters in Moehringer's and Flynn's books had picked up and headed toward the setting sun, only to find themselves squinting into the desolation of a border town, the desert light throwing into harsh relief the feckless notion that they ever could have started over.
It's ''an elitist fantasy, the simple life,'' St. Germain writes of that lying dream. ''I ought to know better, ought to remember how it feels to live in a place like this, the grinding poverty, the lack of opportunity, all the kinds of self-defeat -- alcohol, drugs, gossip -- the gnawing fear that you haven't gotten away from the world, it's gotten away from you.''
The vehicle of St. Germain's book, the method by which he moves the narrative through time and place, is the killing of his mother, Deborah, at the age of 44, apparently by her fifth husband, Ray, a wrecked ex-cop about 10 years her junior. From the beginning we're told that Deborah -- ''a former Army paratrooper, the toughest woman I've ever known'' -- had a thing for violent men, that she took them in and tried to love them back to wholeness. ''And there was Ray, a man adrift, a project. She played the martyr until she became one.''
But this potentially sordid fact -- the gruesome murder of an illogically optimistic, erratically creative woman who ''liked horses and men,'' though ''that's not who she was'' -- is not, as it might have been in the hands of a lesser writer, the book's main point. St. Germain's bigger story, the one amplified from a tale of personal loss and grief into a parable for our time and our nation, is about a place awash with guns and paranoia, where men and women toil at grueling, thankless jobs and make misguided alliances in a desperate attempt to defend against loneliness.
Nowhere is this more wittily rendered than in St. Germain's reading of the Arizona ''Marriage Handbook,'' written in Spanish and English and distributed to everyone applying for a marriage license: ''The handbook contains sections on 'Addressing Economic Issues,' 'Taking Responsibility for Raising Children' and 'Learning Effective Confrontation.' I guess Ray never read it. It also has sections on 'Protecting Yourself From Domestic Violence' and 'Making a Personal Safety Plan.' I guess Mom didn't read it either.''
Guns and violence form the weather system roiling throughout St. Germain's memoir, and his deceptively nonchalant prose both cushions and perpetuates the shock of the injuries they precipitate. From the murder of his own mother, to the killing of a neighbor by her husband, to St. Germain's part in the youthful -- dare I say playful -- pellet-gun shooting of three girls, the writing is so matter-of-fact it reflects the casualness with which such cruelty is accepted in certain strata of our society: ''Danny paused, and I hoped he was done shooting, because I'd already lost the stomach for it. But he fired again, and again and again and again. . . . A scream, another. When it was over, all three girls had been hit and were grabbing at their tiny wounds, crying.'' We know, without St. Germain ever saying as much, that these tiny wounds are practice for the bigger wounds these girls have coming.
This isn't just speculation. At a support-group meeting in a rundown hospital complex in Tucson years after his mother's death, St. Germain discovers that ''everyone in this room lost their loved one to an angry man,'' and that ''judging solely by appearance, especially clothes and shoes, the one constant here is that everyone is working class, which makes sense, because so are a disproportionate number of the murder victims in America.''
Violence is America's fetish, and it's St. Germain's bête noire. In Tombstone, Ariz., where he's raised after his mother lands there (according to a former fiancé, ''she'd always wanted to see the O.K. Corral,'' the setting of Wyatt Earp's notorious gunfight), he remarks of the World's Largest Rosebush, ''It's my favorite place in all of Tombstone, the only pure thing in this whole town, the only attraction that doesn't depend on somebody dying.'' This single elegant sentence proves that if the brilliance of ''Son of a Gun'' lies in its restraint, its importance lies in the generosity of the author's insights.

ECSTATIC NATIONConfidence, Crisis, and Compromise, 1848-1877
By Brenda Wineapple722 pp. Harper. $35.
So many histories of the Civil War era have been published that one would think writing another would be pretty much a matter of choosing a major political event -- the Compromise of 1850, say, with its controversial Fugitive Slave Act -- and then pressing cruise control. We drive on a familiar freeway that takes us through a deepening valley: the growing gulf between the North and the South during the 1850s. We view familiar scenery like the Lincoln-Douglas debates. Then, suddenly, we encounter a multicar pileup: the Civil War. 
It is indeed tempting to piece together a narrative where everything falls neatly into place or, even if it doesn't, to imagine a sane resolution to the debate between antislavery and pro-slavery ideologues. A generation of historians known as the revisionists used their supposedly rational perspective to argue that the Civil War was ''unnecessary,'' caused by issues that could have been solved through reasoned discussion and political compromise. That view, which was vigorously challenged in the later decades of the 20th century, has made something of a comeback in recent years among those who contend that there must have been ways in which a war that killed approximately 750,000 Americans could have been averted. If we had only gone left, not right, on that freeway, we could have avoided the smashup.
In ''Ecstatic Nation: Confidence, Crisis, and Compromise, 1848-1877,'' her splendid new history of the Civil War period, Brenda Wineapple takes us on a different ride. Think the Monaco Grand Prix: zigzagging, sometimes precipitous, with hairpin turns that slow you to a crawl followed by straightaways where you reach 200. Lincoln is there, of course, along with all the other major players, but the usual dichotomies are replaced by a kaleidoscope of outsize personalities, conflicting visions and unforeseen events.
In other words, Wineapple gives us history as it feels in real time: full of plans that backfire, schemes foiled by chance, outliers who suddenly change everything and happy endings that turn out to be not too happy after all. And, somehow, the whole untidy situation pushes us toward social progress. ''Ecstatic Nation'' is not a book with an overt agenda. Its message is delivered through its vivid portrayal of the human side of an era, following the roiling tides of emotions -- erratic, shifting and ultimately overpowering.
Lincoln once confessed that he didn't control events; they controlled him. But if he wasn't in control, who was? Everyone, Wineapple demonstrates. Everyone in that tumultuous time.
Wineapple's title comes from an Emily Dickinson poem about ''A single Continent'' where ''One -- is the Population-- / Numerous enough -- / This ecstatic Nation / Seek -- it is Yourself.'' The image reminds us of the importance of the individual in history. The nation is a motley assortment of individuals, and the individual is a mini-nation of selves. As Walt Whitman, the quintessential poet of American democracy, proclaimed in 1855, ''I am large, I contain multitudes.''
All too often, Civil War histories are dominated by accounts of military strategy, party positions, social currents, economic trends and so on. While not ignoring such themes -- indeed, her book is a reliable repository of factual information about the Civil War -- Wineapple brings alive the vibrant, imperfect people behind the issues: not just the leaders in Washington and on the battlefield but the quixotic adventurers who tried to take over Cuba and Nicaragua, the pro-slavery hotheads, the fervent abolitionists, the poets, the showmen, the shysters and the spirit-rappers who conversed with the dead. Ecstatic indeed.
With so many individuals bouncing off one another and gravitating to opposite sides of the slavery issue, small wonder that a blood bath resulted. Wineapple finds that, despite all sorts of political deals put on the table, polarized passions became an unstoppable force. By 1860, she writes, ''a certain sense of inevitability'' had overtaken the nation. ''War seemed a foregone conclusion'' because there was no ''incentive to budge, to question one's own righteousness, to create the grounds on which a compromise might occur.''
There were many bold efforts to challenge slavery. The Liberty Party in the 1840s tried politics, to no avail. Another method was to reject the government altogether. That was the choice of the radical abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison, who publicly burned the Constitution, which he considered a pro-slavery document, and urged the North to secede from the South. Another strategy was Christian persuasion, the avenue taken by Harriet Beecher Stowe in ''Uncle Tom's Cabin,'' which showed the human side of enslaved people. Yet another was individual military action, taken by John Brown, who willingly gave his life in his holy war against slavery.
But all of these efforts, no matter how very different they were, led to slavery becoming ever more deeply entrenched in the reactionary South. One of the strengths of Wineapple's book is it shows how moderates were inexorably sucked into the vortexes of the sectional passions that led to the war. She tells, for example, of Alexander Stephens, a temperate Georgia representative who in 1859 abandoned politics because he found himself, in his words, caught between two trains, each with a drunken engineer, headed on a collision course. Soon, however, Stephens was right back on the Southern train after being selected as the vice president of the Confederacy, which he extolled as a model society based on the ''great physical, philosophical and moral truth'' of the inferiority of blacks.
Efforts to ward off war, Wineapple makes clear, were as fruitless in the North as in the South. Lincoln rejected the incendiary tactics of abolitionists and carefully adhered to the principles of the nation's founders. In 1858 he declared that war was not the solution to slavery, which he said might take as long as a century to disappear. But to his pro-slavery opponents Lincoln was just another devilish radical.
Wineapple relates the war and its aftermath with economy and power. The four-year conflict ended slavery but could not bring a lasting resolution to the race problem. Early in Reconstruction, blacks briefly gained political ascendancy in the South with the help of Northern pressure, but then complacency set in. By 1876, Reconstruction had collapsed, and Jim Crow was beginning to be put in place. In the North, many erstwhile abolitionists abandoned their former radicalism; the few who retained it, like Wendell Phillips, Lydia Maria Child and Frederick Douglass, became lonely prophets of a civil rights movement that would take nearly a century to rouse the nation's conscience.
Wineapple makes good use of her gift -- visible also in her other fine books on Hawthorne and Emily Dickinson -- of communicating vast amounts of information in lively, cogent prose. She makes familiar historical figures seem fresh and unfamiliar ones seem vitally important. The result is a masterly, deeply moving record of a crucial period in American history.

HEADLINE: Sunday Dialogue: Sell Masterpieces to Help Save a City?

 BODY:
Readers discuss the value of art museums as Detroit weighs how to solve its financial crisis.
To the Editor:
The choice being debated in Detroit -- whether to sell works from the Detroit Institute of Arts to help pay the city's debts -- is agonizing. How can we equate a few pieces of canvas with paint on them with the pensions of thousands of firefighters, nurses, police officers, teachers and other civil servants?
The same choice is being played out in many other communities across the country. In a sense, we have always had this dilemma, but this time, there are several special factors. One is that cities and towns are going bankrupt, and they can't continue to provide basic services, let alone support for art museums. Another factor is the stunning rise in prices for works of art. Thousands of works go for over a million dollars every year; eight- and even nine-figure prices are common. 
Mixed into this is the fact that museums have become dependent on support from federal, state and local government in the form of tax subsidies, tax exemptions, especially from real estate tax, and, most important, tax deductions. At the same time, private donors are being asked to give more and more; how long will the 1 percent agree to subsidize a service for the 99 percent? There are more than 100,000 nonprofit arts organizations in this country, all with their hands out.
How can museums justify this kind of support? We claim to be moral institutions, open to all, providing the best to the most, and we all work hard to do just that. But is that really our audience? Don't we, for the most part, serve the affluent, the educated, the converted, those who are on our side of the income and education gap?
Museums make a determined effort to widen their audience -- the Detroit Institute of Arts is a leader in that effort -- but we are still falling short. The shortfall is where that agonizing question arises: How many lives is a Rembrandt worth?
FRANK ROBINSON Ithaca, N.Y., Aug. 5, 2013
The writer was a museum director for 35 years, at Williams College, the Rhode Island School of Design and Cornell University.

''How many lives is a Rembrandt worth?''
If we follow this line of thought and take a running start down its slippery slope in history, we would quickly arrive in the 2009 boardroom at Brandeis University, where choices seemed nonexistent and the art collection necessarily fungible. Thousands of employees would lose their jobs if the university closed under the weight of its sudden financial losses. Unsurprisingly, other options besides selling art emerged.
Taken to global dimensions, why don't we insist that Greece sell its art and architecture to pay its bills and feed its people? ''How many lives is the Acropolis worth?''
Detroit's financial condition isn't the result of sudden factors. Like other municipalities, the city has been living off disastrous short-term thinking and an absence of long-term investment. However, more short-term thinking will only perpetuate disaster. Sell Detroit's gems, and they are gone forever.
Let's commission economists to determine the long-term value of keeping the collection in Detroit compared with the one-time limited dollar value of its sale.
Perhaps a recent property tax that provides $23 million annually for the D.I.A. should be reduced commensurate with other cutbacks imposed across the city. Certainly, the D.I.A. should make some sacrifices along with the rest of the city dying around it.
NATALIE MARSH Director Gund Gallery at Kenyon College Gambier, Ohio, Aug. 7, 2013
How many lives has a Rembrandt saved?
Growing up in Detroit in the 1950s, the daughter of a factory worker, I didn't have books, paintings and music around the home. In high school my art teacher, Irving Berg, signed me up for a sculpture class at the Detroit Institute of Arts. I had never been there.
When the bus stopped in front of the museum, I got out (heart racing), walked toward a huge statue (Rodin's ''The Thinker''), ascended the wide marble stairs, opened the doors and walked in. I was changed. A transformative moment like this cannot be unique to me.
As a kid from the East Side of Detroit, I was able to wander the galleries of my art museum. What a gift.
Today I am an artist.
MARIE TAPERT Whitmore Lake, Mich., Aug. 7, 2013
If the proceeds from selling a Rembrandt really did feed hungry children, I'd be in favor. But the money would go to paying off those who purchased bonds, lent money or extended credit to Detroit, whose financial fortunes have been sliding downward for decades.
There are no guaranteed investments. Let those who gambled incur the losses. And let this be a cautionary tale not forgotten.
SHEILA SORVARI Austin, Tex., Aug. 7, 2013
Mr. Robinson's letter raises some very important questions, but also poses false choices. Although the bankruptcy proceedings may require a valuation of all of Detroit's assets, we believe that those responsible for restoring the city's fiscal health will conclude that the sale of the D.I.A.'s collection -- if, indeed, such a step is legally permissible -- would be both terribly shortsighted and wrong from an economic point of view. However much the collection may be worth on the market today, this figure is inconsequential in comparison to its long-term value to the city and region as a cultural asset.
Just last year voters validated this point of view by supporting a levy to provide an additional $23 million in annual operating funds for the D.I.A. Far from seeing it as an institution supported by the affluent for the benefit of the privileged few, the citizens of Wayne, Oakland and Macomb Counties affirmed their belief in the importance of this great museum to their communities now and in the future.
It is our fervent hope that Detroit will emerge from this economic crisis with renewed confidence and all of the resources, including cultural institutions, to prosper once again.
TIMOTHY RUB CHRISTINE ANAGNOS Philadelphia, Aug. 8, 2013
The writers are, respectively, president and executive director of the Association of Art Museum Directors. Mr. Rub is director of the Philadelphia Museum of Art.
Mr. Robinson asks, ''How many lives is a Rembrandt worth?'' I suggest that the humane answer is none.
Those who consider art essential to civilization should realize that it is even more essential for a civilized society not to abandon its most vulnerable members, let alone break its promise of pensions to those who have invested their working lives in public service.
Would you sacrifice your life, or your child's life, for a Rembrandt? If not, why expect your fellow citizens to sacrifice theirs?
FELICIA NIMUE ACKERMAN Providence, R.I., Aug. 8, 2013
The writer is a professor of philosophy at Brown University.
If Detroit wishes to raise some revenue from its museum's art collection, there may be options less drastic than selling works of art. Objects could be leased for defined periods of time to other museums, or to private collectors for the duration of their lives, so the museum would be assured of their eventual return. The reassembly of the collection could be staged as a celebration by the museum in the future, once Detroit gets past its current troubles.
Works could also be sent on tour to other museums -- this was famously (and infamously) done to raise revenue for the Barnes Foundation. Such a tour would expose people in diverse places to the treasures that have until now been reserved for Detroiters. People attending the touring exhibit might feel that they are supporting Detroit, as well as enjoying its art.
RON L. MEYERS New York, Aug. 7, 2013
The writer is an estate planning attorney.
It's 2013, and there are Whistlers, van Goghs and Caravaggios in Detroit. A few of them are hanging in a trophy case called the Detroit Institute of Arts. But many more are sleeping in a kindergarten classroom because they didn't eat breakfast.
The $150 million estimated market value of a piece like Matisse's ''The Window'' is just that: a market value that has little to do with art. The real value of art emerges when people engage with it, and this requires an investment in education. Trooping a line of inner-city schoolchildren past a million-dollar painting (a painting that they are, of course, not allowed to touch) reinforces market values and hierarchies without promoting, or generating, real art.
Arts education does not depend on expensive paintings; it depends on (relatively cheap) books, supplies and teachers. I think Detroit should sell its collection and pay off its debt. But the city should also set money aside to cultivate the city's children -- its future Caravaggios -- whose deep reserves of talent might otherwise disappear, unheard and unseen.
ANGELA SORBY Milwaukee, Aug. 7, 2013
The writer is a professor of creative writing and the author of a forthcoming book of poems based on paintings and photographs.
The Writer Responds
For many people, and not just museum people like me, making great art available to everyone is vital for a healthy society. Ms. Marsh rightly asks where the sale of Detroit's cultural assets would lead and cites the infamous, botched attempt of Brandeis University to sell off its collection.
Nevertheless, as Ms. Ackerman eloquently points out, the practical, political and moral question remains for Detroit and, to a lesser degree, for other museums: the pensions of civil servants, as well as basic municipal services, will be cut without some infusion of cash, and the institute's paintings are significant assets. If we don't sell them, what do we tell those retired schoolteachers and firefighters?
Mr. Rub and Ms. Anagnos, as well as Ms. Tapert and Ms. Sorby, go to the heart of the matter. The justification for the cost of museums and preserving our cultural legacy is in the power of works of art to enhance our lives, educate us and move us. Ms. Tapert's story is a profound illustration of the extraordinary impact of museums' many education programs for the whole community, and especially for children.
Nevertheless, some people still feel that the use of society's resources for art museums during a crisis is not justified. Museums must deal with that doubt, reach out even more and demonstrate once again that, in fact, they do save lives.

HEADLINE: Did We Waste A Crisis?

BYLINE: By ADAM DAVIDSON. 
Adam Davidson is co-founder of NPR's ''Planet Money,'' a podcast and blog.

 BODY:
Five years ago this month, before Lehman Brothers imploded and the global economy lurched to a halt, Fannie Mae issued a report that encapsulated the financial system's biggest problem. The mortgage-finance company, which was wobbling on account of rising defaults, tried to reassure investors that it had $47 billion in capital, which was considerably more than the $30 million required by law. At the time, the report's authors seemed to fear that some investors might think Fannie was too cautious. In any event, a month later, that protection seemed like a joke. Fannie may have conformed to the rules, but the rules didn't conform to reality. The lender and its brother company, Freddie Mac, were declared insolvent and handed over to the U.S. government. 
Remarkably, five years after the crisis, the health of the financial industry is just as hard to determine. A major bank or financial institution could meet every single regulatory requirement yet still be at risk of collapse, and few of us would even know it. Despite endless calls for change, many of the economists I've spoken with have lamented that the reports that banks issue about their finances remain all but useless. The sprawling Dodd-Frank Act, which rewrote banking regulation in 2010, didn't resolve things so much as inaugurate a process of endless rules-writing by regulators. Meanwhile, the European Union is in the early stages of figuring out how it will change the way it regulates banks; and the gargantuan issue of coordinating regulations across borders has only barely begun. All of these regulatory decisions are complicated, in part, by a vast army of financial-industry lobbyists that overwhelms the relatively few consumer advocates.
Economists have also been locked in their own long-running arguments about how to make the banking industry safer. These disagreements, which are generally split between the left and the right, can have the certainty and anger of religious wars: the right accuses the left of hobbling banks and undermining prosperity; the left counters that the relatively lax regulation advocated by the right will lead to a corrupt oligarchy. But there actually is consensus on one of the most important issues. Paul Schultz, director of the Center for the Study of Financial Regulation at the University of Notre Dame, led a project that brought together scholars of financial regulation from the left, the right and the center to figure out what caused the financial crisis and how to prevent a sequel. They couldn't agree on anything, he told me. But a great majority favored higher equity requirements, which is bankerspeak for the notion that banks shouldn't be allowed to borrow so much.
I conducted my own Schultz test by talking to Anat Admati and Charles Calomiris, prominent finance professors at Stanford and Columbia, respectively, who roughly define the opposite ends of the argument over bank regulation. Admati is a Democrat, Calomiris a Republican. In her recent book, ''The Bankers' New Clothes,'' for example, Admati has argued that bankers misrepresent their finances. Calomiris, who used to be a banker, is generally seen as friendly to the field. As I spoke to them both, they also disagreed on everything until the conversation turned to borrowing. At which point, they independently explained that banks borrow too much, that the government rules are too confusing and that the public has been misled.
I asked Admati and Calomiris to explain their problem with the current system. I randomly chose Citigroup's most recent annual S.E.C. report, a 300-page tome filled with complex legal jargon outlining the bank's performance. The key number that we looked for was the capital-adequacy ratio, which is a measure of how much capital you need to back up the risk of your assets. This is supposed to be the one number that makes clear whether a bank is prepared for a crisis. A high ratio means the bank's owners could bear most losses without requiring a bailout. A low number means the opposite.
It was extremely hard, though, to know how Citi was faring. Calomiris pointed out that the bank reports several different measures, ranging from what appears to be a safe capital ratio of 17.26 percent (implying the bank maintains a loss-absorbing buffer of $17 for every $100 of the assets it owns) to a potentially worrisome 7.48 percent (with stops at 14.06, 12.67 and 8.7 percent). When I asked Admati how healthy the bank was, she replied, ''It's hopeless for anyone to know.''
The problem isn't Citigroup's. The problem, both Admati and Calomiris say, is the rules themselves, which instruct banks to use complex formulas to calculate their leverage ratios based on different definitions of capital and debt. If it's enough to confuse finance professors, how are the rest of us supposed to make any sense of this? (A spokesman for Citi responded by e-mail that ''Citi is a strong and well-capitalized institution'' that follows regulatory standards and guidelines.)
Admati, Calomiris and numerous economists have told me they would like to replace this system with something simple. There are many ways to do this. Regulators could define capital very narrowly (as money that the shareholders of banks could lose without requiring a bailout), and debt quite broadly (as all the exposure a bank has, including derivatives, off-balance-sheet entities and so forth). The ratio could be set higher than it is now, somewhere around 10 percent. (There is still plenty of disagreement over this number. Admati would love to more than double it.) But once that percentage was set, reviewing the soundness of a bank would be as simple as checking the letter grade of a restaurant in New York City.
Most bankers I've met, and even a few economists, say that such rules would make lending more burdensome and therefore weaken the overall economy. If the rules were imposed in the United States but not elsewhere, their argument goes, it would hamper American competitiveness. Many suggest, as one bank official recently told me, that calculating a bank's capital is just complicated, and that there's no way to make it simple.
However, most experts I've talked to -- particularly those who aren't paid by banks -- favor strong and simple bank rules. (For what it's worth, banking experts aren't infallible; they once largely agreed that there wouldn't be a financial crisis.) But even if these rules might make American banks smaller and less competitive and mean fewer loans, that's a reasonable price, the argument goes, for a sounder system. And given all the ideas about reforming our banking system -- like breaking up the largest banks or reimposing Glass-Steagall-like separation of investment and commercial banking -- I haven't heard any alternative that has the same level of support. The Federal Reserve and other U.S. regulators recently proposed stiffer capital rules; one bill proposed in the Senate, known as Brown-Vitter, would apply even stricter capital rules to the largest banks. But while the bill has garnered some attention, it seems unlikely to pass.
Confusion was central to the financial crisis; banks collapsed or needed bailouts, in part, because few trusted, or even understood, the information they provided about their health. In finance, though, complexity often means profit. As Admati told me, there's a lot of money in making financial products whose risk few understand. Simplicity might be good for economics, but it's lousy for Wall Street bonuses.
Deep thoughts this week:
1. Five years later, we haven't made the financial system much safer.
2. But the solution might not be complicated.
3. And that's the problem.

HEADLINE: Help Thy Neighbor and Go Straight to Prison

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

 BODY:
IF you want to understand all that is wrong with America's criminal justice system, take a look at the nightmare experienced by Edward Young.
Young, now 43, was convicted of several burglaries as a young man but then resolved that he would turn his life around. Released from prison in 1996, he married, worked six days a week, and raised four children in Hixson, Tenn.
Then a neighbor died, and his widow, Neva Mumpower, asked Young to help sell her husband's belongings. He later found, mixed in among them, seven shotgun shells, and he put them aside so that his children wouldn't find them.
''He was trying to help me out,'' Mumpower told me. ''My husband was a pack rat, and I was trying to clear things out.'' 
Then Young became a suspect in burglaries at storage facilities and vehicles in the area, and the police searched his home and found the forgotten shotgun shells as well as some stolen goods. The United States attorney in Chattanooga prosecuted Young under a federal law that bars ex-felons from possessing guns or ammunition. In this case, under the Armed Career Criminal Act, that meant a 15-year minimum sentence.
The United States attorney, William Killian, went after Young -- even though none of Young's past crimes involved a gun, even though Young had no shotgun or other weapon to go with the seven shells, and even though, by all accounts, he had no idea that he was violating the law when he helped Mrs. Mumpower sell her husband's belongings.
In May, a federal judge, acknowledging that the case was Dickensian but saying that he had no leeway under the law, sentenced Young to serve a minimum of 15 years in federal prison. It didn't matter that the local authorities eventually dismissed the burglary charges.
So the federal government, at a time when it is cutting education spending, is preparing to spend $415,000 over the next 15 years to imprison a man for innocently possessing seven shotgun shells while trying to help a widow in the neighborhood. And, under the law, there is no early release: Young will spend the full 15 years in prison.
This case captures what is wrong with our ''justice'' system: We have invested in mass incarceration in ways that are crushingly expensive, break up families and are often simply cruel. With less than 5 percent of the world's population, the United States has almost one-quarter of the world's prisoners.
This hasn't always been the case, but it is the result of policies such as mandatory minimum sentences since the 1970s.
In 1978, the United States had 307,000 inmates in state and federal prisons. That soared to a peak of more than 1.6 million in 2009. Since then, the number of inmates has declined for three consecutive years to 1.57 million in 2012. The number of juveniles detained has also begun to drop since peaking in 2000, although the U.S. still detains children at a rate five times that of the next highest country.
In short, there's some hope that this American experiment in mass incarceration has been recognized as a failure and will be gradually unwound. Among the leaders in moving away from the old policies are blue states and red states alike, including New York and Texas. But America still has twice as many prisoners today as under President Ronald Reagan.
Almost everyone seems to acknowledge that locking up vast numbers of nonviolent offenders is a waste of money. California devotes $179,400 to keep a juvenile in detention for a year, and spends less than $10,000 per student in its schools.
Granted, mass incarceration may have been one factor in reduced crime in the last couple of decades; there's mixed evidence. But, if so, the economic and social cost has been enormous -- including the breakup of families and the increased risk that children of those families will become criminals a generation later.
There's also contrary evidence that incarceration, especially of young people, doesn't work well in preventing crime, especially for young people. One careful study of 35,000 young offenders by Anna Aizer and Joseph J. Doyle Jr. reached the startling conclusion that jailing juveniles leads them to be more likely to commit crimes as adults. Milder sentences, such as electronic monitoring and home detention, were actually more effective at preventing adult crime.
Alternatives to incarceration are both cheaper and more efficient. Youth Villages has an excellent record of working with troubled youngsters and their families, and of keeping them from committing crimes. So do some job-training and education programs. Mass incarceration has been particularly devastating for blacks and members of other minority groups, as well as for the poor generally. In this case, Edward Young is white.
Conservatives often argue that there is a link between family breakdown and cycles of poverty. They're right: Boys are more likely to get into trouble without a dad at home, and we have a major problem with the irresponsibility of young men who conceive babies but don't raise them.
We also have a serious problem with the irresponsibility of mass incarceration. When almost 1 percent of Americans are imprisoned (and a far higher percentage of men of color in low-income neighborhoods), our criminal justice system becomes a cause of family breakdown and contributes to the delinquency of a generation of children. And mass incarceration interacts with other government policies, such as the way the drug war is implemented, to have a disproportionate effect on African-Americans. Black men use marijuana at roughly the same rate as white men but are more than three times as likely to be arrested over it.
Young is particularly close to his children, ages 6 to 16. After back problems and rheumatoid arthritis left him disabled, he was a stay-at-home dad while his wife worked in a doctor's office. When the judge announced the sentence, the children all burst into tears.
''I can't believe my kids lose their daddy for the next 15 years,'' his wife, Stacy, told me. ''He never tried to get a firearm in the 16 years I was with him. It's crazy. He's getting a longer sentence than people who've killed or raped.''
Young's lawyer, Christopher Varner, of Chattanooga, is appealing the sentence and says he is shaken by the outcome. ''It's shocking,'' he says. ''That's not what we do in this country.''
I asked Killian, the United States attorney, why on earth he would want to send a man to prison for 15 years for innocently possessing seven shotgun shells. ''The case raised serious public safety concerns,'' Killian said.
Oh.
The classic caricature of justice run amok is Inspector Javert in Victor Hugo's novel ''Les Misérables,'' pursuing Jean Valjean for stealing bread for hungry children. In that case, Valjean knew that he was breaking the law; Edward Young had no idea.
Some day, Americans will look back and wonder at how we as a society could be much more willing to invest in prisons than in schools. They will be astonished that we sent a man to federal prison for 15 years for trying to help a widow.

HEADLINE: The Fed, Lawrence Summers, and Money

BYLINE: By LOUISE STORY and ANNIE LOWREY

 BODY:
When Lawrence H. Summers left his job as President Obama's top economic policy adviser at the end of 2010 to return to Harvard University, one of his first steps was to set up a roster of part-time positions that would touch on just about every corner of the financial world.
But as he negotiated with a prominent venture capital firm in Silicon Valley, Mr. Summers made one thing very clear: he needed an exit plan, in case he returned to public service.
''That was generally the assumption,'' said Marc Andreessen, the co-founder of the firm. ''If he did, he needed a way to do a clean disengage.'' 
Today, the Obama administration is considering nominating Mr. Summers as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve. If the White House does so, Mr. Summers's financial disclosure -- including his recent consulting jobs, paid speeches and service on company boards -- will be one of the hottest documents in Washington. Among the top contenders for the position, Mr. Summers has by far the most Wall Street experience and the most personal wealth.
In addition to rejoining the Harvard faculty in 2011, he jumped into a moneymaking spree. His clock was ticking partly because he knew that the Fed chairmanship, to which he has long aspired, was likely to open up in early 2014, when Ben S. Bernanke's second term will come to an end.
''With Larry, my wife always says that it's hard to be happy if you want to have the most money because you'll never have the most money,'' said Jeremy I. Bulow, an economics professor at Stanford University who is a friend and co-author of academic papers with Mr. Summers. ''He's kind of been going about his life just on the basis of 'who knows what's going to come next?' and just sort of maximizing his experiences, given the opportunities in front of him.''
The opportunities have been many over the last two years. Mr. Summers, 58, has been employed by the megabank Citigroup and the sprawling hedge fund D. E. Shaw. He works for a firm that advises small banks as well as the exchange company Nasdaq OMX. And he serves on the board of two Silicon Valley start-ups: both financial firms that may pursue initial public offerings in the next year. One of them, Lending Club, offers loans to consumers and small businesses by making arrangements directly with online investors, a new business model that falls into a regulatory gap that consumer advocates say may lead to risky borrowing.
Before his tenure in the Obama administration, Mr. Summers had accumulated personal wealth of at least $7 million; the last two years have most likely added considerably to that. But his money and Wall Street connections put him in an awkward position, partly because the next person to lead the Federal Reserve will oversee the writing of several key new regulations from the Dodd-Frank financial reform bill.
Wall Street experience is not unprecedented for a Fed chairman. The departing chairman, Mr. Bernanke, has never been employed on Wall Street, spending most of his career at Princeton. But his predecessor, Alan Greenspan, was the president of a consulting firm and worked in investment banking early in his career, and Paul A. Volcker, an earlier chairman, did some work at Chase Manhattan Bank, which is now a part of JPMorgan Chase.
Still, some senators are speaking out against Mr. Summers. They are raising questions about potential conflicts of interest and noting his role in the repeal of the Glass-Steagall law, which limited the sorts of activities banks could undertake, and his opposition to regulating derivatives in the 1990s -- decisions that many critics say contributed to the financial crisis.
''I start from a position of being extraordinarily skeptical that Larry Summers is appropriate to chair the Fed,'' said Senator Jeff Merkley, a Democrat from Oregon. ''I have serious doubts that Mr. Summers, who as a committed deregulator drove policies that set the stage for the Great Recession, is the right person for a key regulatory position.''
Mr. Summers declined to comment. But whatever his views on regulatory policy, those who know and admire Mr. Summers say he arrived at them honestly.
''There has to be a distinction between talking to people, even for payment, and doing what they want you to do,'' said Robert Z. Lawrence, a professor who taught a course at Harvard with Mr. Summers this year. ''When it comes to Larry Summers, for good or for bad, he's uncontrollable when it comes to the positions he takes. He doesn't take them for that reason.''
Wall Street Wealth
Mr. Summers's wealth comes mainly from two periods of private sector work between government postings. After a lengthy tenure at the Treasury Department in the 1990s, he became the president of Harvard -- a job that Robert E. Rubin, who preceded Mr. Summers as Treasury secretary, helped him obtain.
But in 2006, Mr. Summers was forced out of the university presidency for a variety of reasons, including remarks he made questioning why few women engage in advanced scientific and mathematical work. Soon after, a young Harvard alum brought him into the hedge fund world with a part-time posting at D. E. Shaw. That firm, one of the largest in the industry, paid Mr. Summers more than $5 million.
Mr. Summers's wealth soared from around $400,000 in the mid-1990s to between $7 million and $31 million in 2009, when he joined the Obama administration, according to a financial disclosure he filed at the time. Before returning to government service, he earned $2.7 million from speeches in one year alone.
As for his current work, representatives for Citigroup, Nasdaq and D. E. Shaw declined to disclose his pay. His speaking rates today run into the six figures, according to an associate who spoke on the condition of anonymity, and Mr. Summers has spoken to Wall Street companies like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup.
The job that is likely to generate the most scrutiny for Mr. Summers is his work with Citigroup, which was rescued from the brink of bankruptcy by the federal government's bailout. Though he does not have an office there, two people with direct knowledge of the matter said he was a regular consultant. In a statement, Citigroup said he provided ''insight on a broad range of topics including the global and domestic economy'' to prestigious clients, and attended internal meetings.
Citigroup hired Mr. Summers in part to advise Vikram S. Pandit, who resigned as chief executive last year. With his work there, Mr. Summers followed in the footsteps of his friend, Mr. Rubin, who joined Citigroup after he left the government and earned more than $100 million.
Some of Mr. Summers's employers used to work with him in government.
''I don't think of him as an employee, I like to think of him as an adviser,'' said Lewis A. Sachs, a former Treasury official who runs a Maryland firm called Alliance Partners that is backed by BlackRock, the asset management firm, and BlueMountain Capital, a hedge fund active in the derivatives market.
Mr. Sachs, a frequent visitor to the White House and Treasury, said Mr. Summers's financial work would make him a better Fed chairman.
''It will certainly give him a lot of windows into different parts of the financial system, different parts of the economy,'' Mr. Sachs said.
Asked why Mr. Summers would not have simply opted out of financial work, given the questions it could raise if he were nominated to lead the Federal Reserve, Mr. Bulow, the Stanford economist, said he thought Mr. Summers's early experience with cancer (at the age of 28, he was treated for Hodgkin's disease) had been formative. It shaped him to make decisions based on present options, Mr. Bulow said, rather than worrying about future unknowns, like whether President Obama would choose him for the Fed.
''He doesn't proceed that way,'' Mr. Bulow said. ''I think basically, you know, it's a little bit like Sheryl Sandberg says, 'Don't leave before you're leaving.' ''
Mr. Summers's spokeswoman, Kelly Friendly, declined to provide details about his current pay, but said his ''broad exposure to different parts of the economy gives him a unique perspective on what makes America work.''
In 2009, Mr. Summers said in an interview with The New York Times that he kept boundaries between his private and public work. ''I wanted to be involved as an economist, not as a lobbyist,'' he said. ''I never wanted to be in a position of taking public policy positions based on anything other than my convictions as an economist or a potential policy maker.''
Close Contacts in Finance
Mr. Summers not only has a variety of professional contacts on Wall Street, he also has many friends there. At D. E. Shaw, for instance, Mr. Summers has worked with Darcy Bradbury, the firm's head of external affairs, who has known him for more than 30 years, ever since she was a student at Harvard.
Ms. Bradbury, who also worked with Mr. Summers in the Clinton administration, was elected chairwoman of the hedge fund industry's association shortly after Mr. Summers began his work in the White House in 2009. That group, the Managed Funds Association, has been involved in discussions of industry trading rules as well as pushing for the preservation of a tax loopholes that benefit investment firms.
Trey Beck, a managing director of D. E. Shaw, said in a statement that Ms. Bradbury did not meet with Mr. Summers on behalf of D. E. Shaw or the hedge fund association while he was in the White House. He added that ''Darcy's friendship with Larry had absolutely nothing to do with Darcy becoming M.F.A. chair.''
Richard W. Painter, a former chief ethics lawyer for President George W. Bush, predicted that Mr. Summers's work in finance would not derail his nomination or confirmation.
''Remember, we had two secretaries of the Treasury, which is a regulatory position, who were chairmen of Goldman Sachs,'' said Mr. Painter, who is now a professor at the University of Minnesota. ''We did it with Hank Paulson. Clinton did it with Bob Rubin.''
Mr. Painter noted that if Mr. Summers became Fed chairman, he would have to fully divest himself of all interests in the financial companies he works with.
The divestitures, he said, would include even the start-ups, companies that have the potential for Mr. Summers to make sizable future earnings, if they pursue public offerings.
If Mr. Summers goes to the Fed, Mr. Andreessen said, ''it would be a reasonable statement that he's leaving money on the table.''
A Toehold in Silicon Valley
Mr. Summers has also made contacts in Silicon Valley. Ms. Sandberg, chief operating officer of Facebook, best-selling author of ''Lean In,'' and Mr. Summers's chief of staff at the Treasury, helped introduce Mr. Summers to Silicon Valley, where he is gaining a good reputation, according to Mr. Andreessen, whose venture capital firm has hired Mr. Summers to give advice to companies like Airbnb and Dwolla, a payments company.
Mr. Summers serves on the board of two start-ups. The chief financial officer of one of the companies, Square, a mobile payments company, described Mr. Summers in a statement as ''a really important member of our team.''
The other start-up is Lending Club, which facilitates peer-to-peer loans. Prospective debtors post their personal stories online, asking for money for everything from debt consolidation to in-ground pools to wedding parties. Prospective lenders review the solicitations and offer financing.
''He's been very high-profile for the company,'' said Renaud Laplanche, the company's chief executive.
When Mr. Summers was considering joining the board, he performed due diligence, calling regulators and other board members, Mr. Laplanche said, adding that ''he thought what we were doing was good for the consumer.''
Lending Club falls into a tricky space in financial regulation. The company itself is not regulated as a bank. But it has teamed up with a bank in Utah, one of the states that allows banks to charge high interest rates, and that bank is overseen by state regulators and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
Consumer advocates said Lending Club was so new that they had not yet seen many examples of its loans and collection practices in action. But Sarah Ludwig, the co-director of the New Economy Project, a nonprofit in New York, expressed concern that the company did not verify all borrowers' income and employment.
''This should be another red flag,'' Ms. Ludwig said of Mr. Summers's involvement. ''What is he doing on the board of this company? What is a potential Fed chairman doing on the board of a company that doesn't check if people can afford loans?''
Of the loans Lending Club has made in 2013, it did not verify income about half of the time, according to data available on its Web site.
Mr. Laplanche said the company had models that dictated when it scrutinizes income and that the company was verifying income on more loans than it did in the past. He said that many other lenders also did not verify employment history and income. He added that Mr. Summers had pushed for strong consumer protection. ''He was the most adamant about making sure we were tracing the loan in such a way that we were making sure the people getting the loan had the ability to repay,'' he said.
And he said consumers would not be coming to Lending Club if they thought they could get better rates elsewhere.
But some consumer credit experts said Lending Club's rates on many loans might be higher than what was available at a credit union or other lenders. Of the loans Lending Club has issued in 2013, 12.9 percent of the loans are charging annual percentage rates of 12.4 percent or lower, but 37 percent of the loans are charging annual percentage rates of 19 percent or more, with some as high as 29 percent.
Mr. Summers has been encouraging Lending Club to spend time in Washington to share its story with regulators and policy makers, said John J. Mack, another company board member who was the chief executive of Morgan Stanley during the financial crisis. ''The facts are all over the place, but to me, for it to be growing at the rate it is growing, it is serving a need for small consumers,'' Mr. Mack said.
On top of all his other jobs, Mr. Summers has continued economic research. He is currently the co-chairman of a study at the Center for American Progress about stagnating wages for the middle class.
''I definitely don't think of him as a Wall Street guy,'' said Neera Tanden, the center's president. ''He runs in the crowd enough to know they're not always right.''
She added that since hearing about Mr. Summers's many paid assignments, she was happy with their arrangement. He works, she said, as a volunteer.

HEADLINE: Ready to Rejoin the Rat Race

BYLINE: By JUDITH WARNER

 BODY:
Sheilah O'Donnel tells herself that her new home, a townhouse in a development in Chevy Chase, Md., just a stone's throw from a Safeway, isn't really all that bad. Sure, it's near a gas station. And the front window, with its cheerily upholstered cushions, overlooks a dreary parking lot. And yes, it's kind of small -- ''an apartment,'' O'Donnel, who is 44, sometimes says bitterly, when she's reminded of her former life with her ex-husband in their custom-built, six-bedroom home. But then again, it's perfectly maintained and impeccably furnished, and most important, it's rented with her own money, from the first real job she has had in almost a decade.
It's a midlevel sales job, a big step down from the senior position she held before she had children and quit work. When she was first hired, in May 2011, her salary was just a fifth of what she earned at her peak. But, she said, she wasn't complaining. All around her, she saw women her age scrambling to find work, some divorcing and losing their homes. She liked to help them, editing their résumés, polishing cover letters, pumping up tearful friends who forgot what they were worth after years without a paycheck. 
After one emotional session with a friend, her 12-year-old daughter asked what all the fuss was about. O'Donnel told her: ''This is the perfect reason why you need to work. You don't have to make a million dollars. You don't have to have a wealthy lifestyle. You just always have to be able to at least earn enough so you can support yourself.''
Nine years ago, O'Donnel was promoting a very different message. She was a spokeswoman of sorts for a group of women -- highly educated, very accomplished, well-paid professionals with high-earning spouses -- who in the early 2000s made headlines for leaving the work force just when they were hitting their stride. They were a small demographic to be sure (another, larger, group who left the work force at that time -- poor mothers who couldn't afford child care -- went without notice), but they garnered a great deal of media attention.
This magazine, in a cover article by Lisa Belkin, called the phenomenon of their leaving work the ''Opt-Out Revolution,'' and other coverage followed: a Time magazine cover story on ''The Case for Staying Home'' and a ''60 Minutes'' segment devoted to a group of former mega-achievers who were, as the anchor Lesley Stahl put it, ''giving up money, success and big futures'' to be home with their children.
O'Donnel, featured in the ''60 Minutes'' story pushing a stroller, was, in some ways, an unlikely voice of the opt-out revolution. She had been proudly working since she was 15, when she had a job as a coat-check girl. By 17, she was buying clothes and books and food -- and sometimes even paying her family's electric bill -- through jobs that included waitressing and pedaling tourists around downtown Columbus, Ohio, on a pedi-taxi.
She worked her way through Ohio State and, eager to pay off her college loans, got a job selling copiers. She eventually landed in a competitive training program at Oracle, the technology company, where she rose quickly through the ranks, ending up in the top 5 percent of the sales force. She also met the man who would become her husband, Mark Eisel -- an up-and-comer in management. They worked hard and became well off. At her peak, O'Donnel was earning $500,000 a year.
But after her first two children were born, O'Donnel's travel for work became more difficult. She gave up a quarter of her earnings in exchange for working three days a week, but felt marginalized, her best accounts given to others, meetings often scheduled on her days out of the office. ''I felt like a second-class citizen,'' she said.
Even with the reduced schedule, the stresses of life in a two-career household put an overwhelming strain on her marriage. There were ugly fights with her husband about laundry and over who would step in when the nanny was out sick.
'' 'All this would be easier if you didn't work,' '' O'Donnel recalled her husband saying. ''I was so stressed,'' she told me. ''I said, 'This is ridiculous.' We'd made plenty of money. We'd saved plenty of money.'' She quit her job, trading in a life of business meetings, client dinners and commissions for homework help, a ''dream house'' renovation and a third pregnancy. ''I really thought it was what I had to do to save my marriage,'' she said.
But the tensions in her marriage didn't improve. The couple's long-term issues of anger, jealousy and control got worse as O'Donnel's dependency grew and a sense of personal dislocation set in. Without a salary or an independent work identity, her self-confidence plummeted.
''I felt like such a loser,'' she said. ''I poured myself into the kids and soccer. I didn't know how to deal with the downtime. I did all the volunteering, ran the auctions. It was my way of coping.''
Five years after leaving her Oracle job, O'Donnel began volunteering for Girls on the Run, a nonprofit group devoted to girls' emotional empowerment and physical well-being, and was eventually hired part time, at low pay. She loved the work. The organization's message, about respecting yourself and surrounding yourself with people who appreciate you, resonated with her. ''I started feeling very devalued when I was with him,'' O'Donnel said of her husband, ''but when I was doing all this nonprofit stuff, I felt great.''
O'Donnel and Eisel agree the job drove a destructive wedge between them. ''I look back on it as the beginning of the end of our marriage,'' Eisel said when we talked by phone last month. ''Once she started to work, she started to place more value in herself, and because she put more value in herself, she put herself in front of a lot of things -- family, and ultimately, her marriage.''
O'Donnel's family encouraged her to leave. But with three young children and no means of support, she couldn't see a way out. Eventually, after a particularly bad fight, she went to see a lawyer.
''He said, 'Before you do anything, you get a job,' '' she recalled. ''I said, 'Everyone I spoke with said you don't get a job because your spouse will have to pay less in alimony and child support.' He said, 'You have to look at the next 30 years of your life, and if you're in control of the situation, and you have a job that's paying you money, he's going to be far less powerful over you in the process.' ''
A few weeks later, O'Donnel separated from her husband. She soon ran into an old Oracle colleague in a doctor's waiting room. The woman was working at Monster.com, the employment Web site, and encouraged O'Donnel to get in touch. One former Oracle connection led to another. O'Donnel found that her reputation -- 11 years out -- was still intact, and she was quickly offered a job. But while she waited for her first paycheck, she found herself with no access to cash. She took a big chunk out of her old 401(k) and borrowed money from her sister. It was ''the scariest time in my entire life,'' she told me when we first spoke last summer.
What had been a nasty divorce was entering its end stages and the ''60 Minutes'' interview had come up. When O'Donnel saw the video again, the image of her younger self, giving up her job and proclaiming the benefits of staying at home haunted her. ''I was this woman who made this great 'choice,' '' she said, sadly. ''It wasn't the perfect fairy-tale ending.''
I reached out to O'Donnel -- and nearly two dozen other women -- because I was curious, after 10 years and many, many ''why women still can't have it all'' debates, to know what happened to the mothers who gave up promising careers in the late 1990s and early 2000s to be home with their children.
The economic landscape had changed greatly since these women -- buoyed by their prestigious jobs and degrees, supported by their high-earning husbands, secure in their abilities to shape a new life worthy of their past successes -- first decided to leave work and head home. In the years they were out of the work force, many of the professions they left contracted and changed; even once rock-solid fields like law were becoming insecure in ways that no one had previously thought possible.
The culture of motherhood, post-recession, had altered considerably, too. The women of the opt-out revolution left the work force at a time when the prevailing ideas about motherhood idealized full-time, round-the-clock, child-centered devotion. In 2000, for example, with the economy strong and books like ''Surrendering to Motherhood,'' a memoir about the ''liberation'' of giving up work to stay home, setting the tone for the aspirational mothering style of the day, almost 40 percent of respondents to the General Social Survey told researchers they believed a mother's working was harmful to her children (an increase of eight percentage points since 1994). But by 2010, with recovery from the ''mancession'' slow and a record 40 percent of mothers functioning as family breadwinners, fully 75 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that ''a working mother can establish just as warm and secure a relationship with her children as a mother who does not work.'' And after decades of well-publicized academic inquiry into the effects of maternal separation and the dangers of day care, a new generation of social scientists was publishing research on the negative effects of excessive mothering: more depression and worse general health among mothers, according to the American Psychological Association.
I wondered if these changes affected the women who opted out years ago. Had they found the ''escape hatch'' from the rat race that one of Belkin's interviewees said she was after? Were they able, as a vast majority said they had planned, to transition back into the work force? Or had they, as the author Leslie Bennetts predicted in her 2007 book, ''The Feminine Mistake,'' come to see that, by making themselves financially dependent upon their men -- particularly at a time when no man could depend upon his job -- they had made a colossal error?
The 22 women I interviewed, for the most part, told me that the perils of leaving the work force were counterbalanced by the pleasures of being able to experience motherhood on their own terms. A certain number of these women -- the superelite, you might say, the most well-off, with the highest-value name-brand educational credentials and powerful and well-connected social networks -- found jobs easily after extended periods at home. These jobs generally paid less than their previous careers and were less prestigious. But the women found the work more interesting, socially conscious and family-friendly than their old high-powered positions.
Pamela Stone, a professor of sociology at Hunter College and the author of the 2007 book ''Opting Out? Why Women Really Quit Careers and Head Home,'' heard many similarly glowing stories. In the early 2000s, she spent considerable time interviewing 54 well-off married mothers drawn primarily from the alumnae networks of several highly selective colleges and universities ''who had navigated elite environments with competitive entry requirements,'' as she described them in her book. Now she's updating her research and has reached about 60 percent of her interviewees, two-thirds of whom have returned to work -- their decisions sometimes prompted by their husbands' somewhat reduced earnings, post-recession. ''What I heard repeatedly was 'The job found me' or 'The job fell into my lap,' '' she told me.
Among the women I spoke with, those who didn't have the highest academic credentials or highest-powered social networks or who hadn't been sufficiently ''strategic'' in their volunteering (fund-raising for a Manhattan private school could be a nice segue back into banking; running bake sales for the suburban swim team tended not to be a career-enhancer) or who had divorced, often struggled greatly.
When Lisa Belkin attempted to reach out this spring to the women she interviewed in 2003, she found a similar mixed picture. Many of the women declined to talk about their lives; a few would talk only if they were not identified. Among those willing to speak with her, she found one out-and-out success story -- a woman who volunteered at high levels during her years at home and maintained her social network; she was now assistant dean for student affairs at the Emory University law school. There was one woman who didn't need a high salary, which helped her as she re-entered the post-recessionary work force; she found a part-time job in TV -- the field that she left more than a decade earlier, when she wasn't able to work out a flexible schedule. ''The world had changed in her favor; the part-time work they wouldn't give her is now what they were willing to give,'' Belkin told me. One woman was divorced and had scrambled to find her financial footing; two others were ''trying to find their way,'' Belkin said.
Sylvia Ann Hewlett, an economist and the founding president of the Center for Talent Innovation in New York, surveyed thousands of women in 2004 and after the financial crisis in 2009. She has found that roughly a third of ''highly qualified women'' leave their jobs to spend extended time at home. Though her subjects were all women with graduate degrees or bachelor's degrees with honors, they didn't necessarily have the elite credentials of the women in Stone's research and many reported having a difficult time transitioning into the work force.
Most of the women, Hewlett found, stayed home longer than they had hoped. Eighty-nine percent of those who ''off-ramped,'' as she puts it, said they wanted to resume work; but only 73 percent of these succeeded in getting back in, and only 40 percent got full-time jobs. ''It was distressingly difficult to get back on track,'' Hewlett told me. In addition, the women Hewlett surveyed came back to jobs that paid, on average, 16 percent less than those they had before. And about a quarter took jobs with lesser management responsibilities or had to accept a lower job title than the one they had when they left. The impact of those sacrifices, Hewlett noted, was in many cases amplified after the financial meltdown, when 28 percent more of the women she surveyed reported that they had a nonworking spouse at home.
But money was not the primary focus of the women I spoke with -- whether they needed more of it or not. Rather, what haunted many of them, as they reckoned with the past 10 years of their lives, was a more unquantifiable sense of personal change. They had been supremely self-confident when they took the ''plunge into full-time motherhood,'' as a former high-level corporate lawyer put it to me. (Like a few of the other women I talked to, she didn't want to be identified -- she was newly re-employed and didn't want attention brought to her years out of the work force.) Many even spoke of it as a unique post-feminist adventure -- ''Real women's empowerment is being able to do what you want to when you want to,'' Amy Cunningham Atkinson, a Yale graduate and former ''60 Minutes'' producer (and 2004 Lesley Stahl interviewee), told me. But now they were learning that some things were beyond even their prodigious powers of control.
I first met Carrie Chimerine Irvin in Washington in the early 2000s, when I was researching a book on the American culture of motherhood. A graduate of Brown University and the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard, Carrie, who is 47, worked for the better part of a decade doing educational-policy research. She liked the work, but it wasn't a real calling, and in 1998 she dropped out to take care of her two daughters.
Like most of the women I spoke with at the time, Carrie was totally absorbed by her children, tired, often frazzled and anxious about her worth as a mother. Yet, even among her cohort of devoted supermoms, she was a standout. She cooked healthful meals and concocted clever art projects, arranged play dates and drove to lessons, hosted creative birthday parties and planned inspired family vacations. She decorated her home for every holiday. She oversaw a large yet tastefully cozy house renovation. She did a turn in all the top parent leadership positions at her daughters' prestigious preschool. And she made sure no grandparent went a year without an updated album of family photos.
She made the decision to leave work almost without a backward glance. It was what she wanted. It was what her husband, Stuart, a lawyer, wanted. ''It didn't feel like a sacrifice,'' she told me last summer when we reconnected, after a gap of almost 10 years. ''I wasn't even sure what I wanted to be when I grew up. I knew I was a mom. In my family, even before we had kids, I was such a caretaker. I loved having a home. I really took care of Stuart. It felt like a natural extension of that.''
As the girls grew older, however, Carrie started to feel that the unstated bargain the couple had struck -- her husband earning the money, Carrie keeping their home -- was problematic. She had no issue doing full-time child care; that was a labor of love. But housekeeping? That was another matter. She resented that the couple's mutual mess was now seen as her concern.
''I had the sense of being in an unequal marriage,'' she told me. ''I think he preferred the house to be 'kept' in a different kind of way than I was prepared to do it. If I had any angst about being an overeducated stay-at-home mom, it was not about raising the kids, but it was about sweeping.''
She came to think that returning to work would not only be good for her, but also healthy for her marriage. She chose her words carefully as she related this turning point in her life: ''My husband was getting impatient,'' she said. ''I think he was worried I wasn't yearning for a career again. He'd come home at night, and I'd want to talk about what was going on at school and with the other parents, and I'd get frustrated he was not finding it more engrossing. I think he felt even more than I did that it would be good for me to have something professional, that I'd be more fulfilled as a whole person if I was pursuing some career goals.''
With middle school on the horizon for her daughters, Carrie started working the contacts she made as a self-described ''professional volunteer'' operating among Washington's most-powerful parents. Very quickly, the effort paid off. ''Friends who were former colleagues said, 'When you're ready, come.' So sight unseen, I got work. I didn't have to do a résumé -- nothing,'' she said. She was first offered part-time consulting; then, eager to move on, she reached out to a contact at the Gates Foundation whom she met when she was chairwoman at her daughters' preschool. The contact had become the founding board chairman of a charter school, and he invited Carrie to tour it. She and her husband, who had just joined the board of another charter, hit it off with another man they met on the tour. Conversations followed about the need for board members for Washington's charter schools with the skills and knowledge to make them successful. They came up with an idea: Why not create a nonprofit organization to recruit people to serve on the school boards and train them to be good board members so they could support the charter-school effort in the most productive, results-oriented way? Irvin began running the company part time during school hours from her sunny, renovated kitchen, splitting the work with another well-pedigreed stay-at-home mother.
The seed money came in. Carrie's network of connections continued to build. And in two years she and her partner, Simmons Lettre, raised $1.2 million, hired staff members and rented office space for their new nonprofit company, Charter Board Partners.
I visited Carrie there last summer, one evening when a work dinner kept her in the city unusually late in the day. White boards were marked with colorful, enthusiastic-looking flourishes, and the young, ethnically diverse, heavily female, earnest and friendly staff members were heading home for the night. Irvin, in a crisp summer dress, her light brown hair falling neatly at her shoulders, showed me around. She was excited, revitalized, virtually glowing, like a person in love. ''I'm so energized by our success,'' she told me. ''I feel like I'm fulfilling the professional potential that I never did before. I feel smart. I feel successful. I feel like I escaped a whole slog level of my career. I got to stay home with my kids and yet I got to come back to a leadership position. And I'm earning a living.''
She was doing it all without dropping any of her maternal duties -- not school pickup, not homework, not dinner, not party planning, not even those photo books for the grandparents. She had a housekeeper now for the heavy cleaning. But she still pushed herself to provide the special little touches at home, like making sure her kitchen counter always had a bowl of ''seasonably appropriate'' candy -- even if that candy, to her great annoyance, was now perpetually buried under a pile of unsorted junk.
She acknowledged that what she was trying to do was impossible. ''The pace at which I'm living right now is unsustainable,'' she told me. She tried her absolute best to cut things that weren't strictly essential. She almost never saw friends, rarely exercised and was trying to trick her body into running faster on fewer hours of sleep. Something had to give -- and, unfortunately, that something was shaping up to be time with her husband.
When I visited her one morning this winter after her children and husband had left for the day, she told me that in their early years, she and Stuart traveled to Japan, shared books, interests and ideas. Even after their daughters came along, they had been sure to find ways to spend time together as a couple. They watched TV for a precious hour or so of decompression each night, after the girls went to bed. They talked together late, digesting their days. By this winter, however, they spent their evenings on separate floors, she downstairs in the kitchen, on her computer, catching up on the work she missed during her hours of caring for the children; he, upstairs, watching TV alone.
Carrie said the situation was in many ways unfair: she had been able, twice, to live her dreams, with her husband's encouragement, first as an at-home mother, then as a start-up visionary, while Stuart's steady job made it all possible. And he had to adjust to the loss of her attention when she first shifted it to their daughters and then to her new job.
Their situation was common enough among middle-aged, overtaxed, professional working parents. Stuart was hardly the first man to find himself sidelined either by his wife's devotion to her children or her dedication to work or both. But knowing that their story was playing out in households all around them didn't make their readjustment to life as a working couple any easier. ''I think a big issue is that we both want to be taken care of at the end of the day, and neither of us has any energy to take care of the other,'' Carrie said. ''It's the proverbial 'meet me at the door with a martini and slippers.' Don't we all want that? A clean house and someone at the door? I think when I wasn't working I had some guilt that that wasn't me, but now I want to be that other person. . . . When you're absolutely exhausted, it's hard to be emotionally generous.''
At a time when having a ''good'' job means working 50-plus hours a week, in addition to weekends and tech-tethered evenings, it's not surprising that, if both spouses work, it can often feel as if neither is ever truly home. And that desire to be emotionally present at home, Pamela Stone, the sociologist, told me, became more pressing over time for the women she interviewed, reshaping their ambitions when they decided to go back to work.
While two-thirds of the women she reinterviewed originally worked in male-dominated professions like banking or corporate law, now only a quarter are employed in traditionally masculine and hard-driving fields. The rest chose more female-dominated, and far less lucrative, ''caring, nurturing occupations'' like teaching or nonprofit work, Stone said. Only one of the women she interviewed had returned to her former employer (in a ''vastly different capacity, much diminished,'' she said); and all have scaled down their ambitions.
''The longer they're home, the more they continue the trajectory toward something different,'' Stone told me. ''They have greater appreciation of some of the values of home and connectivity, which were somewhat alien to them in their high-flying professions.''
The women's husbands, Stone said, were often changed by their wives' years at home, too. In her first round of research, in the early 2000s, she said, the women she interviewed reported that their husbands were studiedly neutral on whether they stayed in the work force or came home. ''Almost to a woman, they said, 'My husband said, ''Whatever you want to do,'' ' '' she told me.
Ten years later, in her second round of research, things were different. While 23 percent of Hewlett's women, post-recession, said their husbands were worried financially, and 30 percent said their husbands were ''envious or angry'' about their decision not to work, many of Stone's high-earning husbands came, over time, to want their wives to stay home. ''This round, I'm hearing more, 'My husband really prefers that I be home,' '' Stone said of her recent talks with those women. ''They say, 'It's a big surprise: we've really gone to a very traditional household now.' ''
Many of the women I spoke with were troubled by the gender-role traditionalism that crept into their marriages once they gave up work, transforming them from being their husbands' intellectual equals into the one member of their partnership uniquely endowed with gifts for laundry or cooking and cleaning; a junior member of the household, who sometimes had to ''negotiate'' with her husband to get money for child care.
The husbands hadn't turned into ogres. Their intent was not to make their wives feel lesser. But when traditional gender arrangements were put into place, there was a subtle slide into inequality. ''The dynamic changes,'' said Hope Adler, a former manager at the professional-services firm KPMG who spent 10 years at home full time with her four children before starting work again and choosing to take a much-lower-paying job at a smaller consulting firm that allowed her to work some of the time from home. ''When I worked at KPMG we did 50/50,'' she said. ''We were making equal money. Then once I started staying home, I was doing laundry, dinner. . . .'' But once she started working again, the expectations remained the same. ''There just doesn't seem to be a way to go back,'' she said.
Kuae Kelch Mattox and her husband, Ted -- she a former producer for NBC News, he a multimedia consultant -- met 27 years ago when they were in their early 20s. She was home from Howard University for the summer in Philadelphia; he was working with some former Temple University football teammates as a bouncer at a private club. They were equally educated and equally ambitious.
Before they were married, they made a neatly egalitarian deal: whenever one of them got a really good job, the other one would move to follow. Ted followed Kuae, first to Miami, where she worked as a reporter for The Miami Herald. Then to Chicago, when she landed a spot in a producer-training program on ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.'' Then he got a job with Sony outside New York City, and she followed him there, went to the Columbia University School of Journalism and eventually landed at NBC.
They shared the laundry, the cooking, the cleaning and, eventually, the care of their children. But as Ted climbed the business side in television and Kuae stayed in editorial, their professional fortunes diverged. His salary took off as he surfed the wave of the online revolution, while hers stagnated in old-fashioned TV. His opportunities expanded, and hers shrank.
It wasn't hard for Kuae, who is 47, to leave her job and stay home after the Mattoxes' second child was born. Her mother died when their first child was just 9 months old -- a loss that made Kuae feel the daily separation from her daughter all the more acutely. She came to resent the packed suitcase she kept in her office so she could jump on a plane on a moment's notice if a big story broke. The lure of travel wasn't exciting anymore; it just seemed like lost time.
Kuae's mother -- like all the black mothers Kuae knew as a child -- had worked. She was a high-school drama teacher and speech therapist and was home late afternoons and had vacations off with her children. But after her death, Kuae learned from her father that her mother had always wished she could have spent more time with her children. She didn't want to die with similar regrets. It was 2000, Ted, now 49, was heading up multimedia publishing and new-business development for Consumer Reports and earning a very good living. When they moved from the city to the suburbs, they took care to buy a house that they could pay for, if needed, on just one salary. She had the privilege -- and she knew it was a privilege -- to jump.
Friends and family were surprised: as an upper-middle-class African-American woman, didn't she have an obligation to climb the career ladder? She countered that being able to stay home was another stage in the evolution of the American dream in which each generation does better than its predecessor. Didn't she have a responsibility to her children to be as devoted to the emotional work of keeping a family thriving as the well-off white mothers in town?
''I was very conscious as an African-American mother that my children didn't fall into this achievement gap,'' she told me. ''I wanted to physically be there for them and be a really strong advocate for them.''
She became involved in Mocha Moms, a national nonprofit support group for stay-at-home mothers of color, and eventually became its president, a volunteer position. Over all, she says, her 13 years at home have been the most rich, meaningful and ''transformative'' period in her adulthood. But without question, she has paid a price along the way, in lost income most glaringly. The nonearning ''season'' in her life, as Mocha Mom members like to put it, was supposed to last just a few years. Getting back into journalism after more than a decade proved much harder than Kuae ever imagined; she started putting out feelers for work not long after exiting and had spent two years looking in earnest, without luck, when we first started talking last summer.
When I met with Kuae and Ted in their home just after Christmas, she had recently finished a short-term seasonal stint in the men's department at Macy's. Ted's consulting business was down almost 25 percent in the wake of the recession, and the Macy's job had helped buy Christmas presents.
''I lose sleep and have great anxiety over the thought that we have three kids who are three years apart in age and we'll be paying for 12 years of college,'' she said over bagels and cream cheese in the Mattox's sunny wood-paneled dining room. ''Every time my daughter says, 'I'll be out of here in two years,' is every time I go to bed at night and say: 'Oh, my God. Can we sustain what we need for her and for the other one and for the other one and us and everything else?' ''
The children needed braces, sports equipment, summer camps. The car needed work, and the house -- a solid four-square fixer-upper in various stages of fixed-uppedness -- needed repairs.
And Ted had kind of had it. Here he was, he said while coming and going from the kitchen where he was making French toast for the Mattox's youngest child, earning the household income, helping drive the kids around, pitching in on laundry, housekeeping and cooking, while Kuae, in his eyes, was blithely giving her time away -- free -- to a volunteer organization. He's a numbers guy, he said. From his perspective, the numbers pertaining to what he called her at-home ''journey of self-discovery'' just didn't add up to be a very good deal for him or any husband whose nonearning wife still expects to split household drudgery 50-50.
Ted's expectations were formed by his own mother, a stay-at-home mom in an age in which the identity had no such title, whose ''whole goal her entire life,'' he said, ''was to make sure her boys had a clean house, clean clothes and were well fed.'' Given this, it seemed natural to him that Kuae, as a self-proclaimed stay-at-home mother, might want to try putting some more time into their home. Into things like ''the shuttling of kids, the picking up the house, the laundry, the shopping.'' Even, he ventured further, ''balancing checkbooks, cleaning, setting up the home Wi-Fi, fixing an appliance or whatever.'' A hoot of laughter from Kuae greeted the end of this task list.
He continued: ''Being the kind of person I am, Type A, wound, always going after something, I wonder what I could have done, having 12 years to sort of think about what I want to do. I sometimes think, Wow, I could have been an astronaut in 12 years, or I could have been something different that I'd really enjoy and that I never was afforded the financial opportunity or the time or the resources to enjoy. Maybe call it jealousy. Maybe envy. What could I have been in 12 years of self-discovery? I'll go out on a limb and say: 'I'd like to try it. It looks pretty good to me.' ''
Kuae spoke carefully: ''I don't think Ted views me as a stay-at-home mom as he did before as a working mom -- I think he has struggled with assigning value.'' Her soft, open face was set like a stone.
''When a mother works, something is lost,'' the author Caitlin Flanagan once wrote. But when a mother leaves the work force, a great deal is clearly lost, too. Beyond the personal losses -- the changes in the dynamic of a marriage or the cumulative financial effects of many years of not working -- there is the collective impact to consider. It's hard not to be discouraged by the numbers. Over the last 10 years, the decades-long advancement of women to higher positions in business and politics seems to have stalled. According to the nonprofit research group Catalyst, women now account for just 4 percent of Fortune 500 chief executives, 17 percent of corporate board seats, 20 percent of law partners and 19 percent of Congress (thanks to a big bump in the 2012 elections). A younger generation of female high achievers, especially those who aren't most highly privileged, aren't getting a very hopeful message. And without women in powerful positions pushing for change, employers have less incentive to alter workplace practices that may encourage women to exit after they have children. ''Once they leave the corporate workplace, their ability to imbue workplace culture with their values is gone,'' Pamela Stone says of the women she has studied. ''They leave, and the door closes behind them, and everything stays the same.''
But most people don't make life decisions based on statistics or the collective good. And not a single woman I spoke with said she wished that she could return to her old, pre-opting-out job -- no matter what price she paid for her decision to stop working. What I heard instead were some regrets for what, in an ideal world, might have been -- more time with their children combined with some sort of intellectually stimulating, respectably paying, advancement-permitting part-time work -- but none for the high-powered professional lives that these women had led.
Men, too, are feeling the crunch of excessively demanding work. They now report more work-life stress than women do, according to the Families and Work Institute. They also may be penalized more than women if they try to accommodate their work schedules to the needs of their children, as research appearing in the June issue of The Journal of Social Issues shows. It's perhaps not surprising, then, that some husbands find themselves eyeing their wives' lives at home with envy. ''Men want to say we're more than a paycheck,'' Ted Mattox told me. ''There has to be something more than going to work for 50 years and dying.''
To find time for that ''something more,'' husbands would need to join with their wives in rejecting nighttime networking sessions and 7 a.m. meetings. They would have to convey to employers that work-life accommodations like flexible hours or job sharing aren't just for women and that part-time jobs need to provide proportional pay and benefits. At a time when fewer families than ever can afford to live on less than two full-time salaries, achieving work-life balance may well be less a gender issue than an economic one.
In June, after 13 years, Kuae finally found a job. She was hired as a booking producer for a daily women's news show on Arise TV, a global network started by a Nigerian newspaper publisher that specializes in covering stories about people of color. Arise didn't have the prestige of NBC. And the pay was probably about half what Kuae, who would be doing her job from home, would have been earning had she stayed on her former, high-profile, pre-motherhood track. As a freelancer, paid a day rate, she didn't have benefits. And there were no formal guarantees as to the number of days she would work each year. Nonetheless, she was ecstatic. ''I feel like I'm in my element,'' she said. ''I'm doing all the stories that I always wanted to see on TV and never did.''
But last month, Kuae's show was put on ''indefinite hiatus.'' The businessman financing the network was going through a cash crunch and ''deep cuts'' were announced. Kuae e-mailed me to say that after just six weeks, she found herself out of a job. She was, she said, ''back to Square 1.''

HEADLINE: 'Adverse Selection' and Obamacare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
In his Economic View column, ''For Obamacare to Work, Everyone Must Be In'' (Aug. 4), Robert H. Frank described the ''adverse selection'' quandary -- the idea that buying health insurance is more attractive financially for those who are ill, thus causing more healthy people to drop out and resulting in ever-higher rates. 
In the column, Professor Frank said that ''we must ask those who would repeal Obamacare how they propose to solve the adverse selection problem.''
But some Obamacare opponents want to replace adverse selection with ''no selection'' -- by leaving uninsured Americans uninsured. Or maybe they would replace it with ''reverse selection,'' taking people off Medicaid and other subsidized insurance.
Obamacare opponents ignore the financial costs of leaving things the way they were. Then they complain that we are spending too much.
BETTY MOCK
Bala Cynwyd, Pa., Aug. 4
To the Editor:
Imagine a lottery in which prospective ticket buyers have different expected returns if they win. The smaller the prize looks, the less likely that people will buy in. That's how some healthy Americans regard health insurance, and thus they decline it.
Robert Frank describes such a system -- in which the relatively healthy opt out, thus causing rates to climb progressively for everyone else -- as a ''market failure.'' But such a ''failure'' will occur in any market when the government requires products that have different values, and cost different amounts to make, to be sold at the same price.
The amount that the healthy participant pays in excess of his expected return is, in essence, a wealth transfer. As a practical matter, to induce participation under Obamacare, the opt-out penalty cannot be small -- it must be comparable to this amount. As rhetoric, describing people's unwillingness to subsidize others voluntarily as a ''market failure'' is misleading.
RALPH LINSKER, M.D., Ph.D.
Millwood, N.Y., Aug. 5
To the Editor:
Remember how some Republican opponents of Obamacare tossed around the term ''death panels''? Well, a real-world definition is an American health care system that long denied health insurance because of pre-existing conditions.
Every year, brave American soldiers and first responders die to protect innocent civilians. Our government also pays for public safety as a fundamental responsibility. So why would some people now consider it government overreach to save the lives of the many Americans who die every year for lack of health insurance?
In his column, Robert Frank clearly explained why everyone, via the individual mandate of Obamacare, should pay an affordable amount to prevent adverse selection and finally enable a fully accessible private health insurance market. Republicans should focus on improving the cost-effectiveness of the American health care system rather than continuing the old ways.

HEADLINE: Tax-Free Accounts for Homes

BYLINE: By LISA PREVOST

 BODY:
Tax-free savings accounts help Americans stow away money for health care and college tuition. Why not a tax-exempt account for yet another major expense: the down payment on a mortgage?
A coalition that includes real estate developers and investors has been floating the idea as part of a package of reforms intended to overhaul federally funded real estate programs. Home loan programs, direct grants and tax credits add up to some $450 billion a year in federal spending that the group says mostly benefits a small proportion of households.
''These programs have an enormous impact across the country,'' said Ilana Preuss, the vice president and chief of staff for Smart Growth America of Washington, the group leading the coalition. ''Communities have long benefited from these programs, but they could be doing a lot more.'' 
In addition to proposals to halve the $1 million cap on the mortgage interest tax deduction and beef up support for affordable rental housing, the group suggests that Congress authorize individual mortgage savings accounts to make it easier for would-be buyers to save for a down payment. The program would be limited to first-time buyers who could make pretax contributions to such an account for up to 10 years. Funds put toward the purchase of a home would not be taxed.
''It would encourage individuals to start saving earlier for down payment and closing costs,'' Ms. Preuss said, ''and it would really make their dollar go further.''
The idea is modeled on a home-buyer savings-account program that has been in place in Montana since 1998. Open to any first-time buyer, regardless of income, the program allows people to deduct deposits of up to $3,000 a year from their state taxable income (not their federal income); married couples may deduct up to $6,000 a year. Interest earnings are not taxed.
At least in Montana, however, the incentive has not done much to step up the savings rate. According to the state's revenue department, no more than 225 people, and as few as 125, have participated annually since the program's inception. Their annual deposits have averaged around $400,000.
In 2011, the program cost the state just $24,000 in lost revenue.
''What you've got to understand is, this is people trying to get into their first home,'' said Edmund Caplis, the department's director of tax policy and research. ''For most working families, trying to pull together an extra buck is a stretch.''
Other factors limiting participation of late have been low interest rates on savings accounts and a lack of publicity about the program, said Maureen Rude, the statewide director of operations for NeighborWorks Montana, a nonprofit housing organization.
What tends to resonate more with first-time buyers trying to scrape together a down payment are programs that offer matching funds for dollars saved, Ms. Rude said. Still, she added, ''the more tools that are out there to help people save money, the better, in my opinion.''
The Federal Home Loan Bank of New York operates its own variation on a mortgage savings account program for New York and New Jersey residents. Restricted to first-time buyers earning no more than 80 percent of area median income, the so-called First Home Club provides $4 in matching funds for every $1 saved, up to a maximum grant of $7,500.
In order to qualify for a match, participants must make deposits for at least 10 months and attend financial counseling.
Established in 1995, the First Home Club is administered by more than 70 area lenders, and is regularly fully subscribed, according to Eric Amig, a spokesman for the Federal Home Loan. So far, it has assisted more than 6,800 households.

HEADLINE: High Culture Goes Hands-On

BYLINE: By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI. 
A freelance writer and a former reporter and editor at The New York Times.

 BODY:
THE quest for an experience has taken over giant portions of our lives. Everywhere, we are assaulted by endless opportunities and activities. We text and get texts wherever we are, even behind the wheel. We constantly post what we're doing and where we are, letting friends know how active we are. We take part in ever more extreme sports. We work not on our own, but in teams and in social spaces, bullpens for offices, coffee shops for self-employed free agents. And when we go on vacation, we spend our time shopping, eating and seeking adventure. Even in Europe's old cities of culture, some people might stop in at the Louvre or the Uffizi, but often just to snap a few pictures on their cellphones to prove they were there. 
Trying to keep pace, cultural institutions are changing, too, offering more of the kinds of participatory experiences available almost everywhere else. Playwrights now turn theatergoers into participants or let them choose the ending. Botanical gardens are adding skywalks that let visitors traipse through treetops. Museums stage sleepovers in the galleries and dance parties in huge atriums that were built to be gathering spaces. The landmark Beaux-Arts headquarters of the New York Public Library, on Fifth Avenue in Midtown Manhattan, a sedate research institution, may soon be transformed with the addition of a gigantic branch library, where the main draws will be meeting places and areas for teenagers and children. A ground-floor cafe has already moved in. Who needs Starbucks?
Some of these initiatives are necessary, even good. But in the process of adapting, our cultural treasuries are multitasking too much, becoming more alike, and shedding the very characteristics that made them so special -- especially art museums.
One day last fall, while visiting the Cleveland Museum of Art, I entered a small glass-walled corner gallery to view the British artist Martin Creed's ''Work No. 965: Half the Air in a Given Space.'' Suddenly immersed in a sea of purple balloons that filled the air far above my head, I could see nothing but grape-colored latex and the occasional glimpse of an arm or head belonging to another visitor. I pushed through, the balloons bobbling above me, and eventually made my way back to the exit, with static in my hair and clothes clinging to my body.
Mr. Creed's playful work -- his attempt to make the invisible (air) visible -- has been described as an ''epic sculpture/installation/happening,'' but really, it's an experience. You couldn't ''see'' it without participating in it.
''Work No. 965'' occupied only a small corner of the museum, one previously occupied by Rodin sculptures, but it represented a clash of values that's pulling art museums away from their past. The Cleveland Museum's chief curator, C. Griffith Mann (who was recently hired by the Metropolitan Museum of Art as curator in charge of the medieval art department and the Cloisters), signaled as much, perhaps unwittingly, when he announced that Mr. Creed's artwork would ''activate'' the museum's east wing. In ages past, art museums didn't need activating. They were treasure houses, filled with masterpieces meant to outlast the moment of their making, to speak to the universal. Visiting one might be social -- you went with friends -- but fairly passive. People went to see beauty, find inspiration, experience uplift, sometimes in a spiritual sort of way. Museums housed their heritage, their raison d'être.
But the spirit of ''Work No. 965'' is everywhere, common among curators, museum directors and, of course, artists. You could see it in ''Rain Room,'' the popular summer installation organized by MoMA PS1 that was billed as giving ''visitors the experience of controlling the rain.'' You could see it when the Metropolitan Museum's summer rooftop installations like ''Big Bambú'' by the Starn Twins (2010) and Tomás Saraceno's mirrored, modular habitat ''Cloud City'' (2012) -- both walk-through experiences -- become the talk of the town, while Anthony Caro's steel sculptures (2011) and this year's landscapes by Imran Qureshi did not.
At the New Museum of Contemporary Art, Carsten Höller's appropriately named ''Experience,'' which gave visitors the opportunity to slide down a corkscrew path from the fourth floor to the second and was described, according to The New York Times, ''as an art world amusement park,'' drew lines around the block in 2011. Need I mention Marina Abramovic's ''The Artist Is Present'' at the Museum of Modern Art in 2010, a participatory performance piece that had New Yorkers queuing up for hours to sit in silence opposite the artist, who simply stared in return? What was that about but the experience?
IN the world of commerce, this trend has been going on for decades. By 1998, two consultants, B. Joseph Pine II and James H. Gilmore, had coined the term ''the experience economy'' and were urging businesses to offer customers a memorable time, rather than a product or service. On that theory rest businesses like Chuck E. Cheese's, Build-A-Bear Workshops, Niketown, hotels as tourist destinations and virtually all of Las Vegas. (The Las Vegas Art Museum closed in February 2009 after nearly 60 years of operation, a victim of poor attendance and declining donations).
In this kind of world, the thrill of standing before art -- except perhaps for works by boldface-name artists like van Gogh, Vermeer, Monet and Picasso (and leaving aside contemporary artists who draw attention by being outrageously controversial) -- seems not quite exciting enough for most people. What's a museum to do?
Glenn D. Lowry, the director of the Museum of Modern Art, has seen the future. In a speech he gave a while back in Australia, he noted that museums had to make a ''shift away from passive experiences to interactive or participatory experiences, from art that is hanging on the wall to art that invites people to become part of it.'' And, he said, art museums had to shed the idea of being a repository and become social spaces.
He qualified those thoughts a bit, saying he was speaking mainly of museums that dealt primarily with contemporary art. But I'm not sure of the thesis or the qualification -- or the application. I've seen museums offer people the opportunity to participate in curating exhibitions, choosing which artworks from their collections should be sold to raise money, deciding whether an altered painting should be restored to its original condition, advising on the design of gallery installations and more. Shouldn't those decisions be left to the experts? If not, what do they do? Why study art history?
In another manifestation of the trend, museums are embedding interactive displays in their painting galleries. They are gamifying them. Some are retooling their lecture programs -- which attract older audiences. As Alexander Bortolot, an art historian and the ''curatorial content strategist'' at the Minneapolis Institute of Arts, told me last year, younger people want museums to connect them to the creative economy. They don't want to listen to some art historian flown in from New York; they'd rather network with members of the local arts community and take part in a conversation.
This is all in the name of participation and experience -- also called visitor engagement -- but it changes the very nature of museums, and the expectations of visitors. It changes who will go to museums and for what.
For decades, museums have offered social experiences -- the fact that you can talk while you're in the galleries has always given them an edge over the performing arts -- and that is good. Now is the balance shifting too far to the experience? Are they losing what makes them unique? Should museums really follow the path of those ''experience'' businesses?
If they do, something will be lost. After the terrorist attack at the Boston Marathon in April, Thomas P. Campbell, the Metropolitan Museum's director, reached out to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston with the offer to lend three paintings, all dealing obliquely with contemplation, for a special free exhibition there. At the time, he said, ''Great museums are places of solace and inspiration, particularly when tragedy strikes a community.'' When so many people go instead for an experience, that aspect of art museums -- a key part of their identity -- is at risk.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 18, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
The cover opinion essay last Sunday incorrectly described the state of the visual arts in Las Vegas. While the Las Vegas Art Museum closed in 2009, its collection is on long-term loan to the Marjorie Barrick Museum at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, where selected works are displayed on a rotating basis. (The art museum's board hopes to reopen the institution when the economy improves.) It is not the case that Las Vegas ''no longer has an art museum.'' In addition, the essay referred imprecisely to ''Rain Room,'' a recent installation. While it was part of an exhibition organized by MoMA PS1, it was in a lot adjacent to the Museum of Modern Art, in Manhattan -- not at PS1, the museum's exhibition space for contemporary art, in Queens.

HEADLINE: Sightseers On a Mission

BYLINE: By MAX CHAFKIN

 BODY:
If there was one thing troubling Scott Harrison as he stood up to address a group of nearly 50, including more than a dozen Silicon Valley wunderkinds, it was the matter of the private jet.
Actually, ''private jet'' was, when he thought about it, a bit of an exaggeration. Harrison was no Greg Mortenson, the disgraced education advocate whose use of donations for chartered jets (among other things) led to an investigation by the Montana attorney general as Mortenson's schools in Afghanistan foundered. He wasn't even Bono, taking a little glamour into the bush -- not that there was anything wrong with that, in Harrison's opinion. But still, charity: water, the nonprofit he started, was supposed to be a rejoinder to conventional philanthropy -- the inefficiency, the celebrity culture, the Learjets. 
Harrison had rented the aging 737 to take the entrepreneurs from Dubai to a four-day event last spring he was calling F.ounders Ethiopia -- the name and funny punctuation a result of a partnership with F.ounders, a Dublin-based technology conference -- and he was worried that some people might take it the wrong way. Several days earlier, he asked me, if I mentioned the plane, to include its price, $82,000, a figure he decided was ''not scary.'' (The guests would each pay their share of the trip, $5,000, from which roughly $1,700 would go to the rental of the plane.) ''What I don't want is a bunch of guys flying in on a private jet to pet the poor for a couple of days,'' he said. ''I don't want the perception that these tech darlings aren't like the rest of us.''
I was to join this crew of just-like-us tech guys as they headed with Harrison to Tigray, the mountainous region in Ethiopia's far north, where much of the rural population still lacks basic services like paved roads, electricity, toilets and, crucially for Harrison, access to clean drinking water. It's not uncommon for a woman there to walk an hour or more to fetch water, drawing it unfiltered from a murky, open well, and then to turn around and haul the sloshing 40-pound jug back home. Not surprisingly, waterborne illnesses are among the leading causes of death in children younger than 5; the infant mortality rate in Tigray is 6.4 percent.
Since its founding, Harrison's charity has worked in 20 countries, but it has spent more money drilling wells and setting up hand pumps in Tigray than anywhere else -- projected to be some $27 million by the end of this year. By trying to ensure that the region's entire rural population, some four million people, has access to clean water, Harrison hopes to be able to offer proof (a word he loves) that the global water crisis is solvable. So far, charity: water claims to have provided clean water to a million people in the area. Tigray also happens to be relatively safe and heartachingly beautiful -- making it a suitable destination for a group of young millionaires. ''It's where I take people to kind of start,'' Harrison told me in his New York office in April. ''It's Abyssinia. The priests are wrapped in shrouds. It's sick'' -- by which he meant very cool.
Harrison, who is 37, has a tendency, honed while working in his 20s as a Manhattan nightclub promoter, of taking over any room in which he happens to find himself. Supremely effective as a public speaker, he can be overwhelming in more casual settings. When we met in his office not long ago, he fidgeted excitedly, anticipating and then interrupting me even before I began speaking -- all the while furiously scribbling notes directly onto the surface of his table using a dry-erase marker. When I got home from that interview and checked my e-mail, I found an 87-page paper about the economic benefits of water projects, a 17-page PowerPoint presentation about charity: water's values and an invitation to attend a service with him and his wife, Viktoria, at Hillsong, a rock-music-playing megachurch that fills Irving Plaza or the Gramercy Theater in Manhattan six times each Sunday. ''Scott the nightclub promoter no longer exists, but there are parts of that personality that need to be fed,'' says Ross Garber, a former technology executive who is Harrison's business coach. ''He loves promoting, loves going hard, loves being loved.'' Viktoria Harrison, who was charity: water's designer before she and Scott became romantically involved, told me that the first time he asked her out, he looked at her so intensely that she was sure she was about to be fired.
At Ottomans, a posh Turkish restaurant in Dubai where the tech group gathered for a welcome dinner, Harrison was in full promoter mode. He began by recounting the genesis of the trip: he was having a beer at F.ounders with Michael Birch, the creator of the social network Bebo. ''Michael and I were closing out the bar, and he leaned over and said, 'We should bring everyone here to Ethiopia,' '' Harrison told us. ''There were 120 people,'' he said, pausing for effect. ''There are 40 of us here. So we're doing pretty good.'' He concluded his remarks with a word about the ''sensitivity'' of the private plane. ''It only costs $1,700 per person, and it saves two flights and two days of travel,'' he said. ''And you'll be flying coach, which gives me some pleasure.''
The crowd at the restaurant, who were staying at Dubai's palatial Grosvenor House hotel, chuckled at the mild schadenfreude. As I looked around, I saw Daniel Ek, the founder of the popular online music-streaming service Spotify, and Matt Mullenweg of WordPress.com, a blogging platform whose parent company is reportedly worth $1 billion. There were founders of lesser-known start-ups with strange names and huge bankrolls: Huddle ($38 million raised to date) and Wonga ($145 million). There were Facebook millionaires and Twitter millionaires, celebrity investors and investor-celebrities. I spotted Tim Ferriss, the author of ''The 4-Hour Workweek,'' and Troy Carter, who, through his company Atom Factory, serves as Lady Gaga's manager and is an investor in some 45 early-stage tech companies. In addition to the techies, there were three actresses (Maggie Grace, Jessica Stroup, Sophia Bush), one fashion model (Gelila Bekele), one pro skateboarder (Tony Hawk) and one filmmaker (Jon M. Chu, who directed ''Justin Bieber: Never Say Never''). ''It's like sleep-away camp for geeks,'' Carter said, summing up the vibe.
Writing in this magazine seven years ago, the Princeton ethicist Peter Singer argued that affluent Americans have a duty to donate a substantial portion of their wealth to the developing world. Taking inspiration from the multibillion-dollar stock grants made by Bill Gates and Warren Buffett to the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Singer proposed a sliding scale that called for the wealthiest families to give away a third of their annual income. Anyone in the top 10 percent, he recommended, should at least tithe. ''In the real world,'' Singer wrote, ''it should be seen as a serious moral failure when those with ample income do not do their fair share toward relieving global poverty.''
As ethics, the argument is difficult to assail, but as a sales pitch it's a little flat. Rates of charitable giving have fallen since 2005. Last year, Americans gave 2 percent of their income to charity, slightly less than they gave in 1971, according to an annual survey conducted by Giving USA. And it's here that Harrison -- and his many acolytes in Silicon Valley -- think they can change things. ''Charity: water is a very different kind of nonprofit, and it has everything to do with Scott,'' says Andy Smith, a marketing consultant and co-author (with his wife, Jennifer Aaker, a Stanford professor) of ''The Dragonfly Effect,'' a book that focuses on nonprofits. The world of charitable giving, Smith says, has traditionally attracted people with an aversion to business. ''Now you're having people with more of a business mind coming into the sector,'' he says. ''These are people who are good at persuasion, at making something cool.''
When Harrison founded charity: water in New York City in 2006, he initially intended to counter the cynicism of his club buddies. ''I wanted to create a model that would put all the excuses aside,'' Harrison says -- a charity, in other words, for people who didn't trust charities. To pre-empt objections to high overhead and waste, Harrison set up two bank accounts: one, raised chiefly from a handful of wealthy individuals, to pay for administration and fund-raising; and the other to finance the digging of wells and other water-related projects in the developing world. Today the organization's heavily promoted ''100% Model'' allows it to claim that every dollar donated to water is actually used that way. (Some consider this more a matter of marketing than anything else, but even so, charity: water is a relatively efficient organization, earning a nearly perfect rating from Charity Navigator, a sort of Consumer Reports for the nonprofit world.) Many donations are earmarked to specific projects, so if a church group gives, say, $5,000 for a well in Ethiopia, its members are not only told where their $5,000 is spent, but they also receive pictures of the well they financed and its G.P.S. coordinates. All of this information is publicly available on a section of charity: water's Web site dedicated to ''proving it.'' Most donors who happen to visit their well will find their names on a plaque there.
In just seven years, Harrison's organization claims to have raised roughly $100 million -- $33 million in 2012 alone, up from $27 million the year before and $16 million the year before that. Today it is the largest nonprofit in the United States focused on water, with revenues that are four times as great as those of Water.org, the group co-founded by Matt Damon. Charity: water doesn't drill wells or buy water filters but acts as a fund-raising clearinghouse for locally based charities, which it subcontracts to do the actual work. It markets its partners, mostly using its Web site and social media. ''You could almost imagine us a Kayak.com or an Expedia,'' Harrison says. But charity: water promises to do more than a mere online travel agent does; it claims to verify that the wells its donors buy are actually completed in a timely fashion. ''We create an experience,'' he says, ''a pure way to give.''
Harrison's commitment to geeky transparency, his willingness to speak the language of Silicon Valley and especially his organization's impressive revenue growth have made him a hero to techies and to a growing class of tech-savvy philanthropists. ''Scott is one of a handful of social entrepreneurs who are disrupting philanthropy,'' says Laura Arrillaga-Andreessen, the founder of the Stanford Center on Philanthropy and Civil Society (and the wife of Netscape's founder, Marc Andreessen). She's also an enthusiastic charity: water supporter. The organization, she says, ''is making philanthropy sexy.''
Ours was the only plane at Alula Aba Nega Airport in Mekele -- a small, dusty city 500 miles north of the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa -- when we landed the following afternoon. After customs officials flown in from the capital finished looking over our entry documents, we boarded a convoy of white Toyota Land Cruisers, with the numbers 1 through 20 taped to the sides, and made our way into the mountains.
Harrison organizes donor trips as narratives, which generally begin with a visit to a community that still relies on questionable or extremely remote water sources. We drove for more than four hours over unmarked dirt roads to find Selam, home to 600 people spread out across several miles of pasture -- or what would be pasture during the rainy season. For now, the landscape was barren, rust-colored fields broken up only by giant cactuses and crooked acacia trees. I sat in the passenger seat next to Teklewoini Assefa, the executive director of the Relief Society of Tigray, or REST, one of charity: water's 13 partners, and a close friend of Harrison's. Assefa -- a sturdily built man of 58 with a weathered face, a gold watch and only half of his ring finger -- served in the Tigray People's Liberation Front, the guerrilla army that helped topple Ethiopia's Marxist dictatorship in 1991. I asked Assefa about the injury, and he grinned. ''Bullet,'' he said, pantomiming a rifle blast.
As Assefa navigated the rough road, I chatted with Shakil Khan, a gregarious man who, at 39, was one of the more senior members of the group on the trip. Khan rose to prominence in Silicon Valley thanks to an early investment in Spotify; he also mentored the 17-year-old founder of Summly, an iPhone app that publishes summaries of news stories, who sold his company to Yahoo for a reported $30 million. Silicon Valley investors tend to measure their successes by how early they spot promising companies and trends, and so when I asked Khan about his involvement with Harrison, he was quick to take credit for an early pick. ''This isn't meant to be arrogant in any way,'' Khan said, ''but there are a lot of tech people who I introduced to charity: water.''
Charity: water offers two basic ''products,'' in Harrison's phrasing. The first way to give is through mycharity: water, a sort of social network that allows you to set up a Web page to encourage your Twitter and Facebook friends to donate in honor of an event or cause -- a birthday, for instance, or a marathon. (I gave $63 for a co-worker's birthday two years ago; 10 months later I got an e-mail that began: ''You gave money for a drilling rig. Here's your proof.'' A link to G.P.S. coordinates was included.) Khan started his first campaign in 2010 and raised $206,000 in 10 days, leading to a conglomerate of 22 wells in and around Seglamen, Ethiopia, that charity: water officials -- and most everyone else connected to Khan -- informally call ''Shaktown.'' Khan followed that effort by buying a Well membership, Harrison's other major product.
Well members -- there are 100 of them today, 13 of whom were on this trip -- promise to donate at least $24,000 a year for three years to charity: water's operational bank account, which pays the salaries of Harrison and his 62 employees, keeps the servers running and covers travel expenses for the staff. Members get a chance to hobnob with people in Harrison's inner circle of well-known techies, which includes the Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey and the former Facebook president Sean Parker, as well as the chance to go on trips like this one. ''When you get to spend four or five days in an intense environment, the real you comes out,'' Khan said. ''You're not polished, you're not going onstage.''
Khan wore a black T-shirt neatly tucked into a pair of khakis, finished with a bright blue scarf, indulging in a peculiar form of geeky peacocking that I noticed among certain members of the group. As a general rule, the wackier the dress, the greater the status. Khan's friend and fellow Well member Daniel Ek wore an oversize bright red Philadelphia Phillies hat that came down over his ears, a green polo shirt, green socks and orange running shoes. One of the wealthiest members of the crew, Michael Birch, who with his wife has donated more than $6 million to charity: water, wore an orange shirt, a blue bandanna and what I think was a ladies' cowboy hat. With his beard and shoulder-length blond hair, the effect was more Santa Cruz stoner than entrepreneur who sold his company, Bebo, for $850 million a few years ago.
Among both the powerful and poorly dressed, it was generally understood that you didn't network with other business leaders, in part because networking was, as Chris Sacca, a former Google executive whose venture-capital firm reportedly owns more than 10 percent of Twitter (a stake that could be worth as much as $1 billion), put it to me, not the point and unnecessary, because everyone was already successful. And although we had intermittent cellphone service and wireless Internet throughout the trip, there was an ambivalence about smartphone usage -- and strangely enough, technology more generally. (A tip: If you want to fit in among the start-up set, first brag about your gadgets, then brag about how little you use them.)
''When you work on the Web, so much of what you do is abstract and ethereal,'' said Sacca, who told me that start-up founders have been increasingly turning to organizations like charity: water because, unlike the Web, ''there's a there there.'' As he put it: ''There's a real desire to have meaning, something you can touch, measure, feel -- that exists. There's an allure to the fact that there are G.P.S. coordinates on the charity: water wells. Because everything else we have just lives in this cloud.''
Whereas an earlier generation of dot-com entrepreneurs celebrated their wealth by buying yachts and sports cars, this cohort, having made its fortune at a time when so much of the country was fighting foreclosures and negotiating unemployment benefits, seems to prefer to keep its excesses quiet -- or at least off Facebook and Instagram. ''It's like, 'I drive a Prius and drink $10,000 bottles of wine,' '' said Matt Mullenweg, a co-founder of WordPress and a Well member, summing up the prevailing attitude toward wealth among the tech elite. ''The wine's not on Instagram. The Prius is.''
By the time we reached Selam, Assefa's employees had organized a welcoming party of several hundred residents. Children carried English-language signs (''Thank You, Scott,'' ''Water Is Life''), men waved Ethiopian flags and danced, musicians banged on drums. As dusk fell, Harrison led the group on a mile-long walk into a gully, where we found three pools of brown water and a smaller greeting party. This, we were told by an elderly man who spoke through an interpreter with a megaphone, was where Selam's water came from.
''O.K., guys,'' Harrison said, holding up a large plastic gas can. ''I want everyone to try this for a second.'' A group of villagers started filling the bright yellow vessels with water, then handed them out to us. We struggled to carry them out of the canyon, simulating the journey that 8- and 9-year-old girls made every day. It was too hard. Most people gave up after a few steps, put down their cans and started taking pictures.
The water problem thus established, we were driven to our campsite. Harrison had told us that camping would come as a shock after Dubai's luxury. I guess that might have been the case, but it was still pretty nice. Our group was attended by a staff of 27 locals -- porters, cooks, servants, musicians, dancers -- and served a multicourse meal with a full bar. A young man in a crisp checked shirt insisted on carrying my backpack to the tent.
On New Year's Day 1980, Scott Harrison's father, Chuck, found his wife, Joan, passed out on the floor -- apparently as a result of carbon-monoxide poisoning from a leaky furnace. She survived, but she was never the same, developing a set of mysterious allergies that was sometimes called 20th Century Disease. Detergents, cigarette smoke and pretty much anything else that contained chemicals caused debilitating headaches and fatigue. ''Her body and sometimes her mind went haywire,'' Chuck Harrison told me in an e-mail. He replaced the furnace and set up a cot for his wife in a tiled bathroom, whose door was lined with tinfoil to protect her from the smell of the varnish.
Multiple Chemical Sensitivity, as Joan's illness is now known, is poorly understood and controversial -- many doctors see it as a symptom of a psychiatric disorder, and the American Medical Association does not recognize it as a distinct disease. Even as a boy, Harrison suspected that his mother's condition might be psychosomatic. ''She'd told me she was allergic to radio and TV,'' he says. ''I remember thinking it was all in her head.'' One night in the early '80s, when he was about 6, Harrison sneaked out of his room carrying a portable radio. He tiptoed to the door of the bathroom where his mother slept, carefully turned the volume on the radio all the way down so as not to wake her and then turned it on. Nothing happened until morning. ''She woke up really sick,'' he says. ''It was like, 'Wow, Mom isn't making this up.' You know, I was a selfish kid.''
Harrison told me that this experience -- imbued with feelings of doubt, betrayal and guilt -- is one of his earliest real memories. He became his mother's cook and caregiver. ''She'd eat one food every four days,'' he says. ''When I came back from school I would cook. Breakfast would be cashews, lunch would be lettuce, dinner would be cod.''
Harrison attended evangelical Christian schools, which, combined with his mother's bizarre illness, began to seem stifling as he approached adulthood. After high school, while playing in a band, he moved to New York. He earned a living as a party promoter -- first at Nell's, the famed nightclub, and later at Lotus, an early '00s hot spot. (Along the way, Harrison enrolled in night classes at N.Y.U., eventually graduating with gentlemanly C's and a communications degree.) By 28, he was living the rebel's dream life -- model girlfriend, big apartment in Midtown, grand piano, Rolex, cocaine.
It was on a New Year's Eve trip to Punta del Este, the Uruguayan resort, that Harrison realized he felt empty. Soon after his return, he began reading the Bible for the first time since high school and found himself hung up on a verse in James that defines religion as a commitment ''to look after orphans and widows in their distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.'' This upset him. ''I was kind of 0 for 2,'' he says. ''I had done nothing in a decade of night life for the poor.'' Harrison resolved, then and there, to change.
He swore off cigarettes, gambling, drugs and pornography -- and he quit his job, accepting a volunteer assignment on a cruise ship moored off the Liberian coast that had been converted into a field hospital for facial surgery. His bosses at Mercy Ships, a Texas nonprofit, expected him to take photographs of patients before and after their operations; Harrison had grander ambitions. He wrote confessional essays that mixed reportage from the ship with his own conversion from party person to follower of Christ and then distributed them to his old nightclub e-mail lists. (''There were people who were really encouraging,'' Harrison recalls. ''And then there were people who were like, 'Dude, where's the Prada party?' '') That summer, Harrison organized a gala for Mercy Ships in New York.
Then something miraculous happened: When Harrison came home from Liberia and met his parents, his mother greeted him with a hug, something that they hadn't been able to do for years without his first taking a shower and changing into a clean pair of clothes. She was recovering. ''It seemed that God had chosen to redeem our family at a moment,'' Harrison says, ''to show grace to all of us.''
Later that year, Harrison returned to Liberia, as the idea for charity: water started to take shape. ''It's intoxicating, addicting,'' he wrote in 2006, describing a series of experiences he had helping Liberian children. ''It's a really strong notion -- that of the lost sheep, the lost coin, the prodigal son. That they matter, that they can be found, saved. That they can speak to larger change.''
His old club friends were suspicious of the nonprofit world. ''I would hear the black-hole expression a lot,'' he says. ''You know: 'I don't know where my money goes.' '' Here were people who willingly paid $16 for a margarita talking about waste and inefficiency. This wasn't a charity problem, Harrison decided. It was a perception problem.
Harrison tells a version of this story -- beginning with his mother's illness and ending with the conception of charity: water -- most every time he has an audience. ''I wanted to reinvent the way people thought about charity, and how people thought about giving,'' was how he put it to us that night at the campsite. ''There were no really imaginative, fun, epic charities that I knew of. I thought we could actually build a brand and go after the Nikes and Apples of the world.''
Our first stop the following day was a worksite, where we were greeted by hundreds of children who'd taken the morning off from school to celebrate our arrival. They danced, clapped, chanted and held up those ''Water Is Life'' signs while our group snapped pictures. Eventually we huddled around a 40-foot-deep hole while Assefa explained how a well is dug. Workers started with shovels, but once they hit bedrock, the wells had to be dynamited open.
''Is it ready to blow?'' Harrison called out, and then sent Nathan Hubbard, the C.E.O. of Ticketmaster, to do the honors. Hubbard pushed the button, the ground thumped and rocks and dust sputtered out of the hole. The well was a few inches deeper, and workers went in with jackhammers to prepare for the next round of blasting. It was, self-consciously, a show.
The narrative continued that afternoon: we drank from a recently finished version of the same type of well a few miles away. ''Tastes like success,'' someone joked, amid the furious taking of pictures. Then it was on to a school, where we found a larger charity: water project that included several water taps and latrines. Harrison had organized a pickup soccer game there that ended up including 100 or so impossibly cute elementary-school children.
I went to two villages the next day and two more the following day. The visits were all remarkably similar: the same speeches, the same signs, the kids singing: ''Welcome. Welcome. To our home. To our home.'' There was always bread and honey, always a chance to photograph a beautiful smiling child drinking from a pristine well, always a chance to have yourself photographed doing the same.
On the morning of that last day, we visited a mechanical drilling rig in the village of Agazi that had just hit water. (The rig and its accessories were purchased by charity: water for roughly $1 million, donated to its Ethiopian partner, REST, and staffed by REST employees with financing from Harrison's organization.) Young men on horses galloped through the procession, trailing red ribbons and ruffles; others charged around on foot, carrying giant Ethiopian flags. ''You have solved our problem,'' declared Daniel Hagos, REST's head of rural water-supply development, translating for a village elder. And later: ''We thank Scott. Let God let him live forever.''
Harrison acknowledged the crowd and then pulled himself onto the roof of one of the trucks. A compressor sent air into the well, pushing a vent of muddy water 20 feet into the air. The crowd shrieked.
''Who wants to stand there,'' he asked, motioning to a group of five to pose in front of the rig. ''It's a great shot.'' The compressor forced out another spurt of water. Harrison took a few pictures with his iPhone and then got back down on the ground and jostled his way to the front as water droplets fell on his shoulders. It was a tightly choreographed performance, but a deeply affecting one.
''I think people in the tech community are attracted to fastidiously designed and maintained brands,'' Tom Conrad, the executive vice president of Pandora, said as our Land Cruiser drove between villages. ''Perhaps that's superficial,'' he conceded, ''but good design correlates with thoughtfulness throughout the endeavor.''
In the back seat, Neil Hutchinson, a 35-year-old entrepreneur who has donated more than $2 million to charity: water, nodded. ''You want to be part of a growth story,'' he said. ''A lot of charities don't place any emphasis on brand. That doesn't really make any sense. If Scott hadn't got a great brand, the charity wouldn't have grown at this rate.''
Harrison's critics don't dispute his marketing prowess but say that's beside the point. Charity: water's ''biggest provable impact may be that it puts the names of millennials on new, but perhaps not always functional, wells in poverty-ridden countries,'' Anne Elizabeth Moore wrote in an essay published on Truthout, a liberal Web site, earlier this year. ''That's branding. Not a movement.'' Moore noted Harrison's use of the two bank accounts but questioned whether charity: water had really provided clean water to the more than three million people that the organization claims. One estimate suggests that 30 percent of all water projects, industrywide, break down ahead of schedule. And charity: water currently has limited ability to monitor its own wells. ''We don't know what percentage of our wells are broken,'' says Robert Lee, the organization's director of special programs. ''My guess is 5 to 10 percent.''
This fact has the potential to create a gulf between Harrison's brand of charity and the charitable work itself. In 2011, an internal audit found that a nonprofit Harrison hired in Kenya had done unsatisfactory work on 31 projects financed in 2008 by employees and customers of Brighton Collectibles, a California-based retailer of handbags and accessories. Brighton sued charity: water, claiming breach of contract, fraud and negligence, and though charity: water denied any wrongdoing, it agreed to pay $1 million as part of a settlement (which would ultimately finance another organization's water projects). Harrison told me that tribal violence in Kenya following a disputed 2007 election was to blame for the project's shortcomings, but he acknowledged that he failed to warn donors of the risks of a large-scale project in a poor country rife with violence and corruption. ''We were more naïve then,'' he said. ''We set expectations poorly.''
Charity: water says well maintenance is an industrywide problem and presents itself in a familiar role as savior. Last December, the organization was awarded a $5 million grant by Google's philanthropic arm to develop sensors to monitor water flow remotely in real time and to pay local charities to hire maintenance crews. The plan is to solve the problem of well failure while also improving communications with donors, who, if all goes well, will be able to check the status of their wells halfway around the world on their iPhones. Jacquelline Fuller, the director of Google Giving, says that the sensor project has the potential to ''change the entire sector.''
It's a compelling pitch, and it should be said that Water.org, Harrison's closest significant competitor, has confronted the problem of well breakdown by shifting most of its resources away from digging wells. The philanthropy, which was formed in 2009 when Matt Damon's H20 Africa merged with WaterPartners, a pioneering charity that dug its first well in the early '90s, has expanded its mission to providing microloans to help people in developing countries hook up to existing municipal water systems. Gary White, the organization's C.E.O., says the goal is to use ''market-based solutions'' to ''move beyond the high-subsidy approach.'' White, who has spent his adult life trying to get people to care about water, tells me that he is grateful to Harrison for raising awareness but is skeptical of his approach. ''There's never going to be enough charity in the world to get water to everyone who needs it,'' he says.
Harrison is less pessimistic. He sees giving as a growth industry, and his business plan calls for charity: water to raise $100 million in 2015. He has been hiring engineers and product managers from tech companies like Twitter and Zynga with the hope that they can propel charity: water to the kind of fast growth that helped those companies reach multibillion-dollar valuations. He's already thinking about expanding to other areas of charitable giving -- perhaps charity: education or charity: shelter. ''The people working here have signed up for the moonshot,'' he says. ''We're not here to grow 10 percent a year.''
I ask him if trips like the one I went on do not, in some sense, undercut that goal. Aren't there better uses of his time than playing tour guide to groups of minimoguls halfway around the world? Wouldn't it be better to spend the group's money on water projects rather than on luxurious camping trips? ''It's about building a long-term relationship with 40 people,'' he says. ''The cost of the food or a charter plane pales in comparison.'' There's something else, too: he wants to give these young techies the revelatory experience he had in Liberia. ''I want to give them a piece of the joy I found,'' he says. ''These trips really bring out the best in people.''
He may be right. Our last stop before boarding the private plane back to Dubai was, in Harrison's words, ''Daniel's well.'' It was a modest hand pump in the tiny village of Giramagogo that had been purchased by Daniel Ek, Spotify's C.E.O., for $7,000. Though Ek wasn't the wealthiest guy on the trip -- Spotify is still private, meaning much of Ek's net worth is locked up in private shares -- he was in many ways the most influential. The Internet music-streaming company has a reported $3 billion valuation and is likely to go public. Ek is a reserved guy, and he was quiet for most of the trip, but he seemed to lose track of himself in the moment, grinning widely and clapping wildly. ''I'm very happy to have played a small part in getting you clean water,'' he said, addressing the village. ''So thank you.''
Ek made his first donation to charity: water -- $5,000 -- in 2009 shortly after Spotify raised $50 million from venture capitalists. He was 26 and had already sold another company for $1 million. ''You know, this Internet has created so much wealth in such a short amount of time,'' he said as we waited for our return flight to Dubai. ''We made money when we were incredibly young, and in the beginning we didn't handle that well.'' Ek lived lavishly during the first few years of his newfound wealth and minor celebrity. ''When you're a computer geek, you think you want to be the guy with all the girls at the table,'' he said. ''But I realized after a while that ain't me.''
He had trouble connecting with charities. He wanted one that would use technology to show him where his money was being spent. ''I wanted to be able to go to a project if I felt like it, and just see where my money went,'' he said. ''I feel like with today's charities, you just give, and you get nothing back. You don't see anything. And I think that's what charity: water has done so brilliantly.''
This was, on one hand, a bit much. Ek is worth hundreds of millions of dollars on paper -- he reportedly owns 15 percent of Spotify -- and he doesn't need anything back, not the ''proof'' that Harrison is so eager to offer, not even a warm feeling. The reasons he offered for supporting charity: water were self-centered, superficial and simplistic -- so often the failings of this cohort of tech darlings. On the other hand, here was a mere 30-year-old, his star still rising, talking about giving it away even before he really has it. It was presumptuous and cringe-worthy and inspiring.
Ek told me that he would like to donate 1 percent of the equity in Spotify to charity: water, worth perhaps $30 million now, but can't because Spotify is private and he is bound by shareholder covenants that make it difficult to simply give away shares. So he plans instead, he said, to find a way to donate ''a meaningful portion'' of his wealth to charity, including charity: water, and he is encouraging his peers to do the same.
By the time the trip was over, two members of the group, including Troy Carter, whose company manages Lady Gaga, had committed to give Harrison and his brand 1 percent of their companies as well. ''I think that's awesome,'' Ek said. ''There are a lot of companies that are going to be created in the next five years. If charity: water can get one or two of those billion-dollar companies, we have a real shot.''

HEADLINE: With I.P.O.'s on the Rise, Analysts Get New Scrutiny

BYLINE: PETER LATTMAN and SUSANNE CRAIG


HIGHLIGHT: For years, financial industry rules have barred research analysts from pitching initial public offering business, but some say Wall Street is returning to its old ways. 

 BODY:
The market for initial public offerings has made a comeback, surging to levels not seen since before the financial crisis. At the same time, concerns have resurfaced over the role of Wall Street research analysts in these lucrative deals.
For years, stock analysts have been barred from pitching I.P.O. business, a big moneymaker for firms like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Banking fees from helping companies list their shares on stock exchanges have topped $1.7 billion in the United States so far this year.
The country's largest banks agreed to bar their analysts from I.P.O. solicitations a decade ago after regulators, led by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, uncovered evidence that during the Internet boom some analysts issued overly optimistic reports about dot-com start-ups to help their colleagues on the investment banking side win underwriting assignments.
But some analysts say Wall Street is slipping back into its old ways. 
Today, companies routinely interview analysts when selecting bankers to underwrite their I.P.O.'s. During these meetings, the analysts say, they increasingly feel pressure to say the right things to curry favor with a company's management and owners. They also see themselves as participating in their banks' efforts to win business, a potential breach of government regulations.
The enforcement department of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Wall Street's self-regulatory body, has sent an inquiry asking several firms for information on the issue, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
"The walls between research and banking can still be porous," said Jay R. Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida who studies the I.P.O. market. "It doesn't surprise me that there has perhaps been some backsliding."
Representatives for Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Citigroup said that its research department acts independently of its banking unit.
The banks say that their analysts are supposed to discuss only broad industry trends at these meetings and not pitch the bank's underwriting services. If asked about specific views on a company, like earnings models or potential I.P.O. pricing, they are supposed to refer those questions to bankers.
Interviewing analysts as part of the process of going public has become more prevalent, several analysts said, with the proliferation of so-called I.P.O. advisers, firms that advise companies in the early stages of an offering. These firms are paid to help companies and, often, their private equity owners screen banks vying to take companies public. Among other things, they arrange for meetings between companies and the Wall Street analysts and bankers.
"If you are going to see the people who are screening the underwriters you are there for one purpose, to win banking business," said another Wall Street analyst, who also requested anonymity because his company prohibits employees from speaking to the media without prior approval. This analyst said he knew of the practice but had not taken part in any meetings.
Participants say company meetings with the analysts and bankers are held separately, but can happen within hours of each other, and banks rarely send compliance officers to monitor the discussions. Analysts say that when private equity executives are involved, the sessions can turn especially uncomfortable, veering into questions about a company's valuation.
Solebury Capital, Rothschild and Lazard are among the leading firms in this area. Solebury has recently guided a number of companies through the I.P.O. process, including the discount retailer Five Below; Bloomin' Brands, which owns Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill; and HD Supply Holdings, according to regulatory filings.
In an interview, Solebury's co-chief executives, Alan Sheriff and Ted Hatfield, said that their corporate clients meet with analysts as well as bankers as they work through the offering process, but that the meetings with analysts are "informational," regarding general market trends.
"Pitching investment banking in analyst meetings is strictly off limits," Mr. Sheriff said.
A senior research executive at one major Wall Street firm says he thinks it is acceptable for an analyst to have a broad chat with a company looking to go public, and the analyst can benefit from that meeting by learning more about the industry. But he expressed concern about meetings with companies in the process of choosing banks to underwrite their I.P.O.'s.
"I am not O.K. with a third party organizing a beauty contest with the express purpose of winning banking business," said the executive, whose firm has a policy against speaking to the media. "The problem is, the analyst going to the meeting knows the purpose and couldn't help but feel pressured. You are selling your bank."
Investors both large and small often rely on the recommendations of analysts, who issue buy and sell recommendations on stocks. Questions about the legitimacy of Wall Street research came into focus during the height of the Internet and telecommunications bubble. During that heady time, analysts worked closely with banking colleagues to secure profitable I.P.O. assignments from fast-growing tech companies.
Mr. Spitzer, as attorney general, spearheaded an investigation that helped solidify his reputation at the time as the "sheriff of Wall Street." He released incriminating e-mails that showed analysts privately disparaged the very companies they were publicly telling investors to buy. They also showed how influential investment bankers were in securing positive research reports for companies that were either clients of a firm or prospective customers.
In one e-mail, an investor asked Henry Blodget, then a Merrill Lynch analyst, what was so interesting about GoTo.com, an Internet company he was recommending, except for the banking fees that it generated.
"Nothing," Mr. Blodget replied.
In another e-mail message, Mr. Blodget called InfoSpace, an Internet company that he favored publicly, "a piece of junk."
Federal regulators barred Mr. Blodget, who now runs Business Insider, a business news Web site, and Jack B. Grubman, another prominent analyst who worked at Salomon Smith Barney, from the securities industry.
In 2003, 10 Wall Street banks agreed to pay a collective $1.4 billion to resolve the government's accusations. As part of the settlement, the firms agreed to separate their banking and research departments, a move that regulators said would ensure that analysts operated more autonomously.
Analysts were also expressly "prohibited from participating in efforts to solicit investment banking business," including pitches and road shows. Over the years, that language has been incorporated into rules policed by Finra, the regulator.
There are exceptions. A federal law backed by the banking industry and passed last year, the Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act, watered down the rule. The law, known as the JOBS Act, allows analysts to attend an investment banking pitch in connection with the I.P.O. of an emerging growth company, defined as a firm with less than $1 billion in revenue. Still, Finra's rules say, "a research analyst may not engage in otherwise prohibited conduct in such meetings, including efforts to solicit investment banking business."
Questions about whether that rule is being flouted come as the market for initial public offerings is heating up. This year, 122 I.P.O.'s have come to market, raising about $29 billion, an increase of 33 percent over the same period in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters.
A huge chunk of those I.P.O.'s are companies owned by private equity firms, which are looking to cash out their holdings in a buoyant market. The $12.6 billion in proceeds generated by private equity-backed initial public offerings this year has already surpassed the $10.4 billion worth of deals during all of 2012, Thomson Reuters said.
Several big private equity-owned companies are preparing to file I.P.O.'s in the coming months, like the hotelier Hilton Worldwide and the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus. Research analysts have participated in meetings related to the selection of underwriters on those deals.
After being told that analysts were playing a role in I.P.O. solicitations, Mr. Spitzer, now a candidate for New York City comptroller, expressed concern.
"The structure sounds like a slightly too-clever way to circumvent the intent" of the rule, he said.

HEADLINE: The Wrong Lesson From Detroit's Bankruptcy

BYLINE: JOSEPH E. STIGLITZ


HIGHLIGHT: There is more than enough blame to go around for the largest municipal insolvency in American history. But in restructuring, the city&#8217;s interests, not creditors&#8217;, should be foremost. 

 BODY:
When I was growing up in Gary, Ind., nearly a quarter of American workers were employed in the manufacturing sector. There were plenty of jobs at the time that paid well enough for a single breadwinner, working one job, to fulfill the American dream for his family of four. He could earn a living on the sweat of his brow, afford to send his children to college and even see them rise to the professional class.
Cities like Detroit and Gary thrived on that industry, not just in terms of the wealth that it produced but also in terms of strong communities, healthy tax bases and good infrastructure. From the stable foundation of Gary's excellent public schools, influenced by the ideas of the progressive reformer John Dewey, I went on to Amherst College and then to M.I.T. for graduate school. 
Today, fewer than 8 percent of American workers are employed in manufacturing, and many Rust Belt cities are skeletons. The distressing facts about Detroit are by now almost a cliché: 40 percent of streetlights were not working this spring, tens of thousands of buildings are abandoned, schools have closed and the population declined 25 percent in the last decade alone. The violent crime rate last year was the highest of any big city. In 1950, when Detroit's population was 1.85 million, there were 296,000 manufacturing jobs in the city; as of 2011, with a population of just over 700,000, there were fewer than 27,000.

So much is packed into the dramatic event of Detroit's fall - the largest municipal bankruptcy in American history - that it's worth taking a pause to see what it says about our changing economy and society, and what it portends for our future.
Failures of national and local policy are by now well known: underinvestment in infrastructure and public services, geographic isolation that has marginalized poor and African-American communities in the Rust Belt, intergenerational poverty that has stymied equality of opportunity and the privileging of moneyed interests (like those of corporate executives and financial services companies) over those of workers.
At one level, one might shrug: companies die every day; new ones are born. That is part of the dynamics of capitalism. So, too, for cities. Maybe Detroit and cities like it are just in the wrong location for the goods and services that 21st-century America demands.
But such a diagnosis would be wrong, and it's extremely important to recognize that Detroit's demise is not simply an inevitable outcome of the market.
For one, the description is incomplete: Detroit's most serious problems are confined to the city limits. Elsewhere in the metropolitan area, there is ample economic activity. In suburbs like Bloomfield Hills, Mich., the median household income is more than $125,000. A 45-minute drive from Detroit is Ann Arbor, home of the University of Michigan, one of the world's pre-eminent hubs of research and knowledge production.
Detroit's travails arise in part from a distinctive aspect of America's divided economy and society. As the sociologists Sean F. Reardon and Kendra Bischoff have pointed out, our country is becoming vastly more economically segregated, which can be even more pernicious than being racially segregated. Detroit is the example par excellence of the seclusion of affluent (and mostly white) elites in suburban enclaves. There is a rationale for battening down the hatches: the rich thus ensure that they don't have to pay any share of the local public goods and services of their less well-off neighbors, and that their children don't have to mix with those of lower socioeconomic status.
The trend toward self-reinforcing inequality is especially apparent in education, an ever shrinking ladder for upward mobility. Schools in poorer districts get worse, parents with means move out to richer districts, and the divisions between the haves and the have-nots - not only in this generation, but also in the next - grow ever larger.
Residential segregation along economic lines amplifies inequality for adults, too. The poor have to somehow manage to get from their neighborhoods to part-time, low-paying and increasingly scarce jobs at distant work sites. Combine this urban sprawl with inadequate public transportation systems and you have a blueprint for transforming working-class communities into depopulated ghettos.
Adding to the problems that would inevitably arise from such poorly designed urban agglomerations is the fact that the Detroit metropolitan area is divided into separate political jurisdictions. The poor are thus not only geographically isolated, but politically ghettoized as well. The result is a separate, poorer inner city with a dearth of resources, made even worse because the industrial plants that had provided the core of the tax base are shut down.
The decision to file for Chapter 9 municipal bankruptcy protection was made by Kevyn D. Orr, the nonelected emergency manager appointed by Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican, to run the city's finances. The incumbent mayor, Dave Bing, a Democrat, has decided not to seek a second term, which is hardly surprising given that he and other local officials have been left on the sidelines as their city's future - and the accumulated debts owed its creditors - is being hashed out in court.
As historians like Thomas J. Sugrue have demonstrated, the disintegration of Detroit precedes the conflicts over social-welfare programs and race relations (including riots in 1967) and reaches back into the postwar decades, a time when the roots of deindustrialization, racial discrimination and geographic isolation were planted. We've reaped what we've sown.
Lacking regional political unity, there is no overall structure to improve the infrastructure and public services between poorer inner cities and affluent suburbs. So the poor fall back on what means they have, which is not good enough. Cars inevitably break down and buses are late, making workers appear to be "unreliable." But what is really unreliable is the iniquitous design of the city. No wonder America is becoming the advanced industrial country with the least equality of opportunity.
The same skewed priorities that have gutted Detroit at the local level are echoed in a void at the level of national policy. Every country, every society, has regions and industries whose stars are rising, and others that are in decline. Silicon Valley has, for some time, been America's rising star - just as the upper Midwest was a hundred years ago. With technological change and globalization, though, the Midwest's comparative advantage as a global manufacturing hub has ebbed, for reasons too well known to list here. Markets, however, often don't do a good job of self-rejuvenation.
Rather than deal purposefully with this changing economic landscape with useful policies encouraging the growth of other industries, our government spent decades papering over the growing weaknesses by allowing the financial sector to run amok, creating "growth" based on bubbles. We didn't just let the market run its course. We made an active choice to embrace short-term profits and large-scale inefficiency.
There may be something inevitable about the structural changes that have made American manufacturing less central to our economy, but there is nothing inevitable about the waste, pain and human despair in cities that have accompanied that change. There are policy alternatives that can soften such transitions in ways that preserve wealth and promote equality. Just four hours from Detroit, Pittsburgh, too, grappled with white flight. But it more rapidly shifted its economy from one dependent on steel and coal to one that emphasizes education, health care and legal and financial services. Manchester, the center of Britain's textile industry for more than a century, has been transformed into a center of education, culture and music. America does have an urban renewal program, but it is aimed more at restoring buildings and gentrification than at maintaining and restoring communities, and even at that, it is languishing. American workers were sold "free" trade policies on the promise that the winners could compensate the losers. The losers are still waiting.
Of course, the Great Recession and the policies that created it have made this, like so many other things, much worse. The mortgage bankers marched into large sections of some of our cities and found them good subjects for their predatory and discriminatory lending. Once the bubble burst, those cities were abandoned by all but the debt collectors and foreclosure sheriffs. Rather than saving our communities, our politicians focused more on saving the bankers, their shareholders and their bondholders.
The situation may be grim, but all is not lost for Detroit and other cities facing similar problems. The question facing Detroit now is how to manage bankruptcy.
But here, too, we must be wary of the influence of the "wisdom" of wealthy interests. In recent years, our financial "wizards" at private banks - whose skill is supposed to be managing risk - sold Detroit some fancy financial products (derivatives) that have worsened its financial plight by hundreds of millions of dollars.
In a conventional bankruptcy, derivatives would get priority as creditors before current and retired municipal workers. Fortunately, the rules governing Chapter 9 of the bankruptcy code put greater emphasis on the public good. When a public body goes into bankruptcy, there is always some ambiguity about its assets and liabilities. Its obligations include an unwritten "social contract," including social services for its residents. Its ability to increase revenues is limited: higher taxes can accelerate a death spiral, driving out more businesses and homeowners.
The banks, not surprisingly, would like other priorities. With nearly $300 million of outstanding derivatives at stake, they may connive to be first in line for repayment. The Chapter 9 proceeding provides the opportunity to place the banks where they ought to be - at the back of the queue. It was bad enough that these nontransparent financial instruments were used to confuse and deceive investors. It would add insult to injury to reward the banks' behavior. The priority in the bankruptcy proceedings must be restoring Detroit to vitality as a city, not just getting it out of the red. The basic principle of Chapter 11 of our bankruptcy code (focusing on corporations) is that bankruptcy should provide a fresh start: doing so is vital to preserving jobs and our economy. But when cities go bankrupt, it's even more important to preserve our communities.
Banks and bondholders will argue that pension payments for city workers are an undue burden, and should be limited or canceled to reduce the banks' losses. But the high priority that workers are typically given in municipal bankruptcies is entirely justified. After all, they have performed their services on the understanding that they would be paid, and pensions are nothing but "deferred compensation." Workers are not engaged in the complicated business of risk assessment, as investors are. And unlike investors, they can't really diversify their portfolios to manage their risk. So it should be unconscionable to tell workers that, sorry, we aren't paying you what we promised for work you've already done. Especially because their pensions, unlike those of corporate chieftains, are far from generous. Most of the retired city employees receiving checks get about $1,600 a month.
This means that much of the burden of bankruptcy will have to fall on those who lent Detroit money, and those who insured those lenders. This is as it should be. They got a return, reflecting their subjective estimate of the risk that they faced. Of course, they would like to get high returns, and somehow not bear the risk. But this is not the way markets work, or should work.
Ensuring that bankruptcy proceeds in a way that is good for Detroit will require vigilance, and is only the first step in recovery. In the longer term, we will need to change the way we run our metropolitan areas. We need to provide better public transportation, an education system that promotes a modicum of equality of opportunity, and a system of metropolitan "governance" that works not just for the 1 percent, nor even for the top 20 percent, but for all citizens.
And on the national level, we need policies - investment in education, training and infrastructure - that smooth America's transition away from a dependency on manufacturing for jobs. If we don't, post-Great Recession bankruptcies like those in Jefferson County, Ala., Vallejo, Calif., Central Falls., R.I., and now Detroit will become far too common.
Detroit's bankruptcy is a reminder of how divided our society has become and how much has to be done to heal the wounds. And it provides an important warning to those living in today's boomtowns: it could happen to you.

HEADLINE: To Stay Afloat, Bookstores Turn To Web Donors

BYLINE: By JULIE BOSMAN

 BODY:
For years, independent bookstores have taken creative steps to fight off challenges from Amazon and the superstores by building in-house espresso bars, hosting members-only lunches with authors and selling birthday cards, toys and trinkets.
In 2013, it has come to this: Asking their customers for donations.
Crowdfunding is sweeping through the bookstore business, the latest tactic for survival in a market that is dominated by Amazon, with its rock-bottom prices, and Barnes & Noble, with its dizzying in-store selection. It's hardly a sustainable business model; but it buys some time, and gives customers a feeling of helping a favorite cause and even preserving a civic treasure.
In San Francisco, a campaign for Adobe Books successfully raised $60,000 on Indiegogo.com in March after the store faced a rent increase and nearly went out of business. 
In Asheville, N.C., the Spellbound Children's Bookshop collected more than $5,000 when it appealed to customers for help moving to a new location.
In the Flatiron district of Manhattan, Books of Wonder raised more than $50,000 in an online campaign last fall after the recession and other losses depleted its financial resources.
Web sites like Indiegogo and Kickstarter, originally made for the public financing of creative projects, have simplified the logistics of raising money, and bookstores facing financial distress are seizing the opportunity. They can set up a Web page explaining what their fund-raising goal is, why they are asking for it and what the deadline is. Donors pitch in as little as $5 or $10 with a few clicks and a credit card number. Peter Glassman, who owns Books of Wonder, said he turned to a fund-raising campaign only as a last resort.
''I thought, given the financial strains we're under at the moment, perhaps this is the way to prevent us from getting into a really desperate situation,'' Mr. Glassman said.
He said it was the first time in 30 years that he was willing to admit that the store needed help.
''You never tell people your problems,'' he said. ''The worst you say is, 'Business is a little tight.' ''
But that kind of tough-it-out attitude seems to have gone the way of the Book-of-the-Month Club. The independent bookstores that remain have taken a hard-nosed approach to their business, more willing to experiment with new technologies and to tap the carefully cultivated loyalty of their customers.
Josh Mills, the longtime manager of The Bookstore in Chico, Calif., made a public appeal for $35,000 on Indiegogo when the owner decided to close the store and Mr. Mills stepped up to buy it.
In less than two months, he had collected $36,068, mostly in chunks of $15 and $25 from locals who were outraged at the thought of the bookstore shutting down. Donations seemed to come from everywhere: Mr. Mills received $25 from one former customer in Hawaii who heard about the store's plight via e-mail from a friend in France. Acquaintances threw local fund-raisers, serving wine, crostini and deviled eggs, and then funneled the money into the online campaign.
''I felt strange about asking for money that way -- baring my soul and sharing my personal business is not what I do,'' said Mr. Mills, who now owns the store. ''Bookstores are sort of an endangered industry for lots of reasons. But it would have left a huge hole in our little community if we had gone away.''
Independents have seen their business suffer in recent years for all of the usual reasons. Many customers have shifted their purchases from print books to e-books. Amazon's market share keeps growing, making it the biggest seller of books in the country. And the price of rent has gone up in city centers.
A price war between Amazon and Overstock.com, another online retailer, that flared up last month resulted in print books being discounted even more steeply than usual -- sometimes close to 60 percent -- a price cut that a small bookstore cannot match. (Amazon and Overstock can make up for their losses on books by selling jewelry, furniture and diapers.)
But owners of independent bookstores also reason that if they cannot compete with Amazon on price, they will attract customers by having a more carefully chosen selection. If Barnes & Noble has uninformed salesclerks, theirs will have the fluency of a Ph.D. candidate in literature.
And if their customers have a fierce attachment to their local neighborhood bookstore, as many claim to do, then bookstore owners reason that they should test that loyalty by making a direct appeal for donations.
''I think it's an indication of the emotional connection that many customers have with their bookstores,'' said Daniel Goldin, the owner of the Boswell Book Company in Milwaukee. ''Every customer who buys a book at an independent could do it in a different way, a cheaper way. A lot of customers position us in their head like the nonprofits they support, like a humane society or a park.''
The American Booksellers Association, a trade group, says the number of bookstores it represents has grown slightly in the last several years, despite an overall drop in the last decade -- they currently have 1,632 members, down from about 2,400 members in 2002.
''Amazon obviously continues to grow,'' said Oren Teicher, the chief executive of the association. ''It's not like we're without challenges.''
Seeking financial support from customers, he said, is an example ''of how a combination of technology and localism is helping stores get funded that 20 years ago would have been impossible to do.''
Many independent bookstores said that despite the challenges to their business, they were doing just fine. Some of them are crowdfunding not as a means of survival, but as a way to expand.
BookCourt, a neighborhood fixture in Cobble Hill, Brooklyn, is one of the stores that has been thriving despite competition from Amazon and Barnes & Noble. (A two-story Barnes & Noble is just three blocks away.) It recently started an ambitious online campaign to help pay for the purchase of a new bookstore space in the Catskills that will open next spring.
Zack Zook, the events and development director for the store, said he was inspired by other online fund-raising campaigns for short films and art projects that he had occasionally participated in for the last several years.
''There's something that feels really neutral about throwing a hundred bucks in a pot,'' Mr. Zook said. ''People like to be affiliated with a mission. And with any independent bookstore, it's almost like a nonprofit -- there's really no money to play with.''
Mr. Glassman, of Books of Wonder, said he had been gratified by all of the support.
''It was very touching to know how much people care,'' he said.
He acknowledged the fund-raising campaign was a short-term fix. ''It helped, but it didn't solve it,'' he said. ''But we're not in danger anymore of closing tomorrow.''

HEADLINE: Path to United States Practice Is Long Slog to Foreign Doctors

BYLINE: By CATHERINE RAMPELL

 BODY:
Thousands of foreign-trained immigrant physicians are living in the United States with lifesaving skills that are going unused because they stumbled over one of the many hurdles in the path toward becoming a licensed doctor here.
The involved testing process and often duplicative training these doctors must go through are intended to make sure they meet this country's high quality standards, which American medical industry groups say are unmatched elsewhere in the world. Some development experts are also loath to make it too easy for foreign doctors to practice here because of the risk of a ''brain drain'' abroad.
But many foreign physicians and their advocates argue that the process is unnecessarily restrictive and time-consuming, particularly since America's need for doctors will expand sharply in a few short months under President Obama's health care law. They point out that medical services cost far more in the United States than elsewhere in the world, in part because of such restrictions.
The United States already faces a shortage of physicians in many parts of the country, especially in specialties where foreign-trained physicians are most likely to practice, like primary care. And that shortage is going to get exponentially worse, studies predict, when the health care law insures millions more Americans starting in 2014. 
The new health care law only modestly increases the supply of homegrown primary care doctors, not nearly enough to account for the shortfall, and even that tiny bump is still a few years away because it takes so long to train new doctors. Immigrant advocates and some economists point out that the medical labor force could grow much faster if the country tapped the underused skills of the foreign-trained physicians who are already here but are not allowed to practice. Canada, by contrast, has made efforts to recognize more high-quality training programs done abroad.
''It doesn't cost the taxpayers a penny because these doctors come fully trained,'' said Nyapati Raghu Rao, the Indian-born chairman of psychiatry at Nassau University Medical Center and a past chairman of the American Medical Association's international medical graduates governing council. ''It is doubtful that the U.S. can respond to the massive shortages without the participation of international medical graduates. But we're basically ignoring them in this discussion and I don't know why that is.''
Consider Sajith Abeyawickrama, 37, who was a celebrated anesthesiologist in his native Sri Lanka. But here in the United States, where he came in 2010 to marry, he cannot practice medicine.
Instead of working as a doctor himself, he has held a series of jobs in the medical industry, including an unpaid position where he entered patient data into a hospital's electronic medical records system, and, more recently, a paid position teaching a test prep course for students trying to become licensed doctors themselves.
For years the United States has been training too few doctors to meet its own needs, in part because of industry-set limits on the number of medical school slots available. Today about one in four physicians practicing in the United States were trained abroad, a figure that includes a substantial number of American citizens who could not get into medical school at home and studied in places like the Caribbean.
But immigrant doctors, no matter how experienced and well trained, must run a long, costly and confusing gantlet before they can actually practice here.
The process usually starts with an application to a private nonprofit organization that verifies medical school transcripts and diplomas. Among other requirements, foreign doctors must prove they speak English; pass three separate steps of the United States Medical Licensing Examination; get American recommendation letters, usually obtained after volunteering or working in a hospital, clinic or research organization; and be permanent residents or receive a work visa (which often requires them to return to their home country after their training).
The biggest challenge is that an immigrant physician must win one of the coveted slots in America's medical residency system, the step that seems to be the tightest bottleneck.
That residency, which typically involves grueling 80-hour workweeks, is required even if a doctor previously did a residency in a country with an advanced medical system, like Britain or Japan. The only exception is for doctors who did their residencies in Canada.
The whole process can consume upward of a decade -- for those lucky few who make it through.
''It took me double the time I thought, since I was still having to work while I was studying to pay for the visa, which was very expensive,'' said Alisson Sombredero, 33, an H.I.V. specialist who came to the United States from Colombia in 2005.
Dr. Sombredero spent three years studying for her American license exams, gathering recommendation letters and volunteering at a hospital in an unpaid position. She supported herself during that time by working as a nanny. That was followed by three years in a residency at Highland Hospital in Oakland, Calif., and one year in an H.I.V. fellowship at San Francisco General Hospital. She finally finished her training this summer, eight years after she arrived in the United States and 16 years after she first enrolled in medical school.
Dr. Sombredero was helped through the process by the Welcome Back Initiative, an organization started 12 years ago as a partnership between San Francisco State University and City College of San Francisco. The organization has worked with about 4,600 physicians in its centers around the country, according to its founder, José Ramón Fernández-Peña.
Only 118 of those doctors, he said, have successfully made it to residency.
''If I had to even think about going through residency now, I'd shoot myself,'' said Dr. Fernández-Peña, who came to the United States from Mexico in 1985 and chose not even to try treating patients once he learned what the licensing process requires. Today, in addition to running the Welcome Back Initiative, he is an associate professor of health education at San Francisco State.
The counterargument for making it easier for foreign physicians to practice in the United States -- aside from concerns about quality controls -- is that doing so will draw more physicians from poor countries. These places often have paid for their doctors' medical training with public funds, on the assumption that those doctors will stay.
''We need to wean ourselves from our extraordinary dependence on importing doctors from the developing world,'' said Fitzhugh Mullan, a professor of medicine and health policy at George Washington University in Washington. ''We can't tell other countries to nail their doctors' feet to the ground at home. People will want to move and they should be able to. But we have created a huge, wide, open market by undertraining here, and the developing world responds.''
About one in 10 doctors trained in India have left that country, he found in a 2005 study, and the figure is close to one in three for Ghana. (Many of those moved to Europe or other developed nations other than the United States.)
No one knows exactly how many immigrant doctors are in the United States and not practicing, but some other data points provide a clue. Each year the Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates, a private nonprofit, clears about 8,000 immigrant doctors (not including the American citizens who go to medical school abroad) to apply for the national residency match system. Normally about 3,000 of them successfully match to a residency slot, mostly filling less desired residencies in community hospitals, unpopular locations and in less lucrative specialties like primary care.
Over the last five years, an average of 42.1 percent of foreign-trained immigrant physicians who applied for residencies through the national match system succeeded. That compares with an average match rate of 93.9 percent for seniors at America's mainstream medical schools.
Mr. Abeyawickrama, the Sri Lankan anesthesiologist, has failed to match for three years in a row; he blames low test scores. Most foreign doctors spend several years studying and taking their licensing exams, which American-trained doctors also take. He said he didn't know this, and misguidedly thought it would be more expeditious to take all three within seven months of his arrival.
''That was the most foolish thing I ever did in my life,'' he says. ''I had the knowledge, but I did not know the art of the exams here.''
Even with inadequate preparation, he passed, though earning scores too low to be considered by most residency programs. But as a testament to his talents, he was recently offered a two-year research fellowship at the prestigious Cleveland Clinic, starting in the fall. He is hoping this job will give residency programs reason to overlook his test scores next time he applies.
''Once I finish my fellowship in Cleveland, at one of the best hospitals in America, I hope there will be some doors opening for me,'' he said. ''Maybe then they will look at my scores and realize they do not depict my true knowledge.''
The residency match rate for immigrants is likely to fall even lower in coming years. That is because the number of accredited American medical schools, and therefore United States-trained medical students, has increased substantially in the last decade, while the number of residency slots (most of which are subsizided by Medicare) has barely budged since Congress effectively froze residency funding in 1997.
Experts say several things could be done to make it easier for foreign-trained doctors to practice here, including reciprocal licensing arrangements, more and perhaps accelerated American residencies, or recognition of postgraduate training from other advanced countries.
Canada provides the most telling comparison. Some Canadian provinces allow immigrant doctors to practice family medicine without doing a Canadian residency, typically if the doctor did similar postgraduate work in the United States, Australia, Britain or Ireland. There are also residency waivers for some specialists coming from select training programs abroad considered similar to Canadian ones.
As a result, many (some estimates suggest nearly half) foreign-trained physicians currently coming into Canada do not have to redo a residency, said Dr. Rocco Gerace, the president of the Federation of Medical Regulatory Authorities of Canada.
In the United States, some foreign doctors work as waiters or taxi drivers while they try to work through the licensing process. Others decide to apply their skills to becoming another kind of medical professional, like a nurse practitioner or physician assistant, adopting careers that require fewer years of training. But those paths present barriers as well.
The same is true for other highly skilled medical professionals.
Hemamani Karuppiaharjunan, 40, was a dentist in her native India, which she left in 2000 to join her husband in the United States. She decided that going back to dentistry school in the United States while having two young children would be prohibitively time-consuming and expensive. Instead, she enrolled in a two-year dental hygiene program at Bergen Community College in Paramus, N.J., which cost her $30,000 instead of the $150,000 she would have needed to attend dental school. She graduated in 2012 at the top of her class and earns $42 an hour now, about half what she might make as a dentist in her area.
The loss of status has been harder.
''I rarely talk about it with patients,'' she said. When she does mention her background, they usually express sympathy. ''I'm glad my education is still respected in that sense, that people do recognize what I've done even though I can't practice dentistry.''

Already there are too few residencies to ease the country's doctor shortage. (Sources: Association of American Medical Colleges

HEADLINE: Police Put Off Dispersal of Pro-Morsi Sit-Ins

BYLINE: By DAVID D. KIRKPATRICK; Kareem Fahim and Mayy El Sheikh contributed reporting.

 BODY:
CAIRO -- The Egyptian police appeared on Monday to have postponed once again their threat to begin choking off two Cairo sit-ins where tens of thousands have gathered to protest the ouster of President Mohamed Morsi, leaving in place a tense six-week-old standoff.
The new military-appointed government has promised for more than a week to use all necessary force to clear out the sit-ins, which were established by Mr. Morsi's Islamist allies in the Muslim Brotherhood upon his ouster on July 3. But so far, a combination of external pressure from Western powers and internal dissent from liberal cabinet ministers appears to have persuaded Gen. Abdul-Fattah el-Sisi, the officer who ordered the takeover, to hold off decisive action.
As the sun rose over the main sit-in site on Monday, a small group of Morsi supporters who had gathered by makeshift barricades breathed a sigh of relief, resting on a sandpile in bicycle helmets with a few crude clubs at the ready. 
Interior Ministry officials said on Sunday night that they would begin clearing out the sit-ins as early as dawn. Human rights advocates said that could lead to the loss of dozens of lives, in part, they say, because the Egyptian police are incapable of a gradual escalation -- especially if they meet any friction or resistance.
''If the Egyptian police managed to intervene using responsible, proportionate force, it would be the first time,'' said Karim Medhat Ennarah, a criminal justice researcher for the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights. ''I don't think they have the capacity to do that,'' he said, adding that the police killed at least 140 Morsi supporters in mass shootings at smaller demonstrations in the weeks since his ouster. ''I will be surprised if it did not start another round of lethal violence.''
Congressional leaders and Western diplomats have said a bloody crackdown will provoke a cutoff of the $1.3 billion in annual American military assistance to Egypt. Diplomats say it could also block a $4.8 billion loan package from the International Monetary Fund that the new government calls essential to turning around the economy.
Rights advocates also warn that the use of force could increase the chance that Mr. Morsi's Islamist supporters around the country would turn to violence in retaliation. The new government has detained many of his top allies on apparently politicized criminal charges, stirring Islamist fears of a return to the old police state.
Interior Ministry officials said Sunday that they would move in slowly, gradually surrounding the sit-ins to cut off any shipments of food and water. The officials said they would eventually block any entrance but leave one exit open so that demonstrators could leave at will.
After that, the ministry officials said, the police will gradually step up the use of nonlethal tactics, including tear gas and water cannons. But it was unclear whether the police intended to escalate their pressure over a matter of hours, days or weeks.
How the police would handle resistance was another question, especially with both sides on edge after the recent deadly clashes. The demonstrators have already erected barricades and stored piles of rocks to throw at attackers. Birdshot pellets and homemade handguns have become increasingly common at Egyptian street protests, including among Islamists. Government officials have accused the Islamists of stockpiling weapons, although both sit-ins appear to be overwhelmingly peaceful.
Brotherhood leaders said Sunday that their demonstrations would remain nonviolent even if the police moved in. Gehad el-Haddad, a Brotherhood spokesman, all but dared them to try. ''If they try to disperse the sit-ins by force, we will just create a new sit-in, or multiple sit-ins,'' he said. ''It is the people who make the sit-ins, not the sit-ins that make the cause.''
For weeks, Mohamed ElBaradei, the interim vice president and Nobel Prize-winning former diplomat -- along with a few colleagues, including Ziad Bahaa el-Din, the interim deputy prime minister -- had led a push for a patient, less-violent approach to the sit-ins, say human rights advocates and Western diplomats who have worked with the new cabinet. Mr. ElBaradei had urged the new government to seek a political reconciliation with Mr. Morsi's Islamist backers, the victors in Egypt's first free elections, that might convince them to participate in a renewed democratic process despite the military takeover.
General Sisi, the central power behind the government, appears to have been persuaded by the arguments for a measured response to the sit-ins, the rights advocates and diplomats said. Among other things, they said, General Sisi may have worried about a possible resignation by Mr. ElBaradei, who has used his international reputation to try to convince the West that Mr. Morsi's ouster can be a step toward a more inclusive democracy.
But other factions of the government, including the powerful general and military intelligence services, advocated swift and forceful action, the diplomats and rights advocates said. And the tensions within the government had increasingly spilled out into reports by the state-run news organizations and private outlets close to the security services.
Mr. ElBaradei is ''dangerous to the people and the state,'' a headline in a state-run newspaper recently declared. He is working for the Islamists to ''thwart the revolution,'' encouraging their ''sabotaging'' and destructive inclusion in politics, charged a columnist in the state-run newspaper Al Akhbar, laying out an attack still echoing through the privately owned news media as well.
In a Twitter message on Sunday afternoon, he fired back at the news media attacks, calling them ''desperate attempts to sustain tyranny.'' He declined a request to comment.
Brotherhood officials have indicated a willingness to negotiate compromises that could include Mr. Morsi's swift replacement and a handover of power to others. But Amr Darrag, a Brotherhood leader involved in talks with Western diplomats, insisted that as a starting point, Mr. Morsi, who has been detained in an undisclosed location since his ouster, should be released and reinstated at least temporarily, to give the handover legal legitimacy. Western diplomats said the release of imprisoned Brotherhood leaders could also reassure the Islamists of fair treatment in the future.
But officials of the interim government say that Mr. Morsi can never be reinstated, not even for a moment, and that his detention or release is now a matter for the courts to decide. Mr. Morsi is under investigation over crimes related to his escape from political imprisonment during the revolution that ended the rule of President Hosni Mubarak in 2011, including allegations that Mr. Morsi conspired with the Palestinian militant group Hamas in the jailbreak -- charges Mr. Darrag called ''a bad joke.''
Nabil Fahmy, the interim foreign minister, acknowledged the differences between Mr. ElBaradei and others, contending that the Islamists were using the negotiations as a ''tool.'' But in an interview on Sunday, Mr. Fahmy said government leaders were unanimous in their belief that ''this cannot continue indefinitely.''
''We are taking every step to resolve this through the powers of persuasion rather than the enforcement of the laws,'' he said. ''But this cannot go on endlessly, because the government needs to move on.''

HEADLINE: Republicans and Democrats Both Miscalculated

BYLINE: By R. GLENN HUBBARD and TIM KANE. 
R. Glenn Hubbard, dean of the Columbia Business School, was a chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers under President George W. Bush. Tim Kane is the chief economist of the Hudson Institute. They are the authors of ''Balance: The Economics of Great Powers From Ancient Rome to Modern America.''

 BODY:
TWO years ago, Adm. Mike Mullen, at the time the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said that debt was the ''single biggest threat to our national security'' -- not some rogue nation, or terrorist group, but debt. What makes the threat of exploding debt especially dangerous is that it's not like a faucet that can be easily turned down. Federal, state and city governments in the United States have lost their fiscal grip, and the saga of Detroit's bankruptcy is just one example.
Astonishingly, when the Congressional Budget Office recently lowered its forecast of future deficits, many voices on the left claimed that the problem had been overblown by ''austerity scaremongers'' (that's us). Even more astonishingly, some voices on the right have renewed calls to ''starve the beast'' now that deficits are supposedly under control.
Both responses are wrong, but for different reasons. 
First, ''the deficit is now under control'' fallacy. The C.B.O. did indeed say that the average federal budget deficit would be $62 billion lower per year than was predicted before. That sounds good, but it lacks context. The C.B.O. still anticipates a 2015 deficit of $378 billion. And Uncle Sam is heading -- and this is the best-case scenario -- toward nearly a trillion dollars of red ink every year after 2023. In an effort to alert Congress to the danger, the C.B.O. also publishes a more realistic alternative fiscal scenario that anticipates how much will actually be spent by the Treasury in the coming decade. The realistic scenario predicts $1.76 trillion more in debt than the old baseline. For anyone willing to question authority, it gets worse. Both official scenarios naïvely assume a return to old norms of full employment, robust growth and moderate interest rates. How many unfulfilled summers of recovery will pass before policy makers will adjust that rosy outlook?
The still larger problem lies with Republicans who refuse to face facts. ''Starve the beast'' has been the mantra of conservatives since Ronald Reagan was president, a belief that, if taxes were low enough for long enough, rational Democrats would have no choice but to agree to bring federal spending down as well. Even though total federal revenue held level at around 18 percent of gross domestic product in recent decades, spending soared. When Reagan was sworn into office, gross federal debt equaled 32.5 percent of G.D.P. Under President Obama's leadership, it has risen above 100 percent.
We are stuck in a bad and worsening place: sure, deficits strike fear in the hearts of economists and intellectuals, but they don't matter at the ballot box. Jobs matter. Growth rates matter. Wars matter. Deficits? Yawn.
This outcome wasn't what conservative experts predicted. Alan Greenspan trusted in 1978 that there was ''a political limit to deficit spending.'' In the presidential debates of 1980, Reagan said that tax cuts would act like cutting the allowance of spendthrift children (in Congress). Scholars like Milton Friedman and Robert Barro voiced support for starving the beast. But William A. Niskanen, a Reagan administration economist and former chairman of the libertarian Cato Institute, studied the effect of starving the beast at the end of his career and concluded that it was impotent. Mr. Niskanen's finding was that fiscal deficits led to higher, not lower, federal outlays.
Deficits create a ''fiscal illusion'' that public goods and transfer payments are less expensive than they are. Once politicians learned that voters were tolerant of deficits of millions of dollars, they responded with deficits of billions of dollars, and now a trillion-dollar deficit.
Let's admit it, then. Conservatives were wrong -- not in beliefs that higher marginal tax rates harm growth, not that debt is dangerous, but about strategy. The beast was not starved.
The name of the game, as many younger senators and House members have realized, is spending control. Congress has tried internal reforms before -- Gramm-Rudman-Hollings in 1985, Paygo in the 1990s -- but they did not last. If we are to restore economic sobriety and intergenerational fairness to the budget, a more binding solution may be needed.
Starting with loosely binding ropes, Congress should modify the budget treatment of entitlement programs. The federal government continues to analyze Social Security and Medicare through the lens of cash accounting: counting up the costs of new long-term obligations not in the year the obligation is made, but off in the distant future when they must be paid. Private firms must accumulate funds to meet their pension obligations, why not Uncle Sam? This kind of rule in Detroit would have saved the city, and its workers, from the mess they're in today. Changes in the accrued liabilities of Social Security and Medicare, in particular, should be assessed on the federal budget each year. That change would force elected officials to make the tough choices now -- raising taxes, cutting other spending or reforming entitlements -- instead of punting to tomorrow.
But tighter ropes may be needed. Perhaps a 28th Amendment to the Constitution requiring a balanced budget. While this idea may appear radical, it is favored by about 70 percent of Americans.
The amendment may be forced on Congress, given that 32 states have petitioned for its adoption since 1975, two states shy of the constitutional trigger.
In 1982, 1995 and 2011, some version of balanced-budget legislation passed one but not both chambers of Congress. Those early amendment drafts had many critics, both Democratic and Republican, and many of their criticisms were valid. Successive versions became more of a small-government litmus test than a solution. Let's fix that.
If our goal is to ''balance'' instead of just ''starve'' the federal beast, the amendment will trust voters to choose the amount of government it wants so long as the sticker price is honest, and there will be as many Democratic senators on board as Republicans. Here are three practical modifications that Congress should consider in a new balanced budget amendment.
First, because reconciling expenditures and revenues would be impossible in real time, the constraint should be on expenditures only. A good rule would be this: Congress shall spend no more in the current year than it collected, on average, over the previous seven years. No more overspending in fat years and no draconian cuts to expenditures during future recessions.
Second, any amendment should be simple, focused only on fiscal balance. The best mix of tax and expenditure changes is for each generation of voters to decide.
Third, there should be an exception to the spending constraint for national emergencies.
America's high and rising national debt threatens our economic health through higher future taxes, crowding out important government services, or both. The best antidote is a focus on economic growth and a balanced approach to deficit control.
It is time to ''balance the beast.''

HEADLINE: Would-Be Doctors Head to Eastern Europe

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER F. SCHUETZE

 BODY:
BUDAPEST -- When a first-year medical student from the United States left his skateboard by the entrance of a 19th-century lecture hall here, Professor Andrea Dorottya Szekely swiftly picked it up and reprimanded its young owner.
''We do things differently here,'' Dr. Szekely said of Semmelweis University, a 244-year-old institution in Budapest that focuses on the medical and health sciences. Students are expected to stand at attention in classrooms until a bell rings and their professors enter, for example.
Despite having to bridge such cultural gaps at times, an increasing number of foreign students are heading to Eastern Europe for medical, dental or pharmaceutical studies. Though it still hosts far fewer international students than Western Europe does, the region appears to be attracting growing interest. 
The number of foreign university students in Hungary rose 21 percent from 2005 to 2011 -- to 16,465 from 13,601 -- according to the Unesco Institute for Statistics, which defines a foreign university student as one who had not previously earned a secondary degree in the country. In Poland, there was an 80 percent increase in the number of foreign students from 2005 to 2010, the latest year for which figures are available. The Czech Republic reported a doubling of foreign students from 2005 to 2011, while Slovakia saw a more than fivefold increase in its foreign student population, according to Unesco.
Many of the foreign students who choose the region do so to study medicine or other health care disciplines. In 2010, the fields of ''health and welfare'' accounted for 30 percent of foreign student enrollment in Poland, according to a study by the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. In Slovakia, 45 percent of foreign students were studying health subjects, while in Poland foreigners made up 15 percent of students in those classes, according to the O.E.C.D. study. In comparison, in countries like Germany, Sweden and Canada, where the competition for spots in medical school is especially intense, 6 to 9 percent of students pursuing those degrees are foreigners, according to that study.
In Hungary, where four universities offer medical and dental programs in English, 42 percent of international students are studying in health-related fields, according to the O.E.C.D.
There are various reasons for the shift, including the growing reputation of degrees from Eastern European universities that teach courses in English. But other factors also come into play, particularly the facts that tuition at these institutions is not as expensive as at top Western schools and that they are not as difficult to get into.
''When I first got here, demand was not that high,'' said Tomer Portnoy, a New Yorker who finished his final year of medical studies in the spring at Semmelweis. ''It was easier to get in.''
At Semmelweis, foreign medical students pay less than $20,000 a year in tuition, and students from European Union countries can often get scholarships or student loans. At Charles University, which is in Prague and also offers an English-language medical program, annual tuition is capped at &#x20ac;14,100, or $18,600. Dentistry programs tend to be slightly more expensive because of the cost of materials like fillings and molds in training.
For Europeans, who typically have access to medical schools in their home countries for almost no charge, such fees can seem high. But the costs are comparatively affordable for students from the United States, where even in-state tuition at public universities can exceed $30,000 a year.
Doctors, dentists and pharmacists with degrees from accredited universities in Eastern Europe may practice almost anywhere within the European Union. Semmelweis's medical students generally do their sixth-year rotations in hospitals around Europe, often in the country in which they hope to work later.
Sarah Moslehi, who moved to Budapest from Goteborg, Sweden, to study medicine, compares the fluidity of E.U. borders to those between the U.S. states. ''Basically, Europe is now like a huge United States,'' she said. ''You can just study somewhere and then move somewhere else.''
Graduates who wish to practice in the United States, however, must pass the U.S. Medical Licensing Examinations. Similar requirements for local certification exist in many other countries, including Canada, India and Israel.
To draw students from outside Hungary, Semmelweis started teaching classes in German in the early 1980s. It began teaching in English later that decade, during the political opening up of Eastern Europe. For the academic year that starts this September, the university has accepted 380 foreign students in its English-language medicine, dentistry and pharmacy programs. Of its 12,719 enrolled students, 1,910 take coursework in English and 911 in German.
Semmelweis has clearly benefited from having a more multicultural campus, according to students and professors, but international students also provide real financial advantages, bringing fees that Hungarians, who study free or nearly so, do not.
Despite the foreign culture, curriculum and language, international students at the university seem to value their time in Budapest.
''It's great to study with people from everywhere,'' said Charlie Attariani, a Swede who completed a dentistry degree at Semmelweis this year.
Semmelweis is the only Budapest university that teaches medicine and dentistry in English and German, but other prestigious universities around Hungary -- the University of Szeged, the University of Pecs and the University of Debrecen -- also offer such courses in English.
Charles University, in Prague, has a strong reputation among medical students looking toward Eastern Europe, and the Iuliu Hatieganu University of Medicine and Pharmacy, in Cluj-Napoca, Romania, is also attracting an increasing number of would-be doctors, pharmacists and dentists.
Semmelweis's programs have drawn students from Germany, Norway and Sweden, where limited spots in medical schools have made the application process extremely competitive, as well as from Middle Eastern countries including Iran and Israel.
One of the biggest advantages to studying in Hungary is its Old World approach to medical education, students say. In addition to a strong focus on etiquette -- students are required to wear suits when taking exams, for example -- rank and rote memorization, medical students in the country are in contact with patients at an earlier stage of their studies than many of their peers and have more hands-on practice in disciplines like pathology and anatomy.
''Maybe in Sweden and Scandinavia they have the technology, but experience-wise, we've seen a lot more,'' said Dr. Attariani, the recent dentistry graduate.
For example, first-year dentistry and medicine students in Hungary spend countless hours studying at an anatomy museum in the Anatomy, Histology and Embryology Building, which has mahogany-and-glass cabinets holding jars with body parts, organs and embryos preserved in formaldehyde. After their second year, medical students typically have greater access to human cadavers than their counterparts in Western Europe do. Groups of eight students share a single cadaver for an autopsy, roughly once every two weeks, said Ms. Moslehi, who has just finished her fifth year at Semmelweis. ''I would never see this in Sweden,'' she said.
The Old World pedagogy can also be seen in degree structure and the curriculums. Dentistry students, for example, spend the first two years of their studies with the students of medicine, giving them a broader foundation and, eventually, a Doctor of Dental Medicine degree rather than the Doctor of Dental Surgery degree that is more common in Western schools.
''We teach in a different way,'' said Dr. Szekely, a Hungarian who leads classes in English as well as in German.
But while the path to the degree may be different, she said, the outcome is the same. ''There's just one goal here,'' she said. ''They want to be doctors.''

HEADLINE: More Opportunities for the More Unpopular Party

BYLINE: By ALBERT R. HUNT | BLOOMBERG VIEW

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- As hundreds of U.S. lawmakers fan out to their home districts this month, there is a genuine political conundrum.
Approval ratings for Congress are at an all-time low, rivaling those of junkyard dogs. Republicans are seen as the main villains; the party's standing with the public keeps falling.
So what's the outlook today for next year's congressional elections? Republicans will hold the U.S. House of Representatives, conceivably even adding to their 233-200 majority. They seem certain to pick up U.S. Senate seats, with an outside chance to gain the half-dozen needed for control. 
There are many explanations: the voter profile of the off-year electorate; the way House districts are drawn; the fact that most of the competitive 2014 Senate races do not favor Democrats; and deteriorating enthusiasm for President Barack Obama.
Events could change those prospects. Republicans may overplay their hand by shutting down the government in a budget dispute this autumn or by undermining the United States' good faith and credit by refusing to raise the debt ceiling. They overreached in 1998 with the planned impeachment of President Bill Clinton and ended up losing seats.
The Republican pollster David Winston foresees a good Republican year but warns it is far from assured: ''There is an opportunity, not an outcome,'' he says. ''Voters aren't looking for an opposition party; they are looking for an alternative.''
To date, on issues like Mr. Obama's health care measure -- which House Republicans have voted to repeal or defund 40 times -- they are short on alternatives. Still, Mr. Winston and others agree with the assessment of David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for The Cook Political Report, that the Republicans have a ''built-in midterm turnout advantage.''
Compare, as Mr. Wasserman does, the compositions of the electorate in 2010, a banner year for Republicans, and in 2012, when Mr. Obama and Democrats did well. Last year, almost one in five voters were under the age of 30; two years earlier, this age group made up 12 percent of the electorate. The reverse is true of those over 65: One in six presidential-year voters were senior citizens; in 2010, it was 21 percent.
That makes a huge difference because more than half of young voters vote Democratic these days, and, with a few exceptions, similar percentages of senior citizens prefer Republicans. Older voters, Mr. Wasserman notes, ''are less transient, have grown deeper roots in their local communities and pay much more attention to nonpresidential years.'' A similar pattern when it comes to race and religion helps Republicans in off-year contests. The electorate is more white, more evangelical Christian, and less black and Hispanic.
Redistricting, which Republicans dominated after the last election, gives an advantage to start, as Democrats tend to congregate more heavily in fewer districts.
As a result, though Democrats won the overall popular vote for the House in 2012, they ended up 17 members shy of the majority. To pick up that many seats, according to Mark Gersh, long the party's foremost analyst on House elections, they might have to win the popular vote by as much as three to four percentage points next year.
There are some heavily populated Democratic states where seats are in play. Democrats, however, scored major gains last time in those states, like New York and Illinois, picking off the low-hanging fruit.
The Senate is not affected by redistricting, but this year, the draw is bad for Democrats. After New Jersey's special election in October, which the Democrat Cory Booker is favored to win, 20 of the 34 seats that will be up next year are currently held by Democrats. Moreover, almost all the most competitive contests are in Republican-dominated, states: Arkansas, Louisiana, West Virginia, South Dakota, Alaska and Montana -- states that went decisively last year for the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney.
The two Republican-held Senate seats that afford Democrats the best chance for a pickup also are in Republican-leaning states. In Georgia, the incumbent Republican is retiring, and Michelle Nunn, the daughter of a popular Democrat, former Senator Sam Nunn, is running. It is not improbable that a far-right Republican congressman will emerge from the crowded primary field. There is also Kentucky, where Mitch McConnell, the Senate minority leader, faces a Tea Party challenge from the right and would most likely face the state's Democratic secretary of state in the general election. Even in the most favorable circumstances, Kentucky is a tough slog; Mr. Obama lost the state by 23 points.
Two Democratic Senate leaders, Harry Reid of Nevada and Charles E. Schumer of New York, outsmarted themselves in one race, South Dakota, pressuring Brendan Johnson, a U.S. attorney and son of the retiring incumbent senator, Tim Johnson, not to run in order to clear the way for former Representative Stephanie Herseth Sandlin. She did not run, nor did Mr. Johnson, whom top South Dakota Democrats believe would have been the stronger candidate. Now, Republicans are heavy favorites to win that seat.
Adding to the head winds is a malaise among core Democrats. The number of people who think the country is on the wrong track is growing, as are negative attitudes about the economy. Although the president is much more popular than Republicans, his job-approval rating -- in the mid-40 percent range -- is the lowest for any second-term president at this juncture since Richard Nixon. That makes it hard to gin up a base next year.
''Democrats are better off only in comparison to Republicans,'' said Frederick S. Yang, a Democratic pollster.
Whatever the outcome next year, Mr. Yang said, Republicans should remember that their problems are more deep-seated: ''They may win some battles; they're losing the war.''

HEADLINE: With I.P.O.'s On the Rise, Analysts Get New Scrutiny

BYLINE: By PETER LATTMAN and SUSANNE CRAIG

 BODY:
The market for initial public offerings has made a comeback, surging to levels not seen since before the financial crisis. At the same time, concerns have resurfaced over the role of Wall Street research analysts in these lucrative deals.
For years, stock analysts have been barred from pitching I.P.O. business, a big moneymaker for firms like Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan Chase and Citigroup. Banking fees from helping companies list their shares on stock exchanges have topped $1.7 billion in the United States so far this year.
The country's largest banks agreed to bar their analysts from I.P.O. solicitations a decade ago after regulators, led by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, uncovered evidence that during the Internet boom some analysts issued overly optimistic reports about dot-com start-ups to help their colleagues on the investment banking side win underwriting assignments.
But some analysts say Wall Street is slipping back into its old ways. 
Today, companies routinely interview analysts when selecting bankers to underwrite their I.P.O.'s. During these meetings, the analysts say, they increasingly feel pressure to say the right things to curry favor with a company's management and owners. They also see themselves as participating in their banks' efforts to win business, a potential breach of government regulations.
The enforcement department of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Wall Street's self-regulatory body, has sent an inquiry asking several firms for information on the issue, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity.
''The walls between research and banking can still be porous,'' said Jay R. Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida who studies the I.P.O. market. ''It doesn't surprise me that there has perhaps been some backsliding.''
Representatives for Goldman and JPMorgan declined to comment. A spokeswoman for Citigroup said that its research department acts independently of its banking unit.
The banks say that their analysts are supposed to discuss only broad industry trends at these meetings and not pitch the bank's underwriting services. If asked about specific views on a company, like earnings models or potential I.P.O. pricing, they are supposed to refer those questions to bankers.
Interviewing analysts as part of the process of going public has become more prevalent, several analysts said, with the proliferation of so-called I.P.O. advisers, firms that advise companies in the early stages of an offering. These firms are paid to help companies and, often, their private equity owners screen banks vying to take companies public. Among other things, they arrange for meetings between companies and the Wall Street analysts and bankers.
''If you are going to see the people who are screening the underwriters you are there for one purpose, to win banking business,'' said another Wall Street analyst, who also requested anonymity because his company prohibits employees from speaking to the media without prior approval. This analyst said he knew of the practice but had not taken part in any meetings.
Participants say company meetings with the analysts and bankers are held separately, but can happen within hours of each other, and banks rarely send compliance officers to monitor the discussions. Analysts say that when private equity executives are involved, the sessions can turn especially uncomfortable, veering into questions about a company's valuation.
Solebury Capital, Rothschild and Lazard are among the leading firms in this area. Solebury has recently guided a number of companies through the I.P.O. process, including the discount retailer Five Below; Bloomin' Brands, which owns Outback Steakhouse and Bonefish Grill; and HD Supply Holdings, according to regulatory filings.
In an interview, Solebury's co-chief executives, Alan Sheriff and Ted Hatfield, said that their corporate clients meet with analysts as well as bankers as they work through the offering process, but that the meetings with analysts are ''informational,'' regarding general market trends.
''Pitching investment banking in analyst meetings is strictly off limits,'' Mr. Sheriff said.
A senior research executive at one major Wall Street firm says he thinks it is acceptable for an analyst to have a broad chat with a company looking to go public, and the analyst can benefit from that meeting by learning more about the industry. But he expressed concern about meetings with companies in the process of choosing banks to underwrite their I.P.O.'s.
''I am not O.K. with a third party organizing a beauty contest with the express purpose of winning banking business,'' said the executive, whose firm has a policy against speaking to the media. ''The problem is, the analyst going to the meeting knows the purpose and couldn't help but feel pressured. You are selling your bank.''
Investors both large and small often rely on the recommendations of analysts, who issue buy and sell recommendations on stocks. Questions about the legitimacy of Wall Street research came into focus during the height of the Internet and telecommunications bubble. During that heady time, analysts worked closely with banking colleagues to secure profitable I.P.O. assignments from fast-growing tech companies.
Mr. Spitzer, as attorney general, spearheaded an investigation that helped solidify his reputation at the time as the ''sheriff of Wall Street.'' He released incriminating e-mails that showed analysts privately disparaged the very companies they were publicly telling investors to buy. They also showed how influential investment bankers were in securing positive research reports for companies that were either clients of a firm or prospective customers.
In one e-mail, an investor asked Henry Blodget, then a Merrill Lynch analyst, what was so interesting about GoTo.com, an Internet company he was recommending, except for the banking fees that it generated.
''Nothing,'' Mr. Blodget replied.
In another e-mail message, Mr. Blodget called InfoSpace, an Internet company that he favored publicly, ''a piece of junk.''
Federal regulators barred Mr. Blodget, who now runs Business Insider, a business news Web site, and Jack B. Grubman, another prominent analyst who worked at Salomon Smith Barney, from the securities industry.
In 2003, 10 Wall Street banks agreed to pay a collective $1.4 billion to resolve the government's accusations. As part of the settlement, the firms agreed to separate their banking and research departments, a move that regulators said would ensure that analysts operated more autonomously.
Analysts were also expressly ''prohibited from participating in efforts to solicit investment banking business,'' including pitches and road shows. Over the years, that language has been incorporated into rules policed by Finra, the regulator.
There are exceptions. A federal law backed by the banking industry and passed last year, the Jump-Start Our Business Start-Ups Act, watered down the rule. The law, known as the JOBS Act, allows analysts to attend an investment banking pitch in connection with the I.P.O. of an emerging growth company, defined as a firm with less than $1 billion in revenue. Still, Finra's rules say, ''a research analyst may not engage in otherwise prohibited conduct in such meetings, including efforts to solicit investment banking business.''
Questions about whether that rule is being flouted come as the market for initial public offerings is heating up. This year, 122 I.P.O.'s have come to market, raising about $29 billion, an increase of 33 percent over the same period in 2012, according to Thomson Reuters.
A huge chunk of those I.P.O.'s are companies owned by private equity firms, which are looking to cash out their holdings in a buoyant market. The $12.6 billion in proceeds generated by private equity-backed initial public offerings this year has already surpassed the $10.4 billion worth of deals during all of 2012, Thomson Reuters said.
Several big private equity-owned companies are preparing to file I.P.O.'s in the coming months, like the hotelier Hilton Worldwide and the luxury retailer Neiman Marcus. Research analysts have participated in meetings related to the selection of underwriters on those deals.
After being told that analysts were playing a role in I.P.O. solicitations, Mr. Spitzer, now a candidate for New York City comptroller, expressed concern.''The structure sounds like a slightly too-clever way to circumvent the intent'' of the rule, he said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: American Is Moved to North Korea Hospital

BYLINE: By MICHAEL SCHWIRTZ

 BODY:
An American tour operator imprisoned in North Korea has been moved from a labor camp to a hospital in the capital, Pyongyang, as his health continues to deteriorate, his sister said Sunday. 
The American, Kenneth Bae, 45, had been imprisoned at the camp since May shortly after he was sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for what the North Korean authorities say were hostile acts against the government.
Since then, his heath has significantly declined, Mr. Bae's sister, Terri Chung, said by telephone. He has lost more than 50 pounds, has problems with his kidneys and liver and has a bad back, among other maladies, Ms. Chung said.
''He has a host of ailments,'' she said. ''Some of them have worsened considerably enough to warrant a hospital transfer.''
The State Department informed Mr. Bae's family on Friday that he had been moved to a hospital in the North Korean capital, Ms. Chung said.
It is not clear what Mr. Bae's hospitalization could mean for efforts to win his freedom. Though tensions with the United States remain high, North Korean officials have been looking for ways to open a dialogue.
In the past, North Korea has used American prisoners as bargaining chips with Washington, though North Korean officials have signaled that they would not do so in Mr. Bae's case.
Last month, Mr. Bae's family received letters from him for the first time since his imprisonment. In the letters, which were addressed to Mr. Bae's wife, mother, sister and others, he wrote that he was in poor health and asked that the United States government work to secure his release.
The letters, which bore a Pyongyang postmark, could not have been sent without North Korea's approval and were seen by some experts as a sign that the authorities were open to negotiations concerning Mr. Bae.
Ms. Chung said her family received another packet of letters last week saying much the same thing. She said she was not aware of ''all the ins and outs of the diplomatic efforts being made,'' but said that her brother had been visited by the Swedish ambassador in Pyongyang on Friday.
Mr. Bae, a Korean-American from Washington State, had been leading a group of businessmen from China on a tour of the special economic zone of Rason in northeastern North Korea when he was arrested in November.
North Korean officials accused Mr. Bae of being a Christian missionary who flouted the country's laws on proselytizing.
Mr. Bae's plight has generated broad sympathy in the United States. A petition on Change.org by Mr. Bae's son, Jonathan, calling for his father's release has received more than 10,000 signatures.
And Dennis Rodman, the former basketball player whose trip to Pyongyang last winter rankled American diplomats, vowed in May to use his new rapport with North Korean officials to win Mr. Bae's release.
In a videotaped interview from prison broadcast on CNN last month, Mr. Bae appeared gaunt and complained of ill health.
''Although my health is not good, I am being patient and coping well,'' Mr. Bae said. ''And I hope that with the help of the North Korean government and the United States, I will be released soon.''

HEADLINE: Spanish Station Draws Young Fans

BYLINE: By BEN SISARIO

 BODY:
On New York radio, the sound of success is a Latin dance mix and a Spanish-speaking D.J. excitedly sending listeners to his Instagram feed.
Last week, WSKQ-FM in New York, known as ''La Mega 97.9,'' celebrated a rare victory in the ratings. The station, which mixes tropical Latin music with some high-energy pop, beat English-language mainstays like Z100 (WHTZ, 100.3 FM) and Lite FM (WLTW, 106.7 FM) for the No. 1 share position among two key demographic groups: adults aged 18 to 34, and 18 to 49. In the 25-to-54 ranking, La Mega was second to Lite FM by just a tenth of a share. 
The overall audience for WSKQ is dwarfed by those of mainstream English-language stations in the greater New York metropolitan market, which is 23 percent Hispanic, according to the tracking company Arbitron. In Arbitron's July ratings, La Mega averaged almost 2.6 million listeners a week, putting it at No. 10; Lite FM, owned by Clear Channel Communications, was No. 1 with 5.2 million.
But younger demographics are those most prized by advertisers, and La Mega, which is owned by Spanish Broadcasting System, won its high share rating -- a measurement of a station's command of overall listening time -- because its listeners keep the station on for longer periods of time than the listeners on other stations. Aided by high ''time spent listening'' statistics, La Mega's share among the 18-to-34 group has nearly doubled since January, going to 9.2, from 4.7.
To accomplish this, the station plays music beyond the traditional salsa and merengue, with Dominican bachata and the hip-hop-influenced rhythms of reggaeton. On its midday show, the host Alex Sensation mixes pieces of Latin, electronic and pop hits in quick succession like a club D.J., singing along and calling out his various social media accounts.
''We have connected to the audience in an emotional way,'' said Jesus Salas, the executive vice president for programming at Spanish Broadcasting System, or SBS, which operates 20 stations in the United States.
Like other radio stations -- in any language -- La Mega has used its on-air personalities and local presence to stand out in the age of Pandora and YouTube. Bill Tanner, a radio consultant and former SBS executive, said that La Mega also benefited from the fact that the Hispanic audience had kept a much closer connection to radio than other groups.
''Hispanics listen to the radio much more than English-language listeners do,'' he said. ''If they are longer listeners, as Hispanics are, and if the station does a nice job with programming, which WSKQ does, then you have the formula for success.''
Last year, WSKQ had $22.4 million in advertising revenue, making it No. 11 in the market, according to the media research firm BIA/Kelsey. Minority stations have often complained their ad rates are lower than those for white-owned stations with lower ratings, but Mark Fratrik, BIA/Kelsey's chief economist, said that was slowly changing.
''As the Hispanic population grows, advertisers have increasingly recognized how important it is to reach those markets,'' he said.

HEADLINE: Chinese Foot-Dragging

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
If there is ever going to be an end to tensions over the South China Sea, one of the world's most strategically important waterways, countries in the region need to find a way to work out their volatile maritime disputes. China, more than any other nation, has fanned those hostilities with sweeping sovereignty claims and confrontations over disputed islands and even specks of rock. 
Last week, Foreign Minister Wang Yi said China would be happy to discuss a code of conduct to help nations peacefully address competing claims, while suggesting that China was in no hurry to have this happen. In other words, to let the conflicts fester.
The 10-member Association of Southeast Asian Nations will discuss this topic next month. The overlapping claims are complicated, but China's foot-dragging allows it to play for time and sow divisions among the smaller countries. The South China Sea has been contested for centuries. And while Vietnam, the Philippines, Japan, South Korea and Malaysia bear some responsibility for ratcheting up frictions, China's assertive use of its navy and commercial vessels (on top of its economic power) has worried many of its smaller neighbors.
The danger is that any miscalculation could spark a conflict. In addition to being a vital trade route, the South China Sea and the East China Sea are believed to be rich in oil, natural gas, fishing and mineral resources. China has asserted ''indisputable sovereignty'' over much of the maritime territory and has cut cables on survey ships working for Vietnam. There have been standoffs between Chinese and Philippine vessels, and with Japan as well.
A confrontational approach is unwise for a country that prizes stability and development and needs to focus on its serious domestic problems, including an increasingly troubled economy. Instead of feeding a resurgent nationalism with mischief-making, Beijing should be working with its neighbors to ease competing claims and to pursue joint development of natural resources.
The Obama administration, increasingly involved in Asia, has urged adoption of a code of conduct. The three officials who have visited the region since May -- Secretary of State John Kerry, Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel and Vice President Joseph Biden Jr. -- have said that such a code is in everyone's interest. Mr. Wang's comments suggest that the Americans have more convincing to do.

HEADLINE: Milton Friedman, Unperson

BYLINE: By PAUL KRUGMAN

 BODY:
Recently Senator Rand Paul, potential presidential candidate and self-proclaimed expert on monetary issues, sat down for an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. It didn't go too well. For example, Mr. Paul talked about America running ''a trillion-dollar deficit every year''; actually, the deficit is projected to be only $642 billion in 2013, and it's falling fast.
But the most interesting moment may have been when Mr. Paul was asked whom he would choose, ideally, to head the Federal Reserve and he suggested Milton Friedman -- ''he's not an Austrian, but he would be better than what we have.'' The interviewer then gently informed him that Friedman -- who would have been 101 years old if he were still alive -- is, in fact, dead. O.K., said Mr. Paul, ''Let's just go with dead, because then you probably really wouldn't have much of a functioning Federal Reserve.'' 
Which suggests an interesting question: What ever happened to Friedman's role as a free-market icon? The answer to that question says a lot about what has happened to modern conservatism.
For Friedman, who used to be the ultimate avatar of conservative economics, has essentially disappeared from right-wing discourse. Oh, he gets name-checked now and then -- but only for his political polemics, never for his monetary theories. Instead, Rand Paul turns to the ''Austrian'' view of thinkers like Friedrich Hayek -- a view Friedman once described as an ''atrophied and rigid caricature'' -- while Paul Ryan, the G.O.P.'s de facto intellectual leader, gets his monetary economics from Ayn Rand, or more precisely from fictional characters in ''Atlas Shrugged.''
How did that happen? Friedman, it turns out, was too nuanced and realist a figure for the modern right, which doesn't do nuance and rejects reality, which has a well-known liberal bias.
One way to think about Friedman is that he was the man who tried to save free-market ideology from itself, by offering an answer to the obvious question: ''If free markets are so great, how come we have depressions?''
Until he came along, the answer of most conservative economists was basically that depressions served a necessary function and should simply be endured. Hayek, for example, argued that ''we may perhaps prevent a crisis by checking expansion in time,'' but ''we can do nothing to get out of it before its natural end, once it has come.'' Such dismal answers drove many economists into the arms of John Maynard Keynes.
Friedman, however, gave a different answer. He was willing to give a little ground, and admit that government action was indeed necessary to prevent depressions. But the required government action, he insisted, was of a very narrow kind: all you needed was an appropriately active Federal Reserve. In particular, he argued that the Fed could have prevented the Great Depression -- with no need for new government programs -- if only it had acted to save failing banks and pumped enough reserves into the banking system to prevent a sharp decline in the money supply.
This was, as I said, a move toward realism (although it looks wrong in the light of recent experience). But realism has no place in today's Republican Party: both Mr. Paul and Mr. Ryan have furiously attacked Ben Bernanke for responding to the 2008 financial crisis by doing exactly what Friedman said the Fed should have done in the 1930s -- advice he repeated to the Bank of Japan in 2000. ''There is nothing more insidious that a country can do to its citizens,'' Mr. Ryan lectured Mr. Bernanke, ''than debase its currency.''
Oh, and while we're on the subject of debasing currencies: one of Friedman's most enduring pieces of straight economic analysis was his 1953 argument in favor of flexible exchange rates, in which he argued that countries finding themselves with excessively high wages and prices relative to their trading partners -- like the nations of southern Europe today -- would be better served by devaluing their currencies than by enduring years of high unemployment ''until the deflation has run its sorry course.'' Again, there's no room for that kind of pragmatism in a party in which many members hanker for a return to the gold standard.
Now, I don't want to put Friedman on a pedestal. In fact, I'd argue that the experience of the past 15 years, first in Japan and now across the Western world, shows that Keynes was right and Friedman was wrong about the ability of unaided monetary policy to fight depressions. The truth is that we need a more activist government than Friedman was willing to countenance.
The point, however, is that modern conservatism has moved so far to the right that it no longer has room for even small concessions to reality. Friedman tried to save free-market conservatism from itself -- but the ideologues who now dominate the G.O.P. are beyond saving.

HEADLINE: Dept. Of Justice Seeks To Curtail Stiff Drug Terms

BYLINE: By CHARLIE SAVAGE

 BODY:
WASHINGTON -- In a major shift in criminal justice policy, the Obama administration will move on Monday to ease overcrowding in federal prisons by ordering prosecutors to omit listing quantities of illegal substances in indictments for low-level drug cases, sidestepping federal laws that impose strict mandatory minimum sentences for drug-related offenses.
Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., in a speech at the American Bar Association's annual meeting in San Francisco on Monday, is expected to announce the new policy as one of several steps intended to curb soaring taxpayer spending on prisons and help correct what he regards as unfairness in the justice system, according to his prepared remarks.
Saying that ''too many Americans go to too many prisons for far too long and for no good law enforcement reason,'' Mr. Holder is planning to justify his policy push in both moral and economic terms. 
''Although incarceration has a role to play in our justice system, widespread incarceration at the federal, state and local levels is both ineffective and unsustainable,'' Mr. Holder's speech says. ''It imposes a significant economic burden -- totaling $80 billion in 2010 alone -- and it comes with human and moral costs that are impossible to calculate.''
Mr. Holder will also introduce a related set of Justice Department policies that would leave more crimes to state courts to handle, increase the use of drug-treatment programs as alternatives to incarceration, and expand a program of ''compassionate release'' for ''elderly inmates who did not commit violent crimes and have served significant portions of their sentences.''
The policy changes appear to be part of Mr. Holder's effort, before he eventually steps down, to bolster his image and legacy. Turmoil over the Congressional investigation into the botched Operation Fast and Furious gun trafficking case ensnared him in the Obama administration's first term, and more recently, controversy has flared over the department's aggressive tactics in leak investigations.
In recent weeks, he has also tightened rules on obtaining reporters' data in leak cases and started an effort to strengthen protections for minority voters after the Supreme Court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965. The move continued an assertive approach to voting rights and other civil rights enforcement throughout his tenure.
Mr. Holder's speech on Monday deplores the moral impact of the United States' high incarceration rate: although it has only 5 percent of the world's population, it has 25 percent of its prisoners, he notes. But he also attempts to pre-empt political controversy by painting his effort as following the lead of prison reform efforts in primarily conservative-led Southern states.
Under a policy memorandum being sent to all United States attorney offices on Monday, according to an administration official, prosecutors will be told that they may not write the specific quantity of drugs when drafting indictments for drug defendants who meet the following four criteria: their conduct did not involve violence, the use of a weapon or sales to minors; they are not leaders of a criminal organization; they have no significant ties to large-scale gangs or cartels; and they have no significant criminal history.
For example, in the case of a defendant accused of conspiring to sell five kilograms of cocaine -- an amount that would set off a 10-year mandatory minimum sentence -- the prosecutor would write that ''the defendant conspired to distribute cocaine'' without saying how much. The quantity would still factor in when prosecutors and judges consult sentencing guidelines, but depending on the circumstances, the result could be a sentence of less than the 10 years called for by the mandatory minimum law, the official said.
It is not clear whether current cases that have not yet been adjudicated would be recharged because of the new policy.
Amid a rise in crime rates a generation ago, state and federal lawmakers began passing a series of ''tough on crime'' laws, including mandatory minimum sentences for drug possession. But as crime rates have plummeted to 40-year lows and reduced the political potency of the fear of crime, fiscal pressures from the exploding cost of building and maintaining prisons have prompted states to find alternatives to incarceration.
Driven in part by a need to save money, several conservative-leaning states like Texas and Arkansas have experimented with finding ways to incarcerate fewer low-level drug offenders. The answers have included reducing prison terms for them or diverting them into treatment programs, releasing elderly or well-behaved inmates early, and expanding job training and re-entry programs.
The policy is seen as successful across the ideological divide. For example, in Texas, which was an early innovator, taxpayers have saved hundreds of millions of dollars on what had been projected as a need to build prison space. With crime rates remaining at generational lows, the space is no longer necessary.
Several years ago, a group called Right on Crime formed to push what it calls the ''conservative case for reform.'' Its Republican affiliates include Jeb Bush, a former Florida governor; Edwin R. Meese III, an attorney general during the Reagan administration; and Newt Gingrich, a former House speaker.
''While the federal prison system has continued to slowly expand, significant state-level reductions have led to three consecutive years of decline in America's overall prison population -- including, in 2012, the largest drop ever experienced in a single year,'' Mr. Holder's speech says. ''Clearly, these strategies can work. They've attracted overwhelming, bipartisan support in 'red states' as well as 'blue states.' And it's past time for others to take notice.''
Still, in states that have undertaken prison and parole overhauls, the changes were approved by state lawmakers. Mr. Holder's reform is different: instead of going through Congress for legislation to modify mandatory minimum sentencing laws, he is invoking his power of prosecutorial discretion to sidestep them.
Earlier in Mr. Obama's presidency, the administration went through Congress to achieve policy goals like reducing the sentencing disparity between crack and powder forms of cocaine. But it has increasingly pursued a strategy of invoking unilateral executive powers without Congress, which the White House sees as bogged down by Republican obstructionism.
Previous examples, like Mr. Obama's decision last year to issue an executive order allowing immigrants who came to the United States illegally as children to remain without fear of deportation and to work, have drawn fire from Republicans as ''power grabs'' that usurp the role of Congress.
Mr. Holder's speech marches through a litany of statistics about incarceration in the United States. The American population has grown by about a third since 1980, he said, but its prison rate has increased nearly 800 percent. At the federal level, more than 219,000 inmates are currently behind bars -- nearly half for drug-related crimes -- and the prisons are operating at nearly 40 percent above their official capacity.

HEADLINE: As Concerns Over Drugs Mount, the Jockey Club Says It Will Pay for Testing

BYLINE: By JOE DRAPE

 BODY:
SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. -- The Jockey Club, horse racing's most influential group, will pay up to $500,000 for out-of-competition drug testing over the next two years, and its chairman warned horsemen, regulators and racetracks that doping and cheating would decimate the sport's bottom line unless complete national reform began immediately.
The group released results of a poll it commissioned that showed drugs and integrity concerns loom larger to bettors than any other issue facing the sport. The poll found that when handicapping races at certain racetracks or in certain states, nearly four in five bettors -- 79 percent -- considered the possibility of illegal drug use. 
By a 9 to 1 margin, bettors said they bet less, not more, because they had to factor in the possibility of illegal drug use. In the study of 816 committed bettors and handicappers nationally, the strongest advocates for change were those who bet more than $10,000 per month: 89 percent ''strongly support'' national uniform medication rules; 93 percent want those rules sooner.
''It is critically important that strict, uniform rules be adopted immediately because of the commercial consequences,'' said Robert Green of Penn Schoen Berland, which conducted the poll from July 29 to Aug. 2. The margin of error for the study is plus or minus 3.5 percentage points.
Last year, a New York Times investigation showed how a pervasive drug culture put horses and riders at risk and found that 24 horses a week died at America's tracks, a rate greater than in countries where drug use was severely restricted.
Horse racing officials have taken significant steps to clean up their sport. Still, the Jockey Club chairman Ogden Mills Phipps said that unless the sport moved more quickly, it risked not only losing customers at an alarming rate, but also could invite federal intervention.
''We know that Congressional leaders are frustrated with the speed of our reforms, and that if we don't get our own house in order, they will do it for us,'' Phipps said, acknowledging that Congressional staff members attended the group's annual round table. ''The facts are clear: if we care about the future of our sport, our equine athletes cannot be burdened by the taint of drugs.''
The Horseracing Integrity and Safety Act -- written by Senator Tom Udall, Democrat of New Mexico, and Representative Joe Pitts, Republican of Pennsylvania -- has been introduced in Congress and would give the United States Anti-Doping Agency the authority to develop rules for permitted and prohibited substances.
Usada, a nongovernmental organization, is the official antidoping agency for the United States Olympic team and has worked with Major League Baseball and other professional leagues to eliminate performance-enhancing drugs. Its credibility as a vigilant watchdog was cemented when it was widely credited for its relentless pursuit of the cyclist Lance Armstrong, who this year admitted that he had systematically used drugs during his riding career.
Heidi Stirrup, a spokeswoman for Pitts, was in attendance and said Pitts had also written a bill that would repeal the Interstate Horse Racing Act of 1978, which allows simulcast wagering to take place across state lines and is the financial engine of the parimutuel industry. Last year, such wagering accounted for 90 percent of the $11.4 billion wagered on the sport in North America.
''There is an urgency to get something meaningful done, and there are some members willing to go back and start at square one,'' said Stirrup, who said Congressional hearings on the integrity and safety of horse racing were planned for the fall.
Eight mid-Atlantic states, including New York, have agreed to operate their racetracks under one set of rules restricting medications to treat illness and injury in racehorses to just 24. Those medications will be subject to strict limitations, and the laboratories conducting drug tests must be accredited under standards created by the Racing Medication and Testing Consortium, which conducts medication and drug-testing research for the industry.
California, Kentucky, Illinois and Arkansas are expected to adopt those measures by the first quarter of 2014, ensuring that 85 percent of the money bet in America is at racetracks operating under stricter, uniform rules. But 17 other states have not agreed to the new measures.
''The Jockey Club has stated in the past that it would support any means of achieving uniformity and reform,'' Phipps said. ''But the clock is ticking. If the current medication reform efforts stall, the Jockey Club may very well lend its hearty support to federal legislation.''
New York racing authorities have already enacted a series of rules -- among the most aggressive in the nation -- to restrict the use of legal drugs on horses and require trainers to disclose what treatments their horses have received. The rate of fatalities in 2013 is the lowest in five years -- 1.1 per 1,000 starts -- and well below the national average collected in the Jockey Club's Equine Injury Database of 1.92 per 1,000 starts, according to the New York State Gaming Commission.
Beyond providing the financing for the out-of-competition testing of horses participating in the sport's graded stakes races, the Jockey Club will build a national electronic database with a list of the drugs and treatments a horse receives, information that will be available to the public to encourage transparency.
The organization also called for regulators to target horses and horsemen who demonstrate suspicious patterns. The polling data showed strong support for a ''three strikes and you're out'' ban, longer suspensions and bigger fines for trainers.
Green said bettors pay close attention to the lax rules in various states and specific trainers whose horses suddenly improve in various jurisdictions.
''The big bettors are five times more likely to say they typically bet less rather than more, mostly because they either had to accept short odds on the 'juiced' horse, or lose the bet to a 'super trainer,' '' Green said. ''Drugs are directly damaging the economics.''

HEADLINE: Korean Brands Struggle to Gain Traction in Japan

BYLINE: By ERIC PFANNER

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Brandishing a new Sony Xperia as she left a mobile phone shop in a trendy part of Tokyo, Nisako Hanawa, a 17-year-old student, explained that she had chosen that brand ''because of its cool design and its good reputation.''
Asked about another leading smartphone maker, Samsung Electronics of South Korea, she and a friend exchanged quizzical looks. ''Samsung?'' Miss Hanawa asked. ''I haven't heard of it.'' 
Samsung Electronics may be the largest consumer electronics company in the world, selling one out of every three smartphones and one in five televisions. LG, the other giant electronics maker in Korea, has a significant share of TV and washing machine markets in Europe and the United States. But here in trend-obsessed Japan, consumers have not caught on that elsewhere in the world some Korean products are knocking Japanese rivals off the shelves.
Many Japanese explain away the absence of Korean brands by claiming the quality is inferior. ''South Korean products are still affected by a 'cheap and nasty' image, which remains prevalent among Japanese above a certain age,'' wrote Hidehiko Mukoyama, an economist at the Japan Research Institute, in a research paper about Japan-South Korea trade relations.
The evidence says otherwise. Korean-made TVs, phones, washers and cars rate higher than many Japanese brands in independent tests by Consumer Reports, CNet and others. LG TVs have been getting favorable reviews in Japan. A local magazine, HiVi, recently rated a 32-inch, high-definition, 3-D-capable LG set-top ahead of televisions in its category from Mitsubishi and Sharp.
The unfamiliarity is not because tariffs make Korean products costlier. Japan eliminated the import duty on many Korean electronics products, including TVs and smartphones.
But this last holdout is finally being cracked open. In 2008, LG stopped selling its televisions in Japan, but it reintroduced them two years later. Now many of the biggest electronics retailers in Japan, including the No. 1 player, Yamada Denki, and the second-biggest chain, Biccamera, sell LG TVs.
At a suburban Tokyo branch of Nojima, a major Japanese retail chain, LG televisions are displayed prominently alongside sets from domestic brands like Sony, Sharp, Panasonic and Toshiba.
Kohei Tomizawa, a sales clerk, said LG TVs were selling briskly, though not as well as those from Sony. LG sets ''tend to be more popular with younger people, and younger people don't buy as many televisions as older customers, who tend to prefer well-known Japanese brands, like Sony,'' Mr. Tomizawa said.
The quality myth may be less believable to a younger generation of consumers. With South Korean food and television shows popular in Japan, LG has latched on to the popularity of K-pop music across Asia and beyond. It has run ads for its smartphones in Japan that feature Kara, a Korean group that is popular in Japan.
''I think things have improved compared to the old days, thanks to the influence of Korean popular culture,'' said Byoung-Uk Lee, assistant director of the Korea Trade-Investment Promotion Agency in Japan.
LG said it sold about $675 million worth of TVs, smartphones, washing machines, vacuum cleaners and other goods in Japan last year, up about 45 percent from 2010.
Samsung also pulled out of Japan in 2007, after failing to make much of a dent here. (The biggest Korean carmaker, Hyundai Motor, also beat a retreat from Japan shortly thereafter.)
But Samsung has come back for a second shot in Japan, starting with its smartphones. NTT Docomo, the largest mobile phone carrier in Japan, has turned to Samsung to try to fend off rising competition from two rival network operators, SoftBank and KDDI.
Those two companies have been poaching customers from Docomo, which does not offer the popular iPhone. ''Docomo needs Samsung, and that is giving it an opening,'' said Michito Kimura, an analyst at IDC, a research firm.
Starting in May, Docomo plastered Japanese cities with advertising posters featuring the flagship Samsung Galaxy S4 smartphone alongside a Sony Xperia A. The campaign, for what Docomo bills as its ''summer collection,'' is the first time that any Japanese carrier has given such prominence to a Samsung phone.
So far, the results of Docomo's embrace of Samsung have been mixed. Analysts say Samsung smartphones have been a tougher sell in Japan than in other countries where consumers are familiar with the brand through the televisions and other goods.
Docomo said that under its summer promotion, it had sold 400,000 Galaxy S4 phones through mid-July, but that was less than half the total of Sony Xperia A handsets.
Apple dominates the Japanese smartphone business, holding a 40 percent market share in the first quarter, according to IDC. Sharp, with 15 percent, and Sony, with 13 percent, follow. Samsung has not cracked the top five vendor ranks.
Japanese and Korean news media have reported that Samsung is considering re-entering the Japanese television market. Samsung declined to comment.
To succeed in Japan, Samsung will have a lot of work to do changing a mind-set. But some analysts, like Sea-Jin Chang, the author of ''Sony vs. Samsung: The Inside Story of the Electronics Giants' Battle for Global Supremacy,'' are convinced that South Korean companies have a brighter future in Japan.
''Japanese customers favor domestic producers,'' said Mr. Chang, executive director of the Center for Governance, Institutions and Organization at National University of Singapore. ''No Korean or Western firms were good enough for them, except Apple. But you will find more Korean firms accepted in the Japanese mainstream in the future.''

HEADLINE: Economic Expansion Slows Down In Japan

BYLINE: By HIROKO TABUCHI

 BODY:
TOKYO -- Japan's economic growth slowed in the second quarter to an annualized rate of 2.6 percent, government data showed on Monday, clouding the outlook for the economic policies of Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and raising concerns that he may put off moves to tackle the country's enormous public debt. 
This was the third consecutive quarter of growth for Japan's roughly $5 trillion gross domestic product, the third-largest in the world after the United States and China. Still, the expansion fell short of analysts' expectations for Japan, whose economy grew at a robust pace of 3.8 percent in the previous quarter, helped by the Abe government's bold monetary and fiscal stimulus drive.
Economists polled by Reuters had expected Japan's economy to grow at a similarly healthy clip in the April-June quarter. But weak capital expenditure, reflecting continued caution among Japanese corporations over the country's long-term prospects, slowed growth, according to figures released by the Cabinet Office.
Compared with the previous quarter, the Japanese economy grew 0.6 percent in the latest quarter. Private consumption rose a better-than-expected 0.8 percent over the previous quarter, as a brightening mood in Japan pushed up spending on food, travel and luxury products. But capital expenditure fell by 0.1 percent, below a market forecast for a 0.7 percent increase.
Signs of slowing growth could strengthen the hand of critics of Mr. Abe's economic drive, which has relied heavily on monetary stimulus and government spending to revive growth in Japan's long-deflationary economy. Mr. Abe has promised to follow up with market deregulation and easing trade barriers to raise Japan's long-term growth potential.
Weaker growth could also derail Japan's plans to raise taxes and pare back its soaring debt, which reached 1 quadrillion yen ($10 trillion) in the second quarter, more than twice the size of its economy. To start easing that debt burden, the government plans to raise a flat consumption tax rate to 8 percent in April 2014 from the current level of 5 percent, and to 10 percent in October 2015.
According to government calculations, raising the consumption tax rate could double tax receipts to more than 5 percent of Japan's gross domestic product, compared with the current 2 to 3 percent, helping Japan better balance its finances.
Whether Japan goes ahead with raising taxes will depend on how sustainable the government deems current economic growth to be. Under the current plan, the consumption tax will proceed if it is likely that the Japanese economy can sustain at least 2 percent real G.D.P. growth for the next decade.
Some economists warn that raising taxes too soon could derail Japan's nascent recovery.
''A tightening in fiscal policy would almost certainly snuff out the current cyclical rebound,'' Duncan Wooldridge and Silvia Liu, economists at UBS, said in a note to clients ahead of the G.D.P. numbers.
''The desire for fiscal consolidation in the long run must not sacrifice the war on deflation in the short run,'' they said. ''To hike or not to hike the consumption tax is the only policy which matters over the next four quarters.''

HEADLINE: Restoration in the Gulf: The View From BP

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Shirking Responsibility in the Gulf,'' by Stephen Teague (Op-Ed, July 31), paints an incomplete picture of BP's efforts to help economic restoration efforts in the Gulf. 
Since the Deepwater Horizon accident, BP has paid more than $11 billion in claims to more than 300,000 claimants. Since 2011, we have also funded a consortium of legal services nonprofits in four Gulf states to help low-income people navigate the claims process.
In fact, according to its own press materials, the organization Mr. Teague works for, the Mississippi Center for Justice, leads that legal aid consortium. It has received more than $4 million in BP funding so far.
We also object to his characterization of BP's efforts to temporarily pause payments by the Court Supervised Settlement Program. Recent allegations of misconduct were concerning enough for the judge overseeing the settlement to appoint a former F.B.I. director, Louis Freeh, to investigate. No company would willingly bear the risk of continuing to pay awards potentially tainted by misconduct.
Mr. Teague says there are ''robust'' mechanisms in place to detect fraudulent claims, but the settlement program appears to be spending substantially less on fraud detection efforts than the Gulf Coast Claims Facility, its predecessor run by Kenneth Feinberg. This is despite the fact that it has been reported that Mr. Feinberg had referred around 4,000 cases of potential fraud to law enforcement authorities.
Our record demonstrates that we are meeting our commitment to Gulf restoration efforts.

HEADLINE: Morning Agenda: Fresh Scrutiny for Wall Street Analysts

BYLINE: WILLIAM ALDEN


HIGHLIGHT: With I.P.O.&#8217;s making a comeback, some analysts say Wall Street is slipping back to its old ways. | Prosecutors are exploring ways to penalize JPMorgan Chase over a trading loss. | A look at the Wall Street experiences of Lawrence H. Summers. | The House Financial Services Committee is sometimes called &#8220;the cash committee.&#8221; 

 BODY:
For years, Wall Street research analysts have been barred from pitching initial public offering business. But with the market for I.P.O.'s making a comeback, some analysts say Wall Street is slipping back to its old ways, Peter Lattman and Susanne Craig report in DealBook.
A decade ago, the biggest banks agreed to bar their analysts from I.P.O. solicitations after regulators, led by Eliot Spitzer, then the New York attorney general, uncovered evidence that during the Internet boom some analysts issued overly optimistic reports about start-ups to help their colleagues on the investment banking side. "Today, companies routinely interview analysts when selecting bankers to underwrite their I.P.O.'s. During these meetings, the analysts say, they increasingly feel pressure to say the right things to curry favor with a company's management and owners. They also see themselves as participating in their banks' efforts to win business, a potential breach of government regulations," DealBook reports.
"The enforcement department of the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or Finra, Wall Street's self-regulatory body, has sent an inquiry asking several firms for information on the issue, said people briefed on the matter who spoke on the condition of anonymity." 
Jay R. Ritter, a professor at the University of Florida who studies the I.P.O. market, said: "The walls between research and banking can still be porous."
PROSECUTORS AND F.B.I. EXAMINE JPMORGAN OVER LOSSES | With federal authorities preparing to criminally charge two former JPMorgan Chase employees suspected of misrepresenting the multibillion-dollar trading loss known as the "London Whale," prosecutors in Manhattan are separately exploring ways to penalize the bank, Ben Protess and Jessica Silver-Greenberg report in DealBook.
"The investigation, according to people briefed on the matter, could yield a fine and a reprimand of the bank for allowing the suspected wrongdoing to occur. Prosecutors at the United States attorney's office in Manhattan could also require the bank to bolster internal controls that failed to thwart the trading loss. The action would come in addition to civil charges from the Securities and Exchange Commission, which could announce a settlement with the bank as soon as this fall."
HOW SUMMERS MADE HIS MILLIONS | If the White House nominates Lawrence H. Summers as the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, his financial disclosure "will be one of the hottest documents in Washington," Louise Story and Annie Lowrey report in The New York Times. "Among the top contenders for the position, Mr. Summers has by far the most Wall Street experience and the most personal wealth."
After leaving his job as President Obama's top economic policy adviser at the end of 2010 to return to Harvard University, Mr. Summers jumped into a moneymaking spree, setting up a roster of part-time positions across the financial world. He has been employed by Citigroup and the hedge fund D.E. Shaw; he works for a firm that advises small banks as well as the exchange company Nasdaq OMX; and he is on the boards of two finance-oriented Silicon Valley start-ups that may pursue initial public offerings in the next year, The Times reports.
"His clock was ticking partly because he knew that the Fed chairmanship, to which he has long aspired, was likely to open up in early 2014, when Ben S. Bernanke's second term will come to an end."
ON THE AGENDA | 
Lawyers for Carl C. Icahn are set to urge a Delaware judge to speed up his lawsuit seeking to stop the proposed buyout of Dell by its founder. James Woolery, deputy chairman of Cadwalader Wickersham & Taft, is on CNBC starting at 7 a.m.
IN THE HOUSE, SEATS OF PLENTY | Representative Andy Barr, a Republican from Kentucky with little experience in the intricacies of Wall Street, has become a telling example of why the powerful House Financial Services Committee is sometimes called "the cash committee," Eric Lipton reports in The New York Times. It is a place, critics say, where there are big incentives for House freshmen to do special favors for the financial industry. "Mr. Barr, 40, a first-time elected official, has raised nearly as much money this year from political action committees run by major banks, credit unions and insurance companies as longtime lawmakers like Speaker John A. Boehner and other party leaders."

HEADLINE: Behind the Cover Story: Judith Warner on Working Mothers

BYLINE: RACHEL NOLAN


HIGHLIGHT: Investigating the feelings that high-powered women (and their husbands) had about returning to the work force after being stay-at-home mothers. 

 BODY:
 Judith Warner, a contributing writer, wrote this week's cover story about women who left the work force to stay at home and are now trying to restart their professional lives. She is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress and the author of "Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety." 

You've written two books on the American family, one about medication and another on the changing cult of motherhood. How did you get interested in this particular aspect of family life - mothers' attempts to return to the work force? 
It really grew out of a longer-term interest: how women my age were making the transition from the early phase of motherhood - and adulthood generally - to middle age. That developed into a curiosity to know how the women I interviewed for "Perfect Madness" were doing. I went to an academic conference on motherhood and gave a paper on, essentially, "Perfect Madness 10 Years Later" - how the culture of motherhood had changed in America since the early 2000s. I noticed, over the past couple of years, how a number of aspects of what I think of as the "Perfect Madness" moment had changed because of the economy. People just didn't have the money to put into hyperparenting in the same way. You couldn't idealize stay-at-home motherhood at a time when more and more women needed to work because their husbands were earning less. And - as I say in the article - there was this shift in social-science research in as people started problematizing "intensive motherhood" (to borrow a phrase from Sharon Hays) rather than problematizing working motherhood. I found all this fascinating. I became really curious to know what had happened to the women who, in the late 1990s and early 2000s, had most closely embodied the dominant motherhood ideal - well-off stay-at-home moms. At that academic conference, I heard Pamela Stone give a talk about new research she was doing into how her interview subjects from her book, "Opting Out?" were faring 10 years later. And the idea came together at that point.
 How did you select the women that you interviewed for this article? Was it mostly through following up with women who you wrote about before? 
Following up with the women I interviewed before proved to be incredibly difficult - I tried to reach out to all the local "Perfect Madness" mothers who were stay-at-home moms at the time, and virtually none responded to my queries. But I did get to Carrie Chimerine Irvin, who appears in my article, that way.
I also went back to the women who were interviewed by "60 Minutes" in 2004 on the same subject and re-interviewed them all. And then there was a group of stay-at-home moms mentioned in the "60 Minutes" segment that still exists. I contacted them and reached about a dozen that way. Kuae Kelch Mattox, who I also write about in this week's article, is someone I met at the motherhood conference where I also met Pamela Stone. She gave a great talk where she stressed the importance of changing the narrative around African-American stay-at-home mothers. When I got the assignment to do the article, I knew I'd go back to her.
 What surprised you, if anything, when you got back in touch with these women or got in touch with them for the first time? 
What surprised me was how incredibly easy it was for some women to get back into the work force. In fact, in the first interviews, I had a disproportionate number of those women, and I was shocked. They more or less picked up the phone once they were ready to go back - and they had job offers. As I did more interviews, however, I came to see that those extremely fortunate women represented the elite of the elite - and that other women with less prestigious educational and career backgrounds and less high-powered social contacts had a much, much harder time of it.

Did the stories of the many women you talked to more or less track in similar ways? Or were they very different in the details? I was particularly intrigued by one husband's jealousy that his wife had been able to spend 12 years away from the job. Was that a common sentiment? 
The stories tracked in accordance with the status of the women - again - those with the most money, the best educational pedigrees, the best social connections - tended to do really, really well. Everyone else had a much harder time, particularly if they were in professions, like journalism, that had taken a big hit in their years out. And women who divorced ended up in the most precarious position of all. I spoke with three husbands, and only one expressed his jealousy. I've heard it - or heard of it from wives - more often, however - and Sylvia Ann Hewlett's research showed that, postrecession, a third or quarter of wives said their husbands were jealous. I have seen and heard this many times anecdotally. I was so glad that Ted, Kuae's husband, put it into words in such an honest way.

You write about privileged, middle-class women because they are the ones who had the opportunity to leave the work force in the first place. Had any of these women since dropped out of the middle class because of the financial crisis or divorce? Do you have a sense that women with fewer resources make similar calculations to these opt-out/opt-in women, or are they too busy hustling to provide for their families? 
I would just say first that these are upper-middle-class, not middle-class, women. I think it's really important to make that distinction; there has been a big tendency in the past to blur the distinctions and make it sound like this was - or is - a phenomenon of "women" of a certain generation. It's not - most women (like most men) have no choice in how they set up their work and parenting lives. I think that point can't be made often enough. People perhaps don't want the lives of the rich and angst-filled shoved in their faces; they don't want the reminder of how tough and different their own lives are shoved in their faces - but we all need to face the unfairness of the fact that having a choice, in this country, is a privilege of the wealthy. And yet, at the same time, finding yourself in an essentially unlivable situation work- and home-wise is a universal. It just plays out differently among wealthy versus poor or working-class (or middle-class) women.
Many of the women I spoke with were so well off that they were sheltered from the fallout of the Great Recession - this, actually, was something that surprised me a great deal. But I know from reading Hewlett that this is not typical. Again, there are big differences of wealth even within the upper-middle class. All this brings us back to the fact that the very top earners in our country have pulled away from everyone else - and live lives that are now quite divorced from the pressures weighing on other families, including upper-middle class families that are better off than most but still struggling.

Before leaving the office, Sheilah O'Donnel tried to work part time but felt marginalized. In some countries, like Germany, there is still prejudice against working mothers; part-time work arrangements, along with long maternity leave, are common. You have written about spending the first few years of motherhood working in Paris. Those commenting online to your article also suggest that this is a structural problem in the United States. Do you see any way forward? 
There absolutely is a structural problem in the U.S., and that structural problem is, for me, the most important take-away from this article. Successful women - successful people - are now facing 50-plus-hour work weeks, plus endless hours on evenings and weekends spent tethered to e-mail. This makes for a really poor quality of life for a family with two working parents. It is not at all surprising to me that families that can afford to have one member of the couple drop out or scale way down choose to do so. And it's not surprising that that member usually turns out to be the woman, because the choice is more socially acceptable for them and because they usually earn less money than their husbands. We certainly need the sorts of work-family supports that all other industrialized nations have: paid maternity leave of a decent length, paid sick days, the ability to work part time without losing your job, etc. But we will also have to be smart about how we implement these policies - if we ever get them. They have had some really perverse effects in terms of women's work force advancement in places like France and even Sweden. When the structural supports are too generous, it seems, employers sometimes avoid hiring women of childbearing age, and when a really large number of mothers take extremely extended leave and then work part-time, it holds back the workplace progress of all women. That said: I don't believe those perverse effects are an argument against the policies. They just have to be well thought out in terms of optimizing both time and home and progress at work. And they have to be addressed to and used by both men and women, so that women don't end up on a separate track. That brings us back to changing the culture of work again.
 You refer back to an article published in the magazine in 2003 called "The Opt-Out Revolution." Do you think that because of the financial crisis and changing attitudes, the "revolution" is over? 
I think a "revolution" tends to signify something really large and societal, whereas this phenomenon really did affect just a small segment of the population. (Directly, that is - the conversation around it affected many more people and, I believe, helped stoke the sense among women who needed to work that they were somehow lesser mothers.) I do think our views toward work and motherhood change with our times, dovetailing particularly with the ups and downs of the economy.

HEADLINE: Assessing the Impact of Business Incubators

BYLINE: EILENE ZIMMERMAN


HIGHLIGHT: A reader questions how effective incubators are at creating successful companies. 

 BODY:
In our July 17 post about Austin's start-up scene, we wrote that there were "at least 15" incubators and accelerators in the region. A reader in Austin questioned the effectiveness of incubators at creating successful companies in the long term. He compiled a list of the top 150 publicly traded software companies by top-line sales - his measure of success - and found that not one on his list had come out of an incubator.
"While I'd love to be able to say otherwise," he wrote, "I don't know of a single software company in this list that began in an incubator. If untrue, no one will be happier than myself to be schooled otherwise." 
We decided to ask a few experts on business incubation what they thought. Jared Konczal, a senior analyst at the Kauffman Foundation, which promotes entrepreneurship, said it seemed "statistically improbable" that no successful software company has come out of an incubator. 
"There is a time lag between the birth of a company and its success," Mr. Konczal said. "It's possible that if you were to investigate the history of every one of those 150 companies, there is a direct connection to an incubator - maybe the current company bought a company that acquired a company that came out of an incubator."
Linda Knopp, director of knowledge services at the National Business Incubator Association in Athens, Ohio, agreed. She said many incubated companies were acquired, sometimes multiple times.
Looking only at publicly traded companies is also a problem because there has been a marked decline in initial public offerings - especially small-company I.P.O.'s - since the technology dot-com bubble burst in 2000, as shown by Jay R. Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida. The average number of small company I.P.O.'s fell to only 28 a year from 2001-12 from 166 per year in the years 1988 to 2000, an 83 percent decline, according to a July paper by Mr. Ritter.
Mr. Konczal said he believed a better approach would be looking at "high-growth firms like those on the Inc. 500 and seeing which ones started in an incubator or accelerator."
And the very definition of success varies based on an incubator's goals. "Many have as their goal job creation," Ms. Knopp said, not an I.P.O. exit. A 2011 report financed by the Economic Development Administration at the Department of Commerce, called "Incubating Success," found that among the incubators it studied the most successful were nonprofits, suggesting that "the most important goals of top-performing incubation programs are creating jobs and fostering the entrepreneurial climate in the community."
Still, the reader raises a valid point. Alejandro Amezcua, an assistant professor of entrepreneurship at Syracuse University's Whitman School of Management, has been studying the success of companies that have been incubated. He tracked every American company that had gone into and out of an incubator at some point in the last 20 years as part of his dissertation research.
"Of about 20,000 companies that had been incubated in that 20-year period, I matched each one to three companies that had never been incubated, but were of comparable size, industry, age, location and ethnic and gender identity of the owner," he said. It was akin to mimicking a randomized experiment that uses an incubated group and a control group that hasn't been incubated.
Mr. Amezcua said he found that over all, the failure rate for the incubated group was "much higher than the group that was not being incubated." He went on, "On the face of it, that's pretty hard for people to swallow because so much of the belief about incubators is that they are helping entrepreneurs who are inexperienced be successful."
But Mr. Amezcua said he didn't see that as negative. "It could be incubators have an alternative effect," he said. "A business goes in there for a year or two and because they are getting a lot of advice, realizes they aren't going to make it and cut their losses sooner rather than later. They could be companies that might have failed anyway, incubator or not."

HEADLINE: The Fiscal Side of Fighting Terror

BYLINE: JARED BERNSTEIN


HIGHLIGHT: Federal spending levels on antiterrorism over the last decade may represent an overreaction to the threat, an economist writes. 

 BODY:
Jared Bernstein is a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities in Washington and a former chief economist to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. 
Ted Koppel wrote what I found to be a smart and resonant op-ed article last week in The Wall Street Journal. Though its focus is the United States reaction to terrorist actions and threats, there are, of course, economic and fiscal implications.
Riffing off the recent closure of our embassies in the Middle East, Mr. Koppel carefully forms an argument that after initially showing admirable restraint, we are now systematically overreacting to terrorist threats, in much the way they'd want us to (he's of course not the first to make this point). He writes: 
"Terrorism, after all, is designed to produce overreaction. It is the means by which the weak induce the powerful to inflict damage upon themselves - and Al Qaeda and groups like it are surely counting on that as the centerpiece of their strategy. 
"It appears to be working."
Mr. Koppel dates the overreaction to the 2003 invasion of Iraq, wherein "the U.S. began to inflict upon itself a degree of damage that no external power could have achieved. Even bin Laden must have been astounded."
What happened next was, I'd argue, uniquely American: a predictable interaction between large scale antiterrorism initiatives and the sectors and institutions that stood, and still stand, to profit by them. This, of course, includes the military and its network of private contractors, but it has gone much further than that, involving a level of surveillance about which we're still learning, though even now we see that it spends billions on contracted employees and huge data centers.
To shed at least some rough light on the implications of this buildup, I crunched some numbers that compare the last two decades, the 1990s and the 2000s. The security sector in the government accounts not only covers defense, but also adds other antiterror spending, including that of the Department of Homeland Security and related intelligence accounts. The table shows real spending over these two decades for both the full sector and without the defense part. Real G.D.P. growth is in there for comparison. 
Clearly, our reaction has been costly, as security expenditures swung sharply, from real contraction (over all, not for the nondefense part) in the 1990s to almost doubling (more than doubling in nondefense security) in the 2000s. Such spending grew less than G.D.P. in the 1990s and a lot faster than G.D.P. since then; as the table note reports, security spending as a share of G.D.P. fell a couple of percentage points in the 1990s and rose a couple of points in the first decade of the 2000s.
Such numbers raise questions. Do they imply we're overspending? On one hand, there have been no successful terrorist attacks on our soil, so how do we know we're not devoting the optimal amount of resources to this? On the other hand, there is Mr. Koppel's convincing argument about overreaction, which obviously carries a price tag, not all of which is covered in that table (e.g., the private costs of how our reaction has changed travel). And then there's the fact that some domestic terrorist plots were disrupted not at the hands of armies or special operations, but by brave passengers on a Detroit-bound jet and by the New York police.
I don't have the answers, though I suspect an objective assessment would support the view that we've gone too far, which is not to say we could do less and all would be fine. As Mr. Koppel put it:
"Will terrorists kill innocent civilians in the years to come? Of course. They did so more than 100 years ago, when they were called anarchists - and a responsible nation-state must take reasonable measures to protect its citizens. But there is no way to completely eliminate terrorism.
"The challenge that confronts us is how we will live with that threat. We have created an economy of fear, an industry of fear, a national psychology of fear. Al Qaeda could never have achieved that on its own. We have inflicted it on ourselves."
I've written a lot about damage of self-inflicted fiscal policy wounds in a weak economy, and with the forthcoming budget battles and debt ceiling, I'm sure I will shortly be doing so again. But this is another self-infliction, one that bores even deeper into our national psyche - and national accounts - in ways that will continue to cause long-lasting damage if we don't recalibrate.

HEADLINE: Suit Accuses Online Lender of Violating New York Rate Caps

BYLINE: JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG


HIGHLIGHT: The lawsuit accuses Western Sky Financial and its affiliates of offering short-term loans at interest rates of more than 300 percent, violating New York usury laws that cap interest rates at 25 percent. 

 BODY:
New York State's top prosecutor filed suit on Monday against an online lender that offers short-term loans at interest rates of more than 300 percent, the latest warning shot in a sweeping battle by state authorities to enforce local interest rate caps.
Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general, sued Western Sky Financial and its affiliates, which claim connections to American Indian tribes - ties that the lenders have argued immunize them from federal and state laws. 
 Visitors to Western Sky's Web site are greeted by a logo of three tepees against a yellow sky. The lender, which says it operates "within the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation" in South Dakota, has argued that the tribal affiliation puts Western Sky beyond the reach of state regulators, including Mr. Schneiderman.
Mr. Schneiderman was not convinced. In the lawsuit, which was filed in the State Supreme Court, Mr. Schneiderman accused Western Sky and its affiliates of violating state usury laws that cap interest rates on loans at 25 percent.
From their perch online, the lawsuit said, the so-called payday lenders engage in "an illegal and deceptive scheme to originate high-interest, personal loans to consumers in New York."
Mr. Schneiderman's office contends that Western Sky and its affiliates have made at least 17,970 costly loans to New York residents since 2010. The interest and fees alone, the lawsuit says, amount to nearly $185 million. The lender, Mr. Schneiderman said in the suit, "preys upon New York consumers facing financial hardships with limited options."
Springing from an investigation that began last year, the suit aims to stop the companies from making more loans in the state and to void those loans that they have already made. Mr. Schneiderman is also looking to extract tens of millions of dollars from the lenders - a sum that consists of a fine and a refund to New York borrowers of all the interest payments made in excess of the state's interest rate caps.
In his suit, Mr. Schneiderman outlined his suspicions about how the operations work. Once consumers apply for loans through Western Sky's Web site, their applications are shuttled to subsidiaries in California, which finance the loans, the suit said. The arrangement, the suit said, means that the loans are in Western Sky's "name only," while the subsidiaries "bear the risk."
With his action on Monday, Mr. Schneiderman joined a group of state prosecutors fighting to keep online lenders from flouting state restrictions on the loans - a campaign that has gained urgency as government officials try to shield residents, desperate for cash, from the expensive loans.
Almost since their inception two decades ago as storefront check-cashing stores, payday lenders have been controversial. As states have imposed interest rate caps, the lenders have shifted their operations to more hospitable places, including Belize, Malta and the West Indies, where they can more easily evade the statewide ceilings on interest rates. Extolling the benefits of operating offshore in a 2005 deposition, one payday lender put it starkly: the move to foreign places offers "lawsuit protection and tax reduction."
Grappling with the increasingly hostile state laws, several lenders, including Western Sky, are forging ties with American Indian reservations. Through these pacts, the lenders argue, they are part of a "sovereign nation" and are not subject federal and state laws. Still, the prosecutors are redoubling their efforts to police the lenders. In at least nine states, including Colorado and Missouri, regulators have taken aim at the lenders with ties to American Indian tribes.
New York State's action against Western Sky follows several other regulatory moves. In April, Western Sky was fined by Oregon's Department of Consumer and Business Services, which accused it of promoting loans with interest rates of 342 percent "through an aggressive TV and radio advertising campaign." Lori Swanson, the attorney general of Minnesota, also sued Western Sky, accusing it of violating a state cap on interest rates.
Minnesota acted after Colorado's attorney general sued Western Sky in 2011, accusing it of illegally making roughly 200 loans to state residents. In a promising development for Colorado, a district court judge said in May that the lenders' tribal ties did not shield Western Sky from state law. The judge noted, according to court filings, that borrowers obtain the loans while living in Colorado, not on the South Dakota reservation.
A spokesman for the company said in a recent statement, "Western Sky Financial is the largest private employer on the impoverished Cheyenne River Indian Reservation." Now, the battle with Western Sky is shifting to New York. Last week, Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's top banking regulator, sent letters to the company and 34 other online lenders, ordering them to "cease and desist" from making the "illegal" loans, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.
As part of a clampdown on payday lenders, New York authorities are also scrutinizing the banks that provide a critical gateway for the lenders to gain access to borrowers' bank accounts. The link is a lifeline. The banks, state officials say, enable the lenders to automatically withdraw loan payments from borrowers' checking accounts, even in states where the loans are effectively outlawed.
Last week, Mr. Lawsky implored 117 banks to stop the online lenders from gaining access to New York residents' checking accounts.
In his lawsuit against Western Sky and its affiliates, Mr. Schneiderman also highlighted the banks' role in allowing money to flow from New Yorkers to the lenders. One lender, the lawsuit said, "repeatedly debited money" from "bank accounts in the state of New York."

HEADLINE: A Glut of Antidepressants

BYLINE: RONI CARYN RABIN


HIGHLIGHT: Overdiagnosis of depression is seen as one factor in the rise in antidepressant use. 

 BODY:
Over the past two decades, the use of antidepressants has skyrocketed. One in 10 Americans now takes an antidepressant medication; among women in their 40s and 50s, the figure is one in four.
Experts have offered numerous reasons. Depression is common, and economic struggles have added to our stress and anxiety. Television ads promote antidepressants, and insurance plans usually cover them, even while limiting talk therapy. But a recent study suggests another explanation: that the condition is being overdiagnosed on a remarkable scale.
The study, published in April in the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, found that nearly two-thirds of a sample of more than 5,000 patients who had been given a diagnosis of depression within the previous 12 months did not meet the criteria for major depressive episode as described by the psychiatrists' bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or D.S.M.). 
The study is not the first to find that patients frequently get "false positive" diagnoses for depression. Several earlier review studies have reported that diagnostic accuracy is low in general practice offices, in large part because serious depression is so rare in that setting.
Elderly patients were most likely to be misdiagnosed, the latest study found. Six out of seven patients age 65 and older who had been given a diagnosis of depression did not fit the criteria. More educated patients and those in poor health were less likely to receive an inaccurate diagnosis.
The vast majority of individuals diagnosed with depression, rightly or wrongly, were given medication, said the paper's lead author, Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Most people stay on the drugs, which can have a variety of side effects, for at least two years. Some take them for a decade or more.
"It's not only that physicians are prescribing more, the population is demanding more," Dr. Mojtabai said. "Feelings of sadness, the stresses of daily life and relationship problems can all cause feelings of upset or sadness that may be passing and not last long. But Americans have become more and more willing to use medication to address them."
By contrast, the Dutch College of General Practitioners last year urged its members to prescribe antidepressants only in severe cases, and instead to offer psychological treatment and other support with daily life. Officials noted that depressive symptoms may be a normal, transient reaction to disappointment or loss.
Ironically, while many patients in the United States are inappropriately diagnosed with depression, many who actually have it suffer without treatment. Dr. Mark Olfson, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, noted that from the time they develop major depression, it takes Americans eight years on average to seek care.
Diagnosing depression is an inherently subjective task, said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, the president of the American Psychiatric Association.
"It would be great if we could do a blood test or a lab test or do an EKG," Dr. Lieberman said, noting that similar claims of overtreatment have been made about syndromes like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. "A diagnosis is made by symptoms and history and observation."
The new study drew 5,639 individuals who had been diagnosed with depression from among a nationally representative sample of over 75,000 adults who took part in the National Survey of Drug Use and Health in 2009 and 2010. The subjects were then interviewed in person with questions based on the D.S.M.-4 criteria.
Only 38.4 percent of the participants met these criteria for depression during the previous year, Dr. Mojtabai said.
It's possible some of the participants did not appear to be depressed because they had already been successfully treated, said Dr. Jeffrey Cain, the president of the Academy of Family Physicians. Their improved mood may also have colored the way they responded to questions about the past.
"If I'm checking people who are being treated for high blood pressure and taking medication, I would expect it to be better when I'm checking them," Dr. Cain said.
According to the D.S.M., a diagnosis of major depressive episode is appropriate if the patient has been in a depressed mood and felt no interest in activities for at least two weeks, and also has at least five symptoms that impair functioning almost every day. These include unintentional weight gain or loss, problems sleeping, agitation or slowed reactions noticed by others, fatigue and low energy, feelings of excessive guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating and recurrent thoughts of death.
"We're not just talking about somebody who's having a bad day or got into an argument with their spouse," Dr. Lieberman said. "We're talking about something that is severe, meaning it's disabling and distressing and is not transient."
Many doctors have long prescribed antidepressants soon after the death of a family member, even though the D.S.M. urges clinicians to differentiate between normal grief and pathological bereavement.
One 50-year-old New York City woman said her doctor prescribed an antidepressant a few weeks after her husband died, even though she thought her feelings of shock and sadness were appropriate.
"He told me, 'You have to function, you have to keep your job, you have a daughter to raise,' " said the woman, who asked that her name be withheld because few friends or family members knew she was taking antidepressants.
Most of the study participants were not receiving specialty mental health care, but Dr. Cain pointed out that it was not clear who was making the misdiagnoses: a psychiatrist, non-psychiatrist physician or other provider, like a nurse practitioner.
But while a psychiatrist may spend up to 90 minutes with a patient before making a diagnosis, patients often are more comfortable with their primary care doctors, who rarely have that kind of time.
Dr. Lieberman suggested watchful waiting may be appropriate in some cases, and more integrated forms of health care may soon make it easier to send patients to a mental health provider "down the hall."
Doctors need to improve their diagnostic skills, Dr. Mojtabai said, and must resist the temptation "to take out the prescription pad and write down an antidepressant and hand it to the patient."

HEADLINE: Driving a Work in Progress From Elio Motors

BYLINE: JIM MOTAVALLI and BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: Elio brought its 3-wheel prototype vehicle to Manhattan last week. The vehicle is intriguing, but has a long way to go. 

 BODY:
Phoenix-based Elio Motors has built a vehicle that isn't exactly a car, but really isn't a motorcycle either. Lodged somewhere in between those two classifications - although considered by many states to be a motorcycle - the 3-wheeler looks like something the Ministry of Information would have issued a low-level bureaucrat in Terry Gilliam's classic dark comedy, "Brazil."
Driving the vehicle took imagination, because the tandem two-seat vehicle that Paul Elio - founder and chief executive of Elio Motors - offered for a test ride in Manhattan last week was far from the one he promised would come from a Louisiana factory next year. He says he intends to sell the finished product, which he says will get 84 miles per gallon on the highway, for $6,800. 
Mr. Elio had a model of an all-new 50-horsepower, 3-cylinder engine with variable valve timing, designed by IAV Automotive Engineering, sitting on a stand on the sidewalk near where the vehicle was parked. But the production engine was not ready. Elio's test car was powered by a clattery 3-cylinder power plant pulled from a 1990 Geo Metro. Also absent, but intended for the production car, were air-conditioning, windshield wipers, power windows and door locks, an AM-FM radio and an "automated manual" transmission.
Missing as well were a rear window and a passenger's side door, but that's by design. Mr. Elio said that in a car with tandem seating (the passenger sits behind the driver) there was no need for another side door, which added cost. The driver's window rolled down with a crank, but the passenger side had only fixed glass, although Mr. Elio said the production cars would have power windows on both sides. And the rear window? He said that it would be hard to see out of one anyway, given the car's layout, but that owners with rear vision anxiety would perhaps have that amenity available as an optional extra.
Elio Motors and the as-yet-unnamed 3-wheeler grew out of ESG Engineering, a company that Mr. Elio said he helped to found. The vehicle's aerodynamic shape, with two outboard front wheels and a single rear wheel in the pinched tail of a wind-cheating fuselage, bears some resemblance to the Edison2, a vehicle that won its class in the Progressive Insurance Automotive X Prize competition (although that car has four wheels).
"In 2008, oil prices were going through the roof, but instead of getting mad I decided to do something about it," said Mr. Elio, a 1995 graduate of the GMI Engineering and Management Institute in Flint, Mich. (now Kettering University). He figured that by placing two occupants in tandem, he could cut down on drag and increase efficiency.
Mr. Elio said that 90 percent of the content in the front-wheel-drive production car would come from North America. The company has raised $50 million for the venture from private investors, he said, outlining a production goal of 250,000 vehicles per year.
"We will launch in 2014 and ramp up to that goal," he said, adding that the company had already received 3,000 advance orders. Indeed, people walking past the vehicle in Midtown seemed interested. Many walked around to the driver's side (after learning that the passenger side window doesn't roll down) to ask Mr. Elio for his business card through the narrow gap between the B-pillar and the front seat - the rear passenger's only access to the outside world.
Mr. Elio said the cars were to be built at a former General Motors plant in Caddo Parish, La., near Shreveport, where the company planned to hire 1,500 workers.
A brief ride around Times Square in the vehicle paid no compliments to the engineering of the Geo Metro motor or the stopgap manual transmission (which featured a vague, loose-fitting shifter mounted to the right of the driver's seat). Passers-by who didn't see the vehicle coming certainly heard it as the short-piped Geo mill belched out its anemic tractor growl. The finished car will supposedly have a 0-to-60 m.p.h. time of 9.6 seconds and a top speed of 107 m.p.h., but not the test vehicle - currently the sole Elio that can be driven.
Instrumentation was basic and also borrowed from an old econobox, but Mr. Elio said that, too, was temporary while the production panel was being readied. The driver sits very low in the car, although there was a lever to raise the seat height, which Mr. Elio said was intended to increase driver visibility of the front wheels.
Mr. Elio said the car had the same ground clearance as a contemporary Ford Mustang. The streets around Times Square are not much of a test track, but the steering was relatively light and the brakes worked - just well enough. In a couple of those hard-braking situations all too common in Midtown, the test car's lack of power brakes was very apparent. Mr. Elio said the production car would have them. The suspension was agricultural in character, and Manhattan's standard potholes and lumpy road patches sometimes made for a rough ride.
Like the Smart Fortwo, the vehicle felt larger inside than it looked outside. Climbing into the back was initially awkward, but once inside, the rear passenger has surprisingly good legroom and headroom. The driver's seat did not feel cramped, and after a few minutes at the wheel it was easy to forget you were driving something so different from everything else on the road.
Some of the claims about the car remain to be verified. Mr. Elio said it would achieve 84 m.p.g. on the highway and 49 in the city, but those numbers are based on the company's computer projections for an engine that has not made its way into the car - not real world Environmental Protection Agency figures. A handout Elio Motors has been circulating says the vehicle has a five-star safety rating, which the company later recanted in an e-mail. Mr. Elio said that such a rating was in fact "anticipated" and based upon computer simulations. He showed the simulations with his iPhone, and they made it look as if the vehicle's occupants could survive a truck bumper broadside at 35 m.p.h. Mr. Elio said that some of a planned batch of 25 prototypes would be used for actual crash testing.
As a 3-wheeler, the vehicle can be registered as a motorcycle and thus avoid stringent federal crash testing standards, but Mr. Elio says he wants the car to meet them anyway. The vehicle weighs about 1,100 pounds, he said, so it is important to know what happens in accidents.
Sales of the vehicle will most certainly hinge on whether buyers are required to get a motorcycle license. Chip Stempeck, Elio Motors' vice president for marketing, said that every state except Kansas would require that the vehicle be registered as a motorcycle based on federal vehicle classifications. So in some states, a person who does not already have a motorcycle license will have to pass that state's motorcycle safety test, possibly on a 2-wheeled motorcycle. That could be a deal breaker for some people.
Then there's the helmet issue. Mr. Stempeck said that while most states would not require the driver to wear a helmet, New York, North Carolina, Nebraska, Mississippi, Missouri, West Virginia and the District of Columbia will. But with a steel roll cage, antilock braking, three air bags and stability control (out of those features, the prototype has only the roll cage installed), Mr. Stempeck said Elio Motors was hopeful that states could be persuaded that the vehicle should be exempt from full motorcycle regulations.
Elio's prototype vehicle, although fun to drive, gave the impression more of a really good backyard project than of something that would be ready for production soon. The murky array of registration hurdles aside, it will be easier to rate the car as something that could be a serious contender once all of Elio's promised features make it from concept to reality.

HEADLINE: Elon Musk Unveils Plans for Hyperloop High-Speed Train

BYLINE: NICK BILTON


HIGHLIGHT: The hypothetical project is called the Hyperloop, a high-speed train that&#160;would&#160;be able to take people to San Francisco from Los Angeles in 30 minutes. That&#8217;s a speed of almost&#160;800 miles an hour. 

 BODY:
Never let it be said that Elon Musk, a serial entrepreneur who was a co-founder of PayPal and the electric car company Tesla Motors, is afraid to think big.
Mr. Musk on Monday harked back to the days of the late-1990s tech bubble - when no idea seemed too big or too expensive - by showing off plans for a project that seems the stuff of science fiction.
The hypothetical project is called the Hyperloop, a high-speed train that would take people to San Francisco from Los Angeles in 30 minutes. That is a speed of almost 800 miles an hour. 
The first unanswered question among many for Mr. Musk's ambitious vision is who exactly would build this 400-mile transportation system. Mr. Musk suggested someone else should do it. But if no one takes the baton, he might do it. Or not.
Beyond that, the details of who would pay for Hyperloop, how it would be built and how long it would take are also unclear. But Mr. Musk theorized that if he devoted all of his energy, he could have a prototype done within one to two years. He estimated the project would cost around $6 billion and tickets would cost $20 per trip.
"It doesn't seem plausible to me," said Richard White, a professor of American history at Stanford and author of "Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America." "I'm suspicious about everything, especially cost."
Mr. White added, "How's he going to build this thing for $6 billion? You can't even build the Bay Bridge for that much money." The still-unfinished renovations of the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland are expected to cost $6.3 billion.
So don't pack your bags just yet. In aninterview with Bloomberg Businessweek on Monday, Mr. Musk said he regretted mentioning the Hyperloop last year, saying that he has no time to work on the project and instead has to run SpaceX and Tesla Motors, his two other companies.
Mr. Musk first mentioned Hyperloop last summer and detailed it further in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. In July, he announced on Twitter that he would unveil the designs for the high-speed train on Aug. 12. As promised, a 57-page "alpha design" plan was posted online Monday that explained how such a train would work.
Mr. Musk has clearly put a lot of thought into the design. The document he unveiled explains that the high-speed train would become "truly a new mode of transport - a fifth mode after planes, trains, cars and boats." The Hyperloop would transport people in "pods" that would travel through tubes. The tubes would be mounted on pylons that could be designed to withstand earthquake movements.
Mr. Musk took swipes at the California High Speed Rail that is being built and headed by the California High-Speed Rail Authority. This train, while real, is not expected to be completed until 2029 and will cost an estimated $68.4 billion to build.
"When the California 'high speed' rail was approved, I was quite disappointed, as I know many others were too," Mr. Musk wrote, while saying that the Hyperloop would cost $6 billion to build. It is not clear how he arrived at this cost estimate.
If anyone could build such a train, it is probably Mr. Musk. Critics railed against him when he first broached the idea for private space travel with Space Exploration Technologies, of Hawthorne, Calif. Otherwise known as SpaceX, Mr. Musk's company proved critics wrong last yearwhen it launched its Falcon 9 rocket.
But Mr. Musk's assertion that he does not want to be the leader of the Hyperloop project has some people wondering if it will actually be built.
During a news conference, Mr. Musk seemed to waver over whether he wanted to be involved with the project. "I'm somewhat tempted to at least make a demonstration prototype," he said. "I've sort of come around a little bit on my thinking here that maybe I should do the beginning bit and build a subscale version that's operating."
In thepaper released Monday, Mr. Musk acknowledged that there had been other proposed ideas for a train similar to the high-speed train over the years. "Unfortunately," he wrote, "none of these have panned out."

HEADLINE: In One Bundle of Mortgages, the Subprime Crisis Reverberates

BYLINE: PETER EAVIS


HIGHLIGHT: A Goldman Sachs bond with a complex name &#8212; GSAMP Trust 2007 NC1 &#8212; has wide-ranging impact, on the bankers who sold the deal, the struggling homeowners, and taxpayers who helped pick up the bill. 

 BODY:
A subprime deal came back to haunt Fabrice Tourre, a former Goldman Sachs trader, when a federal jury in Manhattan found him liable for civil securities fraud.
He is not the only one feeling the pain of a subprime transaction six years on.
 Hundreds of thousands of subprime borrowers are still struggling. Some of their mortgages ended up in another Goldman deal that was done at the same time as Mr. Tourre was working on his own financial alchemy.
In February 2007, just before everything fell apart, Goldman Sachs bundled thousands of subprime mortgages from across the country and sold them to investors. This bond became toxic as soon as it was completed. The mortgages slid into default at a speed that was staggering even for that era.
Despite those losses, that bond still lives. It has undoubtedly left its mark on ordinary borrowers. But the impact of the deal spread ever further. It touched the bankers who sold the deal. It even landed on taxpayers, who ended up owning a large slice of the Goldman bond. 
Much has changed over the last six years. Big banks like Goldman are reporting strong profits and regulators are wrapping up cases stemming from Wall Street's recklessness. House prices are on the rise, providing relief and encouragement for many homeowners. Indeed, subprime securities like the Goldman bond can now even be found in some mom-and-pop mutual funds - which bought them at a discount of as much as half of their original face value.
Yet the financial crisis still reverberates for many others, in large part because of the insidious reach of the financial products that Wall Street created. Subprime securities still pose a significant legal risk to the firms that packaged them, and they use up capital that could be deployed elsewhere in the economy.
This is the story of one of those bonds, GSAMP Trust 2007 NC1.
The name is the sort of gobbledygook that is common in the bond market, but it tells a story. The "GS" is derived from Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street firm didn't actually make mortgages to subprime borrowers that were in the deal. Instead, Goldman bought them from a lender called New Century, the "NC" in the title.
It was New Century that lent to Wendy Fillmore, when she and her husband wanted to buy their house in Las Vegas in 2006. The home cost $276,000. New Century provided two loans, one for a $221,000 loan and a second mortgage for $53,000. Data for the Goldman deal shows that it contains the Fillmores' larger loan.
Ms. Fillmore's husband was, and still is, an information technology specialist, and at the time she was working as a transcriber. She recalls the surprise she felt when New Century agreed to the make the mortgages.
"I was wondering how we managed to get approved for as much as we did," she said.
The reason had a lot to do with the appetite for mortgages by Goldman and other Wall Street firms that had a booming business in slicing and dicing and repackaging the loans in securities.
A month before Ms. Fillmore got her mortgage, Daniel L. Sparks, Goldman's head of mortgages, wrote in an e-mail that he was a "bit scared" of New Century and had reservations about Goldman taking more loans from the lender. The e-mail was contained in materials released by Congress as part of an investigation of Wall Street.
Mr. Sparks gained prominence in 2010 when he testified in Congress about Goldman's mortgage dealings, including a deal that resulted in a $550 million fine for the firm. He is one of the four bankers who signed off on the 2007 bond, according to a lawsuit filed by a federal regulator that is litigating the deal and other transactions. Mr. Sparks, who left Goldman in 2008, is named as a defendant in the federal action. He declined to say what he is doing now.
Ms. Fillmore is still in her Las Vegas home. She estimates that the market value of the house is around half the combined value of her two mortgages.
"It is frustrating to be so far underwater," she said. "It's horrible. We can't move. We just try not to think about it."
Deals like the Goldman one leave a rich paper trail that includes many details about the loans that were contained in the bond. The numbers are jaw-dropping.
Three-fourths of the borrowers in the deal have fallen well behind on their payments at some point, according to a special analysis of the deal performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Many of those people have lost their houses or will lose them. Nearly half the loans in the bond have been in foreclosure proceedings since it was issued, according to the Boston Fed.
One of Mr. Sparks's former Goldman colleagues is Jonathan S. Sobel, who also left Goldman in 2008 and is also a defendant in the federal action. A year ago, Mr. Sobel and his wife acquired a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue, one of the city's most coveted addresses, according to New York property records. They paid $19.3 million.
A few months before that purchase, Anthony Haynes, a New York subway train driver, was forced to sell a house in Brooklyn that had been in his family since just after World War II.
In 2006, New Century lent him $500,000 against the property. A renovation of the house didn't go as planned, Mr. Haynes said. It also turned out that he couldn't afford both the mortgage payments and other bills, like child support payments.
"I am glad to be rid of the financial burden, but I did like the house," he said.
Property records indicate that he sold the house last year for $330,000. The entity that bought it from Mr. Haynes then sold it a few months later for $550,000. Mr. Haynes lives in an apartment in Brooklyn that he and his wife own.
The question today is whether risky mortgage loans should ever have been put in the Goldman bond. Critics say the banks did not properly portray the full risks of the loans bundled into bonds.
Since the financial crisis, many lawsuits have been filed against banks, asserting that banks filled bonds up with loans that didn't meet agreed-upon standards. Last week, for example, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Bank of America over $850 million of jumbo mortgage-backed securities.
Fannie Mae, the mortgage finance giant now owned by the federal government, bought the largest slice of the Goldman deal. In 2008, Fannie was bailed out and taken over by the government, effectively transferring all its assets, including the Goldman bond, into taxpayers' hands.
Fannie's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is suing Goldman and many other banks to recoup losses on bonds that the company bought. The agency asserts that the four Goldman bankers who signed the bond's documents were directly responsible for what it says were misstatements and omissions in the deal. None of the men work for Goldman anymore.
They weren't keen to talk.
The lawsuit says one of the signatories on the deal was David J. Rosenblum. A former Goldman employee of that name now works at Prophet Capital Asset Management, an investment firm based in Austin, Tex. When reached on a Prophet Capital phone number, Mr. Rosenblum declined to say whether he had a connection with the deal.
"I am just a little hermit in my little hermit crab shell," he said.
Mr. Sobel, the Park Avenue resident, didn't respond to requests for comment.
One central figure from the time did talk, though.
Daniel Mudd was Fannie Mae's chief executive when the company bought a $480 million slice of the Goldman bond.
"It doesn't ring a bell," he said, when asked whether he remembered the deal.
His tenure at Fannie has been criticized because it was the period when the firm piled into riskier mortgages. Today, Mr. Mudd offers a general defense of Fannie's subprime strategy: "If you look at the performance of any of the nonprime business that Fannie did, the performance is in an order of magnitude better than business done at other institutions."
Mr. Mudd is also caught up in subprime litigation. He isn't a defendant in the suit aimed at the former Goldman bankers. But in 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil actions against Mr. Mudd and other former Fannie Mae executives, claiming that the company understated its exposure to subprime mortgages.
After Fannie, Mr. Mudd joined the Fortress Investment Group, an investment firm, but resigned in early 2012.
Looking back at the turbulence of the intervening years, Mr. Mudd, an ex-Marine, said, "You continue to march."
It has been a long road for Ms. Fillmore, the Las Vegas homeowner. But she and her husband decided to persevere with their loan. "It has crossed our minds to walk away from the house. But we've put too much into it," she said. "We don't want to give up and lose the house and the past six years of payments."
The Fillmores' experience shows how much homeowner relief efforts can help.
Their debt load was lightened in 2010 after she visited an event held by Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, an organization that helps consumers get help with their mortgages. "They really helped pull our fat out of the fire," Ms. Fillmore said. The group worked with the company that services her larger loan to make it more affordable. Its principal was reduced to $193,000, from $221,000, according to property records.
Deborah Harris, of Windsor Locks, Conn., also benefited from an adjustment to her mortgage. She took out a $168,000 loan from New Century in December 2006 to buy a house. The loan was placed in the 2007 Goldman deal. She says modifications have halved her monthly payments. "I could have been one of the statistics, most definitely," Ms. Harris said. "I guess I was one of the lucky ones who stayed in their homes."
One-fourth of the loans in the Goldman bond have been modified, according to the Boston Fed's analysis. Not all of those succeeded, though. Of the 9,393 loans originally in the deal, 14 percent have been modified and are still current on their payments.
Today, the borrowers whose loans were put in the Goldman bond say they have been chastened by their experiences with debt.
"If I could take everything back, I never would have got involved," Mr. Haynes, the Brooklyn resident, said.
Goldman's bond expires many years from now, in 2037. Some borrowers, like Curtis Williams, who borrowed $193,500 in late 2006 against her house in Jacksonville, Fla., and whose loan is part of the Goldman deal, aren't going anywhere.
"As long as I can stay here, I will," she said.
An earlier version of this article misstated the status of a mortgage for Anthony Haynes. New Century did loan him $500,000 against his property, but that mortgage did not find its way into a Goldman deal (the mortgage loan went into another subprime bond).

HEADLINE: Moving Beyond Stop-and-Frisk

BYLINE: By I. BENNETT CAPERS. 
I. Bennett Capers is a professor at Brooklyn Law School and a former federal prosecutor.

 BODY:
MY husband and I are about the same age and build, wear the same clothes and share the same gender, but I am far more likely to be stopped by the police. This isn't because I have a criminal record or engage in furtive movements. Nor is my husband a choirboy. Statistically speaking, it's because I'm black and he's white.
Even before Judge Shira A. Scheindlin of the Federal District Court in Manhattan issued her courageous opinion in the two-month civil rights trial of Floyd v. City of New York on Monday, the numbers bore this out. 
Since 2004, the New York Police Department has stopped more than four million individuals, approximately 84 percent of whom have been black or Hispanic. In one recent year, stops of whites amounted to approximately 2.6 percent of the white population; in contrast, stops of blacks amounted to just over 21 percent of the black population.
According to Jeffrey A. Fagan, a statistician at Columbia Law School who testified on behalf of the plaintiffs, blacks and Hispanics are more likely to be targeted than similarly situated whites, even after adjusting for precinct crime rates, racial demographics and other social and economic factors. For too many officers, male + black = reasonable suspicion.
Judge Scheindlin has thus confirmed what many of us suspected all along. A large number of these stops and frisks failed to satisfy the minimal constitutional requirements that the Supreme Court put in place with its decision in Terry v. Ohio in 1968: for a stop, reasonable and articulable suspicion that a person is engaged in a crime, and for a frisk, reasonable and articulable suspicion that a person is armed and dangerous.
Even more important, Judge Scheindlin found that many stops were based almost entirely on race, in violation of the 14th Amendment's guarantee of equal protection under the law, and that the city has long responded with deliberate indifference.
But even if these practices were constitutional, they're still a bad idea. Of course, one wouldn't know that listening to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg and other true believers, who insist that aggressive stop-and-frisks have reduced violent crime. But they're wrong.
The most obvious reason is the brute numbers. For every 100 individuals stopped and frisked, only about 6 are arrested, often for minor offenses like marijuana possession. The success rate for finding a gun borders on the nonexistent: 1 in every 1,000 stops. In fact, purely random stops have produced better results.
For another thing, the government's reasoning is empirically suspect, and conflates correlation with causation. The homicide rate has been dropping during the time that stop-and-frisk has been policy. By its defenders' logic, stop-and-frisk works -- even though there are many other reasons for the drop in homicides. Moreover, when the number of stops dropped by 20 percent last year, there should have been a corresponding rise in homicides. There wasn't.
And there is a more important argument that isn't captured by the numbers. Aggressive stop-and-frisks sow community distrust of the police and actually inhibit crime control, creating a generation of disaffected minority youths who believe that cops are racists.
Last, the pro-stop-and-frisk camp ignores the strategies other cities have employed to reduce crime without violating civil liberties, like ''focused deterrence,'' which works with communities to go after the few individuals who are typically responsible for driving up crime rates.
None of this means that stop-and-frisk should be junked. As Judge Scheindlin made clear, she is ''not ordering an end'' to stop-and-frisks. She's ordering the police to follow the law.
When my students ask, what should a cop do to ''follow the law,'' I think back to Martin McFadden, the detective in Terry v. Ohio. Detective McFadden, a veteran of the Cleveland police, saw two men he thought were acting suspiciously. But he didn't immediately stop or frisk them. Instead, he took up a post to watch them.
It soon became clear that the men were scoping out a location for a robbery. He watched as one man walked by the spot several times; he then watched the other go through the same motions. Only then, based on his belief that he had seen enough to think the men were ''casing a job, a stickup,'' did he stop and frisk the men, finding two guns.
That's reasonable suspicion. That's good police work.
Instead, the New York Police Department has watered down the standard so that almost any black or Hispanic male can be deemed suspicious without need for further investigation. That means me. Now imagine if it meant you, too.
That still leaves the question, ''What now?'' Mayor Bloomberg is sure to appeal Judge Scheindlin's decision, both in the court of appeals and the court of public opinion. But that's not the only option.
He could actually welcome Judge Scheindlin's decision to appoint an independent monitor to supervise reform. Mr. Bloomberg already claims crime reduction as part of his legacy. It's not too late for him to claim that and more: that he reduced crime and finally did so in a way that was fair, egalitarian and not racially discriminatory. And it's certainly not too late for his successor.
Just imagine what a legacy that would be. And not just for the mayor, but for New York City as well.

HEADLINE: After a Notable Debate, a Verbal Misfire

BYLINE: By MATT SIEGEL

 BODY:
SYDNEY, Australia -- Prime Minister Kevin Rudd of Australia came in for sharp criticism on Monday over his performance in the first leadership debate of the federal election campaign, with opponents publicly accusing him of having cheated by using notecards.
Australia is to vote on Sept. 7 in a contest that pits Mr. Rudd against the leader of the opposition Liberal-National coalition, Tony Abbott. Prime minister from 2007 to 2010, Mr. Rudd returned to the leadership in June after a Labor Party coup that dispatched the country's first female prime minister, Julia Gillard. 
Mr. Rudd and Mr. Abbott faced off Sunday night in a televised debate from the capital, Canberra. Although the contest tackled hot-button issues like same-sex marriage and the flagging health of Australia's resource-driven economy, it was Mr. Rudd's use of props that dominated the headlines.
Senator Mathias Cormann, an opposition campaign spokesman, blasted Mr. Rudd in a radio interview Monday with the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
''He says the election is all about trust and then he cheats in the debate,'' Mr. Cormann said. ''Last night, Tony Abbott was looking like a leader; Kevin Rudd was looking like a reader.''
A spokeswoman for Mr. Rudd defended his use of the notes, which were clearly visible throughout the debate and on which he relied most heavily during his closing arguments, in comments reported by the Australian Associated Press.
''There were no objections raised at any time,'' said the spokeswoman, whose name was not given in keeping with norms for Australian political campaigns. ''We have always believed this rule is aimed at preventing the use of props.''
The contest, although formally set by Mr. Rudd less than a week ago, has effectively been under way since Ms. Gillard announced in January, unusually early, that the elections would be held in September. Ms. Gillard insisted at the time that she was aiming for political stability, but the plan effectively opened a bruising campaign season that will last almost nine months.
Mr. Rudd has recently faced unusually pointed media criticism, particularly from publications owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. Last week, Mr. Rudd blasted Mr. Murdoch, an Australian-American media mogul, after his Sydney-based tabloid, The Daily Telegraph, ran a series of anti-Rudd editorials on its front page. In one, Mr. Rudd was depicted as Colonel Klink from the 1965-71 television comedy ''Hogan's Heroes,'' sporting a Nazi uniform and a monocle.
Reflecting the tenor of the campaign, David Speers, a political editor at the Murdoch-owned satellite news network Sky and the moderator of the debate, defended his conduct after receiving withering criticism on social media.
''I've been copping a lot of flak on Twitter and elsewhere for not jumping in and ripping those notes off Kevin Rudd,'' Mr. Speers said Monday in an interview with ABC Radio. ''Has he broken the rules? Well technically, yes, I think he probably has.''
Whatever the value of focusing on the form over the substance of the debate, the opposition does appear to have a point. Rules released Friday by the National Press Club, which hosted the debate, state, ''The Leaders may have a pen and paper on the lectern and no other documentation or props.''
The news comes at a perilous time for the Labor Party, which dumped the deeply unpopular Ms. Gillard in the hopes of averting a landslide loss that would decimate its ranks in Parliament.
Mr. Rudd's return saw an immediate bounce in the polls for Labor, which has led a tenuous minority government since its poor showing in the last federal elections in 2010. But several recent polls seem to show that initial surge of support having plateaued or even slightly reversed from its peak.
On Monday, Mr. Abbott was gaining headlines of his own after making a gaffe in Melbourne while criticizing Mr. Rudd for his style of decision-making. Mr. Abbott, a Rhodes scholar, said in a speech to his party that ''No one, however smart, however well educated, however experienced, is the suppository of all wisdom,'' when he apparently meant to say ''repository.'' The comment became a sensation on Twitter and other social media.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Kennedy, And What Might Have Been

BYLINE: By MICHIKO KAKUTANI

 BODY:
JFK'S LAST HUNDRED DAYSThe Transformation of a Man and the Emergence of a Great President
By Thurston ClarkeIllustrated. 432 pages. The Penguin Press. $29.95.
As the 50th anniversary this November of the assassination of John F. Kennedy looms on the horizon, the debates over his legacy and presidency continue: a procession of ''what ifs'' and ''might haves beens,'' accompanied by contradictory arguments, and informed and not-so-informed speculation. Would Kennedy have avoided Lyndon B. Johnson's tragic escalation of the war in Vietnam? Would he have found a way to propel his stalled tax-cut bill and civil rights legislation through Congress and start a war on poverty, or was Johnson able to achieve these historic goals only through a combination of his bare-knuckled, tactical knowledge of Congress; his personal relationships on Capitol Hill; and his ability to use the momentum of sentiment generated by Kennedy's death?
Several schools of argument have arisen. The former Kennedy speechwriter Theodore C. Sorensen and the aide Arthur M. Schlesinger Jr. focused on Kennedy's record and the promise of his vision, creating a sort of bildungsroman portrait of the president, as learning and growing on the job. 
Debunkers like Garry Wills and Seymour M. Hersh, by contrast, focused on the dark side of Camelot, suggesting that what they saw as Kennedy's moral shortcomings and recklessness endangered the nation. More judicious and substantive accounts have been provided by Richard Reeves (''President Kennedy: Profile of Power'') and Robert Dallek (''An Unfinished Life: John F. Kennedy, 1917-1963'').
Thurston Clarke's patchy and often reductive new book, ''JFK's Last Hundred Days,'' draws heavily on the Dallek and Reeves books, while attempting to advance variations on arguments made by Sorensen and Schlesinger. Mr. Clarke also contends that during that period Kennedy was ''finally beginning to realize his potential as a man and a president''; just as ''ambition and realpolitik had characterized his congressional career and early White House years, morality and emotion tempered his ambitions during his last hundred days.''
Mr. Clarke also contends that during those days, Kennedy began to show his wife, Jacqueline, ''the marriage they might have had,'' arguing that the death of their premature infant, Patrick, in August 1963 had brought them closer together, and that he seemed to have curtailed his womanizing.
In Mr. Clarke's view, two speeches the president gave in June 1963 -- one proposing negotiations with Moscow to draft a nuclear test ban treaty, the other declaring that ''race has no place in American life or law'' -- represented a turning point in his life, when he went from sailing with the winds of political expediency to embracing principle, as he described some of his heroes doing in ''Profiles in Courage.''
Mr. Clarke made a similar argument about Robert F. Kennedy in his powerful 2008 book, ''The Last Campaign,'' writing that Robert appeared to begin that campaign as a homage to his brother but came into his own, speaking with an inspirational intensity and rawness rarely seen in politics about poverty, racial injustice and the country's unhealed wounds. Others, too, have observed that the quick-tempered, hard-boiled Bobby -- who'd worked for Senator Joseph McCarthy's notorious Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations in the 1950s and who'd been a tough enforcer on Jack's 1960 campaign -- became a more introspective, empathetic man after his brother's assassination; grief and a passion for fighting for the poor had changed him.
This new book, though, lacks the visceral immediacy of ''The Last Campaign,'' and Mr. Clarke is less persuasive making a case for Jack Kennedy's transformation in the last months of his life.
The idea of transformation is deeply appealing: we live in a culture that prizes reinvention and second acts. With John F. Kennedy, however, it's difficult to make a case for dramatic change or to suggest that in June 1963 ''he finally began to be more Irish than Harvard, governing from the heart as well as the head.''
It's difficult partly because, as Mr. Clarke points out, Kennedy was ''one of the most complicated and enigmatic men ever to occupy the White House'': a man who compartmentalized different aspects of his life and who frequently said and did contradictory things. His most essential quality, the literary critic Alfred Kazin is quoted as saying, was ''that of the man who is always making and remaking himself.''
Kennedy's opinions, too, could appear to mutate swiftly, and could be read in numerous ways. Much of the debate over what Kennedy would have eventually done about Vietnam -- find a way to extricate the United States or listen to the same hard-liners who would help persuade Johnson to escalate American involvement -- stems from wildly divergent remarks he made on the subject, remarks subject to a variety of interpretations.
Mr. Clarke says that Kennedy delivered a response to the CBS anchor Walter Cronkite in early September 1963 that was calculated to ''prepare Americans for the possibility that the war might be unwinnable.'' In the final analysis, Kennedy said of the South Vietnamese government: ''It is their war. They are the ones who have to win or lose it.''
A week later, during an interview with David Brinkley and Chet Huntley of NBC News, Kennedy declared that he believed in the domino theory (which held that if South Vietnam fell, the rest of Southeast Asia would go Communist, too), then concluded: ''I think we should stay. We should use our influence in as effective a way as we can, but we should not withdraw.'' Mr. Clarke contends that this statement ''bore no more resemblance to his real intentions than Roosevelt's pledge not to involve America in the Second World War did to his,'' adding, ''Kennedy wanted to placate hawks in the Pentagon and Congress, just as Roosevelt had wanted to placate the isolationists.''
In his 2003 biography, Mr. Dallek wrote that Kennedy's actions and statements ''are suggestive of a carefully managed stand-down from the sort of involvement that occurred under L.B.J.,'' but also noted that ''no one can prove, of course, what Kennedy would have'' actually done.
Mr. Clarke gives us an often vivid portrait of Kennedy as an immensely complex human being: by turns detached and charismatic, a hard-nosed pol and a closet romantic, cautious in his decision making but reckless in his womanizing. His book, however, lacks the granular detail and sober, appraising eye of Mr. Dallek's volume. Too often, Mr. Clarke seems to be cherry-picking details and anecdotes that support his overarching thesis -- that Kennedy began to hit his stride in his last 100 days, starting to emerge as ''a great president'' -- rather than carefully assessing the historical record.
Mr. Clarke focuses, speculatively, on what Kennedy planned to do, rather than on what he achieved, writing that, among other things, the president ''intended to travel to Moscow for a summit meeting with Khrushchev; launch a secret dialogue with Castro; explore the possibility of establishing a relationship with China; withdraw a thousand advisers from Vietnam by the end of 1963 and remove more during 1964; settle the cold war; end the threat of a nuclear war; launch an attack on poverty; pass his tax cut, civil rights and immigration bills; preside over the most robust, full-employment economy in American history; and continue marrying poetry to power and inspiring the young.''
Mr. Clarke plays down, even dismisses, Johnson's extraordinary legislative mojo in getting Kennedy's stalled initiatives passed, making the debatable assertion that Kennedy ''would have succeeded in getting a civil rights bill through Congress, but perhaps not until after the election'' of 1964. He also writes that the Great Society, Johnson's domestic legislative program, ''was largely a compendium of Kennedy's bills and initiatives.''
Such efforts by Mr. Clarke to inflate Kennedy's achievements distract from his actual accomplishments and influence, and they also make this intermittently interesting volume feel like a sentimental work of hagiography.

HEADLINE: Kerry and Colombia Leaders Discuss Guerrilla War and Spying

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO; Susan Abad contributed reporting from Bogotá, Colombia.

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Secretary of State John Kerry met Monday with leaders of Colombia, Washington's top ally in South America, offering support as negotiators move ahead with talks aimed at ending that country's long-running guerrilla war, and seeking to assuage concerns over the scope of the National Security Agency's surveillance practices. 
''We are necessarily engaged in a very complex effort to prevent terrorists from taking innocent lives in many different places,'' Mr. Kerry said at a news conference in Bogotá, Colombia's capital, at the start of a two-day visit to South America that will include meetings on Tuesday in Brazil. He added that American policies ''will be geared in an appropriate way to work with our friends and our partners to respect their laws.''
Mr. Kerry's trip, coming after a visit by President Obama to Mexico and Costa Rica in May, is aimed at bolstering ties in a region where the United States' influence has faded as China has surged as a crucial trading partner for an array of Latin American countries and as Brazil has sought to raise its economic and diplomatic profile.
The United States, which has provided Colombia with more than $8 billion in security and antinarcotics aid since the 1990s, is still channeling more than $300 million a year as the country contends with a five-decade-old insurgency led by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, and resilient drug-trafficking networks.
President Juan Manuel Santos has focused more on integrating the nation with its neighbors while giving economic and social issues more prominence in shaping ties with the United States.
''Santos has been intent on engaging other players in the hemisphere and globally and not being viewed as so tied to Washington,'' said Michael Shifter, president of the Inter-American Dialogue, a Washington policy group.
But even Mr. Santos, a staunch ally of the United States and former defense minister who worked closely with American intelligence agencies, had publicly requested clarification about the American spying.
Colombia's foreign minister, María Angela Holguín, and Mr. Kerry, who met with Mr. Santos, appeared to smooth over differences on spying. Ms. Holguín said conversations with Mr. Kerry and other American officials had been ''very constructive.''

HEADLINE: A Glut of Antidepressants

BYLINE: By RONI CARYN RABIN

 BODY:
Over the past two decades, the use of antidepressants has skyrocketed. One in 10 Americans now takes an antidepressant medication; among women in their 40s and 50s, the figure is one in four.
Experts have offered numerous reasons. Depression is common, and economic struggles have added to our stress and anxiety. Television ads promote antidepressants, and insurance plans usually cover them, even while limiting talk therapy. But a recent study suggests another explanation: that the condition is being overdiagnosed on a remarkable scale.
The study, published in April in the journal Psychotherapy and Psychosomatics, found that nearly two-thirds of a sample of more than 5,000 patients who had been given a diagnosis of depression within the previous 12 months did not meet the criteria for major depressive episode as described by the psychiatrists' bible, the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (or D.S.M.). 
The study is not the first to find that patients frequently get ''false positive'' diagnoses for depression. Several earlier review studies have reported that diagnostic accuracy is low in general practice offices, in large part because serious depression is so rare in that setting.
Elderly patients were most likely to be misdiagnosed, the latest study found. Six out of seven patients age 65 and older who had been given a diagnosis of depression did not fit the criteria. More educated patients and those in poor health were less likely to receive an inaccurate diagnosis.
The vast majority of individuals diagnosed with depression, rightly or wrongly, were given medication, said the paper's lead author, Dr. Ramin Mojtabai, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Most people stay on the drugs, which can have a variety of side effects, for at least two years. Some take them for a decade or more.
''It's not only that physicians are prescribing more, the population is demanding more,'' Dr. Mojtabai said. ''Feelings of sadness, the stresses of daily life and relationship problems can all cause feelings of upset or sadness that may be passing and not last long. But Americans have become more and more willing to use medication to address them.''
By contrast, the Dutch College of General Practitioners last year urged its members to prescribe antidepressants only in severe cases, and instead to offer psychological treatment and other support with daily life. Officials noted that depressive symptoms may be a normal, transient reaction to disappointment or loss.
Ironically, while many patients in the United States are inappropriately diagnosed with depression, many who actually have it suffer without treatment. Dr. Mark Olfson, a professor of clinical psychiatry at Columbia University Medical Center, noted that from the time they develop major depression, it takes Americans eight years on average to seek care.
Diagnosing depression is an inherently subjective task, said Dr. Jeffrey Lieberman, the president of the American Psychiatric Association.
''It would be great if we could do a blood test or a lab test or do an EKG,'' Dr. Lieberman said, noting that similar claims of overtreatment have been made about syndromes like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. ''A diagnosis is made by symptoms and history and observation.''
The new study drew 5,639 individuals who had been diagnosed with depression from among a nationally representative sample of over 75,000 adults who took part in the National Survey of Drug Use and Health in 2009 and 2010. The subjects were then interviewed in person with questions based on the D.S.M.-4 criteria.
Only 38.4 percent of the participants met these criteria for depression during the previous year, Dr. Mojtabai said.
It's possible some of the participants did not appear to be depressed because they had already been successfully treated, said Dr. Jeffrey Cain, the president of the Academy of Family Physicians. Their improved mood may also have colored the way they responded to questions about the past.
''If I'm checking people who are being treated for high blood pressure and taking medication, I would expect it to be better when I'm checking them,'' Dr. Cain said.
According to the D.S.M., a diagnosis of major depressive episode is appropriate if the patient has been in a depressed mood and felt no interest in activities for at least two weeks, and also has at least five symptoms that impair functioning almost every day. These include unintentional weight gain or loss, problems sleeping, agitation or slowed reactions noticed by others, fatigue and low energy, feelings of excessive guilt or worthlessness, difficulty concentrating and recurrent thoughts of death.
''We're not just talking about somebody who's having a bad day or got into an argument with their spouse,'' Dr. Lieberman said. ''We're talking about something that is severe, meaning it's disabling and distressing and is not transient.''
Many doctors have long prescribed antidepressants soon after the death of a family member, even though the D.S.M. urges clinicians to differentiate between normal grief and pathological bereavement.
One 50-year-old New York City woman said her doctor prescribed an antidepressant a few weeks after her husband died, even though she thought her feelings of shock and sadness were appropriate.
''He told me, 'You have to function, you have to keep your job, you have a daughter to raise,' '' said the woman, who asked that her name be withheld because few friends or family members knew she was taking antidepressants.
Most of the study participants were not receiving specialty mental health care, but Dr. Cain pointed out that it was not clear who was making the misdiagnoses: a psychiatrist, non-psychiatrist physician or other provider, like a nurse practitioner.
But while a psychiatrist may spend up to 90 minutes with a patient before making a diagnosis, patients often are more comfortable with their primary care doctors, who rarely have that kind of time.
Dr. Lieberman suggested watchful waiting may be appropriate in some cases, and more integrated forms of health care may soon make it easier to send patients to a mental health provider ''down the hall.''
Doctors need to improve their diagnostic skills, Dr. Mojtabai said, and must resist the temptation ''to take out the prescription pad and write down an antidepressant and hand it to the patient.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Syrian War Shapes Trip by Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff

BYLINE: By THOM SHANKER

 BODY:
TEL AVIV -- The chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff opened a weeklong visit to the Middle East on Monday for discussions on potential additions of American support to Israel and Jordan, which are both facing border-security challenges from the conflict in neighboring Syria.
The chairman, Gen. Martin E. Dempsey, said his talks in Jordan would include an assessment of whether American surveillance aircraft or collaboration on other border-control techniques could help the Jordanians, whose country is the emergency home to tens of thousands of Syrian refugees -- and, increasingly, a route for black-market weapons transported both ways across the Syrian frontier. 
Syria has accused Jordan of acting as a transit point for weapons supplied to Syrian rebels, an accusation Jordan has denied. In recent days, the Jordanian authorities have detained suspected smugglers, including Syrians, accused of attempting to bring antitank missiles, surface-to-air missiles, assault rifles and other arms from Syria into Jordan -- possibly part of an attempt by jihadists in Syria to foment unrest in Jordan as well.
The Pentagon already has deployed air-defense missile batteries in Jordan, along with crewed F-16s to train alongside the Jordanian Air Force in patrolling Jordan's border and airspace. A few hundred American military planners, including communications experts and logisticians, also are in Jordan.
In some of his most extensive comments on the Syrian crisis to date, General Dempsey noted that cooperation flows both ways, in particular as the United States has benefited from local intelligence efforts tracking Syrian chemical weapons.
''Probably the single point of greatest collaboration with Israel, Jordan and the United States is in identifying the potential chemical threat, its location, trying to determine the intentions of the Syrian regime,'' General Dempsey said.
The Syrian government's chemical munitions, he said, still are moved ''from time to time'' around the country, likely a reflection of the government's concerns that if the weapons remained in one place they could be located and seized by rebels. ''It appears the regime is moving it to secure it,'' General Dempsey said. ''But that could change.''
Early in the Syrian crisis, President Obama declared the use of chemical weapons to be a ''red line'' leading to American action. That talk has faded as both the Syrian government and the militias have been accused of limited use of chemical arms.
The most feared outcome would be for the government's large stockpile of chemical arms to be seized by radical groups amid the chaos, and there appears to be a tacit assent for the Assad government to do all it can to secure those weapons, even if that requires shifting them around the country.
In statements to Congress, General Dempsey has warned of the costs and risks of direct American military intervention in the Syrian civil war, and in a discussion with correspondents here on Monday he made the administration's case for seeking ''to influence through the support of a moderate opposition and, importantly, through increasing the capabilities of our partners.''
He cited cooperation with Israel, Jordan, Turkey, Lebanon and even Iraq, and described expanding American efforts to identify and assist moderate elements of the rebel movement.
''I am very concerned about the radical element of the opposition, and I am concerned about the potential that extremist ideologies will hijack what started out to be a popular movement to overthrow an oppressive regime,'' he said.
He acknowledged that radical militias, which assumed an ascendant role in the civil war about six months ago, remained a powerful force with some of the best fighters on the rebel side. But in the last six months, he said, the United States has increased its ability to identify moderate opposition leaders, and to begin communicating with them in substantive ways.
Even so, he acknowledged that battlefield necessity may require radical and moderate militias to cooperate for tactical gains against the Assad government -- a convergence that would complicate American and allied policy making.
''It doesn't surprise me that from time to time they collaborate with each other,'' he said. ''What we have to be alert for are opportunities to convince the more moderate aspects of the opposition that Syria will be a far better place if the moderate opposition dominates in the end game.''
But the general's immediate prognosis for Syria was grim, and he said any planning for supporting the opposition, assisting refugees and strengthening allied security forces required a much longer view than has informed much of the policy debate in Washington.
''The issues that are fueling the conflict in Syria will not be resolved in the short term, even if the Assad regime were to fail tomorrow,'' he said.
''This is a regional conflict that stretches from Beirut to Damascus to Baghdad,'' he said. ''It is the unleashing of historic ethnic, religious and tribal animosities that will take a great deal of work and a great deal of time to resolve.''

HEADLINE: New Laws and Rising Costs Create a Surge of Supersizing Hospitals

BYLINE: By JULIE CRESWELL and REED ABELSON

 BODY:
Hospitals across the nation are being swept up in the biggest wave of mergers since the 1990s, a development that is creating giant hospital systems that could one day dominate American health care and drive up costs.
The consolidations are being driven by a confluence of powerful forces, not least of which is President Obama's signature health care law, the Affordable Care Act. That law, many experts say, is transforming the economics of health care and pushing a growing number of hospitals into the arms of suitors.
The changes are unfolding with remarkable speed. Two big for-profit hospital chains, Community Health Systems of Tennessee and Health Management Associates of Florida, are combining in a $7.6 billion deal. 
In New York City, Mount Sinai Medical Center, which is one of the country's oldest and largest private nonprofit hospitals, is buying the parent of Beth Israel Medical Center and St. Luke's and Roosevelt Hospitals. Tenet Healthcare of Dallas, which operates in 10 states, is buying Vanguard Health Systems of Nashville, a network of 28 hospitals and facilities that includes Detroit Medical Center.
In fact, Booz & Company, a consulting firm, predicts that 1,000 of the nation's roughly 5,000 hospitals could seek out mergers in the next five to seven years.
''There's immense logic for them to become large super-regional systems, even some national systems,'' said David W. Johnson, a managing director for BMO Capital Markets, which advises nonprofit health systems. Some chains are merging to increase their size and their negotiating clout with insurers, while others are trying to reduce costs and improve care, he said.
Some economists and health insurance companies worry that the trend could raise health care costs.
''The rhetoric is all about efficiency,'' said Karen Ignagni, the chief executive of America's Health Insurance Plans, a trade group that represents insurers. ''The reality is all about higher prices.''
Whatever the outcome, hospitals are merging faster and in greater numbers than they have in years. After holding steady through much of the 2000s, the number of deals doubled to 105 in 2012 from 50 in 2009, according to Irving Levin Associates, a health care research firm. That is still less than half the annual peak during the last merger wave, in the late 1990s, but Booz and others say this is only the beginning.
Hospital executives say they have little choice but to combine given the coming changes in the industry. Many hospitals are struggling with lower payments from the federal government and declining patient admissions. They are also being confronted with fundamental changes in how they are paid under the Affordable Care Act and by private insurers.
Instead of being paid on volume, rewarded for filling beds and performing more tests and procedures, hospitals are becoming responsible for more of the total cost of a patient's care. As a result, they have an incentive to keep patients healthy -- and out of their facilities.
By combining, hospitals can reduce costs in back-office activities like billing and devote more financial resources to investing in expensive electronic medical records systems and physician practices to better follow patients outside the hospital. Under the new state exchanges created by the federal health care law, consumers will be able to tell the difference in hospital prices between markets that have consolidated and those that have not, Ms. Ignagni said.
The plans have similar designs, but a policy offered by the same insurer in, for instance, Northern California, where hospitals have merged, will be more expensive than one offered in Southern California, where the systems are smaller, she said.
Federal regulators are concerned that the growing number of mergers could lead to anticompetitive practices. The Federal Trade Commission has increased its examination of the deals and has blocked a handful of transactions.
Last year, two hospital chains in Illinois, OSF Healthcare System of Illinois and Rockford Health System, abandoned plans to merge after the F.T.C. challenged the deal on the expectation that the combined hospitals would control 64 percent of acute-care inpatient services. That, regulators said, would allow the combined entity to raise rates and ''impose a financial burden on local employers and employees,'' through higher insurance premiums, co-pays and out-of-pocket expenses.
For the most part, however, the mergers continue unchallenged among for-profit systems as well as nonprofit hospitals.
Roman Catholic-sponsored systems have formed some of the first national nonprofit chains, and some worry that Catholic hospitals' growth and acquisitions of non-Catholic hospitals could limit patient access to services like birth control.
In May, for example, Trinity Health and Catholic Health East joined forces to create an 82-hospital system in 21 states. Ascension Health, the largest Catholic nonprofit health system, added 35 hospitals to its network of 78 this year when it closed a deal to acquire a hospital system based in Tulsa, Okla. Ascension has teamed with Oak Hill Capital Partners, a private investment firm, to help finance some of its purchases in the future.
''There isn't an independent hospital out there that is not thinking about this,'' said Gary Ahlquist, a senior partner at Booz, the consulting firm, referring to the mergers. ''At the top of the list is the question, Who should I merge with?''
The last wave of mergers took place in the mid-1990s as hospitals joined forces to combat the potential threat from managed care and a giant for-profit chain now called HCA Healthcare. As those threats receded, mergers slowed.
''Today, the motivations for mergers are a lot broader,'' said Paul Ginsburg, the president of the Center for Studying Health System Change.
''These independents, or smaller hospitals, are very worried about their ability to do well in the future,'' he said.
Analysts say there is not a one-size-fits-all model for this merger wave. While some systems are fanning out across the country, others appear to be focusing on a certain state or region.
But as the hospital merger boom continues, hospitals fiercely holding onto their independence may find it more difficult to compete against bigger, leaner organizations, say analysts.
''There are hospitals out there that have been independent for 80 years and they're saying, 'We're going to be independent for the next 100 years,' '' said Lisa Goldstein, an analyst of nonprofit hospitals at Moody's Investors Service. ''That's going to be a tall order. As other hospitals consolidate and grow around you, whatever niche you had will vaporize.''

HEADLINE: One-State Dream, One-State Nightmare

BYLINE: By ROGER COHEN

 BODY:
TEL AVIV -- Let us deal, on the eve of the first direct peace talks between Israelis and Palestinians in almost three years, with the idea of one state. It hovers out there -- as dream and as nightmare -- and is best laid to rest.
First the dream: That somehow after all the wars and accumulation of hatred, Israelis and Palestinians can learn overnight to live together as equal citizens in some United States of the Holy Land, a binational and democratic secular state that resolves their differences and assures their intertwined futures. 
Oh, what a seductive illusion (at least to some). Let's set aside for a moment that the regional examples of such multiethnic states -- Lebanon, Iraq and Syria come to mind -- are not encouraging. Let's set aside that such a state would have a hard time every May deciding whether to mark a Day of Independence for its Jewish citizens or a Day of Catastrophe for its Arab citizens.
Let's set aside whether the Jabotinsky Streets of the imaginary country dear to the one-state brigade would become Arafat Streets, or vice versa, and whether to have a Begin Avenue or a Grand Mufti al-Husseini Boulevard. Let's even set aside the fact that the two principal communities would be in constant, paralyzing battle, causing the best and the brightest to go elsewhere in search of opportunity and sanity.
The central issue is this: One state, however conceived, equals the end of Israel as a Jewish state, the core of the Zionist idea. Jews will not, cannot and must not allow this to happen. They have learned how dangerous it is to live without a certain refuge, as minorities, and will not again place their faith in the good will of others, nor trust in touchy-feely hope over bitter experience.
That is the ineradicable legacy of diaspora persecution and of the Holocaust. Emerging in the 19th century from the static ghetto into the Sturm und Drang of the modern world, the Jews saw two principle routes to emancipation: assimilation and Zionism.
The former was seductive. At first it offered rapid advancement, before it became clear that in this very advancement lay danger. It was a wager on acceptance that the Jews of Europe lost to Hitler: No citizen was more patriotic than the prewar German Jew.
Zionism, by contrast, placed no faith in others' good will. It sought, rather, to usher Jews to the full realization of their nationhood and so, in a sense, normalize them -- make them patriotic about something that was their own.
The world, in the form of the United Nations, upheld this quest in 1947, voting for the division of Mandate Palestine into two states, one Jewish and one Arab. Arab armies went to war -- and the rest is history, including the now almost half-century-old occupation of the West Bank and Israeli dominion over millions of disenfranchised Palestinians.
And that brings us to one state as nightmare, which is what Israel, an extraordinary success story in many regards, faces today. The only way out of this nightmare is two states, one Israeli and one viable, contiguous Palestinian state living in peace and security beside it.
I sat with Yair Lapid, Israel's centrist finance minister, son of a survivor of Nazi-occupied Hungary, grandson of a Hungarian Jew slaughtered in the camps, and he told me of his father's repeated lesson: that he came to and fought for Israel so that Jews would ''always have a place to go to.''
He said: ''I have a lot of respect for the ethos of Greater Israel. I grew up in a house using this language. But we do understand that in the long term, if we stay there, that will be the end of the Zionist idea. We cannot live in one state. This will be a version of one state for two nations, and that this is the end of Zionism. Eventually the Palestinians will come to us and say, O.K., you decided we are not going to have a country at all, so we want to vote. If you say no, you are South Africa in its worst days. If you say yes, it is the end of the Jewish country, and I want to live in a Jewish country.''
Lapid argued that the all-the-land absolutists -- Economics Minister Naftali Bennett and Deputy Foreign Minister Zeev Elkin among them -- are, in their rejection of the two-state idea, undermining the idea of a Jewish state over time and so undercutting the core of Zionism and his own father's life-shaping message. He is right.
Lapid later issued a statement criticizing Israel's decision to publish construction bids Sunday for more than 1,000 housing units in contested East Jerusalem and several West Bank settlements. ''To poke sticks in the wheels of peace talks is not right,'' he said, ''and not helpful to the process.'' Right again.
One state as delusional fantasy of some Middle Eastern idyll and one state as nightmarish temptation involving the indefinite Israeli subjugation of another people are equally unacceptable.
As the Talmud says, hold too much and you will hold nothing.

HEADLINE: Film On Kochs Has Funds Restored

BYLINE: By BRIAN STELTER

 BODY:
One year ago, the filmmakers Tia Lessin and Carl Deal thought they had hit the public television jackpot. ITVS, an arm of public television that finances independent documentaries, had signaled interest in subsidizing and broadcasting a film about the influence of big-dollar donors on elections. At the time, Ms. Lessin and Mr. Deal were calling their documentary ''Citizen Corp,'' and they were expecting $150,000 from ITVS to help them finish producing it.
Then a few things happened. Last fall, the film was renamed ''Citizen Koch,'' a reference to Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch, the billionaire industrialists who are major supporters of conservative causes. Around the same time, ITVS (through its ''Independent Lens'' series) gave the premiere of a film called ''Park Avenue: Money, Power & the American Dream,'' which was critical of David Koch and other rich New Yorkers. That film caused heartburn at WNET, the powerhouse PBS station in New York, where Mr. Koch was a benefactor and board member. By April, a few months after ''Citizen Koch'' had its premiere at the Sundance Film Festival, the $150,000 expected from ITVS had evaporated. 
Now the money is back, but from a new source. After ITVS told Ms. Lessin and Mr. Deal that it was not going to finance the film or consider it for ''Independent Lens,'' spurring accusations of self-censorship, the filmmakers set up a fund-raising drive on Kickstarter. Last week, that drive passed the $150,000 mark, more than twice the original goal, in effect replacing all the money that ITVS had rescinded. Kickstarter said the number of backers -- 3,400 -- put ''Citizen Koch'' in the top 1 percent of all the campaigns the Web site has hosted.
But the filmmakers still do not know how the documentary will be distributed, beyond the DVDs they have pledged to send their Kickstarter supporters. They have looked at streaming services like Netflix; there have been conversations about a theatrical release, too. But PBS stations (by virtue of their being beamed over the public airwaves) are among the preferred ways for documentaries to reach audiences, and the best route to the stations -- through ITVS -- appears blocked.
On Tuesday, a coalition of progressive groups, including New York's liberal Working Families Party, said they would deliver a petition with more than 300,000 signatures to WNET's offices, calling on PBS to show the film. PBS, for its part, says it is not involved; any decisions rest with ITVS, which has a board that selects films for ''Independent Lens,'' which is then carried by stations.
ITVS declined to answer questions about the film. The organization has not responded to a nine-page letter sent six weeks ago by a First Amendment lawyer retained by Ms. Lessin and Mr. Deal. That letter, unpublicized until now, called on the organization to investigate what happened with ''Citizen Koch'' and to institute reforms.
''Do you think ITVS will reverse itself?'' Ms. Lessin said in an interview. ''They haven't given any indication they will.''
Mr. Deal said: ''We're holding out hope. Our door is open.''
In a statement last spring, ITVS characterized what happened as a mundane editorial choice: ''ITVS began negotiations to fund the film 'Citizen Corp' based on a written proposal. Cuts of the film did not reflect the proposal, however, and ITVS ceased negotiations.''
The filmmakers say that is not true. The film, they assert, was always intended to focus on the 2012 Wisconsin recall election, in which the incumbent Republican governor, Scott Walker, was supported by the Kochs and other wealthy conservatives. ''We didn't insert them in the film -- they inserted themselves into the film we were making,'' Mr. Deal said.
The filmmakers meticulously documented -- and, in May, shared with The New Yorker writer Jane Mayer -- their back-and-forth with ITVS officials, which show that in December, weeks after the ''Park Avenue'' film (by the widely respected documentarian Alex Gibney) was televised, ITVS officials bristled at the addition of the Koch name in the title and demanded that it be changed. (One called the title ''extraordinarily problematic,'' they say.)
The WNET president, Neal Shapiro, meanwhile, was furious with ITVS for not giving him notice about the content of ''Park Avenue'' -- so much so that, according to The New Yorker, he ''threatened not to carry its films in the future.''
There is no straight line from Mr. Koch to ITVS's change toward ''Citizen Koch;'' the PBS ombudsman Michael Getler said flatly in May that ''there is no evidence that David Koch interfered with or tried to censor these films.'' That same month, Mr. Koch resigned from the board of WNET; when asked why on Monday, a spokeswoman for Mr. Koch did not respond to a request for comment.
But ''Citizen Koch'' has clearly benefited from fears about corporate influence over public television and, in particular, over ITVS, which has historically prided itself on its independence. ''Donors' money shouldn't be dictating programming or editorial choices,'' Ms. Lessin said.
For progressive groups, some of which view outsize political spending by Mr. Koch and his brother as a grave threat to democracy, the issues surrounding the film play into a larger, more distressing plotline involving the family's media interests. Last month, Charles Koch confirmed speculation that he and David Koch might be interested in buying the Tribune Company's newspapers, including The Los Angeles Times, in the future.
''The Koch brothers try to purchase cultural respectability on the one hand, even as they advance a hard-right economic agenda,'' said Dan Cantor, the executive director of the Working Families Party, which has not previously organized its members around media issues. He said the party was ''flabbergasted'' by the response to its petition to PBS, which MoveOn, Credo and other advocacy groups also promoted.
Mr. Cantor said he has not seen the film yet. Neither has Mr. Shapiro of WNET, who suggested in a telephone conversation on Monday that invective aimed toward his station is misplaced.
''We have a history of running controversial films; we don't shy away from them,'' he said, also pointing out that programs like ''NewsHour'' and ''Frontline'' have repeatedly examined the intersection of money and politics. But WNET does not schedule documentaries on its own; ITVS does.
For now, what the filmmakers have are fresh funds, thanks to the Web. And one more thing that filmmakers everywhere cherish: persuasive evidence, via the fund-raising drive and the petition, that thousands of people want to watch what they have produced.

HEADLINE: Suit Accuses Online Lender of Violating New York Rate Caps

BYLINE: By JESSICA SILVER-GREENBERG

 BODY:
New York State's top prosecutor filed suit on Monday against an online lender that offers short-term loans at interest rates of more than 300 percent, the latest warning shot in a sweeping battle by state authorities to enforce local interest rate caps.
Eric T. Schneiderman, the New York State attorney general, sued Western Sky Financial and its affiliates, which claim connections to American Indian tribes -- ties that the lenders have argued immunize them from federal and state laws. 
Visitors to Western Sky's Web site are greeted by a logo of three tepees against a yellow sky. The lender, which says it operates ''within the exterior boundaries of the Cheyenne River Sioux Reservation'' in South Dakota, has argued that the tribal affiliation puts Western Sky beyond the reach of state regulators, including Mr. Schneiderman.
Mr. Schneiderman was not convinced. In the lawsuit, which was filed in the State Supreme Court, Mr. Schneiderman accused Western Sky and its affiliates of violating state usury laws that cap interest rates on loans at 25 percent.
From their perch online, the lawsuit said, the so-called payday lenders engage in ''an illegal and deceptive scheme to originate high-interest, personal loans to consumers in New York.''
Mr. Schneiderman's office contends that Western Sky and its affiliates have made at least 17,970 costly loans to New York residents since 2010. The interest and fees alone, the lawsuit says, amount to nearly $185 million. The lender, Mr. Schneiderman said in the suit, ''preys upon New York consumers facing financial hardships with limited options.''
A spokeswoman for Western Sky said that it had not ''had the opportunity to review the complaint,'' adding that the company was confident ''that we have complied with applicable laws in our business practices, and we stand behind those practices.''
Springing from an investigation that began last year, the lawsuit aims to stop the companies from making more loans in the state and to void those loans that they have already made. Mr. Schneiderman is also looking to extract tens of millions of dollars from the lenders -- a sum that consists of a fine and a refund to New York borrowers of all the interest payments made in excess of the state's interest rate caps.
In his suit, Mr. Schneiderman outlined his suspicions about how the operations work. Once consumers apply for loans through Western Sky's Web site, their applications are shuttled to subsidiaries in California, which finance the loans, the suit said. The arrangement, the suit said, means that the loans are in Western Sky's ''name only,'' while the subsidiaries ''bear the risk.''
With his action on Monday, Mr. Schneiderman joined a group of state prosecutors fighting to keep online lenders from flouting state restrictions on the loans -- a campaign that has gained urgency as government officials try to shield residents, desperate for cash, from the expensive loans.
Almost since their inception two decades ago as storefront check-cashing stores, payday lenders have been controversial. As states have imposed interest rate caps, the lenders have shifted their operations to more hospitable places, including Belize, Malta and the West Indies, where they can more easily evade the statewide ceilings on interest rates. Extolling the benefits of operating offshore in a 2005 deposition, one payday lender put it starkly: the move to foreign places offers ''lawsuit protection and tax reduction.''
Facing increasingly hostile state laws, several lenders, including Western Sky, are forging ties with American Indian reservations. Through these pacts, the lenders argue, they are part of a ''sovereign nation'' and not subject federal and state laws. Still, the prosecutors are redoubling their efforts to police the lenders. In at least nine states, including Colorado and Missouri, regulators have taken aim at the lenders with ties to Indian tribes.
New York State's action against Western Sky follows other regulatory moves. In April, Western Sky was fined by Oregon's Department of Consumer and Business Services, which accused it of promoting loans with interest rates of 342 percent ''through an aggressive TV and radio advertising campaign.'' Lori Swanson, the attorney general of Minnesota, sued Western Sky, accusing it of violating a state cap on interest rates.
Minnesota acted after Colorado's attorney general sued Western Sky in 2011, accusing it of illegally making roughly 200 loans to state residents. In a promising move for Colorado, a district court judge said in May that the lenders' tribal ties did not shield Western Sky from state law. The judge noted that borrowers obtain the loans while living in Colorado, not on the reservation.
The company has said that it ''is the largest private employer on the impoverished Cheyenne River Indian Reservation.'' Now, the battle with Western Sky is shifting to New York. Last week, Benjamin M. Lawsky, New York's top banking regulator, sent letters to the company and 34 other online lenders, ordering them to ''cease and desist'' from making the ''illegal'' loans, according to documents reviewed by The New York Times.
New York authorities are also scrutinizing the banks that provide a critical gateway for the lenders to gain access to borrowers' bank accounts. The banks, state officials say, enable the lenders to automatically withdraw loan payments from borrowers' checking accounts, even in states where the loans are effectively outlawed.
Last week, Mr. Lawsky implored 117 banks to stop the online lenders from gaining access to New York residents' checking accounts.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: Tesla's Chief Shows Off High-Speed Train Plan

BYLINE: By NICK BILTON

 BODY:
Never let it be said that Elon Musk, a serial entrepreneur who was a co-founder of PayPal and the electric car company Tesla Motors, is afraid to think big.
Mr. Musk on Monday harked back to the days of the late-1990s tech bubble -- when no idea seemed too big or too expensive -- by showing off plans for a project that seems the stuff of science fiction.
The hypothetical project is called the Hyperloop, a high-speed train that would take people to San Francisco from Los Angeles in 30 minutes. That is a speed of almost 800 miles an hour. 
The first unanswered question among many for Mr. Musk's ambitious vision is who exactly would build this 400-mile transportation system. Mr. Musk suggested someone else should do it. But if no one takes the baton, he might do it. Or not.
Beyond that, the details of who would pay for Hyperloop, how it would be built and how long it would take are also unclear. But Mr. Musk theorized that if he devoted all of his energy, he could have a prototype done within one to two years. He estimated the project would cost around $6 billion and tickets would cost $20 per trip.
''It doesn't seem plausible to me,'' said Richard White, a professor of American history at Stanford and author of ''Railroaded: The Transcontinentals and the Making of Modern America.'' ''I'm suspicious about everything, especially cost.''
Mr. White added, ''How's he going to build this thing for $6 billion? You can't even build the Bay Bridge for that much money.'' The still-unfinished renovations of the Bay Bridge connecting San Francisco and Oakland are expected to cost $6.3 billion.
So don't pack your bags just yet. In an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek on Monday, Mr. Musk said he regretted mentioning the Hyperloop last year, saying that he has no time to work on the project and instead has to run SpaceX and Tesla Motors, his two other companies.
Mr. Musk first mentioned Hyperloop last summer and detailed it further in an interview with Bloomberg Businessweek. In July, he announced on Twitter that he would unveil the designs for the high-speed train on Aug. 12. As promised, a 57-page ''alpha design'' plan was posted online Monday that explained how such a train would work.
Mr. Musk has clearly put a lot of thought into the design. The document he unveiled explains that the high-speed train would become ''truly a new mode of transport -- a fifth mode after planes, trains, cars and boats.'' The Hyperloop would transport people in ''pods'' that would travel through tubes. The tubes would be mounted on pylons that could be designed to withstand earthquake movements.
Mr. Musk took swipes at the California High Speed Rail that is being built and headed by the California High-Speed Rail Authority. This train, while real, is not expected to be completed until 2029 and will cost an estimated $68.4 billion to build.
''When the California 'high speed' rail was approved, I was quite disappointed, as I know many others were too,'' Mr. Musk wrote, while saying that the Hyperloop would cost $6 billion to build. It is not clear how he arrived at this cost estimate.
If anyone could build such a train, it is probably Mr. Musk. Critics railed against him when he first broached the idea for private space travel with Space Exploration Technologies, of Hawthorne, Calif. Otherwise known as SpaceX, Mr. Musk's company proved critics wrong last year when it launched its Falcon 9 rocket.
But Mr. Musk's assertion that he does not want to be the leader of the Hyperloop project has some people wondering if it will actually be built.
During a news conference, Mr. Musk seemed to waver over whether he wanted to be involved with the project. ''I'm somewhat tempted to at least make a demonstration prototype,'' he said. ''I've sort of come around a little bit on my thinking here that maybe I should do the beginning bit and build a subscale version that's operating.''
In the paper released Monday, Mr. Musk acknowledged that there had been other proposed ideas for a train similar to the high-speed train over the years. ''Unfortunately,'' he wrote, ''none of these have panned out.''
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

HEADLINE: In Move for Economy, Mexican President Seeks Foreign Investment in Energy

BYLINE: By ELISABETH MALKIN

 BODY:
MEXICO CITY -- President Enrique Peña Nieto of Mexico on Monday, pushing one of the most sweeping economic overhauls here in the past two decades, proposed opening his country's historically closed energy industry to foreign investment.
The president's plan, which would rewrite two constitutional amendments, challenges a bedrock assumption of Mexico's national identity -- its total sovereignty over its energy resources -- by inviting private companies to explore and pump for oil and natural gas.
Mr. Pena Nieto's goal, like those of presidents before him, is to recharge Mexico's economy by tackling areas that analysts agree hinder its expansion, which has averaged just 2.2 percent a year since 2001, according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. 
Perhaps the worst of those is the creaky energy sector. Demand for energy in the country is growing so fast that Mexico could turn from an energy exporter to an energy importer by 2020, the government says.
Already, Mexico must import almost half its gasoline, mostly from the United States. Mexican companies pay 25 percent more for electricity than competitors in other countries, the government says. Although Mexico has some of the world's largest reserves of shale gas, it imports one-third of its natural gas.
In advancing the plan, Mr. Peña Nieto is making a gamble that the support he has built with opposition parties to make deep changes in education and telecommunications policy will carry over into the debate over energy and a related tax proposal he will send to Congress next month.
''With the reform that we are presenting, we will make the energy sector one of the most powerful engines in the economy,'' Mr. Peña Nieto said at a ceremony to present the plan on Monday.
So far, Mr. Peña Nieto has proved astute at negotiating changes based on a list of commitments that all three major political parties agreed on last December. He has been helped by the two main opposition parties' weakness after the 2012 election, which gave Mr. Peña Nieto's Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, a majority in Congress.
But his two major victories in education and telecommunications were comparatively easy. There was already consensus on the need to rein in the power of the teachers' union and the companies that control telecommunications and television broadcasting.
In energy, the divisions are much deeper. In particular, Mexico's left-wing parties have been adamant that the Constitution's 75-year-old prohibition on private investment should remain ironclad. From the right, the National Action Party, or PAN, proposed energy reform last month that would go even further than Mr. Peña Nieto to invite in private investment.
Public opinion is also suspicious about opening up the industry. A survey last year by CIDE, a Mexico City university, found that 65 percent of the public opposed private investment in Pemex, the state-owned oil monopoly.
''The entire energy reform is a potential source of conflict,'' said Luis Miguel Labardini, a consultant with Marcos y Asociados, a Mexican energy consulting firm. ''Sometimes in Mexico we are conflict-averse.''
The proposal would allow private companies to negotiate profit-sharing contracts with the government to drill for oil and gas. Under such a scheme, the reserves would continue to belong to the Mexican state, but investors would get a share of the profits. Private investment would be allowed in refining, oil pipelines, and petrochemical production.
Although most analysts believe that Mr. Peña Nieto has the votes in Congress to pass the reform if the PAN votes along with his party, the president appears to want to sway public opinion, as suggested by his decision to make a prime-time televised address on the subject Monday.
''It is fine to appeal to rationality, but when it is about these issues, it's indispensable to touch the audience's heart,'' wrote an analyst, María Amparo Casar, in the Excelsior newspaper last week.
The left-wing leader, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who won more than 30 percent of the vote in last year's general election, is planning street marches to protest the change. If he succeeds in filling the streets of the capital it may be harder for party leaders to stand behind the plan.
Since the 1994 North American Free Trade Agreement exempted energy from Mexico's broad economic opening, presidents have attempted to loosen the prohibitions that give Pemex sole control over all oil and gas exploration and production. No joint ventures are allowed. Those past proposals have often withered in Congress.
But this time, the precipitous decline of Mexico's energy industry may work in Mr. Peña Nieto's favor.
Pemex, which was long an important source of crude imports into the United States, is spending more to pump less. As Mexico's giant Cantarell oil field in the shallow waters of the Gulf of Mexico has declined, production has dropped 25 percent from the peak in 2004, to just over 2.5 million barrels of oil a day.
At the same time, the amount the government budgets for Pemex to invest has steadily climbed to $26 billion this year. To increase production and reserves, Pemex needs to drill in the deep waters of the Gulf of Mexico and in onshore deposits of shale oil and gas. But the company has neither the capital nor the expertise to increase production significantly, analysts say.

HEADLINE: Don't Kill Fannie Mae

BYLINE: By JOE NOCERA. 
David Brooks is off today.

 BODY:
Could it get any worse for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac? Last week, even President Obama joined the growing chorus of those who want to put them out of business.
He did so in a speech in Phoenix, outlining -- at long last -- his ideas for reshaping the country's housing finance system. He called for the housing finance market to be primarily driven by private capital, with a ''limited'' federal role. He said that the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage should remain a mainstay of the mortgage market. And he essentially endorsed a recent bipartisan Senate bill -- a complex piece of legislation that calls for winding down Fannie and Freddie over five years.
Let's just call this what it is: capitulation. Every since the financial crisis, Republicans have insisted that Fannie and Freddie -- private companies that also have a government role, and that guarantee and securitize mortgages -- were the root problem. According to their theory, the two companies drove the country off the subprime cliff, primarily because of their federal mandate to help make it possible for low-income borrowers to own homes. 
The truth is pretty much the opposite. When the banks first jumped into subprime mortgages, Fannie and Freddie hung back. Only after they began losing significant market share did Fannie and Freddie decide, belatedly, to get into the game. Because they were so thinly capitalized, they had almost no cushion when the losses began to pile up.
And after the George W. Bush administration put Fannie and Freddie into conservatorship -- propping them up with a $185 billion bailout -- they had no defenders left. Republican demands that Fannie and Freddie be put out of their misery became the sine qua non for any discussion about reshaping -- and reviving -- housing finance.
There is no question that Fannie and Freddie were deeply problematic companies in their heyday. They bullied anyone -- members of Congress included -- who tried to rein them in. They had implicit government backing that they either played up or denied, depending on the circumstances. And in addition to their guarantee business, they owned a gigantic portfolio of mortgages that many feared would bring them down.
But they also did something truly vital. When Fannie or Freddie guaranteed a mortgage, it meant that they were taking on the credit risk from the lender. That entailed two skills. The first was underwriting. Until they lost their heads in the subprime bubble, Fannie and Freddie had high underwriting standards that banks had to adhere to get a mortgage guaranteed. Second, they had to have a highly skilled hedging operation that could maneuver adeptly as interest rates changed.
And that ability of Fannie and Freddie to take on credit risk is what made that staple of American housing finance -- the 30-year fixed-rate mortgage -- possible. So much can happen over the course of 30 years that no bank wants to take on that risk -- and no system of private capital is going to continue making those loans, at least not without some kind of government backing.
Which is why all this talk of ''winding down'' Fannie and Freddie, as the president put it last week, makes so little sense. In conservatorship, the two companies have been doing exactly what the country needs from them: guaranteeing prime mortgages and propping up the housing market after private capital fled.
The Senate bill under consideration does backward somersaults to kill off Fannie and Freddie while retaining a government role in the mortgage market, including the creation of a new agency to serve as a backstop to the securitization market. It is incredibly complicated, untested and probably unnecessary.
In five years as wards of the government, Fannie and Freddie have actually shown the kind of role they could play. They are no longer bullies. They don't really function as private companies anymore -- nor do they have a mission to help people gain the American dream. Their portfolio is supposed to be gradually unwound. They have more capital.
In other words, their sole role now is to guarantee and securitize mortgages. And they are making huge amounts of money -- much of which is going to the government. Fannie Mae, for instance, recently announced a quarterly profit of $10.1 billion, and said it was making a $10.2 billion payment to Treasury. ''At the current pace,'' The Wall Street Journal reported, ''over the next year, Fannie and Freddie are likely to repay the government more money than they borrowed.''
Does housing finance need reform? Yes. Do we need private capital to return? Of course. But the easiest and most sensible reforms would take advantage of what we already have -- two companies that know how to handle credit risk -- instead of trying something new and untested, purely because Fannie and Freddie are political poison.
In the meantime, we should be thanking Fannie and Freddie, instead of tearing them down.

HEADLINE: Stringer Goes After Spitzer During a Blistering Debate

BYLINE: By KATE TAYLOR

 BODY:
The second face-off between the Democratic candidates for New York City comptroller was even nastier than the first.
In a blistering hourlong debate, Scott M. Stringer, the typically mild-mannered Manhattan borough president, leveled a series of attacks that seemed to catch Eliot Spitzer, the former governor, onetime prosecutor and self-described ''steamroller,'' off balance.
Early in the debate, after Mr. Spitzer said that the middle class trusted him because, as attorney general, he had stood up to Wall Street and investigated the lending practices that led to the financial crisis, Mr. Stringer responded with a stinging rebuke. 
''They don't trust you, because you let them down,'' he said. ''Even if what you're saying is true -- that somehow you could foresee the financial calamity, which is, I would say, a stretch at best -- when you became governor, you didn't protect the people from the calamity. You resigned in disgrace.''
He continued: ''So you talk a good game fighting for the middle class, but when it was on your watch, when you had an opportunity to make a difference for all the people who were in those mortgages, for the people who were trying to struggle to put food on the table in one of the greatest fiscal calamities of our generation, you dropped the ball, and you had to leave.''
Later, after Mr. Spitzer attacked Mr. Stringer for supporting the lifting of term limits, which allowed Mr. Bloomberg to run for a third term, Mr. Stringer said that he had campaigned with Mr. Bloomberg's Democratic opponent, William C. Thompson Jr., and noted that Mr. Spitzer had not played a role in the 2009 mayoral election.
''Now part of the reason why you were sidelined is because you left during a federal investigation; I understand that,'' he went on. ''But what you did is you didn't go to help the Democrats take back City Hall. You went to a TV studio, where you were walled off from what was really going on in the streets of the city.''
He also accused Mr. Spitzer of being ''nowhere to be found'' after Hurricane Sandy and of criticizing elected officials from the remove of his CNN television studio.
Mr. Stringer said that Mr. Spitzer was trying to buy the office of comptroller, noting that he was spending his own money instead of participating in the public financing program.
''You're acting like a Republican, not a Democrat,'' he said.
Mr. Spitzer in turn noted that business groups and labor unions had pledged to spend at least $1.5 million against him, because, he said, they ''don't want an independent voice.''
''You say repeatedly I'm trying to buy this election, Scott,'' Mr. Spitzer said. ''I'm just trying to keep up with you, keep up with the money you're going to spend, and all the millions of dollars that your allies on Wall Street and the political plutocracy have said they're going to spend.''
The candidates frequently interrupted each other, which seemed to irritate Mr. Spitzer in particular. At one point, when Mr. Stringer had interjected something, Mr. Spitzer chastised him. ''Scott, stop interrupting,'' he said, adding, ''You'll have your chance.''
The debate, which took place at the CUNY TV studio, was moderated by Brian Lehrer of WNYC and Errol Louis of NY1. The only brief period of levity came when the moderators conducted a ''lightning round,'' in which they asked such questions as whether either of the candidates had ever bounced a check (Stringer: yes; Spitzer: no), voted for a Republican (Stringer: no; Spitzer: yes), ridden a Citi Bike (both no) or eaten a cronut, the buzzed-about marriage of a croissant and a doughnut (both no).

HEADLINE: The Government as a Low-Wage Employer

BYLINE: By THE EDITORIAL BOARD

 BODY:
In 1965, in a nation torn by racial strife, President Johnson signed an executive order mandating nondiscrimination in employment by government contractors. Now, as President Obama has observed, the nation is divided by a different threat: widening income inequality. He could respond much as Mr. Johnson did -- with an executive order aimed, this time, at raising the pay of millions of poorly paid employees of government contractors. 
Recent studies have shown how hundreds of billions of dollars in federal contracts, grants, loans, concessions and property leases currently flow to companies that pay low wages and provide few if any benefits, even as executive pay among federal contractors has risen. In effect, tax dollars are being used to fuel the low-wage economy and, in the process, worsen inequality.
This research has been underscored by a recent complaint filed with the Labor Department by Good Jobs Nation, a group representing low-wage workers employed under federal concession agreements. The complaint alleges that food franchises operating at federal buildings in the District of Columbia have ignored minimum-wage and overtime laws. The group has also organized walkouts by low-wage workers of vendors licensed to operate at Smithsonian museums, actions that have dovetailed with recent walkouts by fast-food workers around the nation.
Many laws and executive actions, mostly from the 1930s and 1960s, require fair pay for employees of federal contractors. But over time, those protections have been eroded by special-interest exemptions, complex contracting processes and lax enforcement. A new executive order could ensure that the awarding of contracts is based on the quality of jobs created, challenging the notion that the best contractor is the one with the lowest labor costs.
Mr. Obama also could tell federal agencies to conduct reviews of contracts to see if the work should be done in-house. There is compelling evidence that using private-sector contractors is often costlier than using government employees, even when contractors pay workers little.
Nearly 50 years after one executive order helped to end discrimination in government contracting, another one is needed to help ensure fair pay in that same sector.

To the Editor:
Robert D. Putnam's essay about Port Clinton, Ohio (''Crumbling American Dreams,'' Sunday Review, Aug. 4), poignantly highlighted the devastation wrought by the combined forces of a global recession and technological revolution on our communities, families and seemingly our values. Left unsaid is the opportunity each of us has to make a difference in the lives of our neighbors. 
The challenges we face are too big for any one sector to tackle. But when all of us -- nonprofits, government, business and individuals -- combine our talent, resources and time, we create opportunities for everyone to flourish.
It's happening. People across America are coming together -- rooted in a strong sense of ''we'' -- to change their communities. In Grand Rapids, Mich., 1,200 faith leaders, retirees, college students and employees work with struggling elementary-school children, who have rapidly advanced academically.
There are countless success stories like this illustrating the power of collective action to fuel positive change. It starts with us.

HEADLINE: Bulger Guilty As a Mob Tale Ends in Boston

BYLINE: By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE; Jess Bidgood contributed reporting.

 BODY:
BOSTON -- James (Whitey) Bulger, the mobster who terrorized South Boston in the 1970s and '80s, holding the city in his thrall even after he disappeared, was convicted Monday of a sweeping array of gangland crimes, including 11 murders. He faces the prospect of spending the rest of his life in prison.
The verdict delivers long-delayed justice to Mr. Bulger, 83, who disappeared in the mid-1990s after a corrupt agent with the Federal Bureau of Investigation told him he was about to be indicted. He left behind a city that wondered if he would ever be caught -- and even if the F.B.I., which had been complicit in many of his crimes and had relied on him as an informer, was really looking for him.
''This was the worst case of corruption in the history of the F.B.I.,'' said Michael D. Kendall, a former federal prosecutor who investigated Mr. Bulger's associates. ''It was a multigenerational, systematic alliance with organized crime, where the F.B.I. was actively participating in the murders of government witnesses, or at least allowing them to occur.'' 
The trial was the final reckoning for a man small in stature but large in legend, who ruined hundreds of lives and deepened the stain on Boston's already corrupt federal law enforcement bureaucracy. Mr. Bulger was on the run for 16 years, until the authorities found him in 2011 in Santa Monica, Calif., with an arsenal of weapons and $822,000 in cash in the walls of his retirement apartment.
The trial also offered a glimpse of a time and a place that has all but disappeared. The South Boston of Mr. Bulger's day has been transformed from a parochial, mostly Irish-American working-class enclave into part of Boston's booming innovation economy. Old triple-deckers have given way to glassy condos for young professionals.
The dilapidated waterfront of Mr. Bulger's era, where he once imported 36 tons of marijuana, is now a showcase harbor dotted with pleasure craft and rimmed by the soaring glass walls of the federal courthouse where he had stood trial since June 12, with his former partners in crime parading to the witness stand to testify against him.
''When you hear about those days, it's as if all that took place in another century, on another planet,'' said Thomas J. Whalen, an associate professor of social science at Boston University. ''Those were the bad old days of Boston, and there is nothing to be nostalgic about. There was brutality at every level.''
June Barry, a 79-year-old who has lived in South Boston her entire life, and who used to joke with her friends about Mr. Bulger's grip on the neighborhood, greeted the verdicts with relief. ''It's good to be over,'' she said. ''I'm glad they got him, and they got him alive. He has to pay for it now,'' she added.
''We always said, 'Well, Whitey might be listening, we'd better behave ourselves.' ''
As a clerk read the verdicts in the lengthy and complicated list of charges, Mr. Bulger looked away from the jury and showed no reaction. He was found guilty of 31 of 32 counts of his indictment, the one exception involving an extortion charge. While the jury of eight men and four women convicted him of 11 murders, they found the government had not proved its case against him in seven others, and in one murder case it made no finding, leading to gasps inside the courtroom by relatives of those murder victims and explosive scenes outside the court.
''My father just got murdered again 40 years later in that courtroom,'' said the son of William O'Brien, who is also named William.
When he was led from the courtroom, Mr. Bulger gave a thumbs-up sign to a few family members seated behind him, prompting a woman sitting with the relatives of victims to yell out, ''Rat-a-tat Whitey.'' His sentencing is set for Nov. 13.
His lawyer J. W. Carney Jr. vowed to appeal. He said the basis for an appeal would be that Judge Denise Casper had not allowed Mr. Bulger to mount the defense he wanted: that he was given immunity for his crimes -- in essence, that he had a license to kill.
Others said such an argument was ludicrous and had little chance of success, particularly since Mr. Bulger maintained he was never an informant.
''It's difficult enough to persuade a court of appeals that you were immunized for proven murders if you were an informant,'' said Martin Weinberg, a prominent Boston criminal defense lawyer. ''It's impossible to make that argument when you say you were never an informant.''
Perhaps one glimmer of gratification for Mr. Bulger was that the jury reached ''no finding'' in the death of Debra Davis, one of two women he was accused of strangling. He has long maintained that his personal code of honor did not allow for the killing of women, although the jury did determine that he had killed the other woman, Deborah Hussey. Ms. Davis was the longtime girlfriend of Stephen Flemmi, Mr. Bulger's former partner in crime who testified against him. Ms. Hussey was the daughter of another of Mr. Flemmi's longtime girlfriends.
Mr. Bulger had spent much of the trial scribbling on a yellow legal pad, perhaps for an appeal or a memoir, or maybe just for something to do. Some of the witnesses, particularly those who testified against him, had made him bristle with anger, and on a few occasions he exchanged obscenities with them, as if the courtroom were a schoolyard.
In his last few appearances in court, after deciding that he would not take the stand in his own defense, Mr. Bulger seemed defeated. He slumped more in his chair. He did not take notes as vigorously.
Mr. Weinberg said the seven murders that the government had not proved Mr. Bulger had committed were the oldest of the murder charges and were based on uncorroborated testimony. But, he noted, the jury also rejected the defense's argument that ''because the F.B.I. was corrupt, Mr. Bulger deserved to be exonerated.''
Mr. Bulger's defense lawyers, Mr. Carney and Hank Brennan, described a culture in which agents took bribes, alerted criminals in advance to wiretaps and pending indictments, and gave them information about informants that led to their murder. But they produced almost no evidence that Mr. Bulger could not have committed the crimes of which he was accused.
Mr. Bulger seemed to view the trial as more about his legacy than his guilt or innocence. He maintained he was not an informant, though that would have been no crime and was not part of the indictment against him.
Though previous courtroom proceedings -- notably those presided over by Judge Mark L. Wolf in Federal District Court in 1998 -- exposed the symbiotic relationship between Mr. Bulger's Winter Hill Gang and the F.B.I., this trial focused more on Mr. Bulger's criminal actions while under the bureau's protection.
Fred Wyshak, the assistant United States attorney who was the lead prosecutor, maintained that some victims were killed because the F.B.I. had told Mr. Bulger they were informants who were going to testify against him. Others were rival hoodlums or innocent bystanders.
Some were lured into traps and shot. Others were felled in a hail of bullets. Some were bound in chains and shot at close range. Ms. Hussey and Ms. Davis were strangled. Afterward, Mr. Bulger would routinely take a nap while others cleaned up the mess, which included removing the teeth of victims so their bodies could not be identified. The corpses were shoveled under the dirt floor of a basement or tossed into a car trunk and dumped in a shallow grave.
Beyond the murders, there were guns in people's faces and in their crotches. There were threats, shakedowns, demands for ''rent'' for the privilege of doing business on Mr. Bulger's turf.
''The depth of depravity is stunning -- the killing of weak people, the women, the treachery against their own friends, shooting them in the back of the head,'' said Anthony Cardinale, a criminal defense lawyer who has represented mobsters and who first exposed Mr. Bulger as an F.B.I. informant. ''It's almost Toscaesque in terms of the treachery that went on, and in the end, everyone winds up dead.''

HEADLINE: How to Share Scientific Data

BYLINE: By JOHN MARKOFF

 BODY:
Stewart Brand, the founder of the Whole Earth catalog and a Silicon Valley muse, once said that information wanted to be free and expensive, simultaneously. That paradox is increasingly haunting the world of modern science.
A deluge of digital data from scientific research has spawned a controversy over who should have access to it, how it can be stored and who will pay to do so.
The matter was the subject of discussion after the journal Science published a paper on Thursday by Francine Berman, a computer scientist at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute who is a leader of a group that focuses on research data, and Vinton Cerf, the vice president of Google. 
The paper calls for a different culture around scientific data based on acknowledging that costs must be shared. It also explores economic models that would involve the support of various scientific communities: public, private and academic.
In an interview, Dr. Cerf said storing and sharing digital information was becoming a ''crucial issue'' for both public and private institutions.
The debate is likely to accelerate next week when federal agencies are expected to file proposals for how they would ''support increased public access to the results of research funded by the federal government.'' The plans were requested by John P. Holdren, director of the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a memorandum in February.
But Dr. Holdren also directed that plans be carried out using ''resources within the existing agency budget.''
That is likely to be a formidable challenge. While the cost of data storage is falling rapidly, the amount of information created by data-based science is immense. In addition, many agencies have complicated arrangements providing favorable access to corporations that then resell federal data. The agencies also must overcome the hurdle of developing systems that will make the data accessible.
Still, the federal guidelines underscore the importance of digital information in scientific research and the growing urgency to resolve the problems.
''Data is the new currency for research,'' said Alan Blatecky, the director of advanced cyberinfrastructure at the National Science Foundation. ''The question is how do you address the cost issues, because there is no new money.''
Dr. Berman and Dr. Cerf argued in their paper that private companies, as well as academic and corporate laboratories, must be willing to invest in new computer data centers and storage systems so that crucial research data is not irretrievably lost.
''There is no economic 'magic bullet' that does not require someone, somewhere, to pay,'' they wrote.
Dr. Berman is the chairwoman of the United States branch of the Research Data Alliance, an organization of academic, government and corporate researchers attempting to build new systems to store the digital data sets being created, and to develop new software techniques for integrating different kinds of data and making it accessible. ''Publicly accessible data requires a stable home and someone to pay the mortgage,'' she said in an interview.
Google initially promised to host large data sets for scientists for free, and then killed the program in 2008 after just a year, for unspecified business reasons.
It may have been that the company was taken aback by the size of scientific research data sets. For example, the Obama administration's proposal to eventually capture the activity of just one million neurons in the human brain (the human brain has about 85 to 100 billion neurons) for a year would require about 3 petabytes of data storage, or almost one third the amount generated by the Large Hadron Collider during the same period.
Dr. Berman said she was heartened to see a growing international recognition of the scope of the problem. The Research Data Alliance, begun last August with an international telephone conference of just eight researchers, now has more than 750 academic, corporate and government scientists and information technology specialists in 50 countries.
In their paper, she and Dr. Cerf argue that coping with the explosion of data would require a cultural shift on the part of not just the government and corporate institutions, but also individual scientists.
''The casual approach for many scientists has been to 'stick it on my disk drive and make it available to anyone who wants to use it,' '' Dr. Cerf said.
They argued that the costs need not be prohibitive. ''If you want to download a song from iTunes, it's not free, but it doesn't break the bank,'' Dr. Berman said.
Even those who feel that information should be free and open acknowledge that easy availability to data from government-subsidized projects gives an unfair and unnecessary advantage to private firms.
And some scientists argue that there would be advantages to charging for data. ''Paying a small fee for downloads in the aggregate would also act as an incentive for providing the needed infrastructure,'' said Bernardo A. Huberman, a physicist at Hewlett-Packard Laboratories.
In his memorandum, Dr. Holdren told the federal agencies that the release of research papers could be delayed for up to a year; the reasons were not explained. That has angered activists who favor immediate and broad availability of publicly financed research.
''In scientific fields, a year is a very long time,'' said Carl Malamud, the founder of Public. Resource.Org, a nonprofit group that attempts to make government information freely available online. Meanwhile, he said, corporations could sell the information. ''It's a sop to the special interests that publish this stuff.''
Dr. Berman said there were models that could provide ideas for the new infrastructures needed to store the data and make it accessible. One is the Protein Data Bank -- a database of biological molecules -- that is heavily used by the life sciences community and is publicly supported.
That data is freely available. However, she also pointed to the social science database Longitudinal Study of American Youth, which is maintained by the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research at the University of Michigan. Users are charged a subscription fee.

An article on Tuesday about the challenges of storing and making vast amounts of scientific data, much of it publicly financed, readily available referred incompletely to instructions from John P. Holdren, director of the federal Office of Science and Technology Policy, in a memorandum sent to federal agencies in February. While the memo said a guideline for making research papers publicly available would be an embargo period of a year after publication, it also stipulated that individual agencies could tailor their plans to release papers on a different time frame.

HEADLINE: In One Bundle of Mortgages, the Subprime Crisis Reverberates

BYLINE: By PETER EAVIS

 BODY:
A subprime deal came back to haunt Fabrice Tourre, a former Goldman Sachs trader, when a federal jury in Manhattan found him liable for civil securities fraud.
He is not the only one feeling the pain of a subprime transaction six years on.
Hundreds of thousands of subprime borrowers are still struggling. Some of their mortgages ended up in another Goldman deal that was done at the same time as Mr. Tourre was working on his own financial alchemy.
In February 2007, just before everything fell apart, Goldman Sachs bundled thousands of subprime mortgages from across the country and sold them to investors. This bond became toxic as soon as it was completed. The mortgages slid into default at a speed that was staggering even for that era.
Despite those losses, that bond still lives. It has undoubtedly left its mark on ordinary borrowers. But the impact of the deal spread ever further. It touched the bankers who sold the deal. It even landed on taxpayers, who ended up owning a large slice of the Goldman bond. 
Much has changed over the last six years. Big banks like Goldman are reporting strong profits and regulators are wrapping up cases stemming from Wall Street's recklessness. House prices are on the rise, providing relief and encouragement for many homeowners. Indeed, subprime securities like the Goldman bond can now even be found in some mom-and-pop mutual funds -- which bought them at a discount of as much as half of their original face value.
Yet the financial crisis still reverberates for many others, in large part because of the insidious reach of the financial products that Wall Street created. Subprime securities still pose a significant legal risk to the firms that packaged them, and they use up capital that could be deployed elsewhere in the economy.
This is the story of one of those bonds, GSAMP Trust 2007 NC1.
The name is the sort of gobbledygook that is common in the bond market, but it tells a story. The ''GS'' is derived from Goldman Sachs. The Wall Street firm didn't actually make mortgages to subprime borrowers that were in the deal. Instead, Goldman bought them from a lender called New Century, the ''NC'' in the title.
It was New Century that lent to Wendy Fillmore, when she and her husband wanted to buy their house in Las Vegas in 2006. The home cost $276,000. New Century provided two loans, one for a $221,000 loan and a second mortgage for $53,000. Data for the Goldman deal shows that it contains the Fillmores' larger loan.
Ms. Fillmore's husband was, and still is, an information technology specialist, and at the time she was working as a transcriber. She recalls the surprise she felt when New Century agreed to the make the mortgages.
''I was wondering how we managed to get approved for as much as we did,'' she said.
The reason had a lot to do with the appetite for mortgages by Goldman and other Wall Street firms that had a booming business in slicing and dicing and repackaging the loans in securities.
A month before Ms. Fillmore got her mortgage, Daniel L. Sparks, Goldman's head of mortgages, wrote in an e-mail that he was a ''bit scared'' of New Century and had reservations about Goldman taking more loans from the lender. The e-mail was contained in materials released by Congress as part of an investigation of Wall Street.
Mr. Sparks gained prominence in 2010 when he testified in Congress about Goldman's mortgage dealings, including a deal that resulted in a $550 million fine for the firm. He is one of the four bankers who signed off on the 2007 bond, according to a lawsuit filed by a federal regulator that is litigating the deal and other transactions. Mr. Sparks, who left Goldman in 2008, is named as a defendant in the federal action. He declined to say what he is doing now.
Ms. Fillmore is still in her Las Vegas home. She estimates that the market value of the house is around half the combined value of her two mortgages.
''It is frustrating to be so far underwater,'' she said. ''It's horrible. We can't move. We just try not to think about it.''
Deals like the Goldman one leave a rich paper trail that includes many details about the loans that were contained in the bond. The numbers are jaw-dropping.
Three-fourths of the borrowers in the deal have fallen well behind on their payments at some point, according to a special analysis of the deal performed by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. Many of those people have lost their houses or will lose them. Nearly half the loans in the bond have been in foreclosure proceedings since it was issued, according to the Boston Fed.
One of Mr. Sparks's former Goldman colleagues is Jonathan S. Sobel, who also left Goldman in 2008 and is also a defendant in the federal action. A year ago, Mr. Sobel and his wife acquired a duplex apartment at 740 Park Avenue, one of the city's most coveted addresses, according to New York property records. They paid $19.3 million.
A few months before that purchase, Anthony Haynes, a New York subway train driver, was forced to sell a house in Brooklyn that had been in his family since just after World War II.
In 2006, New Century lent him $500,000 against the property. A renovation of the house didn't go as planned, Mr. Haynes said. It also turned out that he couldn't afford both the mortgage payments and other bills, like child support payments.
''I am glad to be rid of the financial burden, but I did like the house,'' he said.
Property records indicate that he sold the house last year for $330,000. The entity that bought it from Mr. Haynes then sold it a few months later for $550,000. Mr. Haynes lives in an apartment in Brooklyn that he and his wife own.
The question today is whether risky mortgage loans should ever have been put in the Goldman bond. Critics say the banks did not properly portray the full risks of the loans bundled into bonds.
Since the financial crisis, many lawsuits have been filed against banks, asserting that banks filled bonds up with loans that didn't meet agreed-upon standards. Last week, for example, the Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission sued Bank of America over $850 million of jumbo mortgage-backed securities.
Fannie Mae, the mortgage finance giant now owned by the federal government, bought the largest slice of the Goldman deal. In 2008, Fannie was bailed out and taken over by the government, effectively transferring all its assets, including the Goldman bond, into taxpayers' hands.
Fannie's regulator, the Federal Housing Finance Agency, is suing Goldman and many other banks to recoup losses on bonds that the company bought. The agency asserts that the four Goldman bankers who signed the bond's documents were directly responsible for what it says were misstatements and omissions in the deal. None of the men work for Goldman anymore.
They weren't keen to talk.
The lawsuit says one of the signatories on the deal was David J. Rosenblum. A former Goldman employee of that name now works at Prophet Capital Asset Management, an investment firm based in Austin, Tex. When reached on a Prophet Capital phone number, Mr. Rosenblum declined to say whether he had a connection with the deal.
''I am just a little hermit in my little hermit crab shell,'' he said.
Mr. Sobel, the Park Avenue resident, didn't respond to requests for comment.
One central figure from the time did talk, though.
Daniel Mudd was Fannie Mae's chief executive when the company bought a $480 million slice of the Goldman bond.
''It doesn't ring a bell,'' he said, when asked whether he remembered the deal.
His tenure at Fannie has been criticized because it was the period when the firm piled into riskier mortgages. Today, Mr. Mudd offers a general defense of Fannie's subprime strategy: ''If you look at the performance of any of the nonprime business that Fannie did, the performance is in an order of magnitude better than business done at other institutions.''
Mr. Mudd is also caught up in subprime litigation. He isn't a defendant in the suit aimed at the former Goldman bankers. But in 2011, the Securities and Exchange Commission brought civil actions against Mr. Mudd and other former Fannie Mae executives, claiming that the company understated its exposure to subprime mortgages.
After Fannie, Mr. Mudd joined the Fortress Investment Group, an investment firm, but resigned in early 2012.
Looking back at the turbulence of the intervening years, Mr. Mudd, an ex-Marine, said, ''You continue to march.''
It has been a long road for Ms. Fillmore, the Las Vegas homeowner. But she and her husband decided to persevere with their loan. ''It has crossed our minds to walk away from the house. But we've put too much into it,'' she said. ''We don't want to give up and lose the house and the past six years of payments.''
The Fillmores' experience shows how much homeowner relief efforts can help.
Their debt load was lightened in 2010 after she visited an event held by Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, an organization that helps consumers get help with their mortgages. ''They really helped pull our fat out of the fire,'' Ms. Fillmore said. The group worked with the company that services her larger loan to make it more affordable. Its principal was reduced to $193,000, from $221,000, according to property records.
Deborah Harris, of Windsor Locks, Conn., also benefited from an adjustment to her mortgage. She took out a $168,000 loan from New Century in December 2006 to buy a house. The loan was placed in the 2007 Goldman deal. She says modifications have halved her monthly payments. ''I could have been one of the statistics, most definitely,'' Ms. Harris said. ''I guess I was one of the lucky ones who stayed in their homes.''
One-fourth of the loans in the Goldman bond have been modified, according to the Boston Fed's analysis. Not all of those succeeded, though. Of the 9,393 loans originally in the deal, 14 percent have been modified and are still current on their payments.
Today, the borrowers whose loans were put in the Goldman bond say they have been chastened by their experiences with debt.
''If I could take everything back, I never would have got involved,'' Mr. Haynes, the Brooklyn resident, said.
Goldman's bond expires many years from now, in 2037. Some borrowers, like Curtis Williams, who borrowed $193,500 in late 2006 against her house in Jacksonville, Fla., and whose loan is part of the Goldman deal, aren't going anywhere.
''As long as I can stay here, I will,'' she said.
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

An article on Tuesday about the continuing ramifications for homeowners from a subprime mortgage transaction assembled by Goldman Sachs misstated the status of a mortgage taken out by Anthony Haynes, a New York subway train driver. While he did indeed receive a loan from New Century for $500,000 against his property, that mortgage did not find its way into the Goldman deal. (His mortgage loan went into another subprime bond.)

HEADLINE: The First Couple's Chance To Put Themselves First

BYLINE: By MARK LANDLER; Nicholas Confessore contributed reporting from New York.

 BODY:
EDGARTOWN, Mass. -- President Obama and his wife, Michelle, have begun a weeklong holiday on Martha's Vineyard that, for now at least, is more a romantic getaway than a family vacation.
While their daughters, Malia and Sasha, are away at summer camp and not scheduled to join them until later in the week, the Obamas have put off their usual menu of family activities like mountain biking and a trip to the local bookstore in favor of dinner at the Sweet Life Cafe and a cocktail party. Mr. Obama also found time for back-to-back golf days with a rotating cast of buddies.
The White House said the girls would be joining their parents here in the coming days, although officials declined to give any details. The Obamas are in the meantime sampling the disorienting liberty of parents with time on their hands and each other for company. 
That has meant rearranging, if not abandoning, the well-worn rituals of the usual Obama holiday on Martha's Vineyard, a scenic New England island of beetlebung trees, BMWs and an affluent summer population used to vacationing presidents.
On Sunday, for example, the first couple joined friends at the Sweet Life, a pricey restaurant in Oak Bluffs. Housed in a yellow restored Victorian, it is known for a charming back garden with twinkling lights strung in the bushes, and practically screams ''date night.'' The Obamas dined in a private room, with no word on who joined them.
In another sign that they front-loaded their social plans, the Obamas went for cocktails on Monday at the home of a 2012 campaign adviser, Broderick Johnson, and his wife, Michele Norris, the NPR correspondent.
By Monday afternoon, the president had already gotten in his second round of golf, at the Vineyard Golf Club in Edgartown, with a foursome that included the Washington power broker Vernon Jordan; Ron Kirk, the president's former chief trade negotiator; and Allison S. Davis, a Chicago developer and a founder of the law firm where Mr. Obama once worked.
A day earlier, the president spent five hours at Farm Neck Golf Club in Oak Bluffs, playing with two aides and his close friend Robert Wolf, an investment banker and political donor.
Mr. Wolf later posted a photo on Twitter of what he said was Mr. Obama reacting as he sank a putt, although a White House pool reporter who saw the shot said the president was leaning back and lifting his right knee in a futile attempt to coax the wayward ball into the hole.
The president's disputed body language constituted the only news development on the first full day of what the White House is determined to make a news-free week on Martha's Vineyard.
''I know he's looking forward very much to some down time with his family, with the first lady, and I'm sure he'll see some friends, but I don't have a social schedule to offer you,'' the press secretary, Jay Carney, said to reporters before arriving on Saturday.
The White House said the president received his regular daily briefing on Monday from the national security adviser, Susan E. Rice, who is also spending the week here. He is also expected to be briefed periodically on domestic issues by Rob Nabors, the White House deputy chief of staff.
In case there was any doubt that Mr. Obama would be back on the clock soon, the White House announced that he would embark on a two-day bus tour of upstate New York and Pennsylvania next week to promote his economic agenda, built on the theme of a ''better bargain for the middle class.''
Small crowds cheered the Obamas after they left the restaurant on Sunday. But Mr. Obama is less a novelty than a regular: this is his fourth vacation here as president. He skipped last summer only because he was running for re-election. And Bill Clinton spent most of his summer vacations here when he lived in the White House.
Twice, Mr. Obama's motorcade has passed a hand-painted roadside sign with the words ''No Keystone'' -- a reference to the pipeline and a reminder that this is a place of Democratic proclivities. To the extent that his presence has generated any negative buzz, it is because the Secret Service has blocked off the road in front of his rented house.
About that house: It is a secluded four-bedroom contemporary owned by a Chicago financier, David M. Schulte, who has donated to Mr. Obama's campaigns. The White House declined to say how much the president was paying in rent. As in previous years, he picked up the tab.
Mr. Schulte, in an e-mail, said he had known Mr. Obama since he ran for the Senate, describing himself and his wife as ''donors and friends.'' But the choice of the house was a coincidence, he said. It was selected by the White House from a list of properties, submitted by a local real estate broker, that met its criteria for security and other requirements.
''I've not talked to the president even once about his vacation,'' Mr. Schulte said in the e-mail.
The house is valued at $7.6 million, according to The Martha's Vineyard Times. That makes it a step down from Blue Heron Farm, a sprawling waterfront estate that Mr. Obama rented in previous years. The British architect Norman Foster bought it last year for more than $20 million, which removed it from the presidential rental market.
In some ways, the new digs symbolize the changing Obama family. With its hay barn and riding circle, Blue Heron Farm was the perfect playground for children. Mr. Schulte's house, with its sleek lines and infinity pool, is a serene retreat for a couple waiting for their daughters.

CORRECTION-DATE: August 19, 2013 

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about the Obama family's vacation on Martha's Vineyard gave an outdated title for a noted British architect who bought Blue Heron Farm, the estate where the Obamas stayed in previous years. The architect, Norman Foster, was elevated to the peerage years ago and now carries the title lord, not sir.

HEADLINE: Discord in an Intergenerational Home

BYLINE: PAULA SPAN


HIGHLIGHT: In &#8220;Mother Daughter Me,&#8221; Katie Hafner tells a sad story of good intentions gone awry. 

 BODY:
"Mother Daughter Me," Katie Hafner's new memoir about her attempt to form a multigenerational household, reminds me of those horror movies where the heroine (it's always a heroine) is about to plunge heedlessly into a darkened basement/attic/forest instead of sensibly dialing 911. You want to yell, "Nooooo!"
Bringing multiple generations under one roof can be a satisfying way to live, and the number of families opting for this scenario in the United States has modestly increased to 5.6 percent of family households, the Census Bureau reported last year. 
But the majority of these three-generation homes consist of a householder living with his or her child and grandchildren, not with an elderly parent or in-law. And the decision often appears to be not purely voluntary. These households form most commonly, the Census Bureau reports, when people feel economically pressed: they're recent immigrants or have low incomes or got hit by the housing crisis.
It's been 70 years since older Americans typically moved in with their children, a practice that swiftly declined with the advent of Social Security, and Ms. Hafner's book illustrates some of the reasons behind this change.
Though most older Americans tell poll-takers they wouldn't want to share a home with their grown kids, we still harbor romantic notions of warm dinners at which grandparents pass family lore along to grade-schoolers. We're not the Waltons, most of us, but we sometimes feel we should be. 
Ms. Hafner, living in a San Francisco apartment with her 16-year-old daughter, rented a gracious Victorian house so that her frail 77-year-old mother could join their household. Mother and daughter hadn't lived within 400 miles of each other in decades; grandmother and granddaughter barely knew each other. Moreover, Ms. Hafner acknowledges early in this account, "My mother was free with her opinions ... she took up a lot of psychological space in a room."
So it doesn't come as a complete shock when troubles arise. The 16-year-old is soon in tears over those too freely expressed opinions. Ms. Hafner and her mother spar about money, though they'd agreed to share all expenses equally.
Unpacking their new, shared kitchen becomes a tense standoff over whose vegetable peeler makes it into a drawer and whose gets donated. "Before long, I'm shaking my head at pretty much everything my mother removes from her San Diego boxes," Ms. Hafner writes. "She takes each rejected item as a personal slight - which in fact it is."
Within six weeks, they're seeing a family therapist. Ms. Hafner recognizes that they've never negotiated certain basic policies: whether to eat dinner together every night, whether friends' invitations automatically include her mother, how Ms. Hafner - working at home - can balance career demands with the attention her mother needs.
Much of Ms. Hafner's book focuses on her past and demonstrates why "Mother Daughter Me" can't really function as a guide to forming and sustaining intergenerational households. (Nor does she intend for it to.)
Every family has its difficulties, but Ms. Hafner's has had more than most. Her divorced mother sank so deeply into alcoholism that she eventually lost custody of her two daughters when they were 10 and 12. They were sent to live with their father and his new family, a difficult arrangement that Ms. Hafner's sister soon fled. Her relationship with her mother and sister remained tenuous for decades afterwards.
Meanwhile Ms. Hafner, building a life as a journalist (at The New York Times, among other publications), was abruptly widowed in 2002, then divorced in 2008 after an impulsive second marriage. Her daughter has had to mourn her father and recover from a rejecting stepfather - and here comes her now sober, but still judgmental and narcissistic, grandmother.
Ms. Hafner is admirably honest about all this. Though she and her mother have grown closer, and she has come to better understand her and to admire her strength, "she has been less than thrilled to be featured in her daughter's memoir," Ms. Hafner writes in her end-of-book acknowledgments, admitting that she's had to change several people's names, including her mother's. This is not the sunny ending she envisioned.
If you've grown up in a multigenerational setting, as many families have (see this video of a Pakistani household in Southern California), you may be better equipped for the compromises and responsibilities involved. Or you may simply have a more easygoing parent.
But in issuing her invitation to her mother, Ms. Hafner writes, "I was guided by a combination of love, protectiveness, and, as I would eventually come to see, magical thinking." Her memoir will help others navigate those shoals.

HEADLINE: U.S., Filing Suit, Moves to Block Airline Merger

BYLINE: JAD MOUAWAD


HIGHLIGHT: The Justice Department filed an antitrust lawsuit on Tuesday seeking to block the proposed merger of American Airlines and US Airways. 

 BODY:
 Updated, 8:44 p.m. | After a decade of rapid consolidation in the nation's airline industry, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to block the proposed merger between American Airlines and US Airways, which would create the world's largest airline.
The move, joined by attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia, surprised industry officials, who had expected little resistance to the deal. But it underscored a newly aggressive approach by the Justice Department's antitrust division, which has been more closely scrutinizing proposed mergers as the economy recovers. In 2011, for example, it blocked the merger of AT&T and T-Mobile, and this year it forced Anheuser-Busch InBev to significantly alter the terms of its takeover of the brewer of Corona before approving it.
The airline industry, though, has had a nearly unfettered run of mergers in recent years, and the American-US Airways combination was seen as the capstone. In no small part, this consolidation of the industry into a handful of carriers had the support of regulators. Starting in 2008, the Justice Department approved the mergers of Delta Air Lines and Northwest, United Airlines and Continental, and Southwest and AirTran. 
But antitrust regulators said these past mergers had in effect undermined the case for the American-US Airways combination. While those mergers helped the industry return to profitability and brought more stability, they also led to higher fares, regulators said. A union between American and US Airways would take the consolidation too far, the Justice Department said, hurting consumers and leading to substantially less competition and higher airfares and fees, and to less service to many airports.
"Today's action proves our determination to fight for the best interests of consumers by ensuring robust competition in the marketplace," said Eric H. Holder Jr., the United States attorney general.
The decision to file a civil antitrust lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia brought an unusually strong reaction from the airlines. In a joint statement, American and US Airways said they would mount a "vigorous and strong defense" of their plan.
"We believe that the D.O.J. is wrong in its assessment of our merger," the airlines said. A combined American and US Airways, they said, would create more options for customers than either airline could offer on their own.
Doug Parker, chief executive of US Airways, who was planned to run the combined airlines, struck a defiant tone in a statement to employees, saying, "We will close the merger before year end."
In arguing against the merger, the Justice Department said the vast majority of domestic airline routes were already highly concentrated. The merger, it said, would result in four airlines controlling more than 80 percent of the United States market for commercial air travel.
"We looked very carefully for six months at this deal, and we think it's pretty messed up," said William J. Baer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the department's antitrust division. "It looks pretty bad for consumers."
He told reporters that the merger could cost consumers "hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars."
He said regulators reached that conclusion after reviewing internal plans for the merger at US Airways and American and studying how much fares rose after the other giant mergers.
Asked if some type of compromise might still be possible, Mr. Baer said, "We think a full-stop injunction is the right course for the consumer."
Mr. Baer said the combined airline's pricing power would be apparent at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, where it would have a monopoly on 63 percent of the nonstop routes.
JetBlue's expansion at that airport in 2010 led to 30 percent cuts in some fares, he said. But JetBlue leases half of its takeoff and landing slots from American, which could cancel that deal if the merger occurred.
Mr. Baer, who took over in January, has demonstrated that he is not afraid of taking a fight to court, analysts said, as he did this year with the case in which the department charged that Apple colluded with publishers over e-book pricing. Last month, a federal judge agreed, ruling against Apple.
"They've shown that they are not going to be gun-shy about enforcing antitrust laws," said Michael A. Carrier, a distinguished professor at Rutgers University law school.
Joining the Justice Department in filing the suit were attorneys general from Texas and Arizona, where American and US Airways are based, as well as Florida, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.
The last time the Justice Department challenged a merger was the proposed combination of United Airlines and US Airways in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, sharply altered the financial stakes for the industry, pushing several carriers into bankruptcy - including Delta, United and Continental - and leading to about $60 billion in losses for the industry in the following decade. American was the last of the major carriers to file for bankruptcy protection, in November 2011.
The Justice Department's announcement represents a significant setback for American's plans to exit bankruptcy. It amounts to a rebuttal to the position taken by a federal bankruptcy judge, who approved the merger as part of American's restructuring plan. What is more, all three labor groups representing American employees, including pilots, flight attendants and mechanics, backed the plan put forward by US Airways to merge the airlines.
In doing so, they opposed the initial plan championed by American managers to remain an independent carrier and emerge from bankruptcy alone. That plan, however, was viewed by most analysts as unrealistic given how big Delta and United have become since their respective mergers.
In laying out its case, the Justice Department quotes US Airways executives describing how consolidation had helped the industry raise fares. It also discusses how US Airways provides some low-fare competition through its Advantage Fares program, saying that other carriers, including American and Delta, routinely matched those lower fares.
The Justice Department also explained how American could exit bankruptcy as a "vigorous competitor" without the merger, saying it would have "strong incentives to grow to better compete with Delta and United." As an example, it cited the carrier's large new aircraft order and said that American's stand-alone plan called for increasing flights and destinations.
The decision surprised airline analysts.
" 'Bizarre' is one word," said Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former executive, who characterized the Justice Department as "late to the game with concerns over airline industry consolidation."
A report by the Government Accountability Office in June found that the planned merger would reduce competition in a far larger number of airports than earlier airline mergers, including the one that fused United and Continental into the nation's current leader.
The Obama administration was heavily criticized in its first two years for seemingly failing to keep campaign promises of active antitrust enforcement. One of the antitrust division's first actions in 2009 was to withdraw a Bush administration policy that favored caution by regulators and the development of safe harbors for companies that controlled a given market.
After that, however, the administration had to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis and the housing collapse, and significant antitrust action was delayed until the second half of the administration's first term, said Stacey Anne Mahoney, a partner at Bingham McCutchen in New York.
"The second Obama administration is building up some steam in terms of federal antitrust enforcement efforts," Ms. Mahoney said. Earlier this year, it had seven antitrust actions in litigation at the same time, the most ever, officials said.

HEADLINE: The Civil War and Hawaii

BYLINE: JEFFREY ALLEN SMITH


HIGHLIGHT: Despite the 5,000 miles separating Gettysburg and Honolulu, the island kingdom played a surprising role in the conflict. 

 BODY:
Almost 5,000 miles and half an ocean away from the killing fields of Gettysburg, Chickamauga, or Spotsylvania, Hawaii and Hawaiians might be assumed to have not played a role in the Civil War. Yet regardless of proud protestations of neutrality by the Hawaiian monarchy - the islands were not American territory at the time - many of the islands' residents participated in the conflict, on both sides. And for good reason: though they lived on one of the most geographically isolated island chains in the world, Hawaiians kept abreast of international events, knowing that the outcome of the war could greatly affect Hawaii as well.
The presidential election of Abraham Lincoln received a positive response in Hawaii, with the Hawaiian-language newspaper Ka Hoku Loa writing that America was "blessed" to have him at such a problematic time. Nevertheless, the Lincoln administration was worried about Hawaiian neutrality and what it saw to be growing British influence in the islands. Understandably preoccupied with more pressing domestic matters, Lincoln and Secretary of State William H. Seward did what they could. Seward replaced the boorish and tactless American commissioner to Hawaii, Thomas Dyer, with the more capable James McBride, and promoted McBride to minister, making him the highest-ranking foreign official in the kingdom. 
Later, after the passing of King Kamehameha IV Alexander Liholiho in 1863, Lincoln sent a personal four-page letter to the new monarch, Kamehameha V Lot Kapuaiwa, professing Lincoln's sorrow, while congratulating the king and extending offers of support from "Your Majesty's Good Friend."
However, the Hawaiian monarchy had its own reasons to improve relations with the United States, as it wanted a new trade treaty. To that end, Kamehameha V sent an emissary, Chief Justice E. H. Allen, to Washington in 1864. In June, Allen met with Lincoln, Seward and other politicians to discuss the prospects for a new treaty. He returned to Hawaii frustrated yet optimistic, without a treaty in hand but reporting that Lincoln and Seward were receptive to the idea. The only problem, Seward told Allen, was that the "civil war renders such negotiation inconvenient and inexpedient." Still, the secretary of state promised, "at no very distant period ... the subject will be resumed with pleasure." Private correspondence revealed that Seward planned to request a "port, sufficient for a wharf and buildings for a naval depot" in what appeared to be a forebear of Pearl Harbor. 
Similar geopolitical wrangling played out in the newspapers. Mid-19th-century newspapers were unabashedly slanted, and the Hawaiian press was no different. Many papers were published in Hawaiian, English or a combination of the two. The Hawaiian-language press was to varying degrees anti-monarchy and quasi-independent, but over all it was pro-Union. The Polynesian was one of the biggest and the self-proclaimed "official organ of the Hawaiian government." It was a curious combination of abolitionism and states' rights advocacy that liked to reprint articles from England in favor of neutrality. Engaging in a bit of yellow journalism, The Polynesian used the Civil War as a proxy fight against The Pacific Commercial Advertiser, its main rival and voice of American business interests in Hawaii. For example, in January 1863, The Polynesian claimed that The Pacific Commercial Advertiser had "never approved" of Lincoln's removal of Gen. George B. McClellan, unlike The Polynesian, and now Lincoln and The Polynesian had been vindicated by Union advances on the battlefield. 
Hawaiians themselves decidedly favored the North. Union victories were celebrated, and a Honolulu bookstore sold red, white and blue envelopes that read "Union must be preserved" alongside copies of "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Neighbors of a Southern-born woman living in Honolulu ripped up a Confederate flag she had hung from her veranda. In fact, support for Lincoln in Hawaii was greater than in the United States - he did better in 1860 and 1864 mock elections with American expats in Hawaii than among the Northern voting public. American residents on Hawaii island threw a grand Fourth of July celebration in 1861, complete with bands, the firing of guns, and toasts to Lincoln and the Union. 
Perhaps too caught up in the revelry, a Hilo merchant named Thomas Spencer organized about 40 Hawaiians into a volunteer auxiliary corps that pledged its support should Lincoln call upon them. The group was later dubbed "Spencer's Invincibles" and drilled in military tactics. The Pacific Commercial Advertiser reported that "all the company now wants is a chance of a shot at Jeff Davis' bloodhounds," and that the men hoped that Hawaii's proclamation of neutrality "will not spoil the fun." The Hawaiian government did in fact disband the group, but the monarchy could not stop others from joining the fray.
More than 100 people from Hawaii fought on both sides of the Civil War. Arguably the most famous was the Union general Samuel C. Armstrong. Born on Maui to missionary parents who ran a school for Hawaiian children, after the war Armstrong used that educational experience as the inspiration for his founding and running of the Hampton Institute, which trained African-Americans as teachers and engineers. It was at the Hampton Institute that Booker T. Washington received his education, and he used his alma mater as a model for his Tuskegee Institute. 
However, unlike the white Armstrong, native Hawaiians who fought for the Union risked segregation because of their skin color. One volunteer, Prince Romerson, served in the Fifth Massachusetts Volunteer Cavalry, an all-black regiment, and mustered out as a sergeant. Exceptions did occur, though: Henry Hoolulu Pitman, son of the Hawaiian Chiefess Kinoole O Liliha, was a private in the 22nd Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, a white regiment, who was captured and died in Richmond's Libby Prison. 
A few Hawaiians also found themselves fighting for the South. Probably more for employment than the Southern cause, about 10 Hawaiian seamen joined the crew of the Shenandoah, a Confederate raider that wrought havoc throughout the Pacific. Interestingly, the saga of the Shenandoah played an important part in the larger story of the later overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. Indiscriminate in sinking both American and Hawaiian whaling vessels, the Shenandoah did not directly cause the demise of the whaling industry in the Pacific, but it did hasten it. With whaling ships becoming scarcer and voyages to find whales longer and more cost-prohibitive, commercial agricultural plantations came into their own in Hawaii. After dabbling in cotton, rice and other products, planters found sugar to be the cash crop of choice. Commercially active in Hawaii since the 1830s, the Hawaiian sugar industry saw one of its greatest expansions during the Civil War era. As a result of the Union boycott of Southern sugar, Hawaiian sugar exports to the United States rose 175 percent a year from 1860 to 1866, while prices jumped over 500 percent. 
However, the rise in sugar profits sowed the seeds for the overthrow of the Hawaiian monarchy. Eerily prophetic, The Pacific Commercial Advertiser reported that the Lahina Sugar Company paid more in taxes on sugar than the Hawaiian king's salary, which caused the paper to speculate, "We don't advise the Lahina Sugar Company to purchase his sovereignty - that would be treason or treachery, we don't know exactly which." Either way, the sugar industry in Hawaii gradually gained political and economic power in the kingdom, eventually instituting a form of contract labor that verged on slavery. 
The consolidation of wealth and power generated on these plantations proved fertile ground for white businessmen and their ilk, some of whom were Civil War veterans, who favored American annexation of the islands and ultimately overthrew the kingdom of Hawaii in a coup d'état on Jan. 17, 1893. The war that strengthened the United States as a country laid the foundation for the destruction of the kingdom of Hawaii, and inextricably bound the two for centuries yet to come.

HEADLINE: Wheelies: The Civic Tourer Edition

BYLINE: BENJAMIN PRESTON


HIGHLIGHT: The Honda Civic Tourer is a wagon that will be available in Europe only, and Norway&#8217;s prime minister poses as a cabdriver as part of a campaign stunt. 

 BODY:
In which we find you motoring news from around the Web:
 Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, and such is the case with Honda's Civic Tourer. Essentially a Civic wagon, the compact station wagon features rear end lines not unlike those on a 2006 Toyota Matrix. Introduced as a concept at the Geneva auto show this year, Honda released pictures of the production model in advance of the Frankfurt auto show in September, where the car will be unveiled. Love it or hate it, Americans won't be getting a crack at owning the uniquely styled Civic Tourer; it's for European customers only and is, like other European Civics, a different car from the one sold here. (Edmunds) 
 Politicians are typically curious about what their constituents think, but Prime Minister Jens Stoltenberg of Norway took that curiosity to another level in an elaborate re-election campaign stunt. Having heard that people in taxicabs are likely to engage in frank discussion about various topics, he decided to pose as an Oslo cabdriver in order to get people's thoughts on the issues. In a video that Mr. Stoltenberg posted about his experience, a little old lady unloaded on him, saying that she had intended to send him a letter anyway. For his part, Mr. Stoltenberg seemed to enjoy himself, although he admitted to being nervous behind the wheel; he hadn't driven a car in years. (The Guardian)
 If you've ever wanted a flying car, but can't wait for Terrafugia's Transition or the PAL-V three-wheeled gyrocopter - and you happen to have nearly a million dollars and a penchant for odd antiques - you're in luck. Courtesy Aircraft, a Rockford, Ill.-based classic airplane broker, is selling a 1954 Aerocar for $975,000. The Aerocar hasn't been flown in a while and hasn't had a required annual inspection since 1998, but it changes from car mode to airplane mode in about 10 minutes, so if it can't be flown, it can be driven. (The Wall Street Journal)
 Elon Musk, dreamer of big dreams and chief executive of Tesla Motors and SpaceX, has revealed his roughed out plan for another big ticket transportation idea: Hyperloop. Consisting of a series of solar powered capsules traveling through tubes, Mr. Musk surmises that the magnetically propelled transit option could someday get people from Los Angeles to San Francisco in only 30 minutes. The only problem is that Mr. Musk says he doesn't have time to execute the plan. He has his hands full with Tesla and SpaceX, so Hyperloop will have to be someone else's baby. (Tesla Motors)
 Most Americans remember well the era when Japanese automakers ruled the subcompact class. But times are changing, and today about a quarter of all subcompacts sold in the United States are built by Ford and Chevrolet. According to a report from Automotive News, the Ford Fiesta and Chevrolet Sonic were the second- and third-highest selling entry-level subcompacts in the United States last month - behind the top-selling Nissan Versa. Part of that is because subcompact sales rose to 655,153 in 2012, from 179,851 in 2002. And American subcompacts have been getting better, the sales and marketing head for Nissan in the United States, Fred Diaz, told Automotive News. In response, Japanese automakers are looking to build more economy cars in the United States in order to lower costs. (Automotive News)

HEADLINE: A Rating With a High Return: NC-17

BYLINE: CATHERINE RAMPELL


HIGHLIGHT: A look at the box-office return on investment among films of the last decade, sorted by M.P.A.A. rating. 

 BODY:
 Updated, 10:32 p.m. | with comment from Michael Cieply.
After looking at box office returns on investment by genre, I got interested in whether children's films generate high returns.
There is no category specifically for such movies in the OpusData numbers I have; they usually seem to fall under the adventure genre, which includes family-oriented films like "Finding Nemo" and "Toy Story 3" as well as films for older audiences like "Star Trek" and "The Day After Tomorrow." But I do have the Motion Picture Association of America's ratings for films in this data set, which includes movies made from 2003 to 2012 with at least $2 million in domestic box office returns. That allows a look at how G-rated pictures, a decent proxy for children's films, perform at the box office:
As it turns out, G-rated films, on average, book domestic box office returns that are about 2.4 times production budget and global box office returns that are about 5.3 times budget. The domestic box office R.O.I. is almost exactly the same as the average for all films, and the global box office R.O.I. is somewhat better than the average for all films (about 4.5 times budget). 
I bet this measure substantially understates how well G-rated films perform relative to other films though, since children's films like "Finding Nemo" offer a lot of opportunities for lucrative merchandising. Or as Yogurt might say, moi-chendizing.
In any case, you may notice from the chart above that the film rating associated with the highest box office R.O.I. is, by a long shot, NC-17. The worldwide box office revenues for NC-17 films average 6.3 times production budget. (Films that were NC-17 and "Not Rated" were disproportionately foreign films, which is probably why such a high share of their ticket sales were abroad.)
Of course, bear in mind that the average production budget for the NC-17 films in my data set is $8.5 million, compared with about $37.5 million for all the films from 2003 to 2012 for which I could find production budgets. And there are only five films in my data set rated NC-17 - out of nearly 2,000 films total - although I did find publicly reported production budget information for all five of them.
For comparison, there are a lot of G-rated films of the last decade for which production budgets are not public. Only 40 of the 68 G-rated movies in my data set had publicly reported budgets.
 Addendum: My colleague Michael Cieply, who covers the entertainment industry, writes with this smart point: 
 A missing variable that would considerably distort the results is marketing expense. Most NC-17 movies are small films, and small films tend to have marketing budgets that are vastly out of proportion to their production budgets. It's not unheard of, for instance, for an Oscar-style film to cost, say, $5 million or $10 million to produce, but $50 million or more to market. Big films, by contrast, tend to have marketing budgets that are closer to their production budgets. A movie that cost $200 million to produce might cost another $200 million to market around the world. If you're spending 10 times the production budget to market a film, the equation, I think, goes tilt.

HEADLINE: A Conversation With Katrina Lantos Swett, on Religious Freedom in India

BYLINE: MAROOSHA MUZAFFAR


HIGHLIGHT: A leading official at the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom talks about their insistence on keeping Narendra Modi, chief minister of Gujarat State, off American soil. 

 BODY:
 Few Indian politicians evoke dislike and admiration as intense as that inspired by Narendra Modi, the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat. Mr. Modi is the de facto prime ministerial candidate for India's leading opposition party, the Bharatiya Janata Party, in the 2014 parliamentary elections. Mr. Modi has been remodeling himself as a pro-business, pro-development leader who can bring about economic growth and make difficult decisions. Yet the ghosts of the 2002 sectarian violence, in which more than 1,000 Muslims were killed and tens of thousands displaced from their homes under his watch in Gujarat, along with his continuing use of derogatory language to refer to India's Muslims, has raised concerns about his political rise. 
 In 2005, the United States government denied Mr. Modi a diplomatic visa and revoked his existing tourist/business visa under the Immigration and Nationality Act, which makes a foreign government official who is responsible for particularly severe violations of religious freedom ineligible for an American visa. The decision placed Mr. Modi in the company of, among others, associates of Slobodan Milosevic and an Indonesian Army general who was suspected of torture. Mr. Modi has been lobbying to have the decision reversed. 
Maroosha Muzaffar spoke to Katrina Lantos Swett, vice chairwoman of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, a bipartisan government commission that reviews the facts and circumstances of religious freedom violations and makes policy recommendations to the president, the secretary of state and Congress about the commission's insistence on keeping Mr. Modi off American soil. 
 Q. 
On a recent panel, you requested the U.S. State Department to continue the visa ban on Narendra Modi, the chief minister of the Indian state of Gujarat. Mr. Modi is the de facto prime ministerial candidate for India's Bharatiya Janata Party for the country's national elections in 2014. How does the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom see these developments?
 A. 
For the people of India, I think it is important for them to consider very carefully who it is who they want to be their next prime minister. It is no outside nation's or no individual's role to tell them who should be the next leader of India. But I think it is a bit of information that will help them as they go through that electoral process. It is our view and view of many others that Mr. Modi shall not be granted the privilege of U.S. visa because of the very serious doubts that remain and that hang over Mr. Modi relative to his role in the horrific events of 2002 in Gujarat.
The International Religious Freedoms Act, under which we were created, provides very specifically for the requirement that our government should not issue visas to officials that are implicated in serious abuses of religious freedom rights. That provision absolutely applies in this instance. While it is impossible to project down the road, we feel it is important to stand up for the principle involved here, which is that really terrible things happened during his leadership in Gujarat. There are many, many unanswered questions that remain, there are at are many grave allegations, there are huge doubts.
 Q. 
Indian courts have not yet found any evidence of Mr. Modi's involvement in the 2002 violence in Gujarat. You say that there are still some grave allegations, some doubts hanging over his role in the 2002 riots.
 A. 
As you know, one of his ministers (Maya Kodnani) was recently convicted for her role in these events. Given the nature of the way the governments function, it is highly unlikely at the very least that this minister would have been engaged to the degree that she was without the knowledge, without the direction from Mr. Modi. There is of course the very damning sworn notarized affidavit of former deputy commissioner of police Sanjeev Bhatt, which is really an eyewitness account. He is not simply providing sworn testimony as to events that happened on the streets. His testimony is also regarding things that were said by Mr. Modi in his presence. There are very powerful letters that were signed by 65 members of the lower house and upper house and they cite a number of grave concerns.
And let's set aside, just for a moment, whether or not Mr. Modi was directly complicit in the events of 2002. There is a lot to be troubled about what has happened since or what has failed to happen. Legal accountability, you know, when you think of the numbers that were killed, the incredible number of rapes, the vast displacement, the burning and trashing of property, there should have been by now significant numbers of people held legally accountable. We find that that really hasn't happened.
There have been very few convictions. One of the things that concern us is that Mr. Modi seems more concerned with rehabilitating his own reputation than with providing recompense and rehabilitation for the surviving victims of those terrible events. Where are the reparations that have been paid? Where are the public apologies, public accounting for what went on? These to me are all indications that to some degree we are seeing a very ambitious man more focused on his political rehabilitation than on really righting the wrongs.
I think there is a difference between whether or not one can be held legally liable or accountable for something and going so far as to say a clean bill of health, a clean chit. Certainly in our system of justice you can be found not guilty, which is not the same thing as found innocent.
Under these circumstances we should follow our laws, which say that we should not give a visa. Of course Mr. Modi wants us to reverse our position because that would be part of his rehabilitation process. But perhaps it would be more instructive for observers and analysts and voters in India to have that piece of information as they evaluate whether or not he is the man who should lead India.
 Q. 
Your critics say that International Religious Freedom Act is selectively invoked.
 A. 
India is a great democracy and we tend to expect more of democracies than we do of dictatorships. That is not to say that your question is not a valid one. But I do see it as a compliment to India that we hold India to a very high standard because India is the world's largest democracy. I would say that maybe India is held to that higher standard because you have shown that you embrace the values that we embrace in terms of democracy.
 Q. 
Are the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom and the State Department on the same page? A spokesman for the State Department said in April that Mr. Modi is welcome to apply for a U.S. visa. What does that mean?
 A. 
I think it was an intentionally ambiguous statement. It is one of the reasons we went public with a (November 2012) letter to Secretary Clinton asking for continuation of the decision to deny a visa to Mr. Modi to influence the State Department. We are independent but we work closely with the State Department, especially its international religious freedom office. But there are plenty of policy conclusions where we come down in a somewhat different place from the State Department.
 Q. 
What motivates the State Department to ignore some of your recommendations?
 A. 
The State Department has a more difficult job than we do because they are balancing American security interests, American commercial interests, American cultural interests, American exchange interests, a whole range of diplomatic interests, and one of the things that they are putting into that mix is the defense of our fundamental values, human rights and religious freedom and other such things. Because of its much larger portfolio the State Department cannot be as single-minded as we are.
 Q. 
After the 2002 riots in Gujarat, the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom recommended that India be on the "countries of particular concern" list (a global list of the worst offenders of religious freedom) but the State Department ignored it. In your latest report, you have placed India on the Tier 2 list of countries, which includes Afghanistan, Russia, Cuba, Nigeria, Laos, Azerbaijan and Kazakhstan.
 A. 
India merits being on the Tier 2 list for the state of its religious freedom.
It is sometimes frustrating to see some of the countries we are critical of on the grounds of religious freedom. For instance, in Burma, there has been some real progress and real development in terms of democracy and many other criteria, but there have been some disconcerting developments when it comes to religious freedom and sectarian violence.
 Q. 
Is it true that the State Department does not view the 2005 visa denial and revocation as a religious freedom issue?
 A. 
Well, that's one dimension of it. Obviously what happened in 2002 in Gujarat was sectarian violence on a really massive scale. I don't think you can say that that wasn't a religious issue. It was a religious issue and the 2005 visa denial harks back to that. I am not quite sure why they would have said that. There is no ignoring of the central role of the violence and the destruction that took place. And there is no avoiding the sectarian nature of it. It was by all accounts religiously based.
 Q. 
If Mr. Modi were to apply for a visa now, what are the chances of the U.S. Department of State denying him the visa?
 A. 
I don't think I am in a position to answer that question, and I think if you ask the State Department the same question, you will get a polite "no comment." I would say there probably are different camps within the State Department. This is being debated in a lively way. If you go to the Congress, you will find members of Congress who are saying we have got to give this guy a visa, and you will find an equal number of congressmen saying that it would really be a betrayal of our values.
 Q. 
In the U.S. Congress, are the supporters and opponents of Mr. Modi's visa divided along party lines?
 A. 
I don't think it breaks along partisan lines. I think it breaks down along which congressmen prioritize human rights versus who don't. We met recently Cynthia Lummis and she has asked for more information. Not only did I testify before her and made a strong case for why the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom has taken the position it had on it, but after that she did request additional information from us. She said something to the effect that somebody is presumed to be innocent until proven guilty. I pointed out that we were not talking about us passing a judgment of guilt or innocence, but whether or not we would extend a privilege. To get a visa to this country is not a right but a privilege. It is not a matter of standards of proofs in a court of law but whether or not the privilege should be extended to someone.

HEADLINE: The Ad Campaign: Thompson Emphasizes His Roots

BYLINE: DAVID W. CHEN


HIGHLIGHT: William C. Thompson Jr. is on the air with two 30-second commercials, both of which are heavily biographical. 

 BODY:
First aired: August 13, 2013 Produced by: The Campaign Group For: William C. Thompson Jr. 
Four years after losing a closer-than-expected election to Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, William C. Thompson Jr., a former comptroller, is back on the air with two commercials as he tries to improve his position in a crowded Democratic primary. Both 30-second commercials are heavily biographical and feature Mr. Thompson speaking directly to the camera. The more vivid of the two ads is titled "Believe." 
Fact-Check0:06 "I grew up in Brooklyn. My father was a judge. My mother a teacher. We had good public schools, good jobs. That's the New York we believe in." 
A smiling Mr. Thompson, wearing a suit and tie, tries to project his sunniest and most homespun persona. Backed by a peppy, jazz-infused score, Mr. Thompson talks about his grandparents, both Caribbean immigrants. He is filmed standing in front of the Bedford-Stuyvesant row house in which he grew up, emphasizing his Brooklyn roots even though he now lives in Manhattan. His rose-tinted description of his formative years overlooks the fact that in the mid-1970s, when Mr. Thompson was entering the job market, the city was in the throes of a fiscal crisis, with double-digit unemployment rates, and the schools were generally viewed as a disaster.
0:15 "More affordable. Safer streets. Better schools in every neighborhood. I'm Bill Thompson. I'll always remember where I come from and who I'm standing up for." 
Mr. Thompson pledges to do what every candidate - Democrat or Republican - has focused on if elected: make the city more affordable and safer, and improve the schools. In a sign of his institutional support, he is seen walking with firefighters outside a firehouse, and talking with New Yorkers on the street, while a graphic notes that he has been endorsed by firefighters, Democratic leaders and teachers. The ad concludes with a smiling Mr. Thompson surrounded by his family: his father, a former judge; his wife; and his adult daughter.
Scorecard
Mr. Thompson's mission is simple here: Even though voters may not remember him much from his 2009 run, he wants them to know that he is back. By mentioning his Caribbean roots, he is indirectly highlighting the fact that he is the only black candidate in the mayor's race, which could be a plus among black and Hispanic voters. He speaks more slowly than the other candidates who have aired ads, as if to reinforce his message that he is the calm, deliberate adult in the field.

HEADLINE: The Real Price of Congress's Gridlock

BYLINE: By ROBERT B. REICH. 
Robert B. Reich, the secretary of labor from 1993 to 1997 and a professor of public policy at the University of California, Berkeley, is the subject of the documentary film ''Inequality for All.''

 BODY:
BERKELEY, Calif. -- CONGRESS began its summer recess last week and won't reconvene until after Labor Day. You'd be forgiven for not noticing a difference. With just 15 bills signed into law so far this year, the 113th Congress is on pace to be the most unproductive since at least the 1940s.
But just because the legislature has ceased to function doesn't mean our government has. Political decision making has moved to peripheral public entities, where power is exercised less transparently and accountability to voters is less direct. What we're losing in the process isn't government -- it's democracy. 
Take the Federal Reserve. Absent any Congressional legislation to speak of -- no short-term spending to increase job growth, no long-term plan to reduce the budget deficit -- the nation's central bank has been forced to do all the heavy lifting with the economy. The $85 billion of bonds it buys each month is now the main form of government stimulus to the economy as well as the linchpin of continued job growth. Congress's inability to pass effective fiscal policy means that the Fed's monetary policy, to keep long-term interest rates as low as possible, has become the only game in town for boosting private spending and investment.
But the strategy also poses serious risks, like asset bubbles, if borrowers use the cheap money to speculate; bond collapses, if the Fed slows its bond buying too quickly and spooks the market; and inflation, if low interest rates cause buyers and sellers to expect prices to rise. It could also increase income inequality, by giving wealthy investors a cheap source of funds to expand their portfolios. Forcing the Fed to become the sole decision maker on the economy is also why the selection of a new Fed chairman has become so important -- even more important than it ought to be.
Congress's paralysis has also encouraged the Supreme Court to enter the political fray. Normally the judicial activism of recent years could be checked by Congressional action. But not now. Justice Anthony M. Kennedy's opinion for the majority in the 2010 Citizens United case, which struck down limits on corporate campaign contributions, rested partly on the presumption that Congress would require corporations to disclose their political expenditures. But no bill requiring full disclosure has stood a chance of making it through the quagmire.
The court's decision this summer in Shelby County v. Holder handed Congress the task of coming up with a new, updated formula for deciding which states and localities need permission from the Justice Department, under the Voting Rights Act, to make changes to their election processes. But legislative paralysis makes the passage of any new formula highly unlikely. Seen in this light, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s deciding vote last year to uphold the Affordable Care Act probably reflected his reasonable fear that the court would otherwise be viewed, not unfairly, as just another political battleground.
Or consider climate change. It's a public debate the nation briefly embarked on in the 2008 presidential race, when John McCain and Barack Obama presented different plans for cap-and-trade systems. Naturally, gridlock in Congress put an end to it. After the election, Mr. McCain backed off any cap-and-trade plan, and the two parties have been at loggerheads over the environment ever since.
The issue ultimately lost the spotlight to a debate over Mr. Obama's choice for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, Gina McCarthy, who is expected to use the E.P.A.'s authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon emissions of power plants; and to a Congressional showdown, motivated in part by Mr. Obama's E.P.A. appointment, over the use of the filibuster on presidential nominees.
Mr. Obama won the skirmish and got his administrator, but don't expect much public deliberation over carbon emissions from here on. The E.P.A. will handle the issue through regulatory rule making, mostly unchecked by Congress and the public.
A final displacement of national politics has been onto state governments, now grappling with everything from undocumented immigrants and gun control to gay marriage and abortion. While many political matters should be left to the states, these cry out for federal standards because of the relative ease with which undocumented immigrants, gun sellers, gay couples and women seeking abortions can transport themselves to more accommodating jurisdictions.
What's more, these institutions aren't even understood by the public to be making political decisions with national implications. Media coverage tends to be narrowly drawn for insiders -- macroeconomists, constitutional scholars, E.P.A. watchers, the residents of a particular state -- or trivialized for outsiders: Should the next Fed chief be female? Are Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas too openly partisan? Is Ms. McCarthy too much of a firebrand? Are ''red'' states diverging from ''blue'' states?
The Republican right -- mostly new House members who are supported by the Tea Party and who are in open rebellion against the rest of the right -- are probably pleased with the gridlock in Congress. They would like nothing better than to stop the federal government from functioning. But they may not fully grasp that their efforts have only shifted power elsewhere in the system.
Some of the institutions gaining power may be making decisions consistent with conservative values: the Supreme Court and some state governments, for instance. But hardly all (the Fed and the E.P.A.).
In any event, it's bizarre that a self-styled populist insurrection would end up making our government less accountable to the people. But that's exactly what it's done. What's really gridlocked now is democracy.

HEADLINE: U.S., Filing Suit, Moves to Block Airline Merger

BYLINE: By JAD MOUAWAD; Christopher Drew and Edward Wyatt contributed reporting.

 BODY:
Updated, 8:44 p.m. | After a decade of rapid consolidation in the nation's airline industry, the Justice Department filed a lawsuit on Tuesday to block the proposed merger between American Airlines and US Airways, which would create the world's largest airline.
The move, joined by attorneys general from six states and the District of Columbia, surprised industry officials, who had expected little resistance to the deal. But it underscored a newly aggressive approach by the Justice Department's antitrust division, which has been more closely scrutinizing proposed mergers as the economy recovers. In 2011, for example, it blocked the merger of AT&T and T-Mobile, and this year it forced Anheuser-Busch InBev to significantly alter the terms of its takeover of the brewer of Corona before approving it.
The airline industry, though, has had a nearly unfettered run of mergers in recent years, and the American-US Airways combination was seen as the capstone. In no small part, this consolidation of the industry into a handful of carriers had the support of regulators. Starting in 2008, the Justice Department approved the mergers of Delta Air Lines and Northwest, United Airlines and Continental, and Southwest and AirTran. 
But antitrust regulators said these past mergers had in effect undermined the case for the American-US Airways combination. While those mergers helped the industry return to profitability and brought more stability, they also led to higher fares, regulators said. A union between American and US Airways would take the consolidation too far, the Justice Department said, hurting consumers and leading to substantially less competition and higher airfares and fees, and to less service to many airports.
''Today's action proves our determination to fight for the best interests of consumers by ensuring robust competition in the marketplace,'' said Eric H. Holder Jr., the United States attorney general.
The decision to file a civil antitrust lawsuit in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia brought an unusually strong reaction from the airlines. In a joint statement, American and US Airways said they would mount a ''vigorous and strong defense'' of their plan.
''We believe that the D.O.J. is wrong in its assessment of our merger,'' the airlines said. A combined American and US Airways, they said, would create more options for customers than either airline could offer on their own.
Doug Parker, chief executive of US Airways, who was planned to run the combined airlines, struck a defiant tone in a statement to employees, saying, ''We will close the merger before year end.''
In arguing against the merger, the Justice Department said the vast majority of domestic airline routes were already highly concentrated. The merger, it said, would result in four airlines controlling more than 80 percent of the United States market for commercial air travel.
''We looked very carefully for six months at this deal, and we think it's pretty messed up,'' said William J. Baer, the assistant attorney general in charge of the department's antitrust division. ''It looks pretty bad for consumers.''
He told reporters that the merger could cost consumers ''hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars.''
He said regulators reached that conclusion after reviewing internal plans for the merger at US Airways and American and studying how much fares rose after the other giant mergers.
Asked if some type of compromise might still be possible, Mr. Baer said, ''We think a full-stop injunction is the right course for the consumer.''
Mr. Baer said the combined airline's pricing power would be apparent at Ronald Reagan National Airport near Washington, where it would have a monopoly on 63 percent of the nonstop routes.
JetBlue's expansion at that airport in 2010 led to 30 percent cuts in some fares, he said. But JetBlue leases half of its takeoff and landing slots from American, which could cancel that deal if the merger occurred.
Mr. Baer, who took over in January, has demonstrated that he is not afraid of taking a fight to court, analysts said, as he did this year with the case in which the department charged that Apple colluded with publishers over e-book pricing. Last month, a federal judge agreed, ruling against Apple.
''They've shown that they are not going to be gun-shy about enforcing antitrust laws,'' said Michael A. Carrier, a distinguished professor at Rutgers University law school.
Joining the Justice Department in filing the suit were attorneys general from Texas and Arizona, where American and US Airways are based, as well as Florida, the District of Columbia, Pennsylvania, Tennessee and Virginia.
The last time the Justice Department challenged a merger was the proposed combination of United Airlines and US Airways in 2001. But the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, sharply altered the financial stakes for the industry, pushing several carriers into bankruptcy -- including Delta, United and Continental -- and leading to about $60 billion in losses for the industry in the following decade. American was the last of the major carriers to file for bankruptcy protection, in November 2011.
The Justice Department's announcement represents a significant setback for American's plans to exit bankruptcy. It amounts to a rebuttal to the position taken by a federal bankruptcy judge, who approved the merger as part of American's restructuring plan. What is more, all three labor groups representing American employees, including pilots, flight attendants and mechanics, backed the plan put forward by US Airways to merge the airlines.
In doing so, they opposed the initial plan championed by American managers to remain an independent carrier and emerge from bankruptcy alone. That plan, however, was viewed by most analysts as unrealistic given how big Delta and United have become since their respective mergers.
In laying out its case, the Justice Department quotes US Airways executives describing how consolidation had helped the industry raise fares. It also discusses how US Airways provides some low-fare competition through its Advantage Fares program, saying that other carriers, including American and Delta, routinely matched those lower fares.
The Justice Department also explained how American could exit bankruptcy as a ''vigorous competitor'' without the merger, saying it would have ''strong incentives to grow to better compete with Delta and United.'' As an example, it cited the carrier's large new aircraft order and said that American's stand-alone plan called for increasing flights and destinations.
The decision surprised airline analysts.
'' 'Bizarre' is one word,'' said Robert Mann, an airline consultant and former executive, who characterized the Justice Department as ''late to the game with concerns over airline industry consolidation.''
A report by the Government Accountability Office in June found that the planned merger would reduce competition in a far larger number of airports than earlier airline mergers, including the one that fused United and Continental into the nation's current leader.
The Obama administration was heavily criticized in its first two years for seemingly failing to keep campaign promises of active antitrust enforcement. One of the antitrust division's first actions in 2009 was to withdraw a Bush administration policy that favored caution by regulators and the development of safe harbors for companies that controlled a given market.
After that, however, the administration had to deal with the fallout from the financial crisis and the housing collapse, and significant antitrust action was delayed until the second half of the administration's first term, said Stacey Anne Mahoney, a partner at Bingham McCutchen in New York.
''The second Obama administration is building up some steam in terms of federal antitrust enforcement efforts,'' Ms. Mahoney said. Earlier this year, it had seven antitrust actions in litigation at the same time, the most ever, officials said.The Justice Department's lawsuit against the merger of American Airlines and USAirways by DealBook
This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.

GRAPHIC: CHARTS: A Case Against the Merger: The Justice Department and seven attorneys general filed a lawsuit to block the merger between US Airways and American Airlines. The civil complaint argues that competition among airlines would be lessened and airfares could rise for consumers. One of the complaint's key arguments is that US Airways offers cheaper fares, but with one stop, bringing more passengers through its smaller hubs. These fares, which have benefited last-minute travelers as an alternative to higher nonstop fares, could disappear in the merger. (Source: ITA Airfare Matrix, via Department of Justice) (A3)

HEADLINE: Operators Of Jitneys Scrutinized After Crash

BYLINE: By KIRK SEMPLE

 BODY:
WEST NEW YORK, N.J. -- From behind the wheel of his 21-seat minibus, Joseph Cruz sees things with exceptional clarity. He has divided the world -- at least, the helter-skelter world of commercial minibuses in which he has made his living for 11 years -- into two camps: the safe drivers and everyone else.
''Incredible!'' Mr. Cruz, 42, exclaimed as a competing minibus zipped around him on Bergenline Avenue here and blew through a red light in the hunt for the next fare.
''You got some animals,'' he muttered. ''Some people just don't care.'' 
Ever since July 30, when a minibus barreled off a busy road in this small town and killed an 8-month-old girl in her stroller, a torrent of outrage has been directed at Mr. Cruz's industry, an informal, loosely regulated network of minibuses that has evolved over the past few decades into a bustling commuter system linking gentrifying and working-class communities in New Jersey with Manhattan.
The death has drawn intense scrutiny to what for many riders is a critical 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week alternative to the large fleet of more conventional buses operated by New Jersey Transit that are often overcrowded and more expensive.
Known by a range of names -- jitneys, dollar buses, guaguas, colectivos -- the minibuses carry an eclectic mix of riders: construction workers with their tools, corporate employees, the unemployed looking for work, late-night revelers in high heels and travelers lugging suitcases to inexpensive New Jersey motels.
But for all their conveniences, their drivers have developed a reputation for flouting conventional traffic laws as they jockey for fares, picking up and dropping off passengers at random locations, blocking traffic and driving recklessly in a rhythm reminiscent of a bumper car ride at an amusement park.
Officials said that at the time of the fatal crash last month, the driver of the bus, Idowu Daramola, 48, was speeding and using his cellphone before plowing into a light pole, which fell over and crushed the baby girl, Angelie Paredes. Mr. Daramola has been charged with death by auto, reckless driving and using a cellphone while operating a vehicle.
Since then, almost everyone connected to minibuses -- passengers, drivers, company owners and public officials -- has called for stricter regulation.
This consensus, though, has not translated into unity. Officials blame the company owners and drivers; the drivers blame the owners and one another; the owners blame other companies and their drivers; the passengers blame everyone, not least the authorities for allowing the hazards and disorder to persist.
But the drivers and company owners, even as they call for more oversight, have also cautioned against an overreaction by the authorities that would threaten an industry largely run by striving immigrants and serving a largely working-class immigrant ridership.
''We want to protect the industry,'' said Sergio Garces, 59, a Chilean immigrant and president of a recently formed association of jitney drivers.
Jitney loyalists say the minibuses are cheaper and quicker than New Jersey Transit, whose full-size buses work the same routes but come less often, particularly late at night, and will bypass stops during the morning and afternoon rush because they are already full.
Early one recent morning, Anna Alvarez, 34, stood on South Marginal Highway in Weehawken, not far from the entrance to the Lincoln Tunnel, waiting for a jitney to take her to her job in Manhattan. ''I usually take it due to the fact that you sometimes wait long for the buses,'' Ms. Alvarez said.
Underscoring her point, jitneys heading for Manhattan rolled by at a clip of about one per minute, charging $3 a ride; New Jersey Transit buses, charging $3.20, were far less frequent.
But Mauricio Gonzalez, 47, a Colombian hair stylist, was content to wait. ''They're crazy, these guys,'' he said as he let numerous jitneys pass in favor of the next New Jersey Transit bus. ''They go so fast, they don't care about nothing and it's hot inside.''
It is an amorphous industry. Nobody seems to know just how many jitneys are in operation. Government officials and longtime operators estimated that there were hundreds of buses.
Ever Escobar, a co-owner of Vanessa Express Company, a 25-year-old business in Jersey City, said there might be about 30 companies, including ones that had only one or two vehicles, operating in a zone bounded by Fort Lee to the north, Bayonne to the south and Paterson to the west.
Regulation of the industry is equally uncertain, officials said. Depending on their size and where they travel, jitney companies can be subject to regulatory oversight from an assortment of federal and state agencies. But enforcement has been uneven, said Barry Lefkowitz, executive director of Limousine Associations of New Jersey. Mr. Lefkowitz said he had been lobbying for new legislation that would help standardize the industry.
The fierce competition is easy to understand: drivers earn wages based on volume, so the more passengers they pick up, the more money they make.
Many drivers rent their buses, paying companies $100 or more a day. After covering the cost of fuel, the rest of the day's proceeds goes into the drivers' pockets. On a good day, drivers said, they could clear $150; on a bad day they may barely break even.
Following the crash in West New York, the Hudson County sheriff, Frank Schillari, announced what he called ''a massive crackdown'' on the jitney buses.
Michael Makarski, a spokesman for the sheriff, said last week that he was not permitted to publicize the results of the campaign, but said that at least one minibus had been impounded and its driver and the bus's owner had been issued summonses because the driver was operating the vehicle with suspended personal and commercial driver's licenses.
The death and the resulting outcry have also given impetus to a newly formed drivers' group, the Association of Professional Interstate Conductors. Created in an attempt to provide a lobbying counterweight to the power of the bus company owners, the association is now focused on introducing measures that would help the industry regulate itself, including training guidelines, background checks for drivers and more order in the number and distribution of jitneys on the road.
''We want to change the image of the industry,'' said José H. Valdez, another leader of the association and a jitney driver from El Salvador.
The association's leadership has been trying to win the support of elected officials in the region. One afternoon this week, Mr. Garces and Mr. Valdez met with Dr. Felix E. Roque, a physician who is the mayor of West New York, to discuss their concerns.
''What you're doing is important for the community,'' said Dr. Roque, who immigrated to the United States from Cuba when he was a child. ''We're here to help you guys. But at the same time we have to protect the public.''
The region's elected officials are not waiting for the industry to begin policing itself. Last Tuesday, several of them, including Dr. Roque, gathered at the site of the crash and called for greater oversight of the industry, with stricter licensing, mandatory training of drivers, tougher enforcement of vehicle maintenance regulations and higher penalties for traffic infractions.
Mr. Garces, the association's president, listened intently as one official after another complained of the industry's problems and announced their support for tighter regulations.
''They're killing us,'' he murmured, shaking his head. ''Public opinion, the whole world, is against the drivers.''

HEADLINE: In Brazil, Kerry Is Told Spying Sows 'Distrust'

BYLINE: By SIMON ROMERO

 BODY:
RIO DE JANEIRO -- Brazil's foreign minister on Tuesday excoriated the surveillance practices of the United States, dismissing as unsatisfactory Secretary of State John Kerry's explanation of the wide-ranging collection of data on telephone and electronic communications and describing the spying as ''a new type of challenge'' in Brazil's relationship with the United States.
Foreign Minister Antonio Patriota issued the unusual expression of indignation over the National Security Agency's spying programs while standing next to Mr. Kerry at a news conference in Brasília, the capital, where the secretary of state had stopped on a two-day trip to South America, largely in an attempt to allay concerns in Brazil over the N.S.A.'s spying. 
Resentment has festered in Brazil since revelations of the surveillance practices emerged in July, detailing how the agency established a data collection center in Brasília and prioritized Brazil, with its vast telecommunications hubs and large population of 200 million, as among the agency's most spied-upon countries.
Washington's ties with Brazil remain warm: President Dilma Rousseff is scheduled to go to the White House in October for a highly anticipated state visit; high-level contacts continue in areas like energy and agriculture, according to Mr. Patriota; and trade between the two countries is thriving (though still eclipsed by Brazil's robust commerce with China). Still, the surveillance has clearly struck a nerve.
Mr. Patriota, a former ambassador to the United States, said that the surveillance practices ''cast a shadow of distrust'' over bilateral relations and that ''listening to explanations doesn't mean accepting the status quo.''
Mr. Kerry absorbed these comments before defending the programs and trying to assuage concerns. ''Brazil is owed answers with respect to those questions, and they will get them,'' he said. ''And we will work together very positively to make certain that this question -- these issues -- do not get in the way of all the other things that we talked about.''
Convincing Brazil that such spying is needed may be an uphill struggle, but the Obama administration knows that without strong ties with Brazil, the United States cannot have a satisfactory approach to a range of issues in Latin America, including energy integration, curbs on environmental degradation and the fight against drug trafficking.
Mr. Kerry tried to emphasize the positive aspects of relations with Brazil by focusing on subjects like the government's plans here to send tens of thousands of Brazilian students to American universities and vigorous bilateral trade, tilted in advantage of the United States in the form of an ample surplus.
Still, it was clear at the end of Mr. Kerry's visit that solutions to certain problems remain unresolved, like Washington's requirement that Brazilians traveling to the United States have visas, even though Brazilians rank among the highest-spending foreign tourists and Brazilian companies are increasingly investing in the United States.
Brazil, for its part, has maintained warm and even improving relations with Washington while simultaneously raising its economic and diplomatic profile in the developing world, especially in Latin America, the Middle East and Africa. In Cuba, Venezuela and other countries where the United States is officially viewed as antagonistic, Brazil has emerged as a major trading partner.
''The surveillance leaks are very serious, but they also give Brazil an opportunity, since the U.S. often presents itself as an example of good leadership,'' said Elena Lazarou, director of the Center for International Relations at Fundação Getúlio Vargas, a top Brazilian university.

HEADLINE: Unease at Clinton Foundation Over Finances and Ambitions

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS CONFESSORE and AMY CHOZICK; Lydia Polgreen contributed reporting, and Kitty Bennett contributed research.

 BODY:
Soon after the 10th anniversary of the foundation bearing his name, Bill Clinton met with a small group of aides and two lawyers from Simpson Thacher & Bartlett. Two weeks of interviews with Clinton Foundation executives and former employees had led the lawyers to some unsettling conclusions.
The review echoed criticism of Mr. Clinton's early years in the White House: For all of its successes, the Clinton Foundation had become a sprawling concern, supervised by a rotating board of old Clinton hands, vulnerable to distraction and threatened by conflicts of interest. It ran multimillion-dollar deficits for several years, despite vast amounts of money flowing in.
And concern was rising inside and outside the organization about Douglas J. Band, a onetime personal assistant to Mr. Clinton who had started a lucrative corporate consulting firm -- which Mr. Clinton joined as a paid adviser -- while overseeing the Clinton Global Initiative, the foundation's glitzy annual gathering of chief executives, heads of state, and celebrities.
The review set off more than a year of internal debate, and spurred an evolution in the organization that included Mr. Clinton's daughter, Chelsea, taking on a dominant new role as the family grappled with the question of whether the foundation -- and its globe-spanning efforts to combat AIDS, obesity and poverty -- would survive its founder. 
Now those efforts are taking on new urgency. In the coming weeks, the foundation, long Mr. Clinton's domain since its formation in 2001, will become the nerve center of Hillary Rodham Clinton's increasingly busy public life.
This fall, Mrs. Clinton and her staff will move into offices at the foundation's new headquarters in Midtown Manhattan, occupying two floors of the Time-Life Building. Amid speculation about her 2016 plans, Mrs. Clinton is adding major new initiatives on women, children and jobs to what has been renamed the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation.
Worried that the foundation's operating revenues depend too heavily on Mr. Clinton's nonstop fund-raising, the three Clintons are embarking on a drive to raise an endowment of as much as $250 million, with events already scheduled in the Hamptons and London. And after years of relying on Bruce R. Lindsey, the former White House counsel whose friendship with Mr. Clinton stretches back decades, to run the organization while living part-time in Arkansas, the family has hired a New York-based chief executive with a background in management consulting.
''We're trying to institutionalize the foundation so that it will be here long after the lives of any of us,'' Mr. Lindsey said. ''That's our challenge and that is what we are trying to address.''
But the changing of the guard has aggravated long-simmering tensions within the former first family's inner circle as the foundation tries to juggle the political and philanthropic ambitions of a former president, a potential future president, and their increasingly visible daughter.
And efforts to insulate the foundation from potential conflicts have highlighted just how difficult it can be to disentangle the Clintons' charity work from Mr. Clinton's moneymaking ventures and Mrs. Clinton's political future, according to interviews with more than two dozen former and current foundation employees, donors and advisers to the family. Nearly all of them declined to speak for attribution, citing their unwillingness to alienate the Clinton family.

Last Thursday, Mr. Clinton arrived two hours late to an exuberant welcome at a health clinic about 60 miles north of Johannesburg. Children in zebra-striped loincloths sang as Mr. Clinton and Ms. Clinton made their entrance, and the former president enthusiastically explained how his foundation had helped the South African government negotiate large reductions in the price of drugs that halt the progress of HIV. Aaron Motsoaledi, South Africa's minister of health, heaped praise on the effort. ''Because of your help we are able to treat three and a half times more people than we used to,'' he told the crowd.
The project is typical of the model pioneered by the Clinton Foundation, built around dozens of partnerships with private companies, governments, or other nonprofit groups. Instead of handing out grants, the foundation recruits donors and advises them on how best to deploy their money or resources, from helping Procter & Gamble donate advanced water-purification packets to developing countries to working with credit card companies to expand the volume of low-cost loans offered to poor inner city residents.
The foundation, which has 350 employees in 180 countries, remains largely powered by Mr. Clinton's global celebrity and his ability to connect corporate executives, A-listers and government officials. On this month's Africa trip, Mr. Clinton was accompanied by the actors Dakota Fanning and Jesse Eisenberg and the son of the New York City mayoral candidate John A. Catsimatidis, a longtime donor.
For most of the foundation's existence, its leadership has been dominated by loyal veterans of the Clintons' political lives. Ira C. Magaziner, who was a Rhodes scholar with Mr. Clinton and ran Mrs. Clinton's failed attempt at a health care overhaul in the 1990s, is widely credited as the driving force behind the foundation's largest project, the Clinton Health Access Initiative, which, among other efforts, negotiates bulk purchasing agreements and price discounts on lifesaving medicines.
Mr. Band, who arrived at the White House in 1995 and worked his way up to become Mr. Clinton's closest personal aide, standing behind the president on golf courses and the global stage, helped build the foundation's fund-raising structure. He conceived of and for many years helped run the Clinton Global Initiative, the annual conference that draws hundreds of business leaders and heads of state to New York City where attendees are pushed to make specific philanthropic commitments.
Today, big-name companies vie to buy sponsorships at prices of $250,000 and up, money that has helped subsidize the foundation's annual operating costs. Last year, the foundation and two subsidiaries had revenues of more than $214 million.
Yet the foundation's expansion has also been accompanied by financial problems. In 2007 and 2008, the foundation also found itself competing against Mrs. Clinton's presidential campaign for donors amid a recession. Millions of dollars in contributions intended to seed an endowment were diverted to other programs, creating tension between Mr. Magaziner and Mr. Band. The foundation piled up a $40 million deficit during those two years, according to tax returns. Last year, it ran more than $8 million in the red.
Amid those shortfalls, the foundation has sometimes catered to donors and celebrities who gave money in ways that raised eyebrows in the low-key nonprofit world. In 2009, during a Clinton Global Initiative gathering at the University of Texas at Austin, the foundation purchased a first-class ticket for the actress Natalie Portman, a special guest, who brought her beloved Yorkie, according to two former foundation employees.
In interviews, foundation officials partly blamed the 2008 recession and difficulties in getting donors to provide operating support rather than restricted grants for specific programs for the deficits.
But others criticized Mr. Magaziner, who is widely seen within the foundation as impulsive and lacking organizational skills. On one occasion, Mr. Magaziner dispatched a team of employees to fly around the world for months gathering ideas for a climate change proposal that never got off the ground. Another time, he ignored a report -- which was commissioned at significant expense from the consulting firm McKinsey & Company -- on how the foundation could get involved in forestry initiatives.
Mr. Magaziner's management style and difficulty keeping projects within budget were also raised in discussions that surrounded the 2011 Simpson Thacher review. (One person who attended a meeting with Mr. Magaziner recalled his lying on a conference room table in the middle of the meeting because of terrible back spasms, snapping at a staff member.)
Mr. Band repeatedly urged Mr. Clinton to fire Mr. Magaziner, according to people briefed on the matter. Mr. Clinton refused, confiding in aides that despite Mr. Magaziner's managerial weaknesses, he was a visionary with good intentions. The former president, according to one person who knows them both, ''thinks Ira is brilliant -- and brilliant people get away with a lot in Clinton world.''
Indeed, by then, Mr. Magaziner had persuaded Mr. Clinton and the foundation to spin the health initiative off into a separate organization, with Mr. Magaziner as its chief executive and the Clinton Foundation appointing a majority of its board members. The financial problems continued. In 2010 and 2011, the first two years when the health initiative operated as a stand-alone organization, it ran annual shortfalls of more than $4 million. A new chief financial officer, hired in 2010, left eight months later.
A foundation official said the health initiative had only three chief financial officers in 10 years and that its financial problem was a common one in the nonprofit world: For all the grant money coming in -- more than $160 million in 2011 -- Mr. Magaziner had also had difficulty raising money for operating costs. But by the end of 2011, the health initiative had expanded its board, adding two seats. Chelsea Clinton took one.
Growing Ventures
As the foundation grew, so did the outside business ventures pursued by Mr. Clinton and several of his aides.
None have drawn more scrutiny in Clinton circles than Teneo, a firm co-founded in 2009 by Mr. Band, described by some as a kind of surrogate son to Mr. Clinton. Aspiring to merge corporate consulting, public relations and merchant banking in a single business, Mr. Band poached executives from Wall Street, recruited other Clinton aides to join as employees or advisers and set up shop in a Midtown office formerly belonging to one of the country's top hedge funds.
By 2011, the firm had added a third partner, Declan Kelly, a former State Department envoy for Mrs. Clinton. And Mr. Clinton had signed up as a paid adviser to the firm.
Teneo worked on retainer, charging monthly fees as high as $250,000, according to current and former clients. The firm recruited clients who were also Clinton Foundation donors, while Mr. Band and Mr. Kelly encouraged others to become new foundation donors. Its marketing materials highlighted Mr. Band's relationship with Mr. Clinton and the Clinton Global Initiative, where Mr. Band sat on the board of directors through 2011 and remains an adviser. Some Clinton aides and foundation employees began to wonder where the foundation ended and Teneo began.
Those worries intensified after the collapse of MF Global, the international brokerage firm led by Jon S. Corzine, a former governor of New Jersey, in the fall of 2011. The firm had been among Teneo's earliest clients, and its collapse over bad European investments -- while paying $125,000 a month for the firm's public relations and financial advice -- drew Teneo and the Clintons unwanted publicity.
Mr. Clinton ended his advisory role with Teneo in March 2012, after an article appeared in The New York Post suggesting that Mrs. Clinton was angry over the MF Global controversy. A spokesman for Mr. Clinton denied the report. But in a statement released afterward, Mr. Clinton announced that he would no longer be paid by Teneo.
He also praised Mr. Band effusively, crediting him with keeping the foundation afloat and expressing hopes that Mr. Band would continue to advise the Global Initiative.
''I couldn't have accomplished half of what I have in my post-presidency without Doug Band,'' Mr. Clinton said in the statement.
Even that news release was a source of controversy within the foundation, according to two people with knowledge of the discussions. Mr. Band helped edit the statement, which other people around the Clintons felt gave him too much credit for the foundation's accomplishments. (The quotation now appears as part of Mr. Band's biography on the Teneo Web site.)
Mr. Band left his paid position with the foundation in late 2010, but has remained involved with C.G.I., as have a number of Teneo clients, like Coca-Cola, Dow Chemical and UBS Americas. Standard Chartered, a British financial services company that paid a $340 million fine to New York regulators last year to settle charges that it had laundered money from Iran, is a Teneo client and a sponsor of the 2012 global initiative.
Last year, Coca-Cola's chief executive, Muhtar Kent, won a coveted spot on the dais with Mr. Clinton, discussing the company's partnership with another nonprofit to use its distributors to deliver medical goods to patients in Africa. (A Coca-Cola spokesman said that the company's sponsorship of foundation initiatives long predated Teneo and that the firm plays no role in Coca-Cola's foundation work.)
In March 2012, David Crane, the chief executive of NRG, an energy company, led a widely publicized trip with Mr. Clinton to Haiti, where they toured green energy and solar power projects that NRG finances through a $1 million commitment to the Clinton Global Initiative.
Officials said the foundation has established clear guidelines for the Clinton Global Initiative to help prevent any favoritism or special treatment of particular donors or sponsors.
Teneo was not the only worry: other events thrust the foundation into internal turmoil. In 2011, a wave of midlevel program staff members departed, reflecting the frustration of much of the foundation's policy personnel with the old political hands running the organization. Around the time of the Simpson Thacher review, Mr. Lindsey suffered a stroke, underscoring concerns about the foundation's line of succession. John D. Podesta, a chief of staff in Mr. Clinton's White House, stepped in for several months as temporary chief executive.
While much attention has focused on Mrs. Clinton's emerging role within the foundation, advisers to the family say her daughter's growing involvement could prove more critical in the years ahead. After years of pursuing other career paths, including working at McKinsey & Company and a hedge fund, Ms. Clinton, 33, has begun to assert herself as a force within the foundation. Her perspective is shaped far more than her parents' by her time in the world of business, and she is poised to play a significant role in shaping the foundation's future, particularly if Mrs. Clinton chooses to run for president.
She formally joined the foundation's board in 2011, marking her growing role there -- and the start of intensifying tensions between her and Mr. Band. Several people close to the Clintons said that she became increasingly concerned with the negative impact Mr. Band's outside business might have on her father's work and that she cited concerns raised during the internal review about potential conflicts of interest involving Teneo.
It was Ms. Clinton who suggested that the newly installed chief executive, Eric Braverman, be considered for the job during a nearly two-year search. A friend and a former colleague from McKinsey, Mr. Braverman, 38, had helped the Clintons with philanthropic projects in Haiti after the earthquake there. And his hiring coincided with Ms. Clinton's appointment as the vice chairwoman of the foundation board, where she will bear significant responsibility for steering her family's philanthropy, both in the causes it tackles and in the potential political and financial conflicts it must avoid.
Ms. Clinton has also grown worried that the foundation she stood to inherit would collapse without her father, who turns 67 next week. Mr. Clinton, who had quadruple-bypass surgery in 2004 and no longer eats meat or dairy products, talks frequently about his own mortality.
Mr. Catsimatidis said Ms. Clinton ''has to learn how to deal with the whole world because she wants to follow in the footsteps of her father and her mother.''
Shifting the Emphasis
Over the years, the foundation has dived into virtually any cause that sparked Mr. Clinton's interest: childhood obesity in the United States, sustainable farming in South America, mentoring entrepreneurs, saving elephants from poaching, and more. That list will shift soon as Mrs. Clinton and Chelsea build their staffs to focus on issues including economically empowering women and combating infant mortality.
In the coming months, as Mrs. Clinton mulls a 2016 presidential bid, the foundation could also serve as a base for her to home in on issues and to build up a stable of trusted staff members who could form the core of a political campaign.
Mrs. Clinton's staff at the foundation's headquarters includes Maura Pally, a veteran aide who advised her 2008 presidential campaign and worked at the State Department, and Madhuri Kommareddi, a former policy aide to President Obama.
Dennis Cheng, Mrs. Clinton's deputy chief of protocol at the State Department and a finance director of her presidential campaign, will oversee the endowment drive, which some of the Clintons' donors already describe as a dry run for 2016.
And Mrs. Clinton's personal staff of roughly seven people -- including Huma Abedin, wife of the New York mayoral candidate Anthony D. Weiner -- will soon relocate from a cramped Washington office to the foundation's headquarters. They will work on organizing Mrs. Clinton's packed schedule of paid speeches to trade groups and awards ceremonies and assist in the research and writing of Mrs. Clinton's memoir about her time at the State Department, to be published by Simon & Schuster next summer.
