HEADLINE: Bush Aides Increase Estimate of Projected Deficit

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
Bush Administration officials told Congressional budget negotiators today that costs for bailing out the savings and loan industry could add $61 billion to the Federal deficit in the next fiscal year, which is about $11 billion more than the bailout cost estimated by the Administration just a week ago.
The more pessimistic assessment came as lawmakers and White House officials opened their second week of budget talks still lacking agreement on what figure to use as the starting point for deficit reduction, let alone any consensus on the spending cuts or tax increases that will be needed to reach a specific deficit target.
Their difficulties have been compounded by uncertainty over the seemingly open-ended estimates for rescuing the savings and loan industry and by opposition to an earlier strategy that would not count some of the bailout costs in figuring the deficit.
''They said it was a hit-or-miss number, like playing the stock market,'' said Representative Leon E. Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee. ''The estimated cost of the S.&L. bailout is still a very flexible figure,'' said Senator Jim Sasser, Democrat of Tennessee, who is chairman of the Senate budget panel. 
New six-year figures provided by the budget director, Richard G. Darman, to the negotiators today seemed to indicate that the total cost to the Government of propping up the troubled industry would be more than twice what the Government initially estimated.
The Chicago Tribune reported today that about $50 billion was available in accounts of various Federal agencies and could be used to offset the Federal deficit. Both the stock and bond markets jumped in early trading in reaction, but experts on the Congressional budget committees and at the General Accounting Office said the report was inaccurate. [Business Day, pages D8 and 16.] Earlier Spending Estimate Last year, when President Bush signed the law providing Federal money to rescue the savings and loan industry, the legislation called for spending $82 billion over the next six years to cover losses of depositors' money at hundreds of insolvent institutions.
Mr. Darman's new figures estimated that the cost would be $167 billion through the 1995 fiscal year.
Part of the cost involves paying off depositors when institutions fail, and this amount is relatively easy to establish. But in addition the Government must spend money each year, called working capital, to buy the assets of failed institutions, like branches and repossessed property. Some of this money will be recovered when the assets are sold. The difference, which is the eventual cost to the Government, is difficult to estimate, since the value of the institutions' assets is not clear.
Moreover, the buying and selling do not necessarily occur in the same fiscal years, so the transactions can skew annual budget accounting.
The Treasury plans to announce on Wednesday, in its first official acknowledgement that the cost of the savings and loans bailout has risen sharply, that losses to the taxpayers could be as much as $50 billion more than expected. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady will testify before the House Banking Committee and acknowledge that the money appropriated last year for the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency responsible for managing the bailout, will fall far short. It will be a clear admission that Congress will have to appropriate more for the rescue.
The Treasury is expected to say it does not know what the exact loss will be, but it will offer a broad range of possible new losses, ranging from about $15 billion to more than $50 billion above its previous estimates.
Since much of the money to finance the bailout is borrowed by the Treasury from the investing public, some analysts calculate the interest costs on that borrowing as part of the overall cost. The Treasury's numbers do not include interest expense.
 
Issue on Bailout Funds
Earlier this year, Mr. Darman and Congressional leaders in both parties agreed in principle that operating costs for the agency handling the bailout should not be counted as part of the budget deficit. But objections from rank-and-file Democrats and Republicans have made that approach and the task of the budget negotiators far more difficult.
''It's a major issue that has to be resolved,'' Mr. Panetta said. ''Even if there is a consensus among the negotiators to take it out of the budget, we face very difficult opposition.''
Much of today's three-hour negotiating session was devoted to what the deficit would look like if items like the trust funds for Social Security, highways and airports were removed from the computation. A number of lawmakers outside the negotiating team have argued that surpluses in these trust funds are being used to mask the true size of the Government's yearly deficit and should thus be taken out of the deficit calculation. At the same time, they argue that a failure to include the costs of the savings and loan bailout in the calculation further masks the real deficit problem.
According to the Administration estimates today, the deficit for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1, would be $199 billion, including the $61 billion for the savings and loan bailout. That estimate assumes that the various trust funds and the operating costs for the agency handling the disposition of assets of the failed institutions remain a part of the budget.
The deficit would rise to $276 billion if the trust fund surpluses and the bailout costs were removed. It would swell to $337 billion if the trust fund surpluses were removed but the costs of the bailout were retained.
 
Updated Forecast Sought
Negotiators said they had asked the Congressional Budget Office and the Administration's Office of Management and Budget to prepare updated economic forecasts over the next several weeks in hopes of arriving at an agreement on the true size of the deficit. Assumptions about interest rates, inflation and economic growth have a direct bearing on the size, and the Administration has acknowledged that the forecast on which its January budget was based is outdated.
The swelling estimates of the deficit make it increasingly likely that Congress will have to stretch out the yearly deficit goals imposed by the budget-balancing law. The law sets a deficit target of $64 billion for the fiscal year 1991 and requires automatic spending cuts in military and domestic programs if Congress and the Administration cannot agree on deficit-cutting measures of their own.
The negotiators have already acknowledged that even their best efforts would be unlikely to yield enough spending cuts or tax increases to reach the $64 billion goal.

CORRECTION-DATE: May 26, 1990, Saturday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
Because of an editing error, an article on Wednesday about the effect of the savings and loan bailout on the Federal deficit described effects of accounting differences incorrectly in some copies. The deficit projected by the Bush Administration for the 1991 fiscal year would reach $199 billion if $61 billion in bailout costs were included in the deficit calculations. If those costs were not included, and surpluses in the Social Security and other trust funds were also not counted, the deficit would reach $276 billion.

HEADLINE: A German Quid for a Moscow Quo

 BODY:
Two out of three isn't good enough for Secretary of State Baker's critics. He has returned from Moscow having made welcome progress toward agreements on strategic arms and also on chemical weapons, but little progress on cutting conventional forces in Europe. Though he offered new and accommodating ideas, Moscow proved unresponsive. 
Not surprisingly, arms control critics in and out of the Administration jumped all over Mr. Baker. The dust they raised obscured what went on in Moscow. Clearing the air is important before the Bush-Gorbachev summit meeting next week.
That can be done by assessing these key questions: Are the Soviets ''stonewalling,'' as charged by Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser? If so, why? And if conventional force cuts are delayed, does it make sense to hold up the Start treaty to reduce nuclear arms?
In the 23-nation talks on Conventional Forces in Europe, the two sides are close to agreement on reducing most forces - by about half for the Warsaw Pact and a tenth for NATO. In Moscow, Mr. Baker offered ideas to break the key deadlock, on aircraft. The Soviets explored these suggestions without accepting or rejecting them. That hardly amounts to stonewalling.
With Moscow facing so much economic and nationalist uncertainty, it's possible that the Soviets just needed more time to evaluate the offer. Perhaps they haven't yet figured out what to do with all the troops they would bring home from Eastern Europe. And Moscow has to assure itself that a united Germany, probably in NATO, won't put the Soviet Union at a decisive military disadvantage. To deal with this problem indirectly, Moscow proposes to limit NATO and Warsaw Pact troops in Central Europe to about 700,000 each.
The West Germans have announced a troop cutback, and Foreign Minister Genscher had indicated a willingness to negotiate reductions, if other NATO allies reduced their forces too. But Chancellor Kohl has now overruled his coalition partner and wants to defer any limits on German troops until after a conventional forces treaty is signed. A week ago, he won President Bush's backing. That tough stance surely helps explain Moscow's unresponsiveness.
Some critics urge holding up strategic arms reductions until Moscow comes around. They say that cutting the Soviet superiority in conventional arms should come first. But the two presidents can initial a strategic arms agreement in principle next week in Washington, and sign a finished treaty this fall. Delaying that would give the U.S. no added leverage over a conventional arms deal.
Such an agreement will take more time than originally anticipated because of German unification. The most important way to expedite this treaty is for Bonn to accept modest limits on its troops in return for Moscow's effective withdrawal from the center of Europe.

HEADLINE: The Pitfalls of U.S. Strictures on China Trade

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Recent Congressional hearings and public debate over whether the United States should renew the most-favored-nation (M.F.N.) status for China have brought Sino-American relations to a new crossroad. As a Chinese scholar studying Sino-American relations here since January, I feel the gravity of the issue compels me to put in a few words.
Those opposed to the renewal argue that the United States must use this opportunity to clarify further its indignation and opposition to Beijing's allegedly worsening human-rights record since last June, to exercise more pressure on Beijing to behave, to discredit Beijing's leaders and if possible to bring down the Beijing Government, which they believe has lost legitimacy to rule in China. 
While sharing their distaste for Beijing's suppression of the student demonstrations last June and their dissatisfaction with its human-rights record since then, I feel their argument is very debatable.
To begin with, as many people have pointed out, suspension of most-favored-nation status for China will more likely hurt the Chinese people on the mainland and in Hong Kong than the leaders in Beijing. Furthermore, this action will more likely undercut China's remaining reforms and open policy than promote them. And it will more likely provide the Beijing leadership an excuse for their failure in managing China's economy than it will discredit them.
Moreover, it will damage U.S. business interests and make China's existing cooperation with the U.S. in such areas as nuclear nonproliferation, arms sales to the Middle East, East Asian stability, anti-drug efforts, etc., less likely.
Finally, such action probably will not change Beijing's behavior, let alone bring down the Government. The U.S. tried to use economic pressures in the 1950's and the U.S.S.R. in the 1960's, and both efforts ended in failure, with the Chinese people suffering the consequences.
An externally imposed drastic change in China is more likely to reduce China to political chaos than to bring about a democratic and effective government there. After all, it is dictatorship, not democracy and freedom, that political chaos usually produces. In this regard, one shold also bear in mind that China is a nuclear power. Political chaos there will not only cause pain and suffering to the Chinese people but also increase the likelihood that Chinese nuclear weapons fall into irresponsible hands. While not questioning the intentions of those opposed to renewing M.F.N. status for China, I want to point out the complexity of the issue and the limits to what the U.S. can do. This is not to say that Washington should not maintain its position and express its dissatisfaction with developments in China since last June. Rather, the U.S. should do it in other ways, such as a conditioned renewal of the M.F.N. status, as Winston Lord proposed in recent Congressional hearings.
In sum, the means must serve the end. As one American put it recently: in this case, suspension of the M.F.N. status for China now is simply not a good means.

HEADLINE: OBSERVER;
Golden Red-Ink Oldie

BYLINE: By Russell Baker

 BODY:
Speaking of death and ruination, has it been generally observed that the Democratic Party is now worried about the budget deficit? There is no surer sign of a party drifting toward the ultimate coma.
Not that there has been much doubt for several years about the Democrats. Aside from occasionally stirring just long enough to make life hellish for some luckless soul like Judge Bork or John Tower, theirs is a party happy in the torpor of incessant re-election to Congress.
A clash of ideas may revive a dying political party, as the battle between Goldwater and the internationalists brought life back to the Republicans 25 years ago. The Democrats, however, are not simply threadbare of ideas; they seem to like it that way. 
When somebody brings them one, as Senator Moynihan did by proposing to cut Social Security taxes, they flee. Instead, they have decided to be alarmed about the deficit. Ignorance of history must run as deep among Democratic politicians as among modern schoolchildren.
Doesn't anyone remember that Republicans campaigned against deficits for 30 years, warning that red ink threatened the country with doom and that only good old Republican fiscal responsibility could save us?
America responded to these alarms with yawns and went right on electing Democratic Presidents, except for the intermission in which it gave its heart to its favorite war hero, General Eisenhower.
This history suggests there is absolutely no political mileage in stewing about budget deficits. Yet the Democrats now stew away as though utterly ignorant of their own party's past triumphs over Republicans fearful of deficit finance.
The beauty part of the joke is that it was the Republican Reagan who created the present deficit. Reagan made all the orthodox Republican sounds about the sacred need for balanced budgets while serenely ignoring his own jaw music and following the traditional Democratic route to victory via Red Ink Turnpike.
The Roosevelt and Truman deficits, which had once left Republicans terrified, were infants compared with the Reagan creation, which is now being expanded under President Bush. Comparatively speaking, this magnificent Republican construction is the very father and mother of deficits.
Or is it? The numbers are grandiose, but it would take a doctorate from one of the fancier universities to understand the economists' debate about whether it is terrifying or just more proof of Washington's power to mislead humanity with arithmetic.
Not surprisingly, many people find it easier not to worry about deficits. There are good reasons for this, including the natural human impulse to leave impenetrable economic debates to economists and a tendency to nod toward slumber when the word ''budget'' is spoken.
Since most people are not passionately interested in balancing their own budgets, their desire for balancing the Federal Government's tends to be secondary, and maybe even tertiary if the question becomes, ''Are you so worried about the deficit that you're ready to reduce it by paying more taxes?''
In brief, the party of fiscal responsibility is likely to be a loser. Yet we now find the Democratic Congressional leaders sufficiently worried about it to confer with White House Republicans on ways to cut the deficit.
Worse luck for Democrats, this has produced speculation that the real purpose is to get both parties lined up behind new taxes. So far they have produced only farce, with Republicans and Democrats both ostentatiously declining to be the first to say: ''Taxes! That's the way to go!''
The Democrats having been mercilessly shellacked year in and year out by low-tax and no-tax Republicans, the question is why they are even participating in this exercise. The Republicans have masterful image manipulators who will surely find it easy to portray them as incurable tax lovers (bad, bad people!) if they agree to some bipartisan scheme to levy new taxes.
Well, aside from the party being bankrupt of ideas, perhaps the Democrats entered this baited trap because they are good patriots alarmed by the deficit.
If it really is alarming, however, surely it's the Republicans who ought to be worried about the deficit. They made it and they have so far insisted on living with it rather than tax to cut it. Holding the Presidency, they are also supposed to be leading the country.
The Democrats need a political earthquake to save them. It is not in the Republicans' interest to let one happen.

HEADLINE: Plan Approved in Albany Seeks To Restore Faith in State Finances

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH KOLBERT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 22

 BODY:
Putting the finishing touches on New York's budget, the State Legislature approved a measure today aimed at restoring faith in the state's finances.
The measure calls for the state to end its longstanding practice of borrowing billions of dollars each spring to finance routine expenses like school aid and tax refunds. It also imposes guidelines for state spending that would link its growth to the growth in the economy. 
The outlines of the plan were agreed on last month, when state leaders announced that they planned to phase out the annual spring borrowing. But a final accord on the measure was delayed by a broader dispute over the state budget, which was finally approved on Saturday, seven weeks late.
Even some of the harshest critics of the state's financial practices have responded warmly to the plan to eliminate the spring borrowing, and today several politicians, including Assembly Speaker Mel Miller and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, tried to elbow each other out of the way to take credit for it.
The adoption of the plan, Mr. Regan said, ''will mark the culmination of a 10-year effort'' by his office.
 
'Positive First Step'
Cynthia Green, a financial analyst for the Citizens Budget Commission, a nonprofit watchdog group, termed the plan ''a positive first step toward fiscal reform.''
Under the measure approved today by the Assembly and the State Senate, the state would issue bonds to replace the money from its annual spring borrowing. The terms of the bonds would severely limit the amount that the state could borrow in the future.
The spring borrowing has enabled the state to roll forward an accumulated deficit that now approaches $5 billion. By issuing long-term bonds to replace the borrowing, the state would eliminate this deficit over the lifetime of the bonds, 30 years.
The measure approved today calls for one-quarter of the revenues from the state's 4 percent sales tax to be earmarked to pay off the bonds.
Because there is no mechanism yet for issuing the bonds, the state is still expected to have to borrow about $4 billion next month to meet its expenses this spring. It is expected to take at least three years to issue all the bonds to eliminate the spring borrowing.
 
Spending 'Targets'
As part of the ''fiscal reform package'' approved today, lawmakers also enacted restrictions limiting the growth in state spending. Restrictions had been demanded by the Republican-led Senate, which made them a condition of passing the budget.
But the spending restrictions approved today are far less stringent than those called for by the Senate. Instead of a statutory spending cap, the restrictions call for spending ''targets'' to be set in 1991 and 1992. The targets, which would not be binding, would limit state spending to 10 percent of the total personal income in the state.
In 1993, a statutory ceiling on spending would be established. The terms of the cap have not yet been set. Legislative action would be required to extend the spending cap beyond 1993.
George Leung, managing director for state ratings at Moody's Investors Services, a major credit-rating agency, said that although the spending restrictions were for the most part only advisory, they could help to restrain state spending.
''If they serve to enforce some kind of spending discipline,'' he said, ''that's positive.''

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Two weeks after some critics complained that Mayor David N. Dinkins was piping a quiet obbligato from the back rows on race relations in New York City, he now finds himself leading a brass band of parades and posters, blue ribbons and bromides, whose effectiveness remains uncertain.
 
The latest effort in the
Mayor's campaign was a ''town meeting'' at the Cathedral of St. John the Divine last night, a blend of camp revival and campaign rally that echoed Mr. Dinkins's well-oiled field effort for last fall's elections.
''It's almost like a political campaign,'' said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, who managed Mr. Dinkins's election campaign. ''We're going on a similar kind of outreach, where we're trying to get what the Mayor has called the silent majority involved in trying to do something about racial tensions in our city, pulling folks together to say, ''Let's hear from some other voices.' '' 
But even Mr. Dinkins's aides concede that it is too early to assess how effective the campaign will be.
''We're not proclaiming that there are going to be any easy answers to the questions raised, or that the moral tone raised by a broad range of community leaders will give answers,'' said Ken Sunshine, the mayor's senior special adviser. ''But it can certainly help set a climate.''
But Mr. Dinkins's calls for calm and unity have drawn fire from members of his core constituency - from the Rev. Herbert Daughtry and the Rev. Calvin O. Butts 3d to his close friend Percy Sutton - some of whom have suggested that he bent over backward to palliate whites at the expense of blacks.
The Mayor is in a bind. He is trying to resolve tensions that grew over many years and are rooted not only in race and ethnicity but economics. As he prepares to issue a budget tomorrow that will surely be full of bad news and little new spending in the face of fiscal constraints, there is concern about too few jobs, too few initiatives and too few changes.
''Bensonhurst, Howard Beach -those are overt racial acts easy to pinpoint,'' said Peter Williams, a project associate at the Center for Law and Social Justice at Medgar Evers College. ''But the more systemic, institutionalized racism existing in New York City has not really been addressed by anybody. It's been studied, but implementation to change the policies and the practice has not been as urgent, and they have as much to do with the creation of a colorful mosaic as anything else.''
To be sure, Mr. Dinkins mentions those problems in almost every speech, but perhaps inevitably he has not managed to do much about them, in just under five months in office. Into the breach, he has thrown a formidable publicity blitz.
In the last week, as New York was transfixed by the split verdicts in the Bensonhurst murder trial, Mr. Dinkins appeared live on three national television news programs, a cool presence trying to defuse an image of the city as a tinderbox. He was interviewed by news magazines and stumped around the city Sunday, from a Harlem church to a Norwegian festival in Brooklyn.
 
High Notes in Blue
The city printed 10,000 posters proclaiming ''Respect and Unity'' in seven languages. John Cardinal O'Connor said he would ask Roman Catholics to take an oath of tolerance. Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez urged students to wear blue ribbons as an emblem of racial harmony. Yesterday, The New York Post, the same newspaper Mr. Dinkins recently chided for prominently quoting the Rev. Al Sharpton, announced the Mayor's rally in a bold blue headline on its front page.
After all the shouting on both sides, Mr. Dinkins's modulation may be a relief.
''I think that rallies that are held in a way that don't inflame people's feelings make a big difference,'' said William Kornblum, director of the Center for Social Research at the City University Graduate Center in Manhattan. ''Strategies like the ribbons are very important, because the more we can show each other that we reject hatred and want more lines of understanding among ourselves, the better off we'll be.
''These things are no panacea,'' he said, but added: ''We have to figure out ways of wearing our hearts on our sleeves.''
 
Change Since Howard Beach
The Mayor's aides insist that he has persisted in the low-key style he has always favored. ''I remind you of Howard Beach, in which he interceded and got things going,'' one senior aide said yesterday.
But some things have changed. After a black man was chased to his death by a gang of whites in Howard Beach in 1986, Mr. Dinkins helped arrange a meeting between Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and lawyers for another victim who had been mishandled by the police and was refusing to cooperate in the investigation.
Now, after the Mayor criticized a black-led boycott of two Korean groceries in Brooklyn, one of those lawyers, C. Vernon Mason, said Mr. Dinkins had ''no African left in him'' and ''too many yarmulkes on his head.''
That hurt Mr. Dinkins but may have had the unintended effect of solidifying his support among moderates of all races. Undoubtedly the more he says and does as Mayor, the harder it will be for him to keep the position above the fray from which he has so far strived to conduct his career.
Moreover, the grocery boycott in Flatbush continues, despite lengthy negotiations led by the Mayor's aides and a personal discussion between Mr. Dinkins and the lawyer for the Haitian woman whose dispute with a store manager started the protest.
In the coming weeks, Mr. Dinkins's aides said yesterday, he will step up his appearances in various neighborhoods around the city, and urge ministers, politicians and community leaders to keep up their sermons against hate.
Mr. Lynch said: ''At least we've gotten local and national awareness as to what's going on. The debate is being waged, and we hope that we can bring forward some concrete things, programs that will alleviate the problems.''

HEADLINE: Procedure Is Upheld For Staten Islanders To Vote on Secession

BYLINE: By RONALD SULLIVAN

 BODY:
A lengthy process under which Staten Islanders could seek state approval to secede from New York City was upheld yesterday in State Supreme Court in Manhattan.
Under legislation signed in March by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, the Governor and the Legislature would have the final authority on whether Staten Island could become independent. First, Staten Islanders would have to approve two secession referendums. 
Justice Herman Cahn ruled yesterday that the first referendum could be on Nov. 6, as part of the general election. If a majority approves, a city commission would be established to report on the fiscal effects of secession.
Staten Islanders would then vote again. With voter approval, the issue would go to the Legislature and the Governor. The process could take three years.
 
Opposition at City Hall
Supporters and opponents of secession said yesterday that they thought the question would face considerable legislative opposition.
In upholding the secession legislation, Justice Cahn rejected the Corporation Counsel's contention that the law was unconstitutional. Mayor David N. Dinkins opposes secession, contending that voters citywide should participate in any secession referendum. Corporation Counsel Victor Kovner said he would appeal to the Court of Appeals.
''We are hoping to expedite the appeal, so we can get a decision before Staten Island goes through the expense of preparing for a referendum this fall,'' Mr. Kovner said. ''It is our contention that secession would have an enormous economic impact on the city as a whole, and equal protection requires an equal opportunity for all New Yorkers to vote.''
Borough President Guy V. Molinari of Staten Island predicted secession would mean property taxes in the borough would double or triple. He added that he did not expect the Legislature to approve secession, no matter how the island voted.
With 352,121 residents, the borough has 5.2 percent of the seven million New Yorkers.

HEADLINE: Education Chief Suggests Schools Minimize Tests

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, May 22

 BODY:
New York State's Education Commissioner said today that the state's public schools should adopt a far broader measure than standardized tests in assessing student performance.
The proposal by the Commissioner, Thomas Sobol, appeared to echo recent moves by other states, including Vermont and Connecticut, to use more intensive ''portfolio'' evaluations of a student's work and to de-emphasize test results in promoting from grade to grade. The portfolios require successful completion of projects, like research reports or science projects, rather than scoring well on tests.
Educators ''cannot achieve the results we desire through top-down regulation alone,'' Mr. Sobol said, adding, ''It's important that children be assessed by the quality of their work over a sustained period rather than the snapshot in time that a test will give.'' 
 
Obstacles Are Noted
The Commissioner's approach is outlined in a memorandum that he will present to the Board of Regents here Wednesday night. He said there would be no changes in state mandates until a thorough review was conducted with teachers, administrators and other school officials.
Educators familiar with Mr. Sobol's proposal said it would provoke a wide debate about the wisdom and the practicality of portfolio assessments.
Some educators noted that while the system had produced promising results in some school districts and in small pilot programs, it required intensive involvement by teachers with individual students. It is by no means clear, they said, that the approach could succeed on a large scale, particularly in places like New York City, where crowded classrooms are a constant problem.
Grant Wiggins, a former research associate with the Rochester-based National Center on Education and the Economy, who is now a private consultant to several school districts that are experimenting with portfolios, said: ''You ask, 'Can it work?' The answer is yes, if there's constant supervision, if there's ample time to look at a student's results and give feedback. Those are a lot of ifs.''
Mr. Wiggins said that for many schools it remained ''technically easier and more cost-effective to do what they're doing now'' - relying heavily on test results to evaluate students.
 
Broad Goals Stir Dissent
The almost informal way that Mr. Sobol offered his suggestion was in keeping with the approach he has taken in the last year to several major reforms of the state's education system. He has outlined basic goals but left the specifics to a large group of experts.
Mr. Sobol said last summer, for example, that there should be a huge decentralization of the New York City school system. And earlier this year he called for revision of the state's educational curriculum to put more emphasis on the influence of non-Western cultures on American life.
Supporters praise Mr. Sobol for trying to build a consensus, while critics deride him as ineffective. The decentralization proposal was widely denounced at the time and has gone nowhere, while the curriculum revision was tentatively approved by the Board of Regents and is being drafted.
Mr. Sobol's proposal today would seem to coincide, at least in part, with recent moves by the New York City Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, to end the city's long-standing policy of automatically holding back failing students after certain grades.
 
Need to Encourage Stressed
With the use of more subjective criteria for advancement, Mr. Sobol said, some students may be encouraged to develop their skills rather than feel they are failures on the basis of a test score.
''What you're encouraging kids to do is their very best work,'' he said. ''You want the teacher intent on building upon what a child can do rather than rubbing his nose in what he can't do.''
Mr. Fernandez has also urged more positive approaches to reduce the dropout rate in New York City, where nearly a third of students leave before finishing high school.
The Chancellor's executive director of strategic planning, Robin Willner, said today that Mr. Fernandez had not seen a copy of Mr. Sobol's proposal. ''We're very interested in authentic assessment,'' she said, using a term for a range of alternatives to standardized tests. ''We also need to be clear that to move in that direction would require a lot of resources and support from the state.''
 
Some Skepticism Apparent
Still, standardized tests have strong defenders, and some educators today indicated they were skeptical about the portfolio approach.
''I hope this isn't going to be looked at as a way to lower standards,'' said Louis Grumet, executive director of the New York State School Boards Association. He also questioned the contention that reduced emphasis on tests would inspire more students to excel.
''The child who is going to do poorly on standardized tests is usually going to do poorly on portfolios,'' he said.
But Mr. Wiggins, the education consultant, said Mr. Grumet's observation was true only for the ''very worst and the very best'' students.
''In the middle range you see a tremendous response in many cases to the portfolios,'' he said.
Under Mr. Sobol's plan, the state would ultimately create new standards for passing students through each grade, with a particular emphasis placed on the fourth, eighth and 12th grades. Those are the grades that President Bush and the nation's governors have said should be the target for new national standards in education.

HEADLINE: WINE TALK

BYLINE: By Frank J. Prial

 BODY:
THE wine on the table was Chateau Bois de Notre Dame, 1970, a Haut-Medoc. Never heard of it? Neither had I. Neither had Orley Ashenfelter, who brought it to the noisy little West Village restaurant.
''Hundred bucks a case at an auction in San Francisco,'' Mr. Ashenfelter said, chuckling.
It was delicious, and at $8 and change for a good 20-year-old wine, he was entitled to be a bit smug. 
But that wasn't why we were there. The idea was to talk about the Ashenfelter Theorem, sometimes referred to as the ''Bordeaux equation.'' Mr. Ashenfelter teaches economics at Princeton, a calling that, to hear him tell it, pays just below a subsistence wage.
Combining a marginal wage and a fondness for claret is no easy task. Mr. Ashenfelter discovered early on that the place to go was the auction hall. Most stories about wine auctions dwell on owners of fast-food franchises who snap up ancient Lafites at $20,000 a bottle. Hardly anyone knows about the genuine bargains that regularly go on the block. Orley Ashenfelter knows. Witness the Bois de Notre Dame. As a wine lover, he had stumbled on a good thing. As an economist, he couldn't leave well enough alone: he had to turn it all into a formula.
It was that formula, or equation, that sent a frisson through the wine world recently when it was outlined in an article in The New York Times.
What Professor Ashenfelter has done is this: create a formula based on winter rainfall and growing-season temperatures in the Bordeaux wine region that, he says, enables him to predict the quality of the annual wine vintages.
For some reason, this rather obvious bit of cerebration has prompted an astonishing outflow of consternation, not to mention indignation, in the wine establishment.
To be sure, Mr. Ashenfelter has fine-tuned his formula and spiced it up with some forbidding jargon. But the fundamental relationship of which he writes, the connection between weather and wine quality, is well known to any fourth grader in the Bordeaux schools.
By applying his formula to the heavy winter rains and exceptionally hot summer of 1989, Mr. Ashenfelter has concluded that the 1989 Bordeaux vintage could be the finest of the century. Well, great, but he's hardly going out on a limb. Everyone in France has been raving about 1989, most of them since last fall when the grapes came in.
So why all the fuss? Two reasons. Some elements of the wine trade are angry because the Ashenfelter equation could be helpful in identifying lesser vintages they have promoted. For example, he is down on 1986, a year praised by more conventional commentators. Mr. Ashenfelter, or at least his numbers, say the vintage will be the worst of the 1980's.
Secondly, and more seriously, he is accused of relegating the whole wine- tasting mystique to a minor role. Supposedly, the sipping, spitting, sniffing and note-taking so dear to wine romantics have all been rendered obsolete by mathematics.
The pessimists are wrong on both counts. In the first place, Mr. Ashenfelter is not doing anything new; he's refining techniques that winegrowers have been using for centuries.
And the tasters are far from obsolete. Mr. Ashenfelter can tell you that 1989 is going to be good. But there are going to be some 89's that are better than others and his formula can't identify them. He can argue that 1986 is poor, but there are some very good 86's and his formula can't single them out.
The professional tasters, those who buy from the chateaus, begin their work in the early spring after the harvest. They already know what the overall quality of the vintage is; their work - deciding which wines to buy, which to reject - is with the individual chateaus.
So, too, the critics, like Robert M. Parker Jr., whose numerical ratings virtually dictate what fine wines are sold in this country. If someone - Mr. Ashenfelter, for example - can help everyone get a better fix on the individual vintages, Mr. Parker's ratings will be more valuable than ever.
A vintage assessment is merely another tool in judging wine. Since there are good wines in poor years and vice versa, the job of the traditional critic will always be important.
The people who worry most about vintages are those who invest in wine futures. They buy early in the expectation that the value of their wine will go up. An early assessment by Mr. Ashenfelter might influence people's decisions to get into the market or not. A few people invest in Burgundy and California but most wine futures business is in Bordeaux.
And what about the good Bordelais? Will a word or a number from Orley Ashenfelter consign whole vintages to the distilleries? Not too likely; much of Mr. Ashenfelter's work was originally done by Bruno Prats, the owner of Chateau Cos d'Estournel.
Mr. Prats has been making calculations like Mr. Ashenfelter's, though admittedly not as precise, for years. So far, his effect on the market has been minimal.
Which brings us back to that bottle of Bois de Notre Dame. Mr. Ashenfelter gives 1970 a quality rating of 43. The control is 1961, with a rating of 100. It was really good, even if neither of us could locate the chateau. Mr. Ashenfelter gives 1989 a rating of - get this -149.
Let's not be angry at him; let's hope he's right. If he is, we're going to be in for some great Bordeaux wine in a few years.
 
TASTINGS
 
Spanna Piemonte 1982, Antonio Vallana; about $7.
The nebbiolo grape is the basis of all the great traditional wines of the Piedmont region of northwestern Italy. ''Traditional'' is the buzzword here because cabernet sauvignon is creeping in at a few of the more pioneering wineries. Fortunately, the Piemontese are conservative and slow to change, so the old-style wines will be around for a long time. Nebbiolo, which comes from the word for fog, is the grape in the greatest Piedmont wines, Barolo and Barbaresco, but it shows up, too, in many lesser-known but marvelous wines like Ghemme, Gattinara and spanna. In fact, spanna is another name for the grape. Because it is still little-known and also, of course, because it is not made with the care of a great barolo, spanna is a fine bargain. This one from Vallana has depth and richness. The finish is a bit rough, but that goes with nebbiolo. The taste is that of a wine at three times the cost. A true bargain.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Where Legends Were Born, Ghosts of Glory Linger

BYLINE: By MEL GUSSOW

 BODY:
The marquee at the Lyric Theater on West 42d Street often promises ''Two Horrifying Hits.'' But inside, once past the garish posters, the popcorn and video games, a theatergoer can look up at the wide arching ceiling and feel emanations of the performers who once played the Lyric and who helped to make 42d Street between Seventh and Eighth Avenues a theatrical crossroads during the early half of this century.
Fred Astaire danced on this stage. The Marx Brothers clowned in ''The Cocoanuts,'' and Douglas Fairbanks performed feats of derring-do. They were all Broadway stars before they went to Hollywood.
Wherever one looks in these theaters, there is a memory or an artifact, followed by nostalgia for a time when the theaters were opulent as well as hospitable. Inside the Lyric and the neighboring theaters, it is possible to feel the colorful presence of a Broadway past. Beneath the peeling paint and crumbling walls there are still remnants of sculptured cherubs, flowery sconces, opera-style box seats and faded murals. 
The area has, of course, gone far downhill. Starting in the late 1920's, with the country struck by the Depression and with the introduction of talking pictures, some of the theaters were converted into movie houses while several turned to burlesque. By 1934, the New Amsterdam was the only one still presenting legitimate plays.
Those still operating today are movie theaters specializing in kung fu and horror films. Some of the theaters are barren and boarded up, but most are still standing. Each has at least a sign of its former splendor, unlike the former theatrical centers on 14th Street and Madison Square, or the first Metropolitan Opera House -historic buildings razed years ago.
The original spirit of the street was partly recaptured in ''Crowbar,'' the Mac Wellman play produced this season by En Garde Arts, which briefly returned the Victory Theater to legitimacy. In slides shown during the performance, one could see the Victory (formerly the Theater Republic) at its height, with formally dressed theatergoers arriving for gala evenings on West 42d Street.
This is an astonishing thought when one considers the prostitution and drug traffic on the street today. But in the 1920's, the Paradise Roof Garden crowned the Victory with a miniature Dutch village complete with water mill, a rooftop space where patrons dined and danced.
Douglas D. Durst, vice president of the Durst Organization, recently led a tour through the Lyric, the Victory and six other theaters, from roof to basement. The Durst Organization held the lease for those buildings until last month when the State Urban Development Corporation took title to a large section of the 42d Street property for a $2.5 billion urban renewal project. Though the urban development project calls for the theaters to be preserved and renovated (and for office towers to be constructed), the future of the theaters still remains in question. Were they to be destroyed, the loss would be irreparable. Despite their dereliction, these theaters have the classic dimensions of their Broadway and London counterparts.
For years, people have been divided about what to do with these buildings. Some planners say the cost of renovation, estimated at $4 million for each theater, would be prohibitive, and they note that there are already Broadway houses in good condition that are empty.
The New York State plan is intended to preserve the theaters, says Frederick S. Papert, the head of the 42d Street Development Corporation, the independent organization that created Theater Row, farther west on 42d Street. Surrounding the theaters with office buildings would make the neighborhood more commercially attractive, Mr. Papert said. He added that he also favored adapting some of the theaters to alternative uses.
Under the plan, the theaters would become a nonprofit cultural center. The New Amsterdam, the most prized of the houses and the only theater of landmark status on the street, would once again become a legitimate theater as would several others. Other buildings would be converted to be used for opera, ballet, rehearsal space, nightclubs, comedy clubs and various business enterprises. Whatever happens to the theaters, some traditional aspects of the street will, of course, never return. On the roof of the Victory, all traces of the Dutch village disappeared long ago. The bare tarred surface is indistinguishable from any tenement roof. Across the street is the New Amsterdam Theater, owned by the Nederlander Organization and for years the home of the ''Ziegfeld Follies.'' One could imagine Florenz Ziegfeld glaring across the street at his rival, David Belasco, in his roof garden. In common, both producers had apartments in their theaters, supposedly reserved for their mistresses.
Belasco's apartment - 3 rms, no vu - still exists, high above an interior cupola in the Victory, but like the building itself it is badly in need of an overhaul. From a window in the apartment, one can peer down to the stage, as Belasco did, to check up on a performance in progress.
From here, it is a long walk down seemingly endless staircases to the dingy basement. Beneath a large trap door are old planks and broken seats and other pieces of unused furniture. There is a general state of dampness in this vault, indicating what was once an underground stream.
Many years ago, Houdini performed in the Victory, and in one of his most famous tricks, he made an elephant vanish. Supposedly, the animal was slipped down this trap door, and then was sneaked out of the theater to be dried off to await the next performance. Deep in the vault, a phantom of the opera might have traveled among subterranean islands. Asked if the stream originally led to the Hudson River, a theater worker said, ''More likely it led to the sewers.'' If so, the phantom might find himself in a rowing competition with the teen-age mutant ninja turtles.
A network of doors and narrow alleys links several theaters so that the entire area has a feeling of catacombs. In towers aligning the walkways are dressing rooms once occupied by performers like George M. Cohan and Lillian Russell.
The history of the theaters and of their time can be traced through programs, reminding theatergoers that in the 1920's tuxedoes cost $50, after-theater suppers were $1.25 and corsets shared advertising space with cigarettes. In the boxes containing Between-the-Acts small cigars, there were collectors' cards illustrating the facades of American theaters, demonstrating that theater was once as popular as baseball.
''The Front Page'' and ''Private Lives'' (starring Noel Coward, Gertrude Lawrence and Laurence Olivier), opened at the Times Square Theater, and Lionel Barrymore portrayed ''Macbeth'' at the Apollo. At the Harris (formerly the Wallack), Lynn Fontanne had her first success in ''Dulcy.'' The Empire was once the Eltinge, named after Julian Eltinge, a foremost female impersonator of his time.
Estelle Winwood and John Drew played in ''The Circle'' at the Selwyn, also the home of the original production of ''The Royal Family.'' At other times, there were performances by Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Beatrice Lillie and Fred Allen. Today the Selwyn is closed. On its marquee, it blithely recommends the attractions at other theaters: ''Enjoy a movie on 42d Street and bring the family.''
The Liberty Theater once housed musical epics like ''The Houseboat on the Styx,'' with its all-star historical cast of more than 70, including representations of such figures as Helen of Troy, Cleopatra, all the wives of Henry VIII, Washington, Napoleon, Sherlock Holmes, Columbus and Shakespeare. Today the Liberty is the most dilapidated of the theaters, with the orchestra almost entirely reduced to rubble. Still hanging is a stage curtain, with a panorama of majestic sailing ships that could have been led by Columbus himself.
A ghostly reminder of theater in its heyday, West 42d Street is a Broadway in exile.

HEADLINE: Getting the Most Out of Byproducts

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 22

 BODY:
General Mills Inc. took Benefit cereal off the market last December when it did not catch on with consumers, leaving the company with 50 tons of unwanted flakes.
But recently General Mills found a more receptive audience for the cereal, made with the grain called psyllium that rated high in fiber, but low in taste. Benefit is being used to fatten up cows and pigs on several South Dakota farms.
The slop trough may seem an ignoble end for a food that had been labored over by product developers and marketers and that cost the company millions to put on supermarket shelves. But General Mills' disposition of the leftover cereal highlights an important, but near invisible, link in the food chain. Food producers' waste and byproducts play a vital role in feeding the nation's livestock. 
No exact figures are available on the size of the highly fragmented byproducts industry. Based on the per-ton price of the individual byproducts, industry experts place annual sales at $5 billion. ''There can be some fairly significant dollars attached,'' said Philip J. Lindau, president of the Pillsbury Company's flour milling and special commodities division.
In 1989, 142 million metric tons of grain were fed to livestock, the Agriculture Department said. Byproducts, or leftovers from milling wheat, crushing soybeans and slaughtering animals, provided another 39 million metric tons of feed.
James E. Cole, an economist with the Agriculture Department, said this was a way for companies to ''minimize their losses, and the farmer to maximize his profits.''
But increasingly, companies, through food alchemy, are trying to salvage their waste, instead of throwing it to the hogs, by converting it into higher-margin products for human consumption. Oat bran and rice bran were used as feeds before the discovery that the grain byproducts could help reduce cholesterol.
''People are much more concerned about human cholesterol than bovine cholesterol,'' said Peter Acly, a spokesman for the Miller Brewing Company.
Miller is one company that is working on converting byproducts into ingredients fit for human consumption. ''What you want to do is upgrade the products to their most beneficial use,'' said Frank Weber, Miller's manager of byproducts. ''In our research efforts we have attempted to look for higher-grade uses.''
The company, for instance, is trying to capitalize on the hundreds of millions of pounds of barley byproduct produced during the brewing process. For years, Miller has been generating millions of dollars of revenue selling its used barley as animal feed. But after years of research, the company has come up with Miller's Barley's Best Bran Flour.
This year, the company plans to sell one million pounds of the flour, which is being used in a bread recently introduced by the Continental Baking Company and in a high-fiber tablet and a high-protein beverage.
But these are exceptions. More typically, remnants of the food-processing operations are shipped off to the nation's feedlots. Little is wasted; bones, blood and feathers are all processed into high-protein meals. There are now experiments under way to use processed poultry litter as a feedstuff.
 
'Not a Pleasant Dinner Topic'
''It's not a terribly pleasant dinner topic,'' said a grain executive knowledgeable about the aftermarket.
Outdated and damaged bakery and dairy products are also processed and recycled as feed.
''John Q. Public doesn't care what happens to stale doughnuts, but among the animal feeders and the bakeries, it is very important,'' said Rolf Peters of the We Toast Bread Company, in Chicago, which converts unusable bakery products into animal feed.
 
A Fairly Routine Path
While it is unusual for an untainted consumer product to be sold as feed, the path General Mills' Benefit followed into the so-called aftermarket was otherwise fairly routine.
John K. McDowell, a grain merchant and cattleman in Lyons, S.D., routinely talks with General Mills officials about grains and byproducts that the big cereal company has for sale. Earlier this year, Mr. McDowell's contact at General Mills mentioned the discontinued Benefit. ''He just kind of brought it up in a conversation,'' Mr. McDowell recalled. ''He said, 'We are taking it off the market for human consumption and we need to do something with it.' ''
Mr. McDowell bought the entire remaining allotment for approximately 3 cents a pound, compared with the 5 cents a pounds for the No. 2 yellow corn that the Benefit is temporarily replacing.
Mr. McDowell's neighbor, a hog farmer, is using a Benefit-laced concoction to wean baby pigs from sow's milk.
Those higher on the food chain, however, never became accustomed to the taste of the Benefit laced with psyllium, which is also a key ingredient in some laxatives. Even R. Craig Shulstad, a General Mills spokesman, acknowledged that ''taste was not a strong selling point'' for Benefit.
In the past, byproducts were simply discarded. The aftermarket gradually developed over the years and took on added importance during the drought of 1988, when normal feed was less available.
 
Monitoring the Aftermarket
In some cases, close monitoring of the aftermarket can provide a clue to the fate of consumer products. Since last summer, the Kellogg Company has been marketing its own psyllium-fortified cereal, called Heartwise. The cereal is selling poorly and there is speculation in the industry that it will soon be withdrawn.
Nancy Roach, a Kellogg spokeswoman, concedes the cereal is not meeting sales expectations, but said that the company remains strongly committed to Heartwise. ''We feel that psyllium will play a very large role in making a contribution to the diet,'' she said.
Nonetheless, Max Busetti, editor of the Food Industry Newsletter in Alexandria, Va., is convinced that Heartwise is doomed. ''I'm just about positive that Heartwise will be shipped to the same hogs,'' he said. ''There are going to be a lot of happy hogs up there.''

War Is No Way To Start a Career

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
WAR, as everyone knows, is not good for children and other living things. What is more debatable, however, is war's long-term effect on adults who make it back to civilian life.
Studies after World War II showed that soldiers had served themselves by serving Uncle Sam: on average, male veterans have outearned non-veterans by 10 to 20 percent. But soldiers of the Vietnam years have earned 10 to 20 percent less in the civilian job market. 
One often-cited explanation for the contrast is job discrimination. Employers, goes the argument, want nothing to do with those who were exposed to the demoralizing effects of drugs and defeat. Others think the difference in veterans' work experience says more about recruitment than about life in the military. World War II veterans, they argue, were the best and the brightest; in Vietnam the Army was forced to draw disproportionately from the poor and untrained.
Now, two economists, Joshua Angrist of Harvard and Alan Krueger of Princeton, have hit upon an ingenious way to untangle the puzzle. In both wars, they discovered, draft procedures created an arbitrary link between birth dates and the probability of serving in the armed forces. And in both, men with no distinguishing characteristic other than being born on the wrong date earned substantially less in civilian life than men who lucked out.
The Angrist-Krueger analysis of World War II veterans, published as a working paper by the National Bureau of Economic Research, makes use of the fact that draft boards drew on the pool of men in simple chronological order of their birth. Roughly 75 percent of the men born in the first six months of 1926 ended up in the military. Thereafter, the probability declined quarter by quarter: Just 22 percent of those born near the end of 1928 ever served.
It seems unlikely that youth alone was, in itself, a key to success in the postwar labor market. But strikingly, younger workers earned more, strongly suggesting that military service was a handicap. The authors calculate that adjusted for other factors, World War II veterans have earned about 5 percent less over the decades.
Mr. Angrist's study of Vietnam experience, to be published in June in the American Economic Review, exploits an even sharper statistical distinction. During the Vietnam War, birth-date lotteries were used to set draft priorities within each group coming of draft age. In 1971, for example, 20-year-olds born on the first 125 dates chosen like the numbers in Lotto were eligible; the rest were exempt.
Most draft-eligibles never served. Still, draft status made a big difference: Two eligibles in seven ended up in uniform, compared with just one exempt in seven. By matching birth dates with earnings data, Mr. Angrist figures that military service during Vietnam reduced average earnings for white males by about 15 percent. The earnings of non-whites did not seem to be affected.
The enduring psychological damage from combat may play a role for the relatively small percentage of veterans who were ever under fire. But Mr. Angrist's interpretation of the earnings deficit is more straightforward: Skills acquired in the military do not make up for the lost years of civilian experience. Nor, apparently, does that modest privilege of veteran status, G.I. Bill education subsidies.
The trade-off is closer for non-whites, Mr. Angrist speculates, because they entered the Army with fewer skills and left fewer opportunities behind.
The numbers offer a new perspective on an old issue. Americans have long rationalized tight limits on assistance to war veterans on the ground that the time spent in uniform was an advantage in later life. In fact, it appears to be quite costly, at least for men who were not already victims of poverty or discrimination.
The results might also lead to second thoughts about the use of national service as a means of giving the underclass a second chance to gain the discipline needed to succeed in a middle-class world.
Mr. Angrist's numbers suggest no net benefits for recruits who met the Army's minimum standards. Nor does a recently published analysis of the post-military earnings of low-aptitude recruits, admitted to the Army under a special dispensation during the 1960's and 1970's. Indeed, according to the Human Resources Research Organization in Alexandria, Va., veterans of ''Project 100,000'' did less well in the civilian job market than comparably skilled non-veterans.
War may make men out of boys. It does not seem to make them better breadwinners.

HEADLINE: U.S. Investigating Iraq's Purchases of Farm Commodities

BYLINE: By MARTIN TOLCHIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 22

 BODY:
The United States Government has found ''possible irregularities,'' which may include kickbacks, in the Iraqi Government's purchases of American agricultural commodities, jeopardizing a $500 million payment guarantee that Iraq has requested from the Commodity Credit Corporation.
The Agriculture Department said on Monday that a team of investigators had returned from Baghdad and reported that Iraq had substantially overpaid American suppliers for sugar, rice and corn. One of the issues is whether the excess funds were used as kickbacks. 
The department asked its Inspector General to investigate the Iraqi Government's requests for ''after sales services'' from American exporters in 1987-89. These services included requests for additional products, the use of designated Iraqi shipping companies and ''cash rebates or discounts.''
''You're dealing with the Middle East, and that's standard operating procedure in some of those countries,'' said an Agriculture Department aide, who asked not to be identified.
Both Administration and Congressional sources said that the Administration had suspended action on Iraq's latest request for a $500 million payment guarantee from the Commodity Credit Corporation, which guarantees loan payments, enabling foreign purchasers of American products to obtain bank financing.
Representative Dan Glickman, a Kansas Democrat who heads the agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains, said that ''we have to make sure that the monies were actually used for their intended purpose and not to guarantee the financing of extra services.''
''Members of this committee would be quite upset if the Agriculture Department went ahead with further guarantees until this matter is resolved,'' he added.
Others who have expressed concern are Representative Charles Rose, a North Carolina Democrat who is the chairman of the agriculture subcommittee on tobacco and peanuts, and Representative George E. Brown Jr., a California Democrat who heads the agriculture subcommittee on foreign agriculture.
The Agriculture Department said that the Iraqi Government had instructed all of its state enterprises not to request or accept ''after sales services'' in connection with any future guarantees from the commodity credit agency.
The Bush Administration has thus far refrained from economic action against the Government of Saddam Hussein, despite a growing Congressional effort to impose economic sanctions on Iraq. Bills to impose sanctions are pending in both the House and Senate.
The Agriculture Department's investigation, which was begun last October, was prompted by a Justice Department investigation of the Atlanta branch of Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, which was said to have conducted a clandestine loan operation and had booked more than $2 billion in unauthorized and unreported loans to Iraq. Indictments in the case are expected next month, a Justice Department aide said.
 
Assignment of Proceeds
The Agriculture Department became involved in the Justice Department investigation when Federal investigators and banking officials found that about $750 million of the loans resulted from assignments of letter of credit proceeds for agricultural sales in conjunction with guarantees by the commodity agency.
Iraq has purchased more than $4.5 billion in American agricultural product since 1983, with the aid of payment guarantees from the credit agency, which has lost no money because of its guarantees, since Iraq has repaid all its loans.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasuries Rise in Busy Trading

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities rose in active trading yesterday, as retail accounts purchased securities after fairly large price declines in recent days.
Buying was touched off early in the session by a report in The Chicago Tribune that $50 billion in unspent funds accumulated by several Federal agencies could be used to reduce the budget deficit.
According to the article, 13 Government agencies, mainly in the defense area, are holding funds in two accounts known as the ''M'' and ''merged surplus'' accounts. The funds have been growing since 1980 and by last year amounted to more than $50 billion, the article said. 
The impact of the report was first seen in the futures trading pits in Chicago, where bond-futures prices moved up strongly. Prices in the cash market for Treasury securities quickly followed.
 
Importance Is Played Down
The importance of the article was played down by Wall Street analysts and by Bush Administration officials. Nevertheless, securities prices remained strong throughout the session.
''The $50 billion the market was focusing on was unspent budget authority,'' said Louis v.B. Crandall, chief economist at R.H. Wrightson & Associates, an economic consulting firm. ''That is not really cash, but money not spent.''
Analysts at MMS International, an economic information and forecasting firm, noted in their daily market commentary that ''claims in the article that the unspent funds could be used to reduce the deficit were simply untrue.''
''The mystery 'M' and merged-surplus accounts did not represent funds actually spent by the Treasury, only spending which had been authorized,'' they said. ''The Government departments do not have $50 billion in funds which can be transferred to the Treasury to reduce the deficit.''
 
Bargain-Hunting Cited
Traders said that bargain-hunting investors had more to do with the rise in prices than the news report.
''The mood got kind of ugly last Thursday and Friday,'' one government-bond trader said, ''and all of a sudden we were back at levels that we haven't seen since before the producer price numbers were released on May 11. That brought in business.''
Yesterday's price run-up came a day before the Treasury was expected to auction a record $10.8 billion worth of new two-year notes. The notes were offered on a when-issued basis late yesterday at a price to yield 8.54 percent, down from 8.59 percent late Monday.
Price gains were recorded in all maturities in the secondary market for Treasury securities. By late in the day, the 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at 101 1/2, up 22/32, to yield 8.60 percent. Late Monday, the benchmark issue was offered at a price to yield 8.67 percent.
 
Note Issues Rise
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 17/ 32, up 19/32, to yield 8.64 percent. And the 8 5/8 percent three-year notes were offered at 100 5/32, up 6/32, to yield 8.56 percent.
Treasury bill rates were unchanged to down slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.72 percent, unchanged on the day. Six-month bill rates fell by three basis points, or hundredths of a point, to a late offered rate of 7.74 percent.
In the corporate bond market, the New York State Electric and Gas Company priced a $100 million issue of first-mortgage bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Salomon Brothers.
The 9 7/8 percent bonds, which mature May 1, 2020, were priced at $98.475 to yield 10.035, 1.43 percentage points higher than the prevailing yield on the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent bonds of 2020 at the time of pricing.
The issue, which is noncallable for 10 years, is rated Baa-1 by Moody's Investors Service and BBB+ by Standard & Poor's.
 
Florida School Bonds
In the tax-exempt municipal bond market, Florida School Boards Association Inc. offered $205.84 million of insured lease-revenue bonds through an underwriting group led by Paine Webber.
The bonds, which are insured by Ambac Inc., are rated AAA by both Moody's and Standard & Poor's.
The issue consists of serial bonds with maturities from 1991 to 2001, and a term bonds maturing in 2004 and 2005.
Coupons on the serial bonds range from 6.10 percent in 1991 to 7 percent in 2001. The 7 percent term bond maturing in 2004 was priced at $98, to yield 7.22 percent. The 6 1/4 percent bonds maturing in 2005 were priced at $91.50, to yield 7.18 percent.
Participants in the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds said that prices of most issues rose by between 1/8 point and 3/8 point.
Meanwhile, actively quoted issues in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal securities rose by about 3/8 point, traders said.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Up in Mark Trading But Falls Against the Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar gained ground yesterday against most other currencies, particularly the West German mark, which remained under pressure as a result of growing political discord over that country's plans to reunite with East Germany.
While the dollar rose more than a pfennig against the West German mark in New York trading, however, it fell almost two and a half yen against the Japanese currency. Dealers attributed the dollar's drop against the yen largely to comments from Treasury Under Secretary David C. Mulford indicating that a further weakening of the dollar would be acceptable, although not necessarily a remedy to the United States trade deficit. 
Currency dealers said the dollar otherwise benefited from continued weakness in the West German mark amid growing concern about the future of the reunification plan.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Government yesterday turned down the opposition Social Democrats' demand for alterations in a newly signed treaty on economic unity with East Germany. The Social Democrats maintain that the new treaty fails to provide enough protection for East German workers and businesses.
The dollar rose in Europe to 1.6685 West German marks, from 1.6630 marks Monday, and to 1.67315 marks in New York from 1.66245.
In Tokyo, where the global trading day begins, the dollar closed at 152.40 yen, down from 153.25 yen Monday. It traded lower at 151.55 yen in London, and at 151.25 yen in New York, down from 153.73 yen.
The dollar was mixed against the British pound compared with Monday. Sterling bought $1.6915 in London, down from $1.6917, and $1.6930 in New York, up from $1.6875.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Monday's quotes, included: 1.41765 Swiss francs, down from 1.4217; 5.6300 French francs, up from 5.6020; 1,228.00 Italian lire, up from 1,222.50, and 1.18735 Canadian dollars, up from 1.17715.
Gold prices ended higher in New York and in Europe after falling in Asia. On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $375.60 a troy ounce, up $2.30 from late Monday. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid for gold at $374.50 an ounce, up $2.15.
Gold rose in London to a late bid price of $375 an ounce, from $373.25 late Monday. In Zurich, gold rose to $375.35 an ounce from $373.50.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold closed at $373.58 an ounce, down from $374.08.
Silver prices increased. On New York's Comex, silver bullion for current delivery settled at $5.283 a troy ounce, up from $5.131 Monday. Silver rose in London to $5.19 an ounce, from $5.14 Monday.

Cocoa Prices Rise on Fears Of Trouble in Ivory Coast

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Cocoa futures prices rose to 14-month highs yesterday on the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange in New York amid fears of supply disruptions from the Ivory Coast, the world's largest cocoa producer.
On other commodity markets, copper futures advanced; grains and soybeans were mostly lower; energy futures were mixed, and livestock and meat futures were mixed.
Cocoa futures settled $39 to $45 higher, with the contract for delivery in July at $1,491 a ton, the highest settlement of a near-month cocoa contract since March 15, 1989. 
Prices surged late in the session after a day of erratic price movements that followed a drop of $31 in the July contract on Monday.
Cocoa futures have soared more than $250 a ton in the last two weeks as Government workers in the Ivory Coast have protested wages and living conditions in the West African nation, whose economy has been crippled by last year's collapse in cocoa and coffee prices.
Energy futures ended mixed on the New York Merc ahead of the American Petroleum Institute's weekly stocks report, which showed a sharp rise in American crude oil supplies.
The institute reported crude stocks up 4.4 million barrels in the latest week compared with trade estimates of an increase of no more than 4 million barrels. Gasoline and distillate stocks were within expectations, as was an eight-tenths of a percent increase in refinery activity.
West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 12 cents lower to 10 cents higher, with July at $18.92 a barrel; heating oil futures finished 0.15 cent lower to 0.12 cent higher, with June at 51.40 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 0.31 cent lower to 0.65 cent higher, with June at 63.04 cents a gallon.
Grain and soybean futures settled mixed on the Chicago Board of Trade, with some corn and soybean contracts up slightly amid fears that planting will be further delayed by rains expected next week in the Midwest.
Cattle and hog futures slipped on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, reflecting perceptions that those markets have peaked after strong rallies in recent weeks. Pork bellies advanced amid speculation that a weekly exchange report would show a continued decline in bellies stored in commercial freezers outside Chicago.

It is that time of year for the community gardeners in Greenwich Village: time to plant, mulch, prune and adjust the chains around the shrubs. Growing things sometimes need a little extra slack. But not too much.
''The Cytisus still seems to have enough room,'' said Mary Emma Harris, eying the steel links entwined in the stems of a Scotch broom shrub in the Sheridan Square Viewing Garden. Next to it was the spot from which an identical shrub, naively left unchained because it was five feet high and five feet wide, was stolen last August.
''It's a shame about the chains,'' she said, ''but the alternative was to give up and plant ivy, and I hate to surrender. At least they seem to be working. A couple of nights this spring the thieves went after a rhododendron and some azaleas, but the chains held.'' 
Casual theft has always been a problem for gardeners - Mother's Day and Easter are traditionally the bleakest times of the year - but the last several years have brought a new wave of larceny. Gardeners and landscapers believe there are professional rustlers out there, fully equipped for large shrubs and small trees. The result has been the new science of floral bondage, which is still in the freewheeling experimental stage.
 
Wearing Barbed Wire
On the Upper East Side, landscapers are planting root balls under wire lattices and are cabling six-foot trees to underground cinder blocks and devices called duckbill anchors. Along Riverside Drive some irate visionaries fantasize about installing alarms, surveillance cameras or radio beepers. On the Lower East Side, the shrubs are wearing barbed wire this spring.
''You can cover the barbed wire with hay or something, or leave it exposed around the stem as a deterrent,'' said Kim Mulcahy, who invented the technique and has been teaching it to community gardeners around the city. ''I show them how to anchor the wire beneath the root ball. I'd rather not talk about the specifics - I don't want the thieves to read about it. Let's just say I advise people on the need to restrain their plants.''
What happens to unrestrained plants when they vanish? Small ones have been spotted for sale on the street, and gardeners suspect that crack addicts are responsible. Small trees and large shrubs are another matter, though. Gardeners have been on the lookout, and the police have conducted overnight stakeouts in Central Park's Conservatory Garden, but so far there are only theories.
Given the inherent difficulties of fencing hot trees and shrubs - they are awkward to store or to break up for parts - gardeners doubt that there is an extensive black market. The best guess is that small-time, economy-minded landscapers are carrying out the thefts before dawn and planting the goods immediately in clients' yards.
 
'Smacks of Professionals'
''It smacks of professionals,'' said Margaret Ternes, executive director of the Park Avenue Malls Planting Project. ''We used to lose a half-dozen plants a summer that ended up on people's window sills, but the past few years it's been different. They took 50 to 60 plants at a time, they knew to go only for the best specimens and -this was the real giveaway - they left wheelbarrow tracks near the median strip.''
Riverside Drive residents reached a similar conclusion when three dozen plants disappeared last summer from the Against All Odds community garden at 101st Street. ''He could spot the expensive stuff no matter how inconspicuous we tried to keep it,'' said Karen Hoodes, referring to the person who stole plants from their gardens, ''and he had a predilection for whites and blues and purples, which leads us to conclude that he was doing it for a specific landscaping project.''
The telltale clue in Central Park was the uprooting technique used last summer, when more than 100 shrubs and plants were taken from the fenced Conservatory Garden at 105th Street.
''We lost a variegated ornamental grass that was huge - five feet tall with a root ball that probably weighed 30 pounds,'' said Lynden B. Miller, the garden's director. ''They removed it without leaving any mess at all, and that's a sign of professionals. It raises my ire no end. If I could get my hands on those people, I'd shake them till their teeth rattle and fall out.''
It is tempting, when confronted with a rhododendron in chains, to conclude that something has gone wrong in New Yorkers' relationship with nature. But maybe it is actually a sign of increased devotion. Charitably minded horticulturists suggest that New Yorkers' increasing fondness for greenery is stimulating the thieves by creating more demand as well as more supply.
''There are more places to steal from,'' Mrs. Miller said, ''because the city is getting more and more beautiful, thanks to the community gardens and the restorations in the parks and the sidewalk plantings. People have more appreciation for plants today, and it's important to remember that in general the public has been wonderful at respecting public gardens.''
 
Perilous Times
Except, of course, at those certain times of the year. ''I have four sons,'' Mrs. Miller said, ''but no one in our home is ever allowed to mention Mother's Day.'' Other gardeners have been known to anticipate that day by pinning a note to a rosebush announcing, ''If you steal these flowers, your mother will die.''
Last summer, when large shrubs kept disappearing throughout the summer at the Conservatory Garden, the curator, Sarah Price, turned to the police. Their first response, she recalled, was, ''Hey, lady, it's a plant.'' Then the police agreed to spend several nights inside the six-acre garden waiting for thieves.
''They didn't catch anyone,'' Ms. Price said, ''but their presence seemed to be a deterrent because the rash of thefts stopped. It was very nice of the police. I can understand why these crimes don't have high priority, but I do think it's a quality-of-life issue. We can't let the thieves take over the jewel of Central Park.''
Commercial landscapers say their work gets stolen all over the city as well as in the suburbs. Dimitri Gravanis, who runs Dimitri's Garden Ltd. at 1572 Second Avenue, near 82d Street, lost a $4,000 tree last year from his own yard in Teaneck, N.J. It was a dwarf maple, six feet high with a six-foot spread, that he had not bothered to anchor.
''I've started advising all our customers to anchor trees and shrubs in exposed places,'' said Mr. Gravanis's son, Basil. ''We use a duckbill anchor that snaps open after you bury it five feet deep. Usually we keep the cable or the chain beneath the surface. You have to consider the esthetics.'' Esthetics or Security? But occasionally esthetics must be sacrificed, even on the Upper East Side. Patricia Taylor Buckley, the wife of the writer and editor William F. Buckley Jr., has been fighting a long battle to keep a pair of small fir trees flanking their front door off Park Avenue.
''First we put the trees in big stone Grecian urns, and the thieves just came along and took them,'' she said. ''After we lost four of them, I tried cementing the urns to the sidewalk. So they just sawed off the urns at the base. They'd come in the middle of the night - I got so paranoid that I'd hear something and run down the staircase at 4 in the morning and turn on the searchlight, but I could never catch them.''
Next, Mrs. Buckley switched from Grecian urns to three-foot-square wooden tubs. ''I cemented the tubs to the sidewalk, so they just dug up the trees and left the tubs behind,'' she said. ''But now I think I've finally beaten them. I found some trees that nobody would ever want to steal. They're terribly scraggly things surrounded by rather dreadful looking ivy, but at least they're mine.''

HEADLINE: SAVINGS FAILURES EXPECTED TO SOAR, THE TREASURY SAYS

BYLINE: By NATHANIEL C. NASH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The Administration told Congress today that more than 1,000 savings and loan associations - 40 percent of the industry - might eventually have to be seized by the Government, twice the number it had initially projected.
Blaming rising interest rates and sizable areas of weakness in the nation's real estate markets, Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the Senate Banking Committee that based on the new projection the $73 billion that Congress appropriated for the bailout last year would have to be raised at least to $89 billion, and perhaps to as high as $130 billion.
''It is now clear that the amounts projected and authorized will fall short of what is required,'' Mr. Brady said.
 
A Shift in Position
Mr. Brady's testimony represented an extraordinary admission by the Administration, which for more than a year has insisted that there was no compelling reason to change its estimates of the cost of the biggest financial debacle in the nation's history, even though private analysts were warning that the Treasury's original numbers were woefully inadequate.
''Reality has arrived and we should be thankful for it,'' said Bert Ely, a financial consultant based in Alexandria, Va. ''The Treasury has put realistic numbers on the table.'' 
But the figures Mr. Brady gave today represent only a portion of the overall cost of the cleanup. They do not include the cost of the deals struck in 1988 for the sale of more than 200 institutions before the bailout law was passed. And, citing the same economic factors, a top regulator admitted today that those costs are also rising. [Page D20.] The new estimates also do not include the huge amounts of interest the taxpayers will have to pay to finance the bailout.
When those are added in, the total cost of the bailout to the taxpayer and the industry could easily exceed $250 billion over the next 10 years, and approach $500 billion over 30 years. Last month, the General Accounting Office said the cost of the bailout including interest would range from $325 billion to $500 billion.
Mr. Brady said his agency did not include the interest costs because such costs are not included in accounting for Government programs. ''It would be like saying that the $30 billion Kennedy space program actually cost $92 billion,'' he said.
Today's estimates were arrived at differently from the $61 billion that Administration officials estimated on Tuesday would be added to next fiscal year's budget deficit because of the bailout.
 
Getting the Bad News Out
Some experts were surprised that the Treasury was willing to paint such a grim picture. ''I think the word must have come down that Brady get the bad news out once and for all and not run the risk that as 1992 approaches they have to change their numbers again,'' said one industry expert who asked not to be identified.
The clear message from Mr. Brady and the Administration was that Congress would need to appropriate large sums of additional money to guarantee that insured depositors not lose any money. Mr. Brady said he would support either an open-ended appropriation or a set figure, whichever the Congress wanted. But he warned that since the cost of the bailout is a moving target, a specific figure might prove to be inadequate and Congress might find it would have to take up the issue again.
The savings and loan industry ran into deep troubles in the mid-1980's as the result of slack regulation at the Federal and state levels and highly speculative investments in real estate by savings and loan entrepreneurs whose lending practices bordered on the fraudulent.
The debacle created billions of dollars of losses for depositors. The Government, which is obligated to cover losses on insured deposits, is now making good on those guarantees. Mr. Brady stressed today that management and stockholders were not being bailed out but that depositors were being rescued.
 
Bailout Officials Attend
Mr. Brady testified as chairman of the Oversight Board of the Resolution Trust Corporation, the agency created last year to oversee the bailout. He appeared with the four other board members: Alan Greenspan, the Federal Reserve Board chairman; Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and two members from the private sector, Robert C. Larson, a real estate specialist, and Philip C. Jackson, a former Federal Reserve official.
The new estimates also come at a time of delicate budget negotiations between the White House and Congress. The Administration has said that the soaring cost of the bailout has been a driving force behind its desire to get a budget agreement.
Mr. Brady said the biggest contributors to the rise in costs have been higher interest rates and the weak real estate markets. Both factors are sending more savings units into insolvency and making it harder to find buyers for either their assets or their branch offices.
''Thrifts are just not as attractive a franchise relative to banks as they once were,'' Mr. Brady said.
 
Accounting for the Deficit
One issue that Mr. Brady and others will have to solve is how, on a budgetary basis, the Government should treat the high costs of the cleanup, as well as the large volumes of interim financing, often referred to as working capital, the trust corporation needs. The issue is what portion of the costs to count as part of the Federal deficit.
Mr. Brady said he would support keeping the working capital off budget, and thus not counted in the deficit, since it is used to pay off depositors after an institution is seized. Once the Government liquidates the assets of an institution, often in a later fiscal period, it recovers large amounts of the money that it borrowed to pay the depositors. Such transactions produce swings that tend to skew the budget picture.
Mr. Brady did say that the Government should count as part of the deficit any payments to depositors that are not ultimately covered by the sale of assets. But he said he would leave to the budget negotiators the issue of whether the bailout costs should be used in calculating whether the deficit is meeting the budget targets of the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings law.
The latest numbers are likely to confuse the public, since industry experts, academics, regulators, members of Congress and the General Accounting Office have issued sharply varying projections.
 
Projections by Category
The projections have basically fallen into three categories.
One measures the problem in terms of what it would cost today to cover the losses of depositors' money, ''As if you could write a check and solve the entire problem right now,'' a senior Treasury official said.
Last year, the Treasury said that $50 billion would be enough for the Resolution Trust Corporation to handle failures between August 1989 and August 1992, and another $23 billion would cover failures after that. It has now expanded that estimate so that in the most optimistic case the cost would be $89 billion, and in the worst case, if real estate prices continue to be depressed, it would cost $130 billion.
Other projections, including those of the Office of Management and Budget, have calculated how much the bailout would cost, including interest on borrowings over the next 10 and 30 years. Last year, the 10-year cost was put at $159 billion, while the 30-year cost was estimated to be more than $250 billion.
But Mr. Greenspan said today that the numbers projected by the Treasury implied even higher overall costs than the $320 billion to $500 billion in the G.A.O.'s most recent projections.
Perhaps the most graphic illustration of the huge upward adjustment by the Treasury was its projection that in the worst case as many as 1,037 savings and loan institutions with $530 billion in assets might have to be seized before the Resolution Trust Corporation completes its work in August 1996.
But Mr. Greenspan did not seem overly concerned about the higher figures. He said he did not expect that the extra borrowing implied by the higher cost estimates would have much of an effect on credit markets.
''In and of itself, it should not affect interest rates,'' he said.
 
Survivors and Casualties
A new calculation by the Office of Thrift Supervision divides the savings industry into four categories of comparative health.
One group covers 1,267 well-capitalized and profitable institutions, with assets of $399 billion. A second group comprises 621 institutions, with $327 billion in assets, that are expected to meet the new capital requirements. Few if any of these are expected to fail.
A third group comprises 315 savings associations, with assets of $152 billion that are troubled by poor earnings and low capital levels. The fourth group covers 299 institutions, with $193 billion in assets, and they are expected to fail.
In the worse-case projection, all the institutions in the last two groups would fail.

HEADLINE: Pierre Rinfret, Economist, Chosen By G.O.P. to Run Against Cuomo

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
After months of searching, New York State Republican leaders last night selected an economist who has never run for public office to be their party's candidate for governor.
The candidate, Pierre Rinfret, is almost certain to be ratified at the Republican state nominating convention in Rye next week.
Republican leaders described the 66-year-old Mr. Rinfret as an enthusiastic, articulate, wealthy, knowledgeable economist who can make an issue of the state's fiscal problems and raise enough money to wage a credible, if uphill, campaign against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
The Manhattan resident, who was an unpaid economic adviser to three Presidents, John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard M. Nixon, heads Rinfret Associates, an economic consulting firm in Manhattan. ''He is as clean as a whistle,'' a Republican leader said. 
Party leaders were repeatedly rebuffed by potential candidates in awe of the $8 million Cuomo campaign treasury and the Democratic Governor's high standing in polls, at least earlier this year.
Also considered was Mr. Cuomo's reputation as one of the best public speakers in the country and as someone whose supporters do not hesitate to bloody an opponent and his image. Four years ago, Mr. Cuomo's supporters tore into Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Republican candidate, over his income tax returns.
In addition, the reluctant Republicans were skeptical of the impoverished New York Republican Party, which has repeatedly left its statewide candidates in the fiscal lurch in the last 10 years.
Republican leaders had scrambled to put together a state ticket before the Memorial Day weekend. Mr. Rinfret and another wealthy Republican, John L. Loeb Jr., a former ambassador to Denmark, were recruited as prospects in the last 36 hours by the Manhattan Republican chairman, State Senator Roy M. Goodman. But Mr. Rinfret (pronounced rin-FRAY) won out.
They were, by one count, the 16th and 17th Republicans to be considered as challengers of Governor Cuomo.
The urgency was dictated by the scheduled start of the Republican state nominating convention next Tuesday. Veteran politicians could not remember state party leaders, Democratic or Republican, taking so long to select a favored gubernatorial candidate before a convention.
A spokeswoman for Mr. Rinfret, Deborah Ishlon, said early yesterday afternoon that ''he has expressed interest in the idea but there are a number of questions and issues to be resolved.'' Although Mr. Rinfret agreed to be photographed at his Fifth Avenue home last night, he gave no further response to requests for comment.
 
Born in Montreal
Mr. Rinfret was born in Montreal and raised in New York City, earning degrees from City College and New York University and a doctorate in political economics from the University of Dijon in France. In World War II, he was awarded a Bronze Star and Purple Heart during service with the Third Army in Europe. He and his wife, Aida, have been married for 41 years and have two grown children.
Mr. Rinfret heads a firm that specializes in economic and business information and trading of government bonds, gold, silver and futures. ''He is personally very affluent and comes well connected,'' said one Republican leader.
His political experience has been at the national level as an economic adviser to the Nixon campaigns in 1968 and 1972. He has not been identified with the New York Republican Party except as a contributor.
 
A Feverish Day
His selection ended a feverish day in which Mr. Goodman and J. Patrick Barrett, the Republican state chairman, met with both Mr. Rinfret and Mr. Loeb and conferred by telephone with various Republican leaders.
Both Mr. Goodman and Mr. Barrett had strong reservations about the statewide stature and fund-raising capability of another possible candidate, Herbert London, a dean at New York University who ran briefly for mayor of New York City last year. He was a rare Republican willing to run and has the support of the Conservative Party.
Mr. Rinfret was described by another Republican leader as favoring abortion rights, a position that could be a problem for the anti-abortion Conservatives. Michael Long, the Conservative Party leader, could not be reached for comment at his home last night.
The two Republican leaders, Mr. Barrett and Mr. Goodman, were serving as representatives of four other Republican county chairmen who joined the recruiting effort when Mr. Barrett failed to enlist a candidate.
The other Republican leaders involved are Assemblyman John C. Cochrane of Suffolk County; Anthony J. Colavita of Westchester County, who was Mr. Barrett's predecessor in the party post; Presiding Supervisor Joseph N. Mondello of Nassau County and Thomas Reynolds, the new Erie County Republican chairman. The 300-member Republican State Committee will actually nominate the state ticket at the convention.
 
Candidates for Other Jobs
The party leaders hope to find candidates for lieutenant governor and state attorney general today or tomorrow. There is only one Republican state incumbent, Comptroller Edward V. Regan, who is seeking re-election.
The party leaders are likely to encounter reluctant candidates for these posts, too. Several have suggested that a woman be nominated for lieutenant governor.
One of those mentioned, Diane McGrath-McKechnie, who was defeated for New York City mayor in 1985, said she would prefer to seek the state chairmanship if Mr. Barrett stepped aside. He has been blamed by some party leaders for what they freely admit has become a public-relations and political debacle.
Robert R. McMillan of Nassau County, who was defeated in a race for the United States Senate in 1988, has been frequently mentioned as an attorney general prospect, but he too said he would rather seek the state chairmanship if Mr. Barrett resigns.

HEADLINE: House, 401-21, Votes to Widen Clean Air Curbs

BYLINE: By RICHARD L. BERKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The House of Representatives late tonight overwhelmingly approved the first major overhaul of environmental laws in 13 years, rebuffing warnings from the White House that some provisions were ''unnecessarily costly.''
Before the 401-to-21 vote, lawmakers resolved several lingering items, passing provisions for a program to assist workers whose jobs would be affected by the measure, a pilot program requiring the sales of alternative-fuel cars in Southern California, and expanded warranties for emission-control equipment.
Representative John D. Dingell, the chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, whose decision to compromise on many elements of the legislation cleared the way for passage, said after the vote that the bill was ''a good piece of legislation'' but that it would take a toll on the public.
''Everybody is going to find out that clean air is not free,'' said the Michigan Democrat. ''There are enormous costs in terms of jobs.'' 
 
Estimates of $20 Billion a Year
The bill, which by some estimates would cost industry $20 billion a year, would greatly strengthen the Clean Air Act of 1970, with broad new air quality standards, curbs on automobile emissions, requirements for the sale of cleaner-burning fuels and a program to cut emissions that cause acid rain. Representatives from industry and environmental groups say neither the House nor the Senate version of the legislation is particularly stronger than the other, although there are some differences in specific provisions. The Senate version was approved last month.
Despite earlier warnings that he would recommend a veto of amendments that the House approved today, John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, said he would urge Mr. Bush to support the package.
 
'A Lot of Fine Tuning'
Mr. Sununu said that while he preferred elements of the version passed by the Senate, he was optimistic that provisions opposed by the Administration would be deleted when the measure goes to a House-Senate conference.
''There's a lot of fine-tuning that has to be done,'' Mr. Sununu said in an interview. ''On the principles of the bill, most of what is coming out is consistent with the President's approach. Our recommendation is to proceed to the Senate and House conference.''
Mr. Dingell, commenting on the bill's prospects in negotiations between the chambers, said: ''You're going to see a very interesting conference where the results are difficult to predict.''
 
Environmentalists Welcome Bill
Environmental groups welcomed passage of the bill tonight, but they were restrained in their comments.
''If the conferees choose the best parts of the two bills, they can fashion a good law and the nation will benefit,'' said Richard E. Ayres, chairman of the National Clean Air Coalition, which represents several organizations supporting stronger environmental laws. ''If, on the other hand, they choose the weakest portions of the two bills, the result will delay unacceptably the pollution control needed to protect public health.''
Industry groups said they would press for many changes when the legislation goes to conference.
Thomas R. Kuhn, president of the Edison Electric Institute, which represents electric companies, said tonight, ''Although specific compromises were reached which address some of our concerns, issues are still pending which could increase the five to seven billion-dollar price tag for electric consumers.''
While it took six weeks of floor fights in the Senate to pass the bill, the House acted quickly, resolving most of the disputes in private negotiations. The measure was not introduced in the House until Monday.
 
Debate Was Heated
After a heated debate that focused not on the environment but on economics, the House rebuffed pressure from the White House and from industry, passing a measure that would provide $250 million in unemployment and retraining benefits for workers who lose their jobs because of the law.
The amendment, sponsored by Representative Bob Wise, Democrat of West Virginia, was approved in a vote of 274 to 146, although a broader assistance program proposed by Senator Robert C. Byrd, Democrat of West Virginia, failed by one vote in the Senate. The measure was intended to help an estimated 5,000 coal miners who could lose their jobs because of the tougher acid rain provisions in the House bill.
''We've taken care of industry's interests, we've taken care of the environmental interests,'' Mr. Wise said. ''And it's time to take care of the people's interests.''
The workers' compensation amendment was of particular concern to Administration officials. In a letter Tuesday to House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, Mr. Sununu and William K. Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, warned that the provision ''would open a multibillion-dollar deficit-increasing door that may never be closed.'' The two men raised their concerns in a meeting this morning with House Republicans.
But in the interview later in the day, Mr. Sununu backed off from suggestions that the amendment would prompt a Presidential veto.
 
Approval on Warranties
The House also approved an amendment that would lengthen the warranties that parts and vehicle manufacturers must provide for emission-control equipment. Under the provision, the manufacturer, rather than the car buyer, is liable for many of the repairs of pollution-control equipment. A similar provision is contained in the Senate bill.
''This amendment insures that neither consumers nor the environment gets stuck with the bill for faulty equipment and that independent garages get a fair break,'' said Representative Gerry Sikorski, a Minnesota Democrat and a chief sponsor of the amendment.
A potentially serious jurisdictional dispute was averted when the House rejected an amendment by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois and chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, that would have deleted user fees and tariffs from many of the bill's provisions. Mr. Rostenkowski had contended that the provisions were taxes and should have come under his committee's authority.
Another point of contention that was resolved earlier today and passed by a wide margin was an amendment that would reduce production of chlorofluorocarbons and other chemicals that destroy the ozone layer.
 
Final Point of Contention
It was not until late tonight, in a deal brokered by Speaker Foley, that an agreement was reached on the last point of contention that was the subject of vigorous negotiations throughout the day: The deal diluted a requirement co-authored by Representative Henry A. Waxman, Democrat of California, that automobile manufacturers each year produce a million vehicles that burn a cleaner fuel, beginning in the middle 1990's in the nation's most polluted cities.
The Waxman plan was opposed by Representative Dingell, who is a staunch ally of the automobile industry. And, although a clean-fuel vehicle provision was contained in the Administration's original clean air proposal, Mr. Sununu said the House plan went too far in dictating certain types of fuels that would have to be used by the cars.
Specifically, in the agreement reached tonight, the amendment would strike the requirement that a million clean-fuel vehicles be produced each year and instead establish a pilot program under which 150,000 cars that use alternative fuel would have to be sold in Southern California in 1994. The number would increase to 300,000 new cars a year beginning in 1997.
After the vote tonight, Mr. Waxman cited the clean-vehicle measure as perhaps the most significant in the legislation. ''It is a foot in the door,'' he said. ''California will lead the way. I think the rest of the country will be following our example.''
Despite Mr. Waxman's optimism, the Clean Air Working Group, a coalition of business and trade associations, expressed serious reservations about the overall legislation. ''The air quality debate in Congress is ignoring the simple guideline that new legislation be both effective and affordable,'' said William D. Fay, administrator of the organization.

Moscow Favors Speedy Talks

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 23

 BODY:
The Soviet Foreign Minister, Eduard A. Shevardnadze, said today that Moscow favors speeding up work at the conventional arms reduction talks in Vienna.
The Soviet official's remarks appeared at least partly aimed at American and NATO officials who have been complaining in recent days of Soviet foot-dragging in Vienna. 
Mr. Shevardnadze spoke to reporters after meeting with the West German Foreign Minister, Hans-Dietrich Genscher, at the large Soviet diplomatic mission here. The two officials said they had touched on a wide range of issues between the two countries, including Soviet security concerns about a reunited Germany, economic relations and scientific and technical exchanges.
The Kremlin insists that a unified Germany not be part of NATO, a demand rejected by the West German Government and the other NATO allies.
The two Foreign Ministers did not report any progress on that issue, but they did agree on the conventional arms talks.
''We advocated an acceleration of the Vienna negotiations''
Mr. Shevardnadze said. ''We don't have much time.''
The aim of the Vienna talks is a treaty substantially shrinking the armies in Europe, along with the tanks, airplanes and other non-nuclear gear. Both the United States and the Soviet Union have indicated that the treaty should be completed in time for a meeting of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe tentatively scheduled for December in Paris.

Talks on Broader U.S.-Soviet Airline Service Stall on Currency

BYLINE: By JOHN H. CUSHMAN Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Negotiations on expanded airline service between the United States and the Soviet Union have stalled over economic issues, dashing hopes that an agreement could be signed at the summit meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev, American officials say.
Serious disagreements surfaced in April over what currency American airlines would use when selling their tickets and paying their costs in the Soviet Union, said officials involved in the discussions, which began last December and initially made rapid headway.
The Soviet negotiators are demanding economic conditions that would gain them valuable dollars but would restrict American airlines' ability to profit from the growing demand for travel by Soviet citizens to the United States, the officials said.
The aviation agreement was discussed again last week during the trip to Moscow by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d. But Bush Administration officials and airline representatives said that the Soviet negotiators remain intractable and that the agreement cannot be concluded before the summit, which begins when President Gorbachev arrives in Washington on May 30. 
 
'A Tremendous Opening'
''It would be a tremendous opening in the market if it happened,'' an American official said of the proposed expansion of air service. ''But the point is, you can have all this authority to fly, but if U.S. carriers can't make a profit in the Soviet Union it isn't worth anything.''
The officials said that they continued to hope that an agreement can be reached eventually, but that it is already too late for a pact to make much difference in this year's tourist trade.
An agreement would open new Pacific service and expand Atlantic routes between the two nations, whose bilateral air traffic is limited to a few flights each week by Pan Am and Aeroflot, serving only Moscow, Leningrad, New York and Washington.
The new agreement would allow up to six American passenger and freight lines to fly to the Soviet Union, and would let Moscow expand Aeroflot's schedule or establish new airlines to compete with Aeroflot on American routes.
 
Politically Sensitive Route
An agreement would bring new service to several cities: Anchorage, San Francisco, Chicago and Miami, along with the Ukrainian city of Kiev, Magadan and Khabarovsk in the Soviet Far East, Tbilisi in Soviet Georgia and Riga in Latvia.
Selecting the cities caused little dispute between the two sides, and like other broad terms of the agreement that provision was settled on in February.
Only lately have some American officials wondered whether the Riga route might be politically sensitive, because of the implications of reaching a trade agreement with Moscow involving a Baltic republic during the debate over Baltic independence.
The officials said they did not expect Riga to be an obstacle to an eventual agreement. Like other bilateral international aviation agreements, that one would not require approval by the Senate.
 
Dollar-Ruble Dispute
American officials had been very optimistic about the talks, especially when they heard Soviet officials speaking about building a new airline to compete with Aeroflot, a prospect that was taken as a sign of movement toward market economics.
But the dispute over currency suggests that the Soviet side continues to view the airline business as a way of obtaining hard currency under tight economic controls.
The currency issue is paramount to the American airlines that would seek to fly on the new routes. American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Airlines, Pan Am and Alaska Airlines, along with charter airlines and freight companies, have been closely watching the talks, which are handled by the State Department with advice from an industry representative.
The Soviets want the American airlines to sell tickets only for dollars, which severely restricts their access to the biggest and fastest growing segment of the aviation market between the two nations: Soviet citizens, who possess only rubles.
 
Competition With Aeroflot
With the relaxation of emigration and travel rights for Soviet citizens, there are now twice as many Soviet citizens flying between the two countries as there are Americans, although American business and tourist travel to the Soviet Union is also growing. According to estimates, 140,000 people flew between the two countries on Pan Am and Aeroflot in 1989; other travelers went through third countries en route to and from the Soviet Union.
The Soviets also want the American airlines to pay in dollars for all their expenses in the Soviet Union, like food services, fuel, rent and labor. Because of the inflated official exchange rate, that is costly to the American companies.
The Americans want permission to sell tickets directly to Soviet citizens, who would pay in rubles. The airlines then would spend the rubles in the Soviet Union to pay their operating expenses, bypassing the costly artificial exchange rate. That would also put the airlines in direct competition with the inefficient state-owned airline, Aeroflot.

HEADLINE: DIPLOMATIC BATTLE WAGED ON KASHMIR

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: NEW DELHI, May 23

 BODY:
On the day this week that the spiritual leader of thousands of Kashmiri Muslims was shot dead by unknown assassins, India's special minister for Kashmir, George Fernandes, was on his way to Cairo to deliver a letter to President Hosni Mubarak.
Mr. Fernandes arrived on the heels of Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who has just completed an eight-nation tour of the Islamic Middle East. She was asking for Islamic solidarity against India.
An Indian-Pakistani diplomatic war, fought by envoys from Washington to Beijing, has been gaining intensity over several months. But so far it has been a war of accusations rather than a debate over objectives. What each side wants, and why, is not always clear to governments outside this region, diplomats say. A Campaign of Repression? Islamic Pakistan asserts that India has unleashed a military campaign of repression against the Muslim majority in the Kashmir Valley, where alienation from New Delhi has been growing for three years and where many people want to exercise the right, denied them for 40 years, to choose whether they want to be part of India. 
This week those charges were intensified as Indian paramilitary forces fired into a crowd of mourners carrying the body of the slain Muslim cleric, Maulvi Mohammed Farooq, from the hosptial to his religious headquarters in Srinigar, the capital of Kashmir, on Monday. Dozens of people died.
In Srinagar today, witnesses told reporters that there had been no exchange of fire between troops and militants, as Indian authorities have insisted in describing the troops' action as self-defense.
In New Delhi, officials regard the question of Kashmir's future a matter over which there can be no debate. The problem, they say, has become simply one of Pakistani support for armed militants. They say that until Islamabad stops that support, there can be no hope of negotiations inside Kashmir or with Pakistan.
 
Three Border Wars
But beneath the surface, politicians on both sides of the border say, there are other motivations and other reasons for the standoff between two countries that have fought three wars along the Kashmir border.
In Pakistan, resentment has festered for nearly 20 years over India's support for a Bengali Muslim independence movement that in 1971 - with the help of the invading Indian Army -created Bangladesh out of what had been East Pakistan.
Over the last decade, not only Pakistan, but also Bangladesh, Nepal and Sri Lanka have watched as India backed other guerrilla armies in the region, most prominently the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in the Sri Lankan Northeast. Indian intelligence agencies have also supported guerrilla groups in the Chittagong Hills in Bangladesh. Pakistan fears Indian influence in its already troubled province of Sind.
 
A Chance for Revenge
''So here in Kashmir, Pakistan has the perfect opportunity to pay us back,'' an Indian politician said. ''They have only to give enough support to keep an insurgency running for a long time.''
For India, the Kashmir situation is fraught with so much potential danger that the Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh seems unwilling or unable to gamble on bold political moves - including opening the border between Indian Kashmir and the Pakistani part of the region or talking with Islamabad about how to build a new political entity in Kashmir that would satisfy both countries. India seems intent on crushing the revolt by force before looking for the roots of the problem.
The Singh Government is supported by a Hindu-based party that includes people willing to press a case against Muslims anywhere.
The Kashmir Valley is only about a third of India's Jammu and Kashmir state, and the only Islamic area -Jammu is largely Hindu and Ladakh is Buddhist. But Kashmir's population is large enough to make Jammu and Kashmir the only Indian state with a Muslim majority. It is important to India's image as a secular nation with religious freedom to have a predominantly Muslim state.
Furthermore, in India, religion is an explosive subject even in normal times. There is always the danger that the crisis in Kashmir will set off conflagrations elsewhere. Several thousand people died at the hands of Hindu mobs last fall in several Indian states because of a dispute over a mosque in Ayodhya over which Hindus wanted to construct a temple.
 
Economic and Political Issues
Kashmiris argue, however, that their problems with India are not religious, but economic and political. They and their supporters in Pakistan accuse India of emphasizing their religion in order to undermine their cause in the West, where Asian Muslims often believe there is a prejudice against them.
The Kashmir Valley, which India had been developing as one of its prime tourist areas, suffered from a low investment level in industry, gorwing unemployment, poor communications, limited air services and inadequate roads connect it with to the rest of India. People here have come to believe that the produce of their orchards and farms might move more quickly through Pakistan.
Buddhists Ladakhis have similar complaints. Apricots not available anywhere in Indian cities ripen and rot on Ladakhi hillsides for lack of refrigerated airfreight services.
Under Prime Minister Indira Gandhi and her son and successor, Rajiv, New Delhi began interfering with Kashmir's internal politics, ultimately dominating the National Conference, the last Kashmiri party with any claim to Kashmiri nationalism. As a result, many Kashmiris were pushed outside mainstream politics. A 1987 state election, which more or less everyone admits was rigged in favor of Mr. Gandhi's Congress Party and its National Conference allies, provided recruits for new militant groups.
An Indian attack on Pakistan will not solve these problems, say citizens groups here and in Islamabad who are beginning to fear an accidental war that neither side wants. Both sides accuse each other of massing troops. Both fear the coming of summer, when snows melt in the border mountain ranges and a season conducive to both military maneuvers and guerrilla infiltration begins.

HEADLINE: House Moves to Free Nicaragua and Panama Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
The House of Representatives took steps today to make sure the United States could soon provide economic aid to Nicaragua and Panama, despite uncertainty over the future of military aid to El Salvador.
On Tuesday night, the House voted down a bill authorizing funds for all three countries. But the Speaker of the House, Thomas S. Foley, said today that Congress would use another vehicle, an ''emergency supplemental appropriations'' bill, to send money to the new Governments led by President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in Nicaragua and President Guillermo Endara in Panama.
The House and the Senate have passed different versions of the appropriations bill. Negotiators from the two chambers have drafted a compromise version scheduled to come up for final approval in the House on Thursday. 
House Democrats said they did not want to expose themselves to further criticism from President Bush, who has repeatedly complained that the Democrats were delaying assistance for Nicaragua and Panama.
Ordinarily a money bill requires a separate prior authorization bill, to provide legal authority to spend the money. But senior Congressional Democrats said they were willing to waive the requirement so they could send the money bill to Mr. Bush before the Memorial Day recess.
The bill includes the full $300 million requested by Mr. Bush for Nicaragua and $420 million of the $500 million he sought for Panama.
On Tuesday, acting on a separate authorization bill, the House voted 250 to 163 in favor of an amendment that would halve United States military aid to El Salvador. But minutes later, in a surprise move, the House voted down the overall bill, 244 to 171. The defeat was insured by Republicans and moderate Democrats who dislike the restriction in military aid to El Salvador; liberals who wanted even more severe restictions, and people from both parties unenthusiastic about foreign aid in general.
Efforts to cut miliary aid to El Salvador have gained momentum because of Congressional doubts about whether the Government of President Alfredo Cristiani will identify and prosecute all the people responsible for the killings of six Jesuit priests in San Salvador in November. Military aid to El Salvador totals $85 million this year.
The fight over Salvadoran aid will soon resume as Congress drafts foreign aid legislation for the fiscal year 1991, which begins Oct. 1.
Mr. Foley said today that the vote on El Salvador was ''a watershed'' in the evolution of United States policy toward that country. ''Almost certainly,'' he said, ''military aid will be curtailed in some form in the future.''
Democrats say that such restrictions would provide new incentives to President Cristiani and the guerrillas to negotiate an end to the decade-long war. The vote Tuesday suggests that a solid majority of House members now favor such restrictions. Indeed, many Republicans in Congress and the Bush Administration said they too would accept some new restrictions on aid, linking it to the behavior of the guerrillas and the Salvadoran armed forces.
The vote on Salvadoran aid highlighted a split between liberals and moderates in the Democratic Party. Representative Dave McCurdy of Oklahoma organized a group of moderate House Democrats who voted against final passage of the foreign aid bill on the ground that Congress should work with the Administration in a bipartisan manner to forge a new policy toward El Salvador.
Mr. McCurdy said, ''Our assistance to El Salvador should contain conditions.'' But now is an ''inopportune moment'' to withhold 50 percent of the military aid funds, just as the Salvadoran Government and the rebels are trying to negotiate a cease-fire, he said.
Moderate Democrats from Georgia, Louisiana, Texas, North Carolina and other states joined Mr. McCurdy in voting against the overall foreign aid bill.
Several House committee chairmen, including Les Aspin of Wisconsin, Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois and G. V. (Sonny) Montgomery of Mississippi, disregarded the leadership of their party and voted against the overall bill.

HEADLINE: Europeans Come to Aid of English Cathedral

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LICHFIELD, England

 BODY:
John Lang, Dean of Lichfield, tells visitors that his red sandstone Cathedral of St. Mary and St. Chad crumbles so easily after seven centuries that tiny pieces of it flake off in every downpour.
''In a heavy rain,'' he said recently, ''you can actually see it going down the drain.''
But in 1988 the European Community came to the rescue, contributing 1,045,000, the equivalent of $1,776,500, to the cathedral's restoration fund. 
As a result, the scaffolding around the buttresses on the south transept bears the blue European Community flag, rimmed with a circle of 12 stars for each member country, which is more usually seen at highway construction sites and industrial parks.
''We got every penny we asked for, on the most extraordinary ground that if the cathedral were to fall into disrepair, tourism would fall off, and therefore employment would decrease,'' Dean Lang said. ''We went over and got a tremendous grilling from a senior official of the European Commission in charge of the European Regional Fund, but what we got nearly doubled the amount we planned to raise.''
Egon Schoneweg, a spokesman for the European Community's Regional Policy directorate in Brussels, said that helping keep Lichfield Cathedral's spires, buttresses and window tracery from collapsing was an unusual activity of the fund, but confirmed Dean Lang's account of the logic behind it.
''It's not a cultural activity on our part,'' he said. ''It's an encouragement of tourism, which makes a contribution to economic development.''
Part of the money is for a visitors' center the church will build on the spacious grounds of the cathedral close. ''We think we get well over 200,000 visitors a year,'' the Dean said.
The sandstone with which Lichfield and Hereford, near the Welsh border, were built is more susceptible to deterioration than the stone of much older cathedral buildings such as Durham, but most of the 30 surviving English medieval cathedrals have had to undertake fund drives to survive.
Most dioceses, like Lichfield, have found their domestic resources inadequate to the task, and many have sought contributions from Anglophile donors in the United States.
Hereford ambitiously contemplated the idea of selling off its 13th-century map of the world at Sotheby's auction house in London, before a national uproar over the potential loss of an important part of the British heritage forced the Dean and Chapter to reconsider. The map went on display again in the cathedral grounds there on May 21, saved by a $3.2 million British Government grant and a $1.6 million gift from an American-born millionaire, John Paul Getty Jr. But most of the other cathedrals are not, like Lichfield, in a region qualifying for special assistance on economic grounds. Coventry Cathedral, in the industrial zone to the south of Lichfield, is, and it received 87,000, nearly $148,000, from the European Community for maintenance and repairs.
Assistance to Britain from the European Community for restructuring its steel and shipbuilding industries from 1989 to 1991 will total $1.6 billion, Mr. Schoneweg said, more than any other member country has received for industrial restructuring. The Community is also providing $991,250,000 for roads, bridges and the like in Northern Ireland over the five years beginning with 1989, he said.

HEADLINE: After the Quake, Older Chinese Fear Crumbling Lives, Not Falling Bricks

BYLINE: By KATHERINE BISHOP, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 23

 BODY:
For thousands of Chinatown residents, the violent shaking of their old brick buildings during the earthquake last October was so terrifying that three days afterward, many remained in shock or immobilized by fear.
But now, as planners move to strengthen those same unreinforced masonry buildings - brick structures lacking steel frameworks and held together only by mortar - they find that the area has an even greater fear than earthquakes: Many elderly Chinatown residents would rather live with the possibility that their buildings may fall down in future quakes than move from their tightly knit community, even temporarily, for repairs.
The fear of being displaced that is held by many of the 30,000 residents 60 and older who live in the 10-block core of Chinatown is only one of the complex problems facing this city as it tries to shape an ordinance mandating repair of the unreconstructed masonry buildings. For decades, despite the belief by seismic experts that such buildings are potential deathtraps in a strong earthquake, San Francisco has had what a city report called ''a do-nothing policy.'' But now the city is moving to act, both because it is under pressure from the state to do so and because the quake last year intensified fears about what would happen when the ''Big One'' hits. 
''No politician wants to stand up and put a dollar value on a life, and anything we do in adopting an ordinance has to do that,'' said Mary C. Comerio, an associate professor of architecture at the University of California at Berkeley and a San Francisco architect. She is advising the city on the economic and social impact of an ordinance affecting the buildings.
And experience has shown that landlords are unlikely to act before they are required to do so.
''People who own the buildings don't want to admit the problem because it costs money to retrofit,'' said Tom Hsieh, the only member of the Board of Supervisors who is of Chinese descent. ''The landlords' feeling is very simple. They don't know when the next quake will come, and they got through this one.''
 
Built for Something Else
The precarious situation of the buildings, and of the people who live there, was evident on a recent visit to a typical brick structure in Chinatown. Rickety staircases and long hallways covered in worn carpeting led to rows of 8-by-10-foot rooms that are the entire private living quarters of each resident. A communal kitchen on each floor consisted of a sink and four electric burners; other tiny rooms had toilets and bathtubs.
''Most of these units were designed for transient workers, seamen and other single men,'' said Forrest M. Gok, a spokesman for Self-Help for the Elderly, a nonprofit social service agency serving Chinatown. ''They were like dormitories - not designed for cooking, for families and certainly not for elderly ladies.''
But in fact this brick building, like others in the neighborhood, is home to elderly Chinese immigrants, about 75 percent of whom are women over 60 who do not speak English.
The tenants, speaking through a translator, were anxious to point out the large pieces of plaster lost from the ceilings in the October quake. The women, who pointed out other safety and health violations and did not give their names because of fear of retaliation from the landlord, described how they were thrown to the floor or had to hold on to the wall to keep from falling when the quake struck.
''I was afraid to run out because the stairs were shaking back and forth so hard,'' one elderly Chinese woman said.
 
Tourists Stay Away
The idea of a repair program has prompted not only concern about displacing the elderly tenants but also worries about what it would do to merchants in Chinatown who depend on tourism.
Before the quake, more than 50,000 visitors a day wandered through Chinatown in peak summer months to shop, nibble on dim sum and take pictures at the elaborate gate marking its entrance on Grant Avenue. But many businesses have been suffering since October, when tourism dropped sharply.
''There is no doubt that stopping business for just a few weeks could make them go under,'' said Rose Pak, a consultant for the Chinese Chamber of Commerce. ''Their margin of profit is very, very small. They aren't corporations that have a financial cushion that can weather it.''
 
Banned for Four Decades
There are about 2,100 privately owned unreinforced masonry buildings here - almost 10 percent of the city's total housing stock. Most were constructed before 1924, and all of them before 1952, when the city banned new ones. In the past, owners have been required to reinforce these structures only when increasing the size or changing the use of the buildings.
According to a study from the office of the city's Chief Administrative Officer, Rudolf Nothenberg, who is charged with developing recommendations regarding the ordinance, most are in danger of some degree of life-threatening collapse in a strong earthquake. The problem is not that the buildings were weakened by the last quake, but that the nature of their construction means they would be in danger in a quake that is centered here. That was not the case in October. In 1986, the state passed the Unreinforced Masonry Building Law requiring cities in areas of maximum seismic activity to make an inventory of such buildings, develop a plan for reducing the threat to life they represent and report progress to the State Seismic Safety Commission by Jan. 1, 1990. By that date, less than half the cities, including San Francisco, had complied, according to the commission.
Moreover, Edward Hensley, a spokesman for the commission, said San Francisco was lobbying hard against proposed amendments to the 1986 law. The amendments seek to impose deadlines on cities for beginning work on the buildings and requiring a level of reinforcement adopted by the City of Los Angeles nearly 10 years ago, a higher level of reinforcement than San Francisco has in mind.
''We're looking for a standard that works best for us - that controls costs and avoids displacement of tenants in Chinatown,'' said David Prowler, assistant to Mr. Nothenberg. ''We want to have the flexibility to say this is all the safety we can afford.''
 
Projecting the Bloodshed
A report by Rutherford and Chekene, a structural engineering firm commissioned by the city to study unreinforced masonry buildings says that in any 10-year period, the statistically expected earthquake losses in unreinforced masonry buildings if no strengthening is done would total 126 fatalities, 507 injuries requiring hospitalization and half a billion dollars in property loss. The minimum repair being considered for San Francisco would cut the fatalities and injuries in half. Adopting the Los Angeles plan would reduce them even further, to 22 fatalities and 88 injured.
While several proposals are under consideration, the alternative most likely to be recommended ''gives the least disruption with the least cost and the least safety,'' said William Holmes of Rutherford and Chekene.
It would involve removing sections of flooring beside the walls and driving bolts into the walls to connect them to the floor joists, preventing the floors from collapsing away from the walls in a strong quake. Mr. Holmes said the repairs could be done while tenants stay in the building. Such repairs would also be less expensive than installing structural steel and plywood shear walls, as required under the Los Angeles ordinance.
But even if the work is done in the least disruptive manner, it may take San Francisco up to 30 years to complete the task, Mr. Prowler said.
''If we don't do anything, we're looking at potential rubble,'' Mr. Gok said. ''It's impossible to do it all at once. And if we do it a little at a time, we won't have time to finish by the next quake.''

HEADLINE: In Discussion on Reducing Deficit, Bush Hears Many Voices

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
President Bush's top economic and political advisers are divided over how hard the President should press for a reduction in the budget deficit and whether he should agree to higher taxes.
Many of their views were batted around at a meeting in Vice President Dan Quayle's office last Thursday, and the discussions have continued in smaller groups almost daily.
''It's a continuum,'' said one adviser who was at the meeting, ''with Darman at one end and Ed Rollins at the other and the rest of us at different points in between.''
 
Top Advisers' Views
Richard G. Darman, the budget director, takes the position that Mr. Bush should strike a dramatic deal with Congress, even if it includes new taxes. Otherwise, in his view, the deficit will either remain so high that it will lead to higher interest rates and much less economic growth, or it will be reduced with automatic across-the-board spending cuts so large that the Government cannot function and the economy might be driven into recession. 
Edward J. Rollins, co-chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, says that with anti-communism and military strength no longer good political issues and with many Republicans on the defensive on abortion and the environment, a strong stand against higher taxes is the only big issue Republican candidates have in their favor going into this year's election.
John H. Sununu, the White House chief of staff, is said to be closer to the Rollins end of the spectrum. Michael J. Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, is near the Darman end.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady has reserved his views for his private meetings with President Bush, but he is reported to have counseled the President on the effect various measures might have on the financial markets.
The open question is where President Bush stands. His advisers, if they know, are not saying.
 
The Participants
Among the White House officials at the meeting last Thursday, in addition to Mr. Quayle, were Mr. Darman, Mr. Sununu, Andrew H. Card Jr., who is Mr. Sununu's deputy, and William Kristol, who is Mr. Quayle's chief of staff.
The outside political advisers included Mr. Rollins; Robert Teeter, the President's poll taker; Craig L. Fuller, Mr. Bush's chief of staff when he was Vice President; Mary Matalin, chief of staff of the Republican National Committee; Richard N. Bond, political director of Mr. Bush's 1988 Presidential campaign, and Kenneth M. Duberstein, a top official in the Reagan White House.
Some of those attending the meeting would not talk about it. But others, and some officials who were not present, discussed the range of views that President Bush is hearing as long as they were not quoted by name.
They said a consensus had developed on three points:
* The White House has handled the budget issue more clumsily than it has any other political issue since Mr. Bush took office.
* The political damage is not permanent, and if the President handles the situation deftly, he can turn whatever decision he makes on taxes into his political advantage.
* The President must either agree to a sweeping deal with Congress that will resolve the deficit problem at least until after the 1992 election or accept no deal at all. A halfway measure that puts off the problem until next year would be the worst of all approaches.
Many political advisers complained that Mr. Bush had not prepared the country for a budget crisis.
In his State of the Union Message on Jan. 31, the last time Mr. Bush addressed the country on prime-time television, he said of the budget that he had just submitted to Congress: ''That budget brings Federal spending under control. It meets the Gramm-Rudman target, brings that deficit down further and balances the budget by 1993 - with no new taxes.''
 
'Sense of Urgency'
Since then, the economy has, by most measures, performed better than expected. Mr. Bush has never explained the ''sense of urgency'' that he said last week in his news conference had led him to enter budget negotiations with Congress.
Even so, the advisers said, Mr. Bush could be well-placed politically. If he decides to break his pledge of ''no new taxes,'' he can portray it as a courageous move to put the economic interest of the country ahead of political interests. If, on the other hand, he decides against a tax increase, he can depict it as standing fast on principle against pressure from his staff.
At the meeting in Mr. Quayle's office, Mr. Darman painted the same picture that he has been presenting to Congressional leaders at the negotiating sessions over the last two weeks.
It is basically this: A combination of the reluctance of Congress to act on the Bush budget proposals, poor economic forecasting and the mushrooming cost of the savings and loan mess means that the $64 billion deficit limit set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget balancing law could be missed by as much as $135 billion.
The Government could not function if an across-the-board spending cut of that size went into effect in October as required by the law. President Bush cannot afford to allow the country to slide into recession. Therefore, budget negotiations with Congress are essential.

HEADLINE: Fix the Budget, Once

 BODY:
Congress would have to whack more than $100 billion off next year's deficit to meet the target under the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law. That would be three times larger than recent budget cuts and would come when the economy is limp, possibly verging on recession.
Congress doesn't have the stomach for cutting programs and raising taxes by anything like $100 billion. So instead, it will amend the budget law to make next year's cut easier. Fortunately, here's where political expediency makes economic sense. Deficits need to be reduced steadily, not in a rush, and certainly not by risking cruel increases in unemployment. The important point is for Congress to fix the budget law permanently. That requires three principal reforms:
Remove the S & L bailout from Gramm-Rudman. The 1985 budget law was intended to keep huge Federal deficits from siphoning capital away from corporate investment. But Federal borrowing to pay off depositors at failed thrifts poses no such threat. These depositors are no more likely to spend the money they receive from the Government than they were to spend their original deposit. So the money will stay put in the capital market. The S & L bailout never belonged in the Gramm-Rudman calculation and can be safely removed. 
Revise the accounting period. Congress has evaded the full impact of the budget targets by shifting nominal expenditures and revenues back and forth between accounting periods. There are many ways to stop this deception. There is a related need to extend the budget-cutting horizon beyond one year. That way Congress can legislate long-term program reductions, which may produce only minor savings now. This is especially important for military hardware.
Revise the budget target. Because the economy has enjoyed steady growth since the 1985 budget law was passed, a fatal flaw has not surfaced until now. During economic slowdowns, taxes fall and the deficit rises. As currently written, the Gramm-Rudman law could, at the worst moment, force a round of tax hikes and spending cuts that could accelerate a downturn into a disaster.
The remedy is to redefine the target in terms of a hypothetical deficit: the deficit that spending and tax programs would cause if the economy were operating near full employment. Written in this way, an economic slowdown would not affect the redefined target and Congress would not be forced to stifle an already sluggish economy.
The country needs a long-term commitment to steady deficit reduction. That requires manageable hits of, say, $30 billion a year. More deficit reduction in order to fit a poorly conceived budgetary straitjacket is a suicidal formula. Gramm-Rudman needs to be changed. Once, and for all.

HEADLINE: Folly to Scrap Plan to Improve J.F.K. Airport

 BODY:
To the Editor:
To this layman's mind, it seems a bit bizarre to scratch the central features of the Port Authority's improvements at Kennedy Airport (news article, May 11), rather akin to ceasing construction of the Second Avenue subway during the economic crunch of the mid-70's.
If 30 million passengers used the facility this year, how much more congestion will be in evidence in a decade with antiquated services dating from 1952, before the age of jet travel? Air travel is here to stay; this week we read, for example, two articles on the new generation of projected supersonic transport planes. Will their clients suffer J.F.K.?
Stephen Berger, executive director of the Port Authority, is correct in assessing the shortsightedness of the airlines. Already traffic is shifting to Newark, with S.A.S., Lufthansa, Air France, Continental and others offering many nonstop international destinations. The need of travelers to escape the delays at J.F.K. is already making peripheral airports like Long Island's MacArthur and Westchester - to say nothing of far-flung Philadelphia and Hartford - boom.
Far lesser cities than New York have financed airports with good design, comfort and access to mass transit: Cleveland, Toronto, Miami, Dallas, Washington, Atlanta, to name a few; and Amsterdam and London, notably, and many others abroad. In a city that sees itself as the center of the universe, J.F.K. is an embarrassment. Why talk of an airport more than 60 miles upstate at Stewart when New York City itself is the market?

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
The High-Tech Future

BYLINE: By Tom Wicker

 BODY:
Early in April, the Pentagon quietly diverted to other purposes $20 million of $30 million allocated by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency to high-definition television.
About two weeks later, not so quietly, the Defense Department assigned Dr. Craig Fields, the director of Darpa, to another defense position.
Still later, Michael Sekora, the physicist who had directed the Defense Intelligence Agency's ''Project Socrates'' - which monitors the advanced technologies of U.S. economic competitors - announced that he had resigned.
He quit to protest reductions in the Bush Administration's support for compiling an accurate data base on foreign technologies, with the aim of aiding U.S. high-technology efforts -those of the military and the private sector. 
Dr. Fields's reassignment was labeled routine by the Pentagon, but in fact resulted from his efforts to direct Government funds into research aiding the competitive position of the nation's commerce and industry, as well as improving its military strength.
That approach, called ''industrial policy,'' was symbolized by the commitment of Darpa funds to the development of high-definition television (HDTV). But ''industrial policy'' is opposed by Richard Darman, director of the Office of Management and Budget, Michael Boskin, chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, and John Sununu, President Bush's chief of staff - hence by the Bush Administration. Last year Mr. Sununu rebuked Robert Mosbacher, the Secretary of Commerce, for trying to promote HDTV research.
Dr. Fields's ouster may have been precipitated by a $4 million Darpa investment in a radiation-resistant substitute for silicon called gallium arsenide, on terms allowing Darpa a share of the financial return. But the controversy over HDTV, which has many highly placed supporters in industry and Congress, is more typical of the continuing dispute over ''industrial policy.''
HDTV would replace the 525 horizontal lines of current television receivers with 1,000 to 1,250 lines, resulting in a sharper visual image. Apart from its commercial potential for home TV sets, supporters claim important military applications - for example, flat-panel screens for improved information displays in tanks and aircraft. A Pentagon advisory board recently urged that HDTV research funds be increased to $100 million yearly for the next five years; the Congressional Office of Technology Assessment is preparing a report citing HDTV as vital to the U.S. position in the world electronics market.
Critics, however, contend that pressures for Government support of HDTV come mainly from the American Electronics Association. They question the importance of HDTV's military uses, and claim that its widespread commercial use would require new TV sets in every home, new television broadcast and transmission equipment, therefore huge new investments by consumers and broadcasters for a relatively minor improvement in clarity and reception.
HDTV research, moreover, already is far advanced in Japan, where more than $700 million has been spent on development. Critics insist it's too late and would cost too much for the U.S. to match that effort. Darpa's $30 million would have been wasted, in this view, which holds that U.S. military needs for HDTV are not important enough to justify a catch-up investment.
Even if accurate as to the specific importance of HDTV, this misses the point that the research Craig Fields wanted to sponsor, for which the Administration fired him, may be important to the survival of the U.S. electronics industry - which is vital to American military strength, even if HDTV may not be. By one estimate, half the total cost of new Army weapons by the year 2000 will be for electronics.
Perhaps even more important, high-technology industries will bear the main burden of future American economic competitiveness - on which national prosperity largely depends. For that reason, the M.I.T. Commission on Industrial Productivity concluded, the Government ''should launch new R&D programs directed toward improving manufacturing, product development, and process engineering'' - particularly those ''that can be anticipated to have benefits both for the military and the commercial sector.''
The Administration seems instead to be limiting research support ''solely to technologies with military applications,'' as a recent Congressional statement charged. That suggests a second article.

HEADLINE: 80 Held in Fight At Building Site In Hunts Point

BYLINE: By GEORGE JAMES

 BODY:
Eighty people were arrested yesterday afternoon after two groups seeking construction jobs fought at the site of a new police station house in the Bronx and turned on the police when officers arrived, the authorities said.
More than 100 members of the groups, the Black and Latino Economic Survival and the United Hispanic Coalition, fought with construction materials like steel reinforcing rods, chunks of concrete and two-by-fours.
They turned on about 60 officers from the 41st Precinct and nearby precincts who responded to the dispute at Bruckner Boulevard and Longwood Avenue in the Hunts Point section, a police spokesman, Sgt. Nicholas Vreeland, said. 
Two officers suffered minor injuries from thrown debris, he said. ''It was basically a battle over turf,'' Sergeant Vreeland said.
 
'Or There'll Be Trouble'
The major-case squad of the Police Department is investigating the groups for possible extortion.
Sergeant Vreeland said the groups had gone to construction sites in recent years threatening contractors who did not provide jobs to their members.
''What they do is tell them, 'We want X number of jobs for our people at this site or there'll be trouble,' '' Sergeant Vreeland said. ''In this particular case, both of these groups were at the same location looking for jobs and a fight broke out between them.''
Efforts to reach members of both groups for comment last night were unsuccessful.
Two patrol cars responded first to the site, where the new 41st Precinct station house is being built. On seeing the number of people fighting, the officers called for assistance.
 
Two Officers Hit
''As cops arrived at the scene, the two groups began throwing things at the officers, the things they had been fighting each other with,'' Sergeant Vreeland said.
A brick hit a sergeant's leg, and an officer was hit ''with some type of debris,'' Sergeant Vreeland said, Neither officer was identified.
The 80 people linked to Black and Latino Economic Survival were arrested as they tried to flee on two school buses that had taken them to the scene, the sergeant added. Members of the other group fled.
The suspects were charged last night with first-degree riot and assault.

Students in seven Camden public schools may be trading in their sneakers and jeans next year for blue-and-white uniforms in an effort to relieve fashion pressure in the economically depressed district.
The Camden Board of Education unanimously voted on Monday to give parents and students the option to decide whether the students should wear uniforms. The program will begin with the new school year in September at two middle schools and five elementary schools. 
Because the district is not paying for the uniforms, which cost about $50, the district cannot institute a mandatory uniform dress code, school board officials said.
A Woodrow Wilson High School student, one of two students on the board, was skeptical about the program.
''I believe that most of the students in high school and middle school will be against the idea,'' said Richard Horton, who is 16 years old. ''They want freedom to wear their Adidas and their Troop jackets, their $120 sneaks and their $60 sweatshirts.''
Edward Taylor, a school psychologist for the district, said the optional program would help ''take away the competition for dress among students and allow them to concentrate more on their work.''
Olive Smith, district director of Special Services, said the uniform option would decrease attacks in which students have been robbed of their sneakers and jackets. Such attacks have occurred in several American cities, and a number of school districts have adopted programs under which students can wear uniforms if they choose.
Mary Arnold Frazier, assistant superintendent, said more than 90 percent of parents responding to a district survey were in favor of uniforms.
Girls in elementary schools will wear navy blue jumpers, knee socks and white blouses. Girls in middle schools will wear a similar uniform, but the jumper will be replaced with a navy blue pleated skirt and vest.
Boys at both levels will wear white shirts and navy blue socks, cardigan sweaters and pants. All of the children will wear dark shoes and bow ties in their school colors.

HEADLINE: Screen Writer Turns to the Novel To Tell of Race and Class in London

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
''The real problem when I was growing up was that racism just wasn't a topic of understanding in England,'' Hanif Kureishi was saying on a recent afternoon. ''If I'd been a black growing up in Detroit, say, there would have been a structure for me to comprehend: the institution of slavery and the history of segregation. But in England, there was no wider understanding of racism. You felt it was your own personal psychological problem.''
Mr. Kureishi, who lives in London, is best known in America as the screenwriter of the Stephen Frears-directed films ''My Beautiful Laundrette'' and ''Sammy and Rosie Get Laid,'' vivid servings of British Asian life that opened the surprising, and hitherto obscure, world of London's Indian and Pakistani immigrant cultures to public scrutiny. The films seemed to offend not only those in England who dislike immigrants, but also some members of England's Asian communities.
Now Mr. Kureishi has returned to the themes of race and class in contemporary London in his first novel, ''The Buddha of Suburbia'' (Viking, $18.95), which has been on best-seller lists in England since it was published there six weeks ago. Since its American debut this month, the book has been critically praised in many newspapers and magazines. 
The writer has skewered practically every target in sight in ''Buddha,'' including suburban social climbers, artistic poseurs, upper-class intellectual twits, Rolls-Royce liberals, scabrous working-class heroes and, once again, England's Asian and black immigrants.
 
A Proto-Punk Romp
''Buddha'' is the oft-raunchy tale of Karim Amir, child of an Indian father and an English mother, who comes of age in Orpington, a London suburb, during the cultural aftershocks of the seismic 60's. Karim moves to London to romp through the proto-punk scene of the 70's - and, not insignificantly, through many a bedroom - until he makes his fortune as an actor.
Mr. Kureishi's screenplays brought him attention, and bought him enough time to work on ''Buddha,'' but ''writing a novel, you really expose yourself,'' Mr. Kureishi said.
''You can't hang back,'' he said. ''It's all there to see. A novel is much more internal, and certainly, writing a first-person novel -it's an act of exposure.''
The 35-year-old Mr. Kureishi was passing through New York on his two-week book tour, traveling light, wearing jeans, black shirt, and a vest emblazoned with a cheerfully lurid icon of Elvis Presley. Lithe and laid-back, Mr. Kureishi spoke quietly and was slow to smile. When he did, his enigmatic eyes and long dark hair gave his expression a startling Mona Lisa quality.
Mr. Kureishi has something of a reputation in London as a scene-maker and dedicated hanger-outer, but, he said, ''you need to live a boring life to be a writer.''
''An idea takes a long time to grow and develop,'' he added. ''You need such discipline and concentration to do a book.'' It took him nearly two years to complete ''Buddha.''
 
'Autobiographical in Some Ways'
Like his fictional protagonist, Mr. Kureishi is the child of an Indian father and an English mother - he grew up in suburban Bromley - and began his own assault on cultural London in the 1970's. In consequence, he is spending much of his time these days fielding questions about just how much of his life is in ''Buddha.''
''Certainly the book is autobiographical in some ways,'' he said. ''That's so obvious. But the relationship between your own life and your writing is very complex. It's hard to realize, yourself, how you've transformed part of yourself into the characters you create.''
His book has occasioned something of a guessing game back home: pin-the-Londoner on the fictional ''Buddha'' character. ''There are two basic reactions,'' Mr. Kureishi said. ''There are those who hate you because they think you put them in the book, and there are those who hate you because they think you didn't put them in the book.''
At least one character has a real-life counterpart: one of Mr. Kureishi's grade-school mates, Bill Broad, became the punk-rocker Billy Idol. A character in ''Buddha,'' Charlie Hero, is partly based on the rocker, ''although I haven't seen him since I was 16,'' Mr. Kureishi said. ''But with all these characters, you create them by taking one person's nose and adding it to another person's hands and another one's feet, and you mix them all up.''
The book's portrait of English racism is autobiographical enough. Young Hanif was the only Asian in his school at the time when ''Paki bashing'' became a vicious pastime for some alienated punks and skinheads.
 
Target of Spitting and Kicking
''One teacher called me 'Pakistani Pete,' something that no teacher would get away with today,'' Mr. Kureishi said. ''Kids I'd known since the age of 5 began spitting at me and kicking me around.''
Unlike his schoolmates, most of whom grew up to be mechanics or laborers, Mr. Kureishi attended King's College in London, began an apprenticeship in London theaters and became a playwright. He won acceptance in theatrical England ''because they liked me,'' Mr. Kureishi said. ''They liked me because I was Indian, and lower-middle-class. That was chic. And I was pretty - then.''
Although he feels that racism is less virulent in England these days, Mr. Kureishi maintained that ''Britain doesn't yet have a vision of itself as a mixed place.'' He explained: ''The feeling is that blacks and Asians were invited to Britain to work, but maybe they'll somehow go back again. Britain still hasn't re-cast itself as a multi-racial, multi-cultural society.''
These days, does Mr. Kureishi think of himself as Indian, English or neither? ''I think of myself as a British writer,'' he said, adding that this is not, perhaps, the way Britain thinks of him.
''Literature there is still in the hand of the old boys,'' he said. ''There are all of these new immigrant experiences in Britain that haven't been touched yet.''
After ''Laundrette'' and ''Sammy and Rosie'' appeared, he received hate mail and threats from Asians in England who objected to his characterizations of immigrant culture.
 
Anger Over Sexual Content
The motivation for some of this anger involved the sexual content of his work, Mr. Kureishi said. In ''Laundrette'' the central characters, Omar and Johnny, were gay. Two of Mr. Kureishi's characters in ''Sammy and Rosie'' had an open marriage, and in ''Buddha,'' the protagonist, Karim Amir, is happily, even energetically, bisexual.
Mr. Kureishi said the biggest protests against ''Laundrette'' occurred not in England but in New York City, in 1986, when the film was picketed by the Pakistan Action Committee. ''People think you're supposed to show them exclusively as strong, truthful and beautiful,'' he said. ''It's just exactly what Philip Roth went through.''
''Looking back on it, I can see in it the seeds of the Rushdie situation,'' he said. Mr. Kureishi was one of the first English writers to speak in support of Salman Rushdie after Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini of Iran denounced his novel ''The Satanic Verses'' as blasphemous and called for the author's death. Mr. Kureishi said he had known Mr. Rushdie ''for a very long time, since his family was an old friend of our family in India.''
''It was devastating for him, for all of us,'' said Mr. Kureishi. ''We thought that the community would be proud of Rushdie as someone who has used his position as a famous writer to talk about racism, colonialism and unemployment. But to see them turn round on him, to see 16-year-olds say they want to murder him with their own hands - it was appalling.''
Mr. Kureishi said that Mr. Rushdie had come to terms with his situation, and was ''writing quite a lot.'' Has he seen him recently? ''I can't answer that question,'' he said.

HEADLINE: One Goal Unmet as Clausen Retires From BankAmerica

BYLINE: By ANDREW POLLACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN FRANCISCO, May 23

 BODY:
Sometime Thursday afternoon at the BankAmerica Corporation's annual meeting here, A. W. Clausen, the chairman and chief executive, will hand over the gavel of leadership to Richard M. Rosenberg, ending an era - or more correctly two eras - at the nation's third-largest banking company.
Mr. Clausen, who is 67 years old, ran BankAmerica in the 1970's before leaving in 1981, then came back to rescue the bank from near failure in the late 1980's.
But even as he retires with BankAmerica restored to health, Mr. Clausen seems to harbor one more aim - making the San Francisco banking company a global power, as it was when he left the first time.
''I see the bank continuing to be an international player, in contrast to some other banks that are circling their wagons and pulling out of the international scene,'' Mr. Clausen said in an interview on Tuesday. 
To recover from the huge loan problems of the 1980's, BankAmerica had to sell off many businesses, including its bank in Italy and other foreign operations, and to narrow its focus to retail banking in California. Indeed, the new chief executive, Mr. Rosenberg, has spent most of his career as a California retail banker at the Wells Fargo Bank.
But Mr. Clausen's retirement is less than total. He will be chairman of the executive committee of BankAmerica's board and will head a new committee of outside experts that will advise the company on international matters.
Mr. Clausen, who is called Tom after a role in a high school play, said he was eager to increase BankAmerica's European participation, in the West and East, where he visited in March. Although he does not see BankAmerica or other American banks lending directly to Eastern European nations, he said, ''as good commercial banks, we will follow our customers,'' and finance projects by American and other Western companies in Eastern Europe.
Such an international focus is not surprising. In 1981, when he left BankAmerica, Mr. Clausen became the head of the World Bank until he retired in 1986. He has favored maintaining loans to developing countries, while some banks are getting out of that area.
BankAmerica's reserves total 54 percent of its loans to developing nations. Raising the reserves would substantially cut into the company's profits, and Mr. Clausen said he did not think that would be needed. ''I don't see us having to go to 75 or 80 percent,'' he said. ''Neither do the regulators.''
Mr. Clausen was drafted to return to BankAmerica in October 1986, replacing his chosen successor, Samuel H. Armacost. At that time the banking company was the subject of a hostile takeover bid from First Interstate Bancorp and was drowning in loan losses. Mr. Clausen fought off First Interstate and nurtured BankAmerica back to health by cutting jobs, selling off businesses to raise cash and revamping management.
Often described as autocratic, Mr. Clausen, who calls himself ''a workaholic,'' said he never lost hope that BankAmerica could be turned around. ''I was pretty discouraged to begin with,'' he added. ''Things appeared to me to be a lot worse than I had hoped for.''
BankAmerica, which recorded more than $1 billion in profits last year, is ''within shouting distance of being an excellent bank,'' he said, with profits, expense contols and capital levels adequate.
''There's still a little bit to fix around here,'' he cautioned. In particular, he said, he would like to see BankAmerica's credit ratings raised and the level of nonperforming assets lowered.
Mr. Clausen said BankAmerica was interested in expanding into more states. Many analysts think the company would be interested in buying its old foe, First Interstate, which is now considered a takeover candidate and has banks in most Western states. When asked about this, however, he replied, ''No, we have no plans, no discussions and no intentions.''
Although the bank prospered under Mr. Clausen in the 1970's, some critics have said that aggressive lending in that decade and the failure to invest adequately in new electronic technology planted the seeds for the problems that arose after Mr. Clausen left. Similarly, it has been said, some of the elements for the recovery had already been started by the time Mr. Clausen returned.
 
Stands on Record
Mr. Clausen angrily denounced such criticisms as ''catcalls one gets along the way from all those ignoramuses.'' He said he would stand on his record of having presided over the bank twice when it performed well.
Besides his continued association with BankAmerica, Mr. Clausen plans to spend time working on Bay Area regional planning issues and for the United Way, but he does not see taking another full-time job.
''I'm a seasoned hand at retiring,'' Mr. Clausen quipped. ''This will be the third time I'm retiring as a C.E.O.'' He added, ''There won't be a fourth time.''

HEADLINE: Vehicle Sales Fell by 17.5% In Mid-May

BYLINE: By PAUL C. JUDGE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 23

 BODY:
Despite fairly aggressive incentives, sales of American-made cars and light trucks fell by 17.5 percent in mid-May, disappointing analysts and dealers who expect higher sales in the spring.
The 10 domestic manufacturers today reported car sales totaling 162,018 for the middle of the month, an 18.6 percent decline from the comparable period a year ago.
Cars sold at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 6 million during the period, one of the lowest selling rates so far this year. That compares with an annual rate of 7.2 million for the period last year, and with 6.7 million for the last 30 days. 
 
Eight Selling Days
Eight selling days were in this period, compared with nine in last year's period.
The sales of light trucks and mini-vans, which normally account for about a third of all new-vehicle sales, fell by 15.7 percent, to 98,092.
''This is the spring selling season, and we expected some good numbers by now,'' said Edward A. Sullivan, a vice president of the WEFA Group, an economic forecasting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa. ''The only way to read the continuing slump is that the underlying market for new cars has eroded.''
The spring sales season, usually from April to mid-June, is historically the most important selling period for American auto makers.
All of the large American auto makers reported declines of more than 20 percent in car sales, with the Ford Motor Company reporting a drop of nearly 30 percent.
As a group, car sales by the Big Three fell by 25.6 percent, while those by Japanese companies with factories in the United States - transplants - rose by 61.5 percent in the period, compared with last year.
Several automobile dealers said today that they believed the underlying economy was sound, and attributed a shortage of new-car buyers to the recent trend of lenders offering longer payback periods on loans.
''There are a lot of people out there who still owe too much money on their cars to consider trading it in,'' said Mark Brobeck, general manager of Ricart Ford in Columbus, Ohio. ''The trading cycle is getting longer with customers than it used to be.''
Other analysts said lower sales were tied to worsening consumer confidence and concerns that inflation, in particular, might increase.
''People are are more concerned about the next 12 months or so as far as their economic situation goes than they were this time last year,'' said Michael M. Luckey, the president of the Luckey Consulting Group Inc. in Cresskill, N.J.
''Nobody here has a simple explanation'' for the low sales rates, said Joel H. Pitcoff, a market analyst for Ford. ''My best guess is that a combination of factors are at work, including widespread speculation that interest rates will come down soon,'' causing some potential buyers to postpone purchases.
Ford experienced the biggest sales decline in mid-May, as its car sales plunged by 29.9 percent, to 42,703. The sales of Ford's light trucks fell by 12 percent, to 34,864.
 
G.M. Sales Off 23.7%
The General Motors Corporation's car sales declined by 23.7 percent, to 72,566. G.M.'s light-truck sales were off by 17.6 percent, to 39,359.
The Chrysler Corporation posted a 22.1 percent drop in its car sales, to 21,047. The sales of Chrysler's light trucks and mini-vans fell by 21 percent, to 21,325.
Responding to the sharp decline in sales of its mini-vans, Chrysler this week gave dealers a $500 incentive on them. While the incentive is designed to spur new orders, the discount could get passed on to customers.
The Honda Motor Company reported a 22.4 percent gain in the sales of its American-made cars, to 11,076. The Mazda Motor Corporation's car sales rose by 45.9 percent, to 1,272.
The sales of cars made by the Toyota Motor Corporation more than doubled, to 8,820, while the Mitsubishi Motors Corporation posted a gain of 51.8 percent in its car sales, to 1,154. Both companies have added substantial new production capacity to their American plants.
Isuzu Motors Ltd. reported sales of 100 cars in mid-May, from the plant is operates with Fuji Heavy Industries in West Lafayette, Ind. Subaru of America Inc., the distributor of Fuji-built cars in the United States, reported that it sold 373 cars produced at the same plant.
The Nissan Motor Company posted a 63 percent increase in its car sales, to 1,907, and those of its light trucks rose by 30.3 percent, to 2,544.

After Long Fight, Pepsi Enters India

BYLINE: By Barbara Crossette

DATELINE: NEW DELHI

 BODY:
IT took half a decade of negotiating, 20 debates in Parliament and a monumental public relations campaign. But last night, in the silver wine coolers of a luxury hotel, Pepsi-Cola came to India.
Well, not exactly Pepsi-Cola. It is called Lehar Pepsi here, a concession to the anti-foreign lobby. And it will not appear in all of India at first: just Jaipur, Kanpur, Bangalore and Punjab state. Plans are to have Pepsi in the larger cities, like Delhi, Bombay and Calcutta, later this year. 
Nevertheless, Pepsico Inc. and its Indian joint-venture partners are jubilant. No major American soft drink has been allowed in the Indian market since Coca-Cola was forced out in a fit of nationalism in 1977 after it refused to divulge its ingredients and reduce its ownership in its Indian venture.
Christopher Sinclair, the president of Pepsi-Cola International, who was on hand last night when the first lids popped at a news conference, called his company's venture in India ''an historic agreement.''
Because of the agreement, the company called on the Bush Administration not to impose trade sanctions on India under the ''super 301'' provisions of American trade law. The company sent a letter to Carla A. Hills, the United States trade representative, saying, ''Given the progress of the Pepsi project, and what we believe it portends for future U.S.-India business initiatives, we hope that our Government will not have to take any actions under the super 301 process.''
Pepsico's move into the Indian market, in which three billion bottles of brand-name soft drinks are sold annually, was made possible by the company's willingness to take a 39.9 percent share in a conglomerate called Pepsi Foods Private Limited. Its co-owners are Punjab Agro Industries, a Punjab state company, and the Voltas subsidiary of the giant Tata Group.
Pepsico and its partners, hoping to sell not only Pepsi but also 7-Up and Miranda orange drink in India, agreed to set up fruit and vegetable processing plants, agriculture research stations, franchised bottling operations and snack-food factories using local potatoes and other ingredients. Pepsico said it plans to invest more than $1 billion in India in the next 10 years. The company's first plants have been built in northern Punjab state, where unemployment among well-educated youths has helped fuel a separatist movement.
Pepsico snack foods - potato chips and Cheetoswith Indian seasonings - were introduced earlier this year, but soft-drink production was delayed, partly because of the time it took to bring bottling operations up to international standards and partly because at the last minute the name of the soft drinks had to be changed.
Pepsi Foods Private had planned to call its flagship drink Pepsi Era, but opponents challenged the name under a law, mostly honored in the breach, that forbids foreign names for Indian products. Lehar Pepsi, which means Pepsi Wave, was the compromise. But by then, permanently labeled bottles had to be scrapped and new ones made at a cost exceeding $1 million.
The battle may not be over. Local soft-drink manufacturers are threatening to make Lehar Pepsi disappear from the shelves. Company officials say they are not worried and are confident that there can be no successful campaign of sabotage against the drinks through the illegal use of Pepsi bottles.
Although Pepsico has more than 700 bottling operations overseas, including successful plants in China and the Soviet Union, the psychological barriers in India have been unique.
In a country fiercely protective of local industry, Indian soft-drink manufacturers have built strong political lobbies to fend off foreign challenges. Since a new Government came to power in India in December, the local bottlers have waged a campaign for the reversal of the Pepsico agreement, which was finally approved in 1988.
But the Government of Prime Minister V. P. Singh resisted, apparently deciding that it would be a bad precedent to upset a contract that took so long to negotiate.
A new application from Coca-Cola, however, was rejected in March. The only other soft drink here that might be considered American is Double Cola, which is selling in limited areas of India and is owned by Indians who live in the United States.
Lehar Pepsi and its related brands, Lehar 7-Up and Lehar Miranda, got an unexpected assist when the Government decided in April to begin enforcing a two-year-old ban on the use of brominated vegetable oil. The substance, which is used to prevent the separation of ingredients in fruit-flavored drinks, is reported to be carcinogenic.
Indian consumer groups say that more than 120 countries have banned the oil, and the groups are pressing the Government to impose a ban here. Brominated vegetable oils have never been used in Pepsico drinks, Mr. Sinclair said at a news conference last evening.

HEADLINE: Boeing and McDonnell Joining Concorde Study

BYLINE: By RICHARD W. STEVENSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES, May 23

 BODY:
The nation's two major commercial aircraft manufacturers, the Boeing Company and the McDonnell Douglas Corporation, said today that they would join with the major European plane makers to study the feasibility of developing a new generation of supersonic airliners.
Boeing and McDonnell Douglas, which have researched supersonic planes on their own for decades, said they would participate in a ''study group'' formed by British Aerospace P.L.C. and Societe Nationale Industrielle Aerospatiale of France.
The British and French companies, which manufactured the supersonic airliner Concorde, announced plans earlier this month for a faster, more fuel-efficient ''Son of Concorde'' that could travel greater distances - Europe to Japan, for example - and invited participation by other nations. The study group will also include Deutsche Airbus, West Germany's leading builder of airliners and a subsidiary of Daimler-Benz. $10 Billion to Develop the Plane British Aerospace and Aerospatiale have estimated that it could cost $10 billion to develop the plane. The willingness of the major European and American commercial aircraft manufacturers to participate in the study underscores the high risks involved with assuming such huge costs. 
''Any program would be of a significant size, certainly beyond our means to go it alone,'' said Donald Graf, who heads McDonnell Douglas's research into supersonic aircraft.
The group said in a statement that it would look into a variety of issues over the next year, ''including global environmental concerns and expected high program investment and risk levels.''
The group said it would examine the probable level of demand for a new supersonic plane from airlines and would assess the compatability of its members in working together.
 
Environmental Concerns
McDonnell Douglas and Boeing have long expressed interest in building a supersonic airliner. Boeing even started building a prototype during the late 1960's, but abandoned it, largely because of concern about the noise it would make on takeoff and the sonic boom that would reverberate to earth when the plane passed overhead at speeds greater than the speed of sound, roughly 750 miles an hour.
Analysts say it remains unclear whether any supersonic airliner can be commercially viable. The Concorde cost $2 billion to develop and required heavy subsidies from the British and French governments. The manufacturers hoped to sell hundreds of the plane, but ended up selling only 14, seven to British Airways and seven to Air France.
Commercial supersonic flight has always been hampered by a variety of environmental and economic concerns. Because of the sonic boom, the Concorde's routes have been largely limited to those that take it primarily over the Atlantic Ocean. Environmentalists say the release of combustion gases from supersonic engines can harm the ozone layer. The current Concorde cannot carry enough fuel to fly from Europe or North America to the Far East, one of the most rapidly expanding airline markets.

HEADLINE: Loan Plan Set Up for McDonald's

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
The hamburger may seem like an unlikely subject for high finance, but the business of selling America's favorite sandwich is the heart of a new financing arrangement announced yesterday by the Chemical Banking Corporation.
The new program offers a way for buyers or owners of McDonald's Corporation franchises to borrow at lower interest rates than they customarily pay for a bank loan. Chemical, and its subsidiary Texas Commerce Bank, will earn fees by handling the finances of a new company whose sole purpose is to make the lower-cost loans. 
The new company, known as Golden Mac, can afford to lend money at a lower interest rate than banks because it borrows money at a low cost in the commercial paper market. Borrowers of Golden Mac rely on sales of hamburgers and other fast food to repay their Golden Mac loans.
 
'A Better Offer'
''We will continue to make bank loans to franchisees who want something special, but for the plain, straight-forward situations, this is a better offer,'' said Lee E. Osborne, senior vice president at Texas Commerce.
Golden Mac, whose full name is Golden Managers Acceptance Corporation, expects to sell commercial paper through Chemcial Securities Inc. at very close to the rate paid by top-quality companies, or about 8.20 percent currently. After adding 1.5 percentage points or 1.75 percentage points to cover various costs, its loan rate to franchisees in the current market would be 9.70 percent or 9.95 percent, depending on the quality of the borrower. Good-quality franchisees typically pay a bank loan rate of the prime rate plus half a percentage point, or 10.50 percent currently.
Franchisees will borrow for seven years at a floating interest rate, which is guaranteed not to rise more than 2.5 percentage points above the initial loan rate for the first three years.
If franchisees default on their loans, investors in the commercial paper would be paid from a letter of credit issued by Credit Lyonnais, which is good for up to 7.5 percent of the commercial paper outstanding.
The initial $125 million limit on Golden Mac's financing will account for less than 10 percent of the $1.5 billion outstanding loans of McDonald's 8,500 American franchisees. Bankers said franchisees borrow over $100 million annually.
 
Similar Programs
Peter A. Sterling, vice president at the Bank of Boston, one of the leading bank lenders to McDonald's and its franchisees for more than 25 years, noted that in early May, the bank began offering McDonald's franchisees a new bank loan program with interest rates ''very competitive'' with rates offered by Golden Mac.
The Golden Mac financing is similar to other bank-sponsored programs that offer lower-rate financing to bank customers who in an earlier era might have borrowed directly from the bank.
Earlier this month, Mellon Bank of Pittsburgh announced the creation of the Three Rivers Funding Corporation, which will buy various kinds of receivables from Mellon's corporate customers. Three Rivers will pay for its purchases with funds raised by selling commercial paper through Merrill Lynch Money Markets Inc.

HEADLINE: FINANCE/NEW ISSUES;
$224 Million Bond Offering Priced by Battery Park City

 BODY:
The Battery Park City Authority yesterday priced a $224 million offering of revenue bonds.
The issue raised hackles earlier this year because $150 million of the proceeds are to be used to help close New York City's budget gap in the current fiscal year. Previous borrowings by the authority, a state agency that oversees development on landfill in lower Manhattan, had been used to finance projects in the Battery Park City area.
Special legislation was passed in Albany earlier this year that enabled the proceeds of yesterday's bond sale to pass directly to New York City.
The bond offering, which is a one-time event, prompted former Mayor Edward I. Koch in March to criticize Felix G. Rohatyn, one of Mayor David N. Dinkins's economic advisers, for not attacking the offering.
Battery Park City revenues are usually split between the city and the state, with the city receiving the bulk.
Yesterday's issue consists of serial and term bonds. Maturities on the serial bonds range from 1998 to 2001. Coupons on the bonds, which were priced at 100, range from 7.10 percent on bonds maturing in 1998 to 7.35 percent on bonds that mature in 2001.
About 40 percent of the issue - $92 million - consists of term bonds that will mature in 2015. Those bonds, which carry a coupon of 7.70 percent, were priced to yield 7.80 percent.
Morgan Stanley & Company acted as lead managers for the negotiated deal, which is rated A by Moody's Investors Service Inc. and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.

HEADLINE: Seidman Sees Higher Cost For Earlier Savings Bailouts

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 23

 BODY:
Even as the Government was acknowledging the escalating estimates for future savings and loan failures, the cost of past failures was seen to be rising as well.
L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told Congress today that falling real estate values and rising interest rates have increased by $12 billion the cost of Government assistance to the more than 200 savings and loan associations that failed before the savings industry bailout was approved by Congress last year. He put the figure now at $65 billion over 10 years.
Among the institutions are those sold by Federal regulators in the waning days of 1988 - the ''December deals'' criticized in Congress as giveaways because of their generous tax benefits and financial assistance agreements. 
The group also includes some 87 Texas savings institutions that were sold as part of the Government's Southwest plan.
 
'Far Larger Problem'
Though the costs of the 202 assistance agreements are not counted in the cost of the bailout, they are a precursor of the increased costs that the Government may face as it begins to liquidate or sell hundreds of failed savings units in the years ahead.
''What we've discoverd is that this is a far larger problem than anyone thought at the time,'' Mr. Seidman said. ''We thought we were looking at a golf ball and it was a basketball instead.''
He pointed specificially to rising interest rates, which have increased the Government guarantees to buyers of troubled loan portfolios, and to a depressed real estate market that has further weakened the value of the savings institutions' assets.
The deals before 1989, which were made by the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation, were intended to protect depositors of insolvent savings institutions by transferring their ownership to new buyers. At that time, the savings industry's insurer lacked the money to close down insolvent savings units and pay off depositors.
To entice buyers to put new capital into the failed institutions and protect deposit obligations, Federal regulators provided a number of financial benefits.
The deals differed greatly, but among the benefits were tax breaks, direct infusions of cash or debt securities, and ''yield maintenance'' agreements, in which the Government protected new buyers from losses on loan portfolios. The theory behind this arrangement was that buyers could be induced to assume some of the Government's obligations if they were given some protections against financial risk.
 
Some Well-Known Buyers
Buyers of these deals included such well-known financiers as Ronald O. Perelman, chief executive of Revlon Inc., and the Texas billionaire Robert M. Bass.
The 1990 cost of the deals was initially expected to be about $1.8 billion, but that has jumped to $5.2 billion. The total cost of the assistance arrangements, which will run for 10 years, is now expected to be about $12 billion higher than initial estimates.
But a spokesman for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation noted today that the $65 billion in anticipated Government payments will be offset by some $10 billion that has come to the Government from asset sales from these deals.
In his testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee, Mr. Seidman requested $5.2 billion in 1990 and an additional $4 billion in 1991.
The escalating costs of the program led Senator Barbara A. Mikulski to question Mr. Seidman's request for an indefinite appropriation to cover these costs. ''This is a whopper of an underestimate,'' the Maryland Democrat said of the request for additional money. ''I'm concerned about writing a blank check. We will meet our obligations, but we also want fiscal responsibility.''
Mr. Seidman said he favored an indefinite appropriation because the Government was obligated to protect depositors' money.

HEADLINE: DINKINS PROPOSES INCREASES IN TAXES IN HIS FIRST BUDGET

BYLINE: By TODD S. PURDUM

 BODY:
Striving to put his stamp on New York City's spending in tough times, Mayor David N. Dinkins yesterday proposed a restrained budget calling for nearly $1 billion in new taxes, deep cuts in services from street cleaning to school aides and a few modest new social and health programs.
In the face of a regional economic slowdown, huge revenue shortfalls and unexpected increases in fixed costs, Mr. Dinkins conceded that his $28 billion budget for the fiscal year that starts July 1 - his first as Mayor -was ''sure to cause more grimaces than grins.''
But even as he proposed to delay hiring 2,177 police officers, cut 417 parks workers, close three fire companies, reduce educational bureaucracy and double the fare on the Staten Island ferry to 50 cents, he added about $40 million worth of small programs for AIDS care, prenatal care, mental health and the homeless.
 
Quality-of-Life Issues
''Some say quality of life is best defined by spotless parks and litter-free roadways,'' Mr. Dinkins said at a crowded news conference in the Blue Room at City Hall. ''But for me it is best exemplified by a happy, healthy baby or by a teen-ager with a diploma in hand and a sparkle in the eye.'' 
As expected, the biggest chunks of Mr. Dinkins's tax proposals called for a $180 million property tax increase, which would cost the typical homeowner $33 and require approval by the City Council, and a $300 million personal income tax surcharge, which would cost the average resident $80 and require approval by the State Legislature.
Other proposals that would require state approval include tripling the automobile use tax to $45, imposing an 8-cent-a-gallon city gasoline tax, increasing the hotel tax to 6 percent from 5 percent and extending the mortgage recording tax to cooperative apartment transactions and increasing it by one-half of 1 percentage point to raise $70 million.
After months of speculation that he might propose layoffs, Mr. Dinkins avoided that drastic step, and he plans to have nearly 8,000 more workers on the payroll by June 1991 than were working last March. He did propose more than $200 million in service cuts and $267 million in ''productivity increases'' that range from slowing city hospitals' payments to vendors to increasing audits to collect unpaid taxes.
 
Delicately Balanced
But fiscal experts said the Mayor's plan, which was higher than the $26.6 billion budget adopted last June, was more a starting point than a finished product. It is delicately balanced on a range of taxes that may not all be approved and productivity measures that may not be achieved and it assumes a 1.5 percent annual wage-increase settlement for municipal workers whose contracts begin to expire this summer and who are demanding more.
Peter F. Vallone, the Speaker of the City Council, which must act on the budget, said Mr. Dinkins had done ''a very commendable job of trying to share the pain.'' But he said the Council would work to restore trims in sanitation and the police, the so-called ''hard services'' for which it traditionally fights.
Mr. Vallone said he accepted Mr. Dinkins's call for $859 million in new or higher taxes over all. But he said the Council had not yet determined how that figure should be distributed among the various tax measures the Mayor was seeking.
 
Must Go to Legislature
More than $500 million of the Mayor's proposed tax package would require action by the Legislature. Those taxes would come on top of other increases recently passed by the state to balance its own budget, and their approval is by no means certain.
Besides the real-estate tax, Mr. Dinkins has asked the Council to delay promised energy tax cuts to save $130 million and to impose a new 4 percent sales tax on dry cleaning, tailoring and shoe repairs to raise $12 million.
Mr. Vallone said he hoped to reach agreement with the Mayor on what taxes to press for in Albany within 10 days and then to lobby jointly for them. Mr. Dinkins made clear that if Albany failed to approve all the tax measures he seeks, the difference would have to be made up through even higher property taxes by the Council, or even deeper service cuts.
Barry Feinstein, the president of teamsters Local 237, which represents many city workers, said he was ''speechless, stunned and all the bad things I can say'' over the proposed budget. Mr. Feinstein, who has been one of Mr. Dinkins's biggest political supporters, said that the budget plan put too big a tax burden on individuals and not enough on business and that it called for workers in his union to accept wage increases below the rate of inflation.
''It's so unacceptable, so damaging, that we are going to do whatever we have to do to change this budget,'' he said.
Mr. Dinkins has long said he would not support taxes that he believed could drive away business.
 
'Always Painful'
Ronald K. Shelp, the president of the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry and the New York City Partnership, said that ''while taxes are always painful, particularly here - with the largest state and local tax burden in the nation - we're happy the Mayor's budget does not unfairly target the industries that are creating jobs in New York City'' in the service sector of the economy.
Mr. Dinkins, when asked if his budget had been hard on the middle class while adding programs for the poor, said that if the city failed to address the problems of ''the least among us,'' it would only have to spend more money on social needs later.
Raymond D. Horton, the president of the Citizens Bugdet Commission, a nonprofit group that monitors city finances, said Mr. Dinkins ''deserves credit for realistically stating the problem.'' But he said the Mayor's proposed solution depended on too many variables like the tax proposals and labor settlement to assure now that it would work.
''I think we can anticipate major revisions,'' he said. ''So in that sense, it's precariously balanced.'' Noting that the Council invariably seeks to restore programs the Mayor has cut, he said it would face a special test this year, the first in which it has not shared power on the budget with the Board of Estimate, which was abolished by changes in the City Charter last year.
''They're really going to have the spotlight on them,'' Mr. Horton said. ''And they're going to have to take the heat one way or the other.''
Mr. Vallone took jocular note of that predicament yesterday when he was asked what he would do in response to the myriad citizens' groups that will be supplicants at the Council's doorstep between now and the end of June. ''We're going to introduce legislation to bring back the Board of Estimate,'' he said, adding that ''we'll do the best we can to try to reflect their concerns.
 
'Very, Very Important'
Allen J. Proctor, executive director of the State Financial Control Board, praised what he called the Mayor's cautious economic predictions and plans for raising an additional $384 million from tougher tax enforcement efforts next year.
But he added: ''It's too soon to say if it's realistically balanced. Obviously to have a plan for an almost $900 million tax program means that the next six weeks are very, very important.''
Mr. Dinkins's plan would cut about 1,300 nonclassroom workers from the Board of Education through attrition, part of about $42 million he had proposed to cut from education programs. Late Wednesday, the city agreed to restore about $22 million of that money for classroom and after-school programs in an agreement with the State Assembly Speaker, Mel Miller.
Mr. Miller, a Brooklyn Democrat, had insisted that the money go to education in exchange for supporting legislation that would pave the way for the transfer to the city of $1.5 billion in surplus funds from the Municipal Assistance Corporation, a state-created fiscal agency, over the next eight years. The city had been counting on $290 million of the surplus to help balance its budget for the coming year.
But the city's Schools Chancellor, Joseph A. Fernandez, said even the lesser cuts ''cannot be taken without hurting our classroom services,'' and he said he would press to restore them.
The State Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, has yet to approve the M.A.C. proposal, and Mr. Vallone said the Council believed the measure could not be acted on by the Legislature without a home-rule message from the Council.
 
Delays for Police
Mr. Dinkins would also again delay hiring police officers, planning only two classes of recruits totaling 2,734 officers for the city's three police departments - transit, housing and the main force - over the coming year, instead of the three classes totaling 4,889 recruits that he announced in February. That would increase the overall head count by about 500 officers, to 32,000 officers, for the combined forces.
Seeking to put the best face on this news, city officials said redeployment of officers within the main city department and the transfer of some duties to civilians would mean that the number of officers estimated to be actually available for street duty there would rise slightly, to 9,475 from 9,379.
But senior police officials have long said such enforcement-strength numbers were only rough estimates.
In the mayoral campaign, Mr. Dinkins criticized former Mayor Edward I. Koch for creating ''phantom cops'' by taking credit for proposed hirings in his budgets and then failing to follow through.
''We're going to deliver that which is in the budget,'' Mr. Dinkins said.
''Or I'm dead,'' added his Budget Director, Philip R. Michael.
''At least,'' Mr. Dinkins said.

HEADLINE: Revised Figures Shows Economy Is Still Sluggish

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
Deflating a recent impression that the economy was chugging along quite nicely, the Commerce Department reported yesterday that the sluggish economic growth that had set in last September had continued through the first quarter.
In its second estimate of the quarter's economic growth, the Commerce Department said the gross national product, measuring the value of all the nation's goods and services, had expanded at an annual rate of only 1.3 percent from January through March and not, as estimated last month, at a healthy 2.1 percent.
The sharp downward revision came mostly because the automobile industry devoted its energies more to selling off a huge stockpile of vehicles than to manufacturing new cars and trucks. In April, the Commerce Department greatly overestimated actual auto production in the quarter. 
 
Trouble Spots Keep Shifting
Economists described the January-to-March performance as another example of the economy's being dragged down each quarter by a different crisis - the Boeing Company strike in the fourth quarter, the backlog of unsold vehicles in the first quarter and a decline in housing construction that is developing in the current quarter.
''The areas of concern rotate, but there is always another one around the corner to drag down the economy,'' said Albert T. Sommers, a senior fellow at the Conference Board, a business organization. ''That's indicative of the fact that there is no central driving force - strong consumer spending or strong capital spending, for example -to make the economy boom, despite these incidents.''
There were some strong points, however. Exports increased more than the Commerce Department originally estimated, responding to the demands of robust European and Asian economies. Capital spending also rose, mostly because many service-sector companies bought computers and other electronic gear. And despite budgetary problems at the Federal, state and local levels, government purchases remained strong.
But the stock and bond markets were not impressed by the report. The Dow Jones industrial average closed at 2,855.55, essentially unchanged, and bond prices fell slightly.
''The market already had in mind, before the numbers came out, that the economy is weak,'' said Robert Giordano, co-director of economic research at Goldman, Sachs & Company, the Wall Street investment house.
The latest Commerce Department reading means that the American economy has been growing sluggishly for six months. The fourth-quarter G.N.P. growth was only 1.1 percent, at an annual rate, partly because of the 45-day strike at Boeing that halted the manufacture of multimillion-dollar commercial airliners.
Now that the inventory of automobiles has been cut to below a 60 days' supply, from more than 90 days, most economists expect the auto and truck industry to function more or less normally. They say production should move up to an annual rate of 9.5 million units, from the 8.5 million in the first quarter, with sales roughly matching production.
Had the 9.5 million production ratebeen in effect in the first quarter, it might have meant an extra $18 billion for the economy, enough to add more than a percentage point to G.N.P. growth, said Roger Brinner, chief economist at DRI/McGraw-Hill.
As it was, the 1.3 percent rise represented a minuscule $11.2 billion increase in the value of the nation's goods and services. That brought the G.N.P. to a total of $4.188 trillion, after adjustment for inflation.
With the automobile industry apparently rebounding, the big second-quarter concern is new-home construction, a huge sector of the economy involving not only home building but also the industries that supply furniture, appliances, plumbing and the like.
Construction had jumped to nearly 1.6 million homes at an annual rate in the unseasonably warm January and February weather, but by April the figure had plunged to 1.2 million.
''A lot of the construction activity that would have begun in the spring was initiated early - in effect, borrowed from the second quarter,'' said Stephen S. Roach, a senior economist at Morgan Stanley & Company.
 
Tight Rein on Inventories
The G.N.P. report noted, in effect, that businesses had kept their inventories at relatively low levels. That raised the possibility that the economy will get a lift from new stockpiling as factories step up production. Consumer spending, in fact, rose at a 2.4 percent annual rate, reflecting stronger demand than in the fourth quarter, but far below the robust spending of the boom years in the mid-1980's.
''There might be some stimulus to the economy from inventory rebuilding, but not much,'' said Mr. Giordano, expressing a commonly held view.
Inflation, as measured by the fixed-weight G.N.P. price index, rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, its largest gain since the fourth quarter of 1981, when it ran at a 7 percent rate, the report said. But the department pointed out that half the gain reflected a sharp run-up in food and energy costs as a result of unusually cold weather last December. Consumer prices fell sharply in April, and this decline should be reflected in a lower inflation rate in the second-quarter G.N.P. reports, economists said.
Corporate profits remained anemic, rising only two-tenths of 1 percent, on an after-tax basis, to $157 billion. A more important measure -the profits earned only from actual production - was up seven-tenths of 1 percent. It had fallen for three consecutive quarters.
Economists took the upturn to mean that business was having an easier time increasing prices to offset, in particular, rising labor costs. ''Now that inflation abroad is pushing up the prices of foreign goods, American producers have more leverage to pass through their own costs,'' Mr. Roach said.
Mr. Sommers agreed that profits might have turned the corner, but he noted that at their current level, they were only 5.2 percent of the total value of G.N.P., the lowest ratio since 1982, a recession year. In the mid-1980's the ratio was regularly 6.5 percent to 7 percent.

HEADLINE: LATIN AID PACKAGE VOTED BY CONGRESS

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Friday, May 25

 BODY:
The Congress, eager to leave town for a Memorial Day recess, today gave final approval to a long-delayed emergency spending bill that includes $720 million in aid President Bush requested for the fledgling democracies in Panama and Nicaragua.
The House approved the measure on a 308-to-108 vote on Thursday night and the Senate followed suit with a voice vote shortly after midnight.
The $4 billion spending bill, which also includes $400 million in housing loan guarantees to help Israel resettle Soviet Jews and money for scores of domestic programs, now goes to the President, who is expected to sign it quickly. 
Mr. Bush, who requested the Central American aid months ago, has repeatedly upbraided Congress for delaying the funds to bolster the new Government of Violeta Barrios de Chamorro in Nicaragua and to help Panama recover from a United States trade embargo and the American invasion last December.
Under the bill, Nicaragua would receive $300 million, including $30 million to help resettle the United States-backed Nicaraguan rebels. Last week, Mr. Bush was forced to turn down a request from Mrs. Chamorro for an emergency loan to help her struggling government stay financially afloat.
 
Panama to Get $420 Million
Panama, which has seen its economy devasted by American trade sanctions imposed during the rule of Gen. Manuel Antonio Noriega, would receive $420 million. General Noriega was forced out by the United States in the invasion and is awaiting trial on drug trafficking charges in Miami.
His successor, President Guillermo Endara, has told the Bush Administration that the country will need considerably more assistance to regain its economic footing and to stem rising unemployment that could jeopardize his government, which was installed by the United States after the invasion.
Other foreign assistance money in the bill includes $30 million for African nations, $20 million for the Caribbean, with $3 million of that sum earmarked for Haiti and $8.7 million earmarked for Jamaica. The Soviet republic of Armenia would get $5 million to aid victims of the 1988 earthquake, and $4 million was allotted for development aid to Romania.
A provision sought by the Senate to set aside $10 million for the establishment of a United States Embassy in Lithuania should the United States establish formal diplomatic ties, was dropped from the legislation after strong objections from the Administration. The State Department said such language would limit the President's flexibility in dealing with the sensitive subject of Lithuania's declaration of independence from the Soviet Union.
 
Quarrels Over Domestic Spending
Although legislators have supported the proposal for assistance to Panama and Nicaragua, their quarrels over domestic spending, particularly projects in their home states or districts, repeatedly delayed final action on the spending bill.
The measure includes $1.2 billion to make up for a shortfall in financing for the food stamp program, $545 million for veterans medical benefits, $110 million to help the Census Bureau complete the 1990 census, and $216 million in disaster relief aid, primarily for Southern states hit by hurricanes and flooding.
About half of the new spending would be paid for by reductions in the Pentagon's budget.

HEADLINE: JAPANESE EXPRESS REMORSE TO KOREA

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, May 24

 BODY:
Emperor Akihito apologized tonight for Japan's brutal subjugation of Korea nearly a half century ago. It was the first time that unambiguous acceptance of responsibility for Japanese wartime aggression had ever been expressed at such a high level.
''I think of the sufferings your people underwent during this unfortunate period, which was brought about by my country, and cannot but feel the deepest regret,'' the 56-year-old Emperor told the visiting South Korean President, Roh Tae Woo, at a state banquet. His remarks were directed pointedly to the people of the Korean peninsula, which is now divided into North and South Korea. 
The phrasing was a departure from the more circumscribed locutions used by the Emperor's father, Hirohito, who in remarks addressed to the United States and China referred to the war years as a ''regrettable'' or ''unfortunate'' period but stopped short of acknowledging any specific Japanese responsibility. Akihito succeeded Hirohito upon his death early last year.
But illustrating the continuing sensitivity toward Japan among its neighbors, it is not clear whether Korean citizens will accept Emperor Akihito's declaration as sufficiently contrite. [On Friday, President Roh opened the second day of his visit with an appeal that Japan and Korea ''break off the shackles of the past.'' [He avoided any specific reference to Japanese colonization of Korea, referring only to the ''past period of darkness'' and recalling the case of a Korean child beaten for insisting on using his own name rather than a Japanese name. Mr. Roh said earlier that he thought Emperor Akihito's apology was significant.] Koreans Protest Visit Japanese occupation of Korea from 1910 to the end of World War II was especially brutal, involving the forced removal of Koreans to do hard labor in Japanese labor camps in Japan and elsewhere in Asia, expropriation of property, destruction of Korean cultural artifacts and even the requirement that Koreans adopt Japanese names. Many South Koreans, nursing centuries of resentment against the Japanese in spite of the improved relationship of the last two decades, have been marching, protesting and even rioting in recent weeks in opposition to President Roh's visit to Tokyo this week.
The visit is the first by a Korean chief of state to Japan since 1984. At that time, Hirohito, who died after ruling for 62 years, made comments that were far more ambiguous than Emperor Akihito's today.
Emperor Akihito's remarks, delivered at the banquet after Mr. Roh arrived in the morning, were the product of weeks of tough and anxious negotiations between Seoul and Tokyo after Korean demands that Japan do more to apologize for its past.
At one point, Mr. Roh's aides were understood to have told Japan that Emperor Akihito would not be welcome to visit South Korea if the apology came not from him but from Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu.
The impasse on the statement had cast a shadow over the state visit, demonstrating that the two most important economic powers of northeast Asia were unable to overcome old hostilities to cooperate on matters of vital concern to their future, such as sharing technology and economic projects. Indeed, although the Emperor's statement may well be accepted, the talks and threats leading up to it have embarrassed Tokyo, underscoring the extent to which Japan still has problems coming to terms with its militaristic past.
 
An Embarrassment for Tokyo
At first, Japan told South Korea it would be improper for the Emperor to issue a strong apology, since Japan's Constitution - written by the occupying Americans after the war - reduced the Emperor's status to that of a mere ''symbol'' of the state, without any political powers. This contention was dismissed by Koreans as an excuse for reluctance to apologize among traditionalists in the ruling Liberal Democratic Party.
Japan then agreed to have the Emperor issue an apology written by government officials. But various versions were disclosed to the press, prompting reports that Koreans found them inadequate. Each disclosure forced the Government to revise its statement, Japanese officials said.
Emperor Akihito's comments were not the first expression of regret from Japan, but past comments on the topic were seen as ambiguous. For example, in 1984, when President Chun Doo Hwan became the first Korean leader to visit Japan, Emperor Hirohito said ''it is indeed regrettable that there was an unfortunate past between us for a period in this century and I believe that it should not be repeated again.''
Many took this statement as an evasion, as if the Emperor were talking about a freak storm instead of troops marching in his name. Japanese responded by saying that the ambiguous comments were simply a reflection of the late Emperor's elliptical speaking style. Mr. Roh replied that even if that was true, Koreans could not understand the statement.
As promised, Mr. Kaifu echoed the Emperor's statement today with his own strongly worded apology, expressing ''my sincere remorse and honest apologies'' for Japanese actions, which he said ''inflicted unbearable suffering and sorrow on the people of the Korean peninsula.'' Japanese officials said that, too, was the strongest apology for Japanese wartime actions ever issued by a Japanese Prime Minister.

HEADLINE: Excerpts From Bush's News Session on China's Trade Status With U.S.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from President Bush's White House news conference today, as recorded by the Federal News Service:
 
OPENING STATEMENT
Well, today, after long and thorough deliberation, I have determined that M.F.N. status, trade status for China, should be extended for a year.
M.F.N. is not a special favor. It's not a concession. It's the basis of everyday trade. And taking M.F.N. away is one thing I said I would not do, that is, in doing that take steps that would hurt the Chinese people themselves. I do not want to do that. 
To express America's outrage at the tragedy of Tiananmen, the Congress and my Administration promptly enacted sanctions against China. These sanctions remain basically unchanged today. And while implementing those sanctions I have repeatedly made clear that I did not want to hurt the Chinese people. And this was a difficult decision, weighing our impulse to lash out in outrage that we all feel against a sober assessment -weighing that against a sober assessment of our nation's long-term interests.
I concluded that it is in our best interest and the interest of the Chinese people to continue China's trade status. Not to do so would hurt the United States.
Trade would drop, dramatically hurting exporters, consumers and investors. China buys about $6 billion a year of American aircraft and wheat and chemicals, lumber and other products. Lose this market and we lose American jobs - aircraft workers in the West, farmers in the Great Plains, high tech employees in the Northeast. Our economic competition will not join us in denying M.F.N. Without M.F.N. an average of 40 percent higher costs for Chinese imports will turn into higher prices for American consumers.
Hong Kong weighed on my mind. Hong Kong would be an innocent victim of our dispute with Beijing - 20,000 jobs and $10 billion could be lost in a colony that is a model of free enterprise spirit. The United Kingdom and China's neighbors have urged me to continue M.F.N. Korea, Japan, Thailand, Singapore, even Taiwan made clear that M.F.N. should be retained.
In recent weeks China has taken modest steps that appear intended to show responsiveness to our concerns. Beijing lifted martial law in Tibet, restored consular access there, giving us a chance to judge the situation for ourselves. Two-hundred and eleven detainees were recently released and then their names provided for the first time.
While we welcome these and earlier steps, they are, let's face it, far from adequate, and I am not basing my decision on the steps that the Chinese have taken so far. Most important of all, as we mark the anniversary of Tiananmen, we must realize that by maintaining our involvement with China we will continue to promote the reforms for which the victims of Tiananmen gave their lives.
The people in China who trade with us are the engine of reform opening to the outside world. During the past 10 years we've seen our engagement in China contribute to the forces for justice and reason that were peacefully protested in Beijing, and our responsibility to them is best met not by isolating those forces from contact with us or by strengthening the hand of reaction, but by keeping open the channels of commerce and communication.
Our Ambassador came to see me here in the Oval Office the other day and told me that not only the people that he is in contact with, but the students there, the intellectuals there, all favor - there in China, favor the continuation of M.F.N.
So, this is why I made the decision I have made . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 
Human Rights Issue
 
Q. Mr. President, it's been a year now since the world has watched China mow its own people down in Tiananmen Square. How can we expect the pro-democracy movement causes around the world to have faith in the United States when they see a reward to Beijing such as the M.F.N?
 
A. . . . I don't think this is a reward to Beijing. I think it is very important we keep these commercial contacts. I think it is in the interest of the United States that we keep these contacts. M.F.N. is based on emigration, and emigration has continued from China at respectable levels. And so, that is why I am making this decision.
And what irks me is when some of the people up on the Hill accuse me of being less interested than they are in human rights. I think I - I think we're on the right track here. . . . It is not a favor we're doing.
 
Cambodia Policy
 
Q. Is it time now, sir, for a review of our policy toward Cambodia in light of the expressed willingness of the Government there to permit internationally supervised elections, and in light of the fact that our policy has drawn widespread condemnation for helping directly or indirectly the Khmer Rouge, the --
 
A. . . . Anytime we can get free and fair, certifiably fair elections, we should - we should be encouraged by that. I am troubled by it, because it isn't clear in Cambodia at all.
 
Q. Well, are you made particularly uncomfortable, sir, by the fact that our support for the non-Communist resistance has the effect, at least, since they are fighting alongside the Khmer Rouge, of helping the notorious Khmer Rouge?
 
A. To the degree it has any effect to help them, yes, I am uncomfortable about it. But when we have this kind of compromise that has been worked out at - it - at this juncture, I think we're on the right track. But there's a discomfort level for it because of the brutality of the Khmer Rouge. And if anybody even perceives that we're trying to help those people, why, then it does cause discomfort. But I think we're on the right track. We are reviewing the whole policy now.
 
Gorbachev and Lithuania
 
Q. About a month or so ago you said that you thought Mr. Gorbachev was showing willingness to compromise and the Lithuanians only showing some willingness to compromise. Is that still your assessment, or have you reviewed the balance on that?
 
A. Well, I - you're presenting me with some - some semantic difference that I did not intend to make. But I - I'm not here to assess blame. What I'm here to do is to assess the - you know, to try to encourage a dialogue on this important question.
 
Contact With China
 
Q. Mr. President, critics of this decision on China believe it is based too heavily on a blind faith that you have in those leaders based on your experience as envoy over there. What message does this send to the younger generation of Chinese leaders who are going to come along and replace those in power now?
 
A. It says that economic contacts are the best way to keep the economic reforms going forward. It says that the more economic contacts we have with China, the more they are going to see the fruits of free market economies. I have told you that the students in China, according to our Ambassador, want to see this M.F.N. continue. And so, it should send no message other than that isolation is bad and economic involvement is good.
 
Taxes for Americans
 
Q. Several polls, including one broadcast last night, are showing that most Americans think that there will be taxes, and about half - in fact, they think you'll go along with taxes - and about half say they're willing to go along with taxes themselves if the case can be proven that taxes are needed. Does this give you more leeway as you make your decision?
 
A. Look, I have stated right here at this podium that I'm not going to go into the details of these - what might be discussed up there. I've said that there's no preconditions. I'm satisfied with the way the process is going. Indeed, I should give credit to Mr. Gephardt for the conduct of these initial meetings. Our people - Dick Darman, Nick Brady, John Sununu up there - all working in good faith.
And I've seen those surveys, but it is way too early to start talking about remedies here. I want to let that process go forward and then, when I get agreement, I will go out and say to the American people, Here's what we recommend. And I'm not going to prejudge it.
 
Q. Some of the Democrats up on the Hill say that you're ducking the tough issue by saying what you just said, that you're not going to tell the American people --
 
A. Yes, I've heard that criticism.
 
Q. They want you to outline the problem and explain to the American people that it's going to take sacrifice. Are you ready to do at least that?
 
A. I'm going to outline the problem when we get agreement so we can go forward with the solution. If I outlined the problem now, I'd go rely on some of the fact that the Congress appropriates all the money and raises all the revenues. That's their obligation. And I'm not one to dwell on surveys recently, but I will point out that people understand that the Congress bears a greater responsibility for this.
But I'm not trying to assign blame; that's why I'm not doing it right now. That's why I'm not doing it. That's why I'm saying we're going to sit and talk. Because if I go out now and say what I think without dealing in, you know, keeping in mind the need to get some progress, I might say something like I just said, and I don't want to do that.
 
Q. But they're going to come back at you today up on the Hill, and they're going to say, See, he's not showing leadership. What's your answer to that?
 
A. My answer is I am. We've gotten these people together. I've said there's no preconditions. Let's talk. And I think it's making progress.
 
Arms Control Talks
 
Q. The Soviets have slowed down the negotiations on conventional arms control. You are not going to be signing a Start treaty, which we'd been led to believe was going to be the centerpiece of this summit. It looks like there won't be any kind of trade treaty signed. Has the summit changed from one of consolidating gains and moving ahead to just trying to get the relationship back on track?
 
A. I wouldn't phrase it exactly that way. . . . We've got a lot to talk about. I don't want to . . . indicate I don't think there will be significant progress on Start. I hope we can move things forward on C.F.E. . . . I hope I've expressed with great enthusiasm and passion my desire to do something about chemical weapons. And it looks to me like we are very, very close there. So we've got a lot of things that I think will be seen properly as progress, but there's enormous problems that just need to be talked about where I can't say there will be an answer.
 
Israel and Arabs
 
Q. Mr. President, the conflict in Israel between the Israelis and the Palestinians seems to become increasingly violent.
 
A. Yes.
 
Q. Do you think the Israelis at this point are acting appropriately and responsibly?
 
A. Well, I have called on both sides for restraint. I've called on the Israeli forces to show constraint. I'm worried about it. I am troubled about the loss of human life in this area. . . . And the answer is to get these talks going. And I will do everything I can to - to get the talks for peace going. . . .
 
Q. Well, Mr. President, is there anything that the United States can do with its enormous clout with Israel, to push the Israelis to be more open to these peace talks?
 
A. Well, the problem we face right now is this, almost an interregnum. I mean, there's no firm decision-making government in place. So, we're in a bit of a hiatus because of that.
 
Balancing the Budget
 
Q. Mr. President, what happened to your promise to balance the budget without raising taxes? Are we going to make it?
 
A. Are we going to make the promise? Things are complicated out there on this subject and we are trying very hard to get a budget agreement and that's the way it is, and we'll see how we go. And I've reported, I think that we've started off now in a bipartisan nature doing a good job. I wish we could control the spending side better.
 
Meetings in Moscow
 
Q. I'd like to ask about the news report coming out of - in the aftermath of the Moscow meetings between - with Secretary Baker, that you were not as pleased with the outcome of those talks, especially pertaining to Start, as Secretary Baker was.
 
A. There is no light between us on that at all. The Administration has a united - unified position. It is a sound position. There's no point just before you sit down to say, ''They caved. They gave more than we did.'' But I am very satisfied with what - where we stand. All I want to do is be sure we can move forward and get - get these deals finalized, and we may not be able to do that. . . . I'll tell you what troubles me is that we're not -somebody asked the question here - we're not further along on conventional forces. But the strategic arms talks are going very well. . . . To get back to your question, there isn't any daylight between the White House and the State Department or the arms control community or Defense. . . . Now we're going to have some criticism. Any time you make a deal you have editiorials out there telling you exactly how it should be done. But I am confident that we're on the right track. . . .
 
Q. Some people are saying that conventional forces is now the real litmus test of Soviet intentions given the developments in Eastern Europe. If they don't pull those troops back out of Eastern Europe, then that tells you something about their ultimate intentions. How do you --
 
A. I'd say - well, I think that - I think that that's a good point and one that I expect the Soviets would want to dispel through action, because I don't get the feeling that they are opposed to C.F.E. agreements.

HEADLINE: DEMOCRATS IRATE OVER BUSH SILENCE

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
President Bush ignited Democratic tempers in Congress today when he refused once again to address the public on the severity of the deficit problem or to offer proposals to solve it.
Speaking at an impromptu White House news conference, Mr. Bush said Congress bears the primary responsibility for dealing with fiscal matters. He said he would not offer more detailed descriptions of the causes for the swelling deficit or make public any recommendations for a solution until after Administration and Congressional negotiators reached a budget agreement.
Democrats wasted little time attacking the President's statement. ''Sitting at Ronald Reagan's right hand, the President learned how to duck, not how to lead,'' said Representative David R. Obey, a Wisconsin Democrat, whose views were widely echoed by Democrats in the House and Senate. Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee, complained, ''The American people have learned more about the Soviet economy over the past two days than they have about their own.'' 
 
Fourth Round of Talks
The jousting came as the budget negotiators entered the fourth round of talks with some signs of progress on defining the size of the deficit-cutting package they want to achieve. The Administration negotiators also presented their latest economic forecast, which included more pessimistic assumptions about interest rates, inflation and economic growth.
Mr. Sasser said Democrats were demanding a package that would slash the deficit by $600 billion over five years, with $60 billion of the cut coming in the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. Republicans are talking about a $500 billion deficit cut over five years, with about $50 billion in cuts for 1991.
Congressional negotiators in both parties said discussions of more specific proposals for spending cuts or tax increases would come after lawmakers return from a two-week Memorial Day recess scheduled to begin on Friday. For the first time since the talks began last week, lawmakers offered a timetable, saying they would aim for resolution, one way or the other, within the next 30 to 40 days.
But the subject uppermost in the minds of Democrats today was the President's news conference, and many of them joked bitterly that Mr. Bush was the first President in modern memory apparently willing to cede power to Congress. Mr. Bush told reporters at the news conference that if pressed to outline his thoughts now on the deficit crunch, he would say: ''Congress appropriates all the money and raises all the revenues. That's their obligation.''
Insisting that he was not trying to assign blame or sour the budget talks, Mr. Bush added that ''people understand that the Congress bears a greater responsibility for this.''
 
Democrats Angered by Bush
Angry Democrats on and off the budget negotiating team responded in kind. ''Harry Truman had a message on his desk; it said, 'The buck stops here,' '' snapped Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, the chairman of the Senate Finance Committee. ''The President's the one who called this summit. If the problem is that serious, the American people are entitled to hear how serious it is.''
Mr. Obey, a House Approporiations subcommittee chairman, said the President was abdicating responsiblity and jeopardizing any chances of an agreement in the budget talks. ''When you run for President, you are supposed to do something, not just be somebody,'' he said, adding that any governor who adopted the posture Mr. Bush has taken would be ''laughed out of the state capital.''
Some Democrats said their patience for protracted talks was wearing thin. ''If they don't get progress in the next three or four weeks, then we ought to walk away from the table,'' said Representative Marty Russo of Illinois, a member of the House Budget Committee but not a participant in the talks.
 
'Golden Opportunity' Seen
''This is a joke, we know what the paramaters are and we know that we want a bold approach that locks the deficit reduction in for five years,'' he said. ''They have a golden opportunity,'' he said of the Administration team. ''If they screw this up now, they deserve the wrath of the American people.''
Administration forecasters are now assuming that interest rates on three-month Treasury bills will average 7.7 percent in 1990, up from the 6.7 percent rate that Administration officials had assumed in January. Longer-term interest rates will average 8.6 percent in 1990, compared with the 7.7 percent level assumed in January.
The Administration forecast economic growth of only 2.4 percent this year and 2.9 percent in 1991, compared with January assumptions of 2.6 percent for 1990 and 3.3 percent for 1991. Inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, will rise by 4.8 percent in 1990 and 4.2 percent in 1991, according to the new estimates.

HEADLINE: Power, of a Sort, to the People

 BODY:
A referendum to put policy to a popular test? It's a familiar idea in this country, especially California, but in the Soviet Union? Not for centuries, in czarist or Communist times, have the people been consulted about fundamental issues of government. But now, in another remarkable departure, that's exactly what Mikhail Gorbachev proposes.
No theorist can tell him how to shift from a state-strangled command economy to freer competitive markets. He has to feel his way, improvising as he goes along. A referendum is his latest idea. It's not exactly power to the people, but it's sure a long way from all power to the Soviets. 
Promoting a sense of popular empowerment might just be the only way to implement the desperately needed economic reform - reform that Americans want to see succeed for practical, as well as philosophical reasons.
How can a society accustomed to state paternalism and job security introduce free markets? Poland has chosen the abrupt way, the cold bath. Its Government is not exactly an elected one. But Solidarity, which helped form it and pushed radical economic reform, enjoys broad popular support.
No such social contract exists between the unelected President of the Soviet Union and the peoples of its various republics. And there is little backing for the regime of Prime Minister Nikolai Ryzhkov, whose slow-moving reforms won out over the more radical measures proposed by Gorbachev advisers.
The referendum Mr. Gorbachev now proposes could help him either way. If he wins, he wins. A vote of confidence would legitimate the tough measures to follow. Strong support would permit him to push for a market system even faster. And if he loses, he could still win, blaming the Ryzhkov regime and replacing it with new managers.
There's no turning back, Mr. Gorbachev insists, and he's surely right. The apparatus of state controls has been partly dismantled. But until it is replaced by markets, Soviet goods and services will not improve. And it takes the people, not just leaders, to make markets work.
Even so, a plebiscite is no panacea. There's a real risk that voters, spurred on by radical and conservative critics alike, may seize the chance to register resounding disgust with Moscow's economic mismanagement by rejecting the move to markets. The populace is experiencing rising inflation and fears massive unemployment. It still looks upon entrepreneurs as profiteers - which they will be unless truly competitive enterprises spring up to drive prices down.
But Mr. Gorbachev's purpose is not economic; it's profoundly political. If he's to succeed in transforming the economy, he will need wide public support, and that means transforming politics. Let the Soviet people speak: what an extraordinary idea!

HEADLINE: Offshore Oil Drilling: A Mistake

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''Troubled Oil, or Troubled Waters?'' (editorial, May 8) raises some good points regarding our national energy needs and the offshore oil dilemma. However, it is important to point out that oil on the face of the earth runs out in about 100 years. If we do not begin to wean ourselves from oil, we will not only continue the fossil-fuel pollution crisis, smog and the greenhouse effect, we will be bestowing on our grandchildren a chaotic economy frantically attempting to institute conservation and renewable fuel programs. 
Coastal oil development is not the answer to this dilemma.
The idea that we should pursue coastal oil development as an essential aspect of our national energy policy is part of the illusion that we can endlessly spend our and the world's finite resources with impunity. We cannot. Nor can we afford to suffer the environmental degradation of an oil spill like the Santa Barbara well blowout of 1969 or tanker accidents like the Exxon Valdez.
Oil is a potent toxin. At 100 parts per million, oil is classified as hazardous waste. Oil at 5 parts per billion impairs the ability of fish to hunt by affecting their sense of smell. Oil at 1 microgram per liter kills fish and shellfish larvae. Oil destroys both the phytoplankton and the zooplankton, the source of both the food chain and most of the world's oxygen. And as witnessed so tragically with the Exxon Valdez spill, oil killed sea mammals and sea birds in large numbers through hypothermia, poisoning and respiratory disease.
Oil passes into the food chain. Studies show that 13 years after an oil spill, oil at 100 parts per million can still be measured in sediments and being released from sediments.
Offshore oil drilling causes severe air pollution. One exploratory drill ship produces the smog equivalent of 7,000 cars driven 50 miles per day. As shown in both the Valdez spill and the recent Huntington Beach, Calif., spill, coastal tourism and commercial fishing suffer irreparable harm.
It is important to place the offshore oil energy debate in a proper context. We can have energy and a healthy unpolluted environment: they are not mutually exclusive.
Sixty-three percent of our oil needs go toward transportation. In the United States, we are now at the 1985 standard of 27.5 fleet miles per gallon for automobiles. Modern technology, however, can produce cars capable of achieving 107 miles per gallon; and there are cars on today's market that achieve 58 miles per gallon.
If we raised fleet miles per gallon to 40 by the year 2000, we could save four times all of the oil that exists off both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of the United States. Indeed, if we were to institute a winterization program for the United States, we could save more than two times the oil that exists off both our coastlines. We don't have to settle for a future of disastrous oil spills that ruin our marine environment.

HEADLINE: New York Loses Badly With New Hotel Tax

 BODY:
To the Editor:
''The Budget: Late and Ugly'' (editorial, May 17) aptly characterizes the New York State budget, but in listing the new taxes to be imposed, omits the occupancy tax on hotel rooms of $100 or more. Tourism is New York State's second largest revenue producer and New York City's third. This multibillion-dollar industry brings revenue and jobs to millions of people. The tax represents fiscal suicide for a healthy industry.
Most of the hotels affected are in New York City and Long Island. Yet our downstate legislators refused to recognize this fact. As a result, the tax on New York City's hotel rooms will skyrocket to nearly 21 percent, possibly the highest in the world. The occupancy tax, coupled with the decimation of funding for the New York City Convention and Visitors Bureau, sets the city's tourism industry for fiscal disaster.
The imposition of the hotel occupancy tax is an economic boon for New Jersey. Its tourism industry will be the real beneficiary of this tax. And the real losers will be New York State and the millions of people who are employed in the hospitality industry.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
People or Monsters?

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

DATELINE: BOSTON

 BODY:
As we approach the first anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre, China tugs at our understanding and our conscience. In a world of spreading democracy, how can so vast and talented a nation remain under authoritarian rule? Is there reason to hope for change? What should we on the outside do to help?
There are profound insights into such questions in a new book, ''A Higher Kind of Loyalty,'' by Liu Binyan. It is a memoir of life in contemporary China, a gripping memoir. It is also an exploration of how people come, and remain, under the sway of tyranny. 
Liu Binyan is China's most important and most courageous journalist. In the brief periods when it was possible to publish honest accounts of life in the People's Republic, he traveled around the country reporting on corruption and injustice. Millions read him and put their hopes in him after his devastating 1979 article on Communist Party cadres' abuse of power, ''People or Monsters?''
In a sense Liu Binyan's greatest story is his own life. For 22 years, between 1957 and 1979, he was in disgrace as a ''rightist.'' For 13 of those years he had to live apart from his wife and children, working as a farm laborer.
Yet it was a long time before he lost his faith in Mao Zedong and the party. He kept thinking that the leaders would correct the horrors he saw and reported. But the book chronicles how waves of ''reform'' always petered out, leaving the corrupt untouched. He came to see that the real issue at the top was not ''right'' or ''left'' but personal power.
''The Chinese people . . . will not tolerate this state any longer,'' he wrote at the end of the book. ''The handful of octogenarians and the privileged bureaucratic clique whom they represent will neither change their ways nor hand over power. Thus they are doomed to destruction.''
In 1987 Liu Binyan was expelled from the party along with Fang Lizhi, the great scientist who is now living in asylum in the U.S. Embassy in Beijing. Mr. Liu was allowed to go to the United States in 1988.
Mr. Liu and his equally courageous wife, Zhu Hong, were in Boston the other day, and we talked about the current situation. I asked whether China could insulate itself from the surge of democracy elsewhere in the world. Both shook their heads no.
''The China of 20 years ago could,'' Mr. Liu said. But control from the center is much weaker now, after the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution and then a decade of economic change.
That loss of control is clear despite the massacre, Mr. Liu said. ''Before the massacre we didn't have underground organizations; now we do, in many provinces. We didn't have underground publications, but now we do.''
Leaders of the democracy movement have escaped from China after months in hiding, Mr. Liu pointed out, although their pictures were posted everywhere as wanted. They got out, he said, because they had help from many, ''including even security officials.''
But Mr. Liu noted that China's Communist Party is much more deep-rooted than those in Eastern Europe. It was not installed by the Soviet Union but won power on its own. And few of the Chinese people, he said, ''know about the terrible things that happened in these 40 years.
''The great famine in the early 1960's, for instance. I myself only learned in the 1980's that 20 to 30 million people died, so ordinary people do not know.
''When they think of the party, they still have illusions. They say, 'Maybe the party itself was good, but there were corrupted officials who did bad things.' They think of the party as something abstract.''
Mr. Liu said there are important forces of change inside the party, ''officials at all levels who oppose the massacre, who oppose corruption. Potentially we have people like Gorbachev. But they don't show themselves, because the time is not right.''
What should the United States do? I asked. Mr. Liu did not disagree with President Bush's decision to extend most-favored-nation trading status to China, but said Mr. Bush should ''exert more pressure on the issue of human rights.''
So far, he said, the President has little to show for all his friendly gestures toward Deng Xiaoping. ''In China we would say, 'Deng Xiaoping never gave Bush any face.'
''It seems to us that Mr. Bush overestimates Deng's control and the stability of his rule - just as the United States did with the nationalist government more than 40 years ago. You helped that government when it was going to be toppled. You lost the government, and at the same time you lost the people - the people's feeling for America.''

Shopping Siren Sings This Song: IKEA! IKEA!

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINERIP

DATELINE: ELIZABETH, N.J.

 BODY:
People worry that America doesn't produce anything useful. Trade deficits persist, savings and loans fail, junk-bond wizards can afford $600 million fines. Yet there's a bright spot: The economy still churns out world-class shoppers.
IKEA, the Swedish home-furnishings chain, held a grand opening of a store the size of seven football fields here on Wednesday, and New York-area shoppers did themselves proud - 3,000 surged in during the first 15 minutes, 25,000 that day. Some had waited in line days to qualify for prizes. At 6 A.M., with three hours to go, a bad rumor about door-prize practices spread, and Karen Battle chanted, ''False advertising! Consumer unity!'' (That brought results: Store officials rushed out, vowing an equitable-prize policy.) They came to shop in a big way. Beata Schmid brought a U-Haul, Ed Kensinger and Bill Kochi rented a van. Something in Swedish furniture sucks yuppies out of the woodwork, even from Bayonne. ''Yeah, there are yuppies in Bayonne,'' said Robin LaScala. ''My husband's a lawyer. I have my Visa ready, my Mastercard, my American Express.'' Anthony Pengue and his fiancee, Elizabeth Jacobson, planned to furnish a condo. ''All we have so far is a mattress and food processor,'' he said. 
Instead of cutting a ribbon, they sawed a board in half (apparently a Swedish custom), and people poured in. It was inspiring. There were shoppers in wheelchairs, shoppers with canes, all exercising their shopping rights.
Minutes after the opening, Anne Dickson turned to Catherine Burke and said, ''Buy anything yet?'' ''I'm about to,'' said Ms. Burke, who found a sofa named Klippan for $95. (Apparently a Swedish marketing custom is to give each item a name.) There was so much to buy and so many shoppers that it took Margaret Calabro and Fran Messina an hour to travel 50 feet. ''Oh my God, Fran, we're going to be here all day,'' said Ms. Calabro. ''I'll have to find someone to pick up my son at school,'' said Mrs. Messina. ''They're giving out candy,'' said Ms. Calabro. ''Candy, Fran?'' Mothers used IKEA day care so they'd have two hands free to shop. Halina Kazmierczak stuck in 3-year-old Arthur and rushed off. ''You're allowed a half hour,'' she said. Debra Queen checked her twins, Tariq and Tarif.
They wanted to do it all right away. By 9:50, Mabel Chung was eating lunch (swedish meatballs and new potatoes) in the IKEA cafe.
Trouble-shooters circulated, unclogging aisles. ''Excuse me, we've been going in circles 10 minutes,'' said Pete Medell. Bill Wiltraut, on emergency duty from another IKEA store, took many by the hand. Melvin Schneider needed lamps and Mr. Wiltraut said, ''Stand here, I'll be right back. Don't move.'' He walked a couple to the other end of the store, then rushed back.
''I'm here, I'm still here,'' said a relieved Mr. Schneider. Mr. Wiltraut showed him a lamp named Korus 36. Mr. Schneider said, ''I need a coffee table, too.'' Upstairs, Mr. Schneider looked nervous. ''I don't want to abandon my cart,'' he said. ''Can I check out my items I just purchased, so I'll have something?''
They spun swivel chairs, punched couches, bounced on beds, took numbers to wait for help at information. Mr. Wiltraut opened a catalogue atop an ironing board named Mellby, looking for a bathroom item for Margit Smith. ''Yes, that's it!'' she said. It was a shelf named Lagen. ''Was I explaining it right?'' she asked, checking shopping technique.
''Sir, sir, are you busy?'' someone yelled in desperation. Mr. Wiltraut found her a rack named Knut 4. A woman needed a lamp named Dolerit in mauve, and Mr. Wiltraut dispatched an aide to the storeroom. ''Two to five minutes?'' said Mr. Wiltraut. ''That's very optimistic,'' said the aide.
Adele Eines was having trouble finding things, so Mr. Wiltraut escorted her. She was so stunned she'd found something that she said, ''I just take it from you? Like this?''
Felice Dodson panicked and couldn't say, office supplies. ''I need office . . . office . . . .'' ''Supplies!'' said Mr. Wiltraut. ''Wait here two minutes. I'll be right back.'' When he returned, four others had joined Mrs. Dodson, and, deciding there was safety in numbers, caravaned to office supplies.
There were lines for carts, the women's room, the bank machine. It was a 40-minute wait for meatballs. (In retrospect, Mrs. Chung was wise to eat lunch at 9:45.) Yet no one seemed to mind much. Wasn't this affirmation that they were on the shopping forefront?
Mr. Pengue and Ms. Jacobson had filled a cart, checked out through one of 28 registers and were back filling a second. ''I'd like to shop three more hours,'' she said. ''I could do three more, easy.'' ''Be realistic,'' he said. It was time to go home and eat some cheese and fruit.

HEADLINE: Rinfret Portrayed as a Fiery Foe for Cuomo

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

 BODY:
Pierre Andre Rinfret, the almost certain Republican candidate for governor of New York, has little state governmental and political experience but could be an oratorical match for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo on the stump, many economists and business executives agreed yesterday.
The 66-year-old Mr. Rinfret (pronounced rin-FRAY) was consistently portrayed as an aggressive, outspoken economist, well-versed in public speaking, writing and television appearances and well-equipped to make a major issue of the state's fiscal problems.
As an economist, he was described as a moderate conservative who had criticized at various times the economic policies of two Republican Presidents, Richard M. Nixon and Ronald Reagan, and also the policies of Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d when he was Treasury Secretary in the Reagan Administration. He called for Mr. Baker's resignation in 1987 because of the Baker policy of depreciating the dollar in the world money market. 
 
'He Has Great Courage'
''He has angered many politicians,'' said William E. Simon, the former Secretary of the Treasury in the Ford Administration. ''He has great courage.'' Despite three decades in public life, Mr. Rinfret was viewed as so apolitical, at least in New York State, that questions arose yesterday as to whether he was an enrolled Republican. Daniel De Francisco, executive director of the Board of Elections and a Democrat, said election records indicated that Mr. Rinfret was not enrolled in a party, but he said that pending a further check today, there was a strong possibility that current board records were incorrect.
Mr. Rinfret, who could be the Republican nominee even if he were an independent, declined any interviews yesterday and instead spent the day talking with Republican leaders, potential contributors and consultants. In one of his few ventures out of his economic consulting concern, Rinfret Associates Inc. at 641 Lexington Avenue, near 54th Street, he rode down three floors to pay a courtesy call on Jonathan Bush, President Bush's brother, whose investment management office is in the same building.
Mr. Bush said he had played no role in putting together the Republican state ticket. Indeed, there has been no evidence of any White House involvement as the state Republicans have scrambled to find a candidate to face the popular and well-financed incumbent.
Republican leaders also spent the day trying to select running mates for Mr. Rinfret - for lieutenant governor and attorney general. They are working against a deadline of this Memorial Day weekend. The Republican state nominating convention will begin on Tuesday.
In telephone interviews with economists from San Francisco to New York, descriptions of Mr. Rinfret jarred against the common image of the pipe-smoking, tweedy, contemplative economist. Instead he came across as more of a cigar-smoking salesman and prognosticator.
The descriptions used words like clear, simple, loud, outspoken and outrageous and said Mr. Rinfret was ''one of the few economists you can listen to without falling asleep.''
''He's probably smarter than Cuomo and just as tough,'' said Martin Anderson, a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution at Stanford University and President Reagan's first economic policy adviser. ''I'd love to see the two of them go at each other.''
 
'Good, Clean Fun' Expected
Murray Weidenbaum, Mr. Reagan's first chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, predicted that Renfret-Cuomo encounters would be ''good, clean fun - they'll do it in a way that won't put the electorate to sleep.'' Mr. Weidenbaum, now director of the Center for the Study of American Business at Washington University in St. Louis, added that ''p.r. puffery aside, he does have an analytical mind.''
But if conventional political wisdom and the 1986 Cuomo campaign are any guides, the Governor will very likely avoid giving his Republican challenger any forums until the final days of the campaign. Mr. Cuomo will do his talking in paid television commercials financed by a campaign treasury of at least $8 million. Mr. Rinfret starts out at ground zero in campaign funds.
But two assets he brings to the campaign are his personal wealth, which could provide seed money for his campaign, and his links to potential contributors in the financial community. His financial background also makes him qualified to make issues of Mr. Cuomo's budget and tax increases.
The Republican leaders who selected Mr. Rinfret after he met Wednesday with the Republican state chairman, J. Patrick Barrett, and the Manhattan Republican leader, State Senator Roy M. Goodman, did not know him. But he is well-known in Washington, where he was an unofficial economic adviser to Mr. Nixon during his Presidential campaigns and in the White House and also, to a lesser extent, in the John F. Kennedy, Lyndon B. Johnson and Reagan Administrations.
 
'Understandable' Economics
One former Nixon aide said Mr. Rinfret appealed to Mr. Nixon because ''he talks economics in understandable words.''
State Senator Goodman had put Mr. Rinfret's name forward on the recommendation of a mutual friend. Yesterday Mr. Goodman said Mr. Rinfret was ''enormously energetic, has a great zest for this campaign and has fire in his belly.''
One of the prospective candidate's immediate jobs is to meet with various Republican leaders who are expected to nominate him next week, as well as with Conservative Party leaders who have favored Herbert London, a dean at New York University.
Mr. London, who ran briefly for mayor last year, is being considered as a possible lieutenant governor candidate, although some Republican leaders favor the nomination of a woman.
The Rinfret-London combination would have at least two political problems, Republicans acknowledged. Mr. Rinfret favors a woman's right to an abortion, while Mr. London opposes abortion with few exceptions.

HEADLINE: SPORTS OF THE TIMES;
The Man Who Has His Own

BYLINE: By William C. Rhoden

 BODY:
For several weeks now Drew Pearson has monitored with some amusement the current debate involving inner-city violence, brand-name sneakers and suggestions that highly visible black athletes should curb their endorsements of overpriced sneakers.
Pearson is a former All-Pro wide receiver who played for the Dallas Cowboys from 1973 through 1983. Today he owns Drew Pearson Enterprises, which was listed among the 100 most successful black industrial and service companies in the latest issue of Black Enterprise magazine. The three-year-old company, based in Addison, Tex., is a sports licensing and sportswear manufacturing concern, which did $10 million in business last year.
What Pearson found amusing about the sneaker controversy was (a) that so much attention has been given to a simple-minded argument that points at sneakers, not the absence of an economic infrastructure, as a major cause of inner-city violence, and (b) that the most substantial recommendation to emerge from the debate was that black athletes, who have broken into the lucrative endorsement market, were somehow to blame. 
What troubles Pearson is that in the course of this wild goose chase a significant point is being missed. The issue is not whether Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson should promote high-priced gym shoes, but whether they should manufacture their own shoes, produce their own lines of sportswear and compete in a multibillion-dollar market.
''Why can't a Michael Jordan and Dominique Wilkins or somebody get together,'' said Pearson, ''and start their own shoe company to compete against Nike or Converse and those people?
''They sell the shoes; it's not the name Nike. It's the name Michael Jordan and the name Dominique Wilkins that sells. I don't know if they realize that they can do it.''
The narrow focus on sneakers is endemic to the sort of tunnel vision that often affects athletes in general and black athletes in particular.
In the past, black athletes were primed to catch passes, not to throw them; now they are encouraged to wear elaborate equipment, but not to make it, to play in stadiums, not to own them.
''We're all shaped and molded a certain way, especially black athletes, from Little League to high school, college and pro sports,'' Pearson said. ''All you see yourself as is an athlete. You don't really see yourself as a coach, or as someone running these concession stands that generate money. Power people see us as being participants, not the ones that set up these leagues, not the ones making any decison concerning the welfare of the league.
''We're just too caught up in being the athlete, and being the reason why there is a league.''
For all the focus on black athletes' selling shoes for Nike, the company, which had $1.2 billion in wholesale sneaker sales last year, bears a once-over.
Like other major companies, Nike manufactures its shoes overseas. It has factories in seven cities in the Far East and three warehouses in this country.
While inner-city youths supposedly kill over shoes they cannot afford, companies that could create jobs and generate money in communities that desperately need it open factories in Taiwan.
And one would think that a company with Jordan and Bo Jackson featured so prominently in its ads might also have significant numbers of blacks in key corporate management levels. No one on Nike's board of directors or any of its 10 vice presidents is black.
The company supplies shoes and apparel for 17 sports; each sport has a four-member management team.
There are two black managers: Harold White heads professional basketball promotion; Don Coleman heads track and field promotion. Those are two of Nike's most prestigious divisions.
''The black kids are buying these shoes but they're not really benefiting from high-volume sales,'' Pearson noted. ''The companies really have no input from that market, yet they seem to know what it takes to get these kids excited to want a pair of shoes.''
It is conceivable that in the next decade black athletes and black businessmen, two groups that have largely ignored each other, will launch the sort of undertakings that could begin to tackle the awesome task of ending economic devastation in the inner city. ''I can see that happening in the sports industry, such as manufacturing your own shoe line, your own clothing line,'' Pearson said.
''When I was coming through in the 1970's and the early 1980's, athletes weren't thinking in those terms,'' he said. ''Because they're making so much money now, athletes are thinking in terms of using their resources, their name recognition, to make something happen for themselves instead of helping somebody else to become profitable, then getting a small percentage of it through a fee.''
The issue, as it turns out, is not who wears the gym shoe but who owns the gymnasium.

Making the Piano Jump and Wail

BYLINE: By JON PARELES

 BODY:
Two pianists who were in on the birth of rock-and-roll headlined the first two nights of the Piano Blues Who's Who, a three-part series presented at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity in Brooklyn Heights.
The opening concert on May 17 featured Johnnie Johnson, who hired a guitarist named Chuck Berry in the early 1950's and stayed with him to make rock cornerstones like ''Johnny B. Goode''; the 81-year-old pianist Sammy Price shared the bill. And the May 18 concert brought the return of Harry Vann Walls, who was the studio pianist for Atlantic Records' rhythm-and-blues sessions with Ruth Brown, the Clovers and Joe Turner (''Shake, Rattle and Roll'' and ''Chains of Love''). Opening for him was his student and fan the New Orleans pianist Mac (Dr. John) Rebennack. 
All four pianists carry history in their left hands, which pump out the bouncing chords and boogie-woogie bass lines that made the piano a blues orchestra. Unfortunately, they all chose to work with bands, burying part of their two-fisted playing under drums in the church's tricky acoustics.
The 71-year-old Mr. Vann Walls was a worthy rediscovery. Working with John Dooley on bass fiddle and with Walter Perkins, the quietest of the four bands' drummers, Mr. Vann Walls revealed a clean-lined approach that made barrelhouse blues sound as calmly economical as a solo by Teddy Wilson. His left hand carried rock-ribbed unswerving chords; his right strolled above it with leisurely syncopated chords or shimmering tremolos.
In a gruff, hearty voice, Mr. Vann Walls sang a few blues songs, including one that promised, ''I may play slow, but I play for a long time.'' His trio was joined by Byrdie Green, who has been singing around New York since the 1950's. She has a clear, forthright voice that can turn sly and cutting a la Dinah Washington, and as she flexed the melodies of songs like ''Goin' to Chicago'' and ''Stormy Monday'' the trio cut loose; Mr. Vann Walls made the piano talk back to her with fancy filigree. Mr. Rebennack also sat in on guitar, singing about death in a blues full of sage humor.
Mr. Rebennack's superb set was a survey of New Orleans music, from the prison song ''Junco Partner'' to the Mardi Gras chant ''Iko Iko'' to Professor Longhair's ''Tipitina'' along with his own ''Walk on Gilded Splinters'' and his recent hit, ''Makin' Whoopee.'' While Mr. Rebennack learned about the blues from Mr. Vann Walls, he proudly carries on the extravagant syncopations and joyful floridity of Professor Longhair. He lavishes two-fisted counterpoint on a tune, with splashing, glittering, trickling handfuls of notes that never obscure the steady rolling beat; his approach recalls the architecture of the French quarter in New Orleans, where stately buildings support wildly rococo wrought-iron balconies.
The concert on May 17 was frustrating. Mr. Price worked with a drummer and saxophonist who didn't follow his beat, and he could be heard only in snatches. And the 66-year-old Mr. Johnson was held back by a generic blues-bar band, which gave its guitarist far too much time for facile solos and strained vocals. When Mr. Johnson's solos came through, he clearly still had the steely touch and splashy upper-register syncopations he brought to Mr. Berry's records. But his band made waiting for those solos a trial.

The Good Teacher: Accumulating Small Victories

Small Victories
The Real World of a Teacher, Her Students, and Their High School
By Samuel G. Freedman
431 pages. Harper & Row. $22.95
As national confidence in public education erodes, there has been a search on television and in films and books for the good teacher - Marva Collins on ''60 Minutes''; Jaime Escalante in ''Stand and Deliver.'' Last year, Tracy Kidder's ''Among School Children'' described a year in the life of a grammar school teacher. Now we have Samuel G. Freedman's ''Small Victories,'' an account of a year in the life of a high school teacher. 
Mr. Freedman's good teacher is Jessica Siegel, a woman in her 30's, single, childless, an English teacher possessed of no discernible sentimentality about her mission and yet much passion. Mr. Freedman, a former reporter for The New York Times, follows her through a single academic year (1987-88) at Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side of Manhattan - ''perhaps the most famous immigrant neighborhood in the world.''
For 150 years, the neighborhood around Seward Park has been a first home to foreigners, and it still is. Today's neighborhood signs are apt to be in Spanish or Chinese. ''Small Victories'' does not tell us very much about the special needs of immigrant children. Despite the fact that 90 percent of Seward Park students come from homes where parents do not speak English, Mr. Freedman does not evaluate debatable innovations like bilingual education. Partly this is because Ms. Siegel's students are seniors - most have been in America for several years and know their way through American English.
Here, windows are broken, classrooms are overcrowded. In 1985, an education task force, noting Seward Park's low test scores, ranked the school with the lowest 10 percent in the state of New York.
''Looking down the aisles and across the rows, Jessica sees the usual Seward Park stew, all the confusion an immigrant society can offer - an American-born black alongside a Panamanian who has the same pigment but speaks Spanish at home; a Chinese in pleated trousers and aviator glasses in front of a compatriot with crudely hacked hair and a second-hand sweatshirt; a Wilberto next to a Wilfredo; three Robertos . . .''
Mr. Freedman tells the stories of two immigrant students - both success stories - one Chinese, the other Dominican. What are we to take from such narratives beyond an admiration for particular achievement? American public schools have never treated the immigrant child particularly well - or any better than now -according to Mr. Freedman. Though some immigrants were culturally more able to make schools work for them, there was no golden age of public education, he asserts, echoing Diane Ravitch, the educational historian.
Seward Park is nothing in the public appraisal. Nothing but an educational Calcutta. Nothing but a big city neighborhood school, ''the catchbasin for poor black, Hispanic and Asian children.'' Seward Park receives proportionately less money from the Board of Education than selective magnet schools or special public schools like Stuyvesant High.
Why, then, do we seek out the story of Jessica Siegel and her ''small victories''?
At a time when college professors shy away from the notion of a common American canon, Ms. Siegel teaches her students the 17th-century Puritan poetry of Anne Bradstreet. Ms. Siegel succeeds because she will not condescend to the ''social disadvantages'' or ''cultural diversity'' of her students.
The most remarkable scene in this book comes when Ms. Siegel explicates with her class the nuances of a paragraph in ''The Great Gatsby.''
I've never read a rendition of the classroom as exciting as this. Ms. Siegel assaults her students with questions amounting to a reveille. Slowly students are awakened to what may be fine and accessible and useful in literature, and even pleasurable. High drama, indeed. Is Ms. Siegel typical of the faculty members at Seward Park? In a way, I think, Mr. Freedman wants us to believe she is. There is a sympathetic portrait of the school principal and another of a truant officer. One chapter describes the weekend job a history teacher must take - dressed in black tie as a maitre d'hotel at wedding receptions - to earn money enough to remain a public school teacher.
Of the students graduating from Seward Park, over 90 percent go on to college or trade school or into the military. So while one never gets a very clear sense of what goes on in classrooms down the hall, Ms. Siegel cannot be the only hero of Seward Park.
What her story does make clear is that teaching, good teaching, is a vocation, not a job.
There she goes with three students in a borrowed car, defying rush hour traffic to get to the State University campus at New Paltz, N.Y. Ms. Siegel has arranged interviews for her students with a counselor for economically disadvantaged students. She gets lost on the way; she gets stuck in traffic; the students arrive too late. (The university bureaucrat is poised to depart his office at exactly 5 o'clock.) And we care about Ms. Siegel's frustration. We care about her disappointment.
A book like ''Small Victories'' encourages optimism. Here is a portrayal of a selfless life in a selfish time. But Jessica Siegel's story should not bring easy consolation. Ms. Siegel has left teaching.
''I'm tired of working this way. . . . All I do is work. I have no life,'' she tells a fellow teacher. She cries when she tells her students she is leaving.
She writes a letter to her own high school teacher - beloved Gloryia Lenzi Okulski - who ransomed Jessica's adolescence a generation before. ''Sometimes I step back from the kids I have developed relationships with and think about how you performed that role for me 20 years ago in New Milford, N.J. I'd love to get back in touch . . .''

HEADLINE: A Savings Rescue Falls Short

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS

 BODY:
Lone Star Technologies had grand plans for turning around the American Federal Bank of Dallas after it bought the savings institution from the Government in late 1988.
Under the Southwest Plan, one of the Government's first attempts to address the nation's growing savings and loan crisis, the Dallas-based steelmaker received Federal support totaling $1.3 billion and expected to strengthen the institution's loan portfolio and quickly turn its attention to expansion.
But American Federal has fallen far short of those original goals, raising questions about whether the Southwest Plan, with all its Government financial support, will be the bonanza for investors that many first thought.
 
No Windfalls Likely
''Not many of these deals look like windfalls,'' said William Ferguson of W. C. Ferguson & Company, a financial consulting firm in Irving, Tex. ''I believe that history will treat the Southwest Plan deals with more charity than they have been treated to date.'' 
Although American Federal is modestly profitable, it is furiously trying to raise capital to meet new Government requirements, , and even top management says the institution is not yet a viable concern. Its experience illustrates the risks and overwhelming difficulty of turning around the nation's ailing savings and loans. Even though it provides generous financial support, the Government's bailout program cannot guarantee success.
In the case of American Federal, a string of unforeseen and unlucky events delayed its return to financial health: when a sluggish Texas economy led to the bankruptcy of Lone Star's steel unit, the parent was left unable to offer the savings unit much financial support. And when illness sidelined Lone Star's 42-year-old chief executive, the new management forced the resignation of American Federal's top executive and chief architect of the acquisition.
But the savings unit was also a victim of changes in Government regulations. Since the Federal capital requirements for savings and loans were increased, some of the 16 savings institutions that were consolidated under the Southwest Plan from 86 insolvent units are struggling.
With such dismal results, critics are saying that the Southwest Plan amounted to nothing more than a Government giveaway. Congress, for one, is objecting to the $11 billion in tax benefits and cash incentives that were given under the plan to entice buyers, and some legislators are urging that the terms of some of the deals be revised.
Indeed, L. William Seidman, chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told Congress this week that rising interest costs and falling real estate values have increased by $12 billion the cost to the Government of the Southwest Plan, which covered institutions that failed before a larger bailout was approved by Congress last year.
 
A Different Approach
The Southwest Plan differs somewhat from the one the Government will follow in the months ahead. Under the Southwest Plan, buyers were required to take all the assets of an insolvent institution, both good and bad. In return, many received lucrative tax benefits and promises of Government protection against some of the future losses from bad loans. Federal regulators chose this course because they lacked the cash to simply close the 86 insolvent units and pay off depositors.
But the deals came under such criticism as examples of Government largess that regulators changed their approach when they devised the latest bailout. Now, they are allowing buyers to bid for whatever they want from the insolvent institutions - generally, the most attractive assets are deposit franchises and performing loans. The Government is selling the unwanted assets, generally troubled real estate projects and loans.
But buyers in the Southwest Plan were not only stuck with having to sell portfolios of suspect real estate, they were also devastated by the savings industry bailout legislation enacted by Congress in 1989. By requiring savings unit operators to put up more capital in reserve, the laws undid the economic assumptions behind many of the Southwest Plan deals, forcing investors to reserve money that otherwise could have been used in rebuilding.
 
Many Tax Benefits
As a result, many buyers have enjoyed more in the way of tax benefits than in operating returns.
For instance, the Guaranty Federal Savings Bank in Dallas had a return in 1989 of only 1.07 percent on the $128 million investment from its parent, Temple-Inland Inc., a maker of paper products based in Austin, Tex. ''Our returns from our investment are mediocre, but the tax benefits are pretty good,'' explained Wayne McDonald, chief financial officer at Temple-Inland.
Of course, there have been exceptions. The First Gibraltar Bank, which was sold to Ronald O. Perelman, chief executive of Revlon Inc., earned a 44.52 percent return on capital last year, not counting its $900 million in tax benefits over the next 10 years.
But much lower returns are more typical, with many in the single-digit range and others showing losses, according to W. C. Ferguson.
 
Deal With Lone Star
The deal to buy American Federal was put together by William E. Gibson, a 45-year-old bank economist and former staff member with the Council of Economic Advisers. In late 1988, when the Equitable Life Assurance Society of the United States got cold feet about financing American Federal, Mr. Gibson turned to an old acquaintance, William Howard Beasley 3d, chief executive of Lone Star.
Lone Star agreed to put up $48 million for 80 percent of American Federal, with the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corporation taking the remaining 20 percent stake. Lone Star paid Mr. Gibson a finder's fee and put him in charge of the unit.
By selling bad assets, streamlining the 64-branch operation and attracting new deposits, the savings unit thought it would take in new cash, make new investments and grow. But American Federal had more problems than anticipated: its records were a mess, its portfolio of unprofitable assets not only included failing real estate properties, but a winery and a film-distribution company with rights to the ''Texas Chainsaw Massacre.''
 
Illness at the Top
Shortly after the buyout, Mr. Beasley was stricken with cancer and, last May, a board member, John Harbin, a former chairman of the Halliburton Company, a Dallas oil and gas service company, stepped into his position.
Mr. Harbin and Mr. Gibson are said to have clashed over how to raise additional capital. One company official, who declined to be identified, said that Mr. Gibson wanted to bring in outside capital and perhaps even do a leveraged buyout of the savings unit to raise the money, while Mr. Harbin preferred to have American Federal grow from within.
As a result of these and other disagreements, Mr. Gibson resigned last January. Mr. Harbin explained his departure this way: ''He's an economist and the bank needed to be run by an operating type.'' Mr. Gibson did not return phone calls.
Today, the mood is cautiously optimistic. To meet the new capital requirement, American Federal reduced its assets; the fewer the assets, the less capital required. In the past months, nearly $500 million in assets have been sold, primarly single-family homes, small apartment buildings, office buidings and raw land, reducing American Federal's loan portfolio to about $2.8 billion.
American Federal also cut operating costs by about $20 million by closing branches, eliminating overlapping bookkeeping systems and streamlining computer operations.
 
A Place for Profits
The institution is now profitable, although every penny of the $13 million it earned last year and the $7 million earned so far this year is going toward the savings unit's capital account, which must reach $75 million - $20 million more than originally assumed - by June to comply with Government regulations.
''We're not sitting here with our heads hanging down,'' said Allan D. Nichols, who was hired last month as American Financial's new chief executive. ''We are not now in the position to be a top-quality viable financial institution. But our current state of affairs is temporary.
''I feel like Vince Lombardi,'' continued Mr. Nichols, a 30-year veteran of commercial banking in Seattle and Atlanta. ''I feel that our game plan is good and we will win - if the game lasts long enough.'' Mr. Nichols now expects that American Federal will have the needed $75 million in core capital by June.
 
Transformation Planned
Eventually, Mr. Nichols said he hopes to transform American Federal into a bank-like institution that does more than traditional mortgage lending. He envisions that American Federal will make small-business loans, manage financial assets and offer such fee-based services as mortgage origination, insurance sales or mutual fund products.
''We're positive and enthusiastic about the future,'' Mr. Nichols said, in his office in a gleaming North Dallas office tower. ''We've got to finish up consolidating first and then move on to phase two, which is replacing our depleted assets with new assets and getting new income and building new relationships with new customers.''
He said he does not expect American Federal to reach phase two for another six months to a year.
 
Problems Remain
While Mr. Nichols is enthusiastic about American's ability to rebound with the Texas economy, he acknowledges that problems remain. Intense competition, particularly from remaining insolvent savings units that have not been closed or sold, has pushed up the rates needed to attract depositors. And many banking experts say the state still has too many banks and that Texas's economic recovery has been stubbornly slow.
And there is the larger question: How much will the Government ultimately spend to protect American Federal's depositors? Much of that depends on how well Mr. Nichols and other executives manage the business.
When the deal closed, Federal regulators gave American Federal $48 million and a note valued at $499 million. At that time, regulators estimated they would spend up to $800 million more - in agreements that provide cash payments to American Federal to recover losses on asset sales and to bring underperforming loans up to market yields. These payments are on a sliding scale that tapers off over time - and, as American Federal sells its troubled assets and replaces them with market-rate loans, this Federal income stream diminishes.
American Federal will not say how much it has received in Federal payments to date, but they came to about $40 million in the first quarter of 1990, and ran at about the same level in the 1989 fourth quarter, making the Government the biggest source of its revenues, according to filings with the Federal Home Loan Bank Board. Whether it continues at this pace and for how long is unclear.
''As we build our value from the marketplace, we continually lower our dependence on Government income,'' Mr. Nichols said. ''That's the premise we are built on.''

HEADLINE: New G.M. Concept: Thinking Small

BYLINE: By DORON P. LEVIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LANSING, Mich.

 BODY:
The General Motors Corporation did not grow into the world's No. 1 auto maker by thinking small or bucking the economies of assembly-line manufacturing. But G.M. has been trying to do both at the factory that assembles the Buick Reatta coupe, and G.M. executives now seem pleased enough with the result to consider using the system for other models.
Instead of being equipped to build 200,000 Reattas a year, the number long thought by American auto makers to be optimal for maximizing the return on capital investment, G.M.'s Reatta plant can produce only 25,000 cars.
And instead of installing the usual moving assembly line, along which each worker repeatedly performs one or two tasks, G.M. organized its work force into small teams. Workers perform dozens of tasks on the cars at various locations in the plant; the cars are carried between locations by computer-guided carts. 
Because a regular assembly line requires much more space and equipment than the Reatta process, the Reatta plant's capital costs are far lower.
The experiment, begun three years ago, was one of the most innovative among the Big Three auto makers in production on a small scale. Such production has become more important as the marketplace has grown more crowded with competing models tailored to smaller groups of drivers.
While the two-seater Reatta luxury car has not sold well, G.M. is generally satisfied that its manufacturing process is not only more cost-effective for building small numbers of cars but can also match larger plants in the quality of the cars and the performance of the workers building them.
''Most of the industry consists of mega-plants, but we could be seeing the beginning of a whole new concept - manufacturing modules of 30,000 to 50,000 units each,'' said David Cole, head of automotive studies at the University of Michigan.
Indeed, the Chrysler Corporation recently announced that it would produce a two-seat sports coupe, the Dodge Viper, to be sold in limited numbers.
If G.M. and other manufacturers can lower the costs of producing smaller lots, ''this could be an important way to remedy the collapse in volume of various domestic car lines,'' Mr. Cole said.
 
A Shortened Chassis
The $30,000 Reatta was designed to attract drivers who wanted a sporty car, like G.M.'s Corvette, but with more luxury, room and comfort. Rather than spend millions on a new chassis, G.M. engineers shortened the chassis design used on the Buick Riviera, Oldsmobile Toronado and Cadillac Eldorado.
Japanese auto makers have grown adept at building several car or truck models on one assembly line - some can produce cars and trucks - as a way to lower their break-even points by saving money on plants and tools. The Big Three auto makers, to a lesser extent, are also learning to operate assembly lines that produce more than one model. But adding models to one line also adds complexity for line workers and makes high quality tougher to maintain.
Mr. Cole said G.M.'s decision to build the Reatta itself ''was unusual, because any car built in so small a number normally would be given to an outside company.'' G.M., he pointed out, hired Pininfarina, the Italian coach-building company, to build the body for the Cadillac Allante, another two-seater automobile.
But there is a drawback to that idea. ''You allow some other company - not your own - to improve vital auto making skills,'' said Peter Van Hull of Arthur Andersen & Company's consulting subsidiary.
 
First Tried by Volvo
The idea for G.M.'s Reatta plant, which the company calls the Reatta Craft Center, was first tried by Volvo, which used worker teams to build cars at stations mainly as a way to make its employees' jobs more stimulating.
G.M. had another motive: recapturing a sliver of its huge loss of market share in North America during the last decade. G.M. is selling about 1.5 million fewer cars a year than it was a decade ago. Getting back even 25,000 of that number would be worthwhile. But because G.M. still wanted to increase profits, it looked for ways to avoid huge capital outlays.
Rather than build a new plant, G.M. decided to use buildings in Lansing that had made axles and other forgings for Oldsmobile until 1985. Instead of buying new automated machines, which had been done at a string of new G.M. assembly plants, engineers used older tools. Hand-held welders are used instead of new robotic welders, for example.
In all, the plant cost about $250 million, about half of what the cheapest version of a conventional assembly plant would cost.
 
Higher Labor Costs
The plant's labor costs, on the other hand, are higher than normal. Some Japanese assembly plants can build a vehicle in less than 20 worker hours, while some American plants require as much as 40 worker hours. The number of worker hours required to build a Reatta tops 40. ''It's horrendous,'' said James Rucker, the plant manager. ''I won't even tell you.''
One reason is that it takes far more worker hours to build a car when each worker must perform a variety of tasks than when each worker performs only a single task. G.M. knew that labor costs would be higher but that they would be balanced by lower capital costs for machines and tools.
One bonus is that workers have found their jobs more interesting. ''How many kids today want to drive three screws and walk to the next car?'' Mr. Rucker said.
Most auto workers on the usual assembly lines have one or two tasks that they perform hundreds of times daily as cars pass in front of them. As a way to fight boredom they sometimes trade jobs with other workers.
 
Nine 'Craft Stations'
At the Reatta plant, workers at the nine ''craft stations,'' each of which can hold three or four painted car bodies, perform several jobs during the 26 to 28 minutes the car is in each station. Craft Center 1, for example, installs electrical wires, heaters, air-conditioners, the emergency brake and the accelerator pedal; Craft Center 9, near the end of the assembly process, puts on bumpers and exterior body molding.
To as great an extent as possible, workers receive training on a variety of assembly jobs, which allows them to switch when they choose or to substitute for someone who is absent.
''There's a greater sense of ownership here for the workers,'' Mr. Rucker said. ''Ownership'' has become a cliche in personnel management to describe a worker's sense of responsibility and connection to the product.
Darryl McGaha, a 20-year G.M. worker, agreed. ''The work isn't more or less demanding intellectually,'' he said. ''But we have more authority, such as responsibility for making sure the quality of parts from our vendors is good.''
 
Workers' Good Reputation
G.M. chose the Lansing plant and United Automobile Workers Local 1618 to try ''craft station'' manufacturing because the workers there have a reputation for stability and reliability, as evidenced by the relatively low absentee rate.
''There's so many different things for one worker to do that it's impossible to teach a replacement in five minutes,'' said Ken Barnes, a G.M. worker. Most assembly jobs at regular G.M. plants can be taught to other workers relatively easily.
While G.M. is satisfied with the Reatta manufacturing system, sales of the car have been significantly below the goal of 25,000 a year. Sales totaled 7,905 in 1989. Sales through May 10 were 2,532, down from 2,750 in the corresponding period last year. So far, G.M. said, sales have not justified adding a second work shift.
Mr. Rucker would not say how many cars G.M. had to produce to be profitable. But at the current rate of 8,000 or 9,000 a year, he conceded, ''we're at the ragged edge.''
Many of the car's first owners did not like Reatta's touch-sensitive television-screen panel for controlling the air-conditioning, sound system and other functions, so Buick dropped it. A Buick spokesman said the company hoped that a new convertible version of the car would perk up sales.

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
A Bad Mixture For Policy Makers

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE Commerce Department's revision of the gross national product data for the first quarter of 1990 heightens the picture of an economy suffering from slugflation, a mixture of sluggish growth and inflation that is a kissing cousin to stagflation.
The annual growth rate in the January-March quarter was revised to 1.3 percent from 2.1 percent, and the inflation rate, as measured by a price index used to adjust G.N.P., was raised to 6.7 percent from 6.5 percent. These figures further complicate the fiscal policy choices facing both the Administration-Congressional budget summit negotiators and the monetary policy makers of the Federal Reserve.
The budget deficit has been worsening as the economy slows, revenues fall short, interest rates stay higher than expected and profits decline. How much can the budget summit meeting cut expenditures or raise taxes without thrusting the weak economy into recession? On the monetary front the question is: Can the Fed ease monetary policy without worsening inflationary pressures? 
The answers to these questions are judgment calls about the relative risks of recession and inflation. In the view of many people in troubled businesses like real estate, banking, autos and airlines, the economy is already in recession.
Public anxiety over the economy has been worsened by the Administration's latest estimate that more than 1,000 savings and loan associations, or about 40 percent of the savings industry, might have to be seized. And some worry that a financial crisis could spread to the commercial banks.
Yet the economy as a whole still has forward momentum. A majority of economists insist the economy is not in a recession now and will not be this year or next. The May consensus forecast of the 50 economists polled by Blue Chip Indicators is for 2 percent growth in 1990 and 2.3 percent growth in 1991. And 63 percent of the members of the National Association of Business Economists predict recession will be avoided in the next three years, thanks to what they foresee as ''effective monetary policy.''
But at present the Fed hesitates to risk increasing the rate of inflation. Some economists outside the Fed fear that the underlying inflation rate, stemming from wage and other cost pressures, is worsening and is being aggravated by inflation abroad. Stephen S. Roach, senior economist at Morgan Stanley, noting that the nation's trading partners have their own inflation problems, said, ''Global interest rates have risen in response, and so, too, have U.S. import prices.''
In Morgan Stanley's May Economic Perspectives, Mr. Roach argues that if the Fed does not check the buildup of inflationary pressures, for fear of ''wreaking havoc on an increasingly fragile financial system,'' the new cost-price feedback mechanism of a globally interdependent economy ''virtually guarantees a further aggravation of U.S. inflation.''
Yet the financial and commodity markets are behaving as though the inflationary danger is waning. Gold prices have dropped, and bond and stock prices have rallied. Oil prices have sagged. An airline fare war is breaking out. Housing and real estate prices are weakening, and they will be further driven down by the Resolution Trust Corporation's sale of real estate it has taken over. With the economy soft, the Research Center in Quantitative Economics of the University of Michigan expects a lower inflation rate in the next few months, and a ''cautious Fed policy.''
What would make it possible for the Fed to ease and bring down rates now? If the budget conference were to reach a compromise that market participants believed would work toward achieving equilibrium over the next few years, both in the budget and in the relationship of savings to investment, interest rates would come down, inflationary worries would be eased and the Fed would be liberated to help sustain economic expansion.
The reduction of American interest rates would also help ease the dollar down, spurring American exports and curbing demand for imports. The combination of a tighter fiscal and an easier monetary policy would, by reducing the cost of capital, stimulate greater business spending for new plant and equipment and for research and development, thereby raising American competitiveness. This would also give the Government the resources it needs to deal with such pressing problems as education, science and technology, health care, the homeless, urban decay, the environment and aid to Eastern Europe and developing countries.
In his first inaugural address, President Bush said, ''We have more will than wallet.'' But, as a new Brookings study, ''Setting National Priorities: Policies for the Nineties,'' puts it, ''The question is not whether America has enough wallet, but whether it has the will to use its abundant wealth to solve the problems it faces.'' The budget summit will be a crucial test of that will.

HEADLINE: Top Regulators Clash On Stock Index Futures

BYLINE: By GREGORY A. ROBB, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 24

 BODY:
The war of words between the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission heated up today as Richard C. Breeden, the chairman of the S.E.C., and Wendy L. Gramm, the chairwoman of the futures commission, appeared before the House Energy and Commerce Committee's telecommunications and finance subcommittee.
Though Mr. Breeden stressed that the agencies work closely, he told the panel that the S.E.C. could not adequately investigate intermarket fraud because it does not have the authority to get information from the futures markets.
''How can a fire inspector know whether there are too many people in a crowded restaurant if he or she is allowed to look at only half the room?'' Mr. Breeden asked. 
Mrs. Gramm countered that her agency receives daily trading reports from the futures exchanges and noted that the S.E.C. does not have similar authority in its regulation of the securities markets.
''When chairman Breeden talks about seeing one-half of the market, it's our half of the market he is seeing because of our systems,'' Mrs. Gramm said.
The Bush Administration has said it will ask Congress to switch jurisdiction of stock index futures to the S.E.C. from the futures commission, and Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, has endorsed the change.
Mrs. Gramm is outnumbered 3 to 1 on the White House's working group on financial markets, which was set up after the October 1987 stock market crash. But she has received support from members of the House and Senate Agriculture Committees, which oversee her agency.
The increasing bitterness between the agencies was also highlighted by the release of an S.E.C. staff report on the October 1989 stock market drop.
Central to the debate over switching the regulatory jurisdiction has been the role trading in stock-index futures had in the 1989 plunge. Though based on the same data as a report last week by the futures commission, the S.E.C. study came to a radically different conclusion.
The S.E.C. study found that index arbitrage and other program-trading strategies significantly accelerated and worsened the market's fall; the futures commission's study found no evidence of intermarket trading activity that would have hastened the stock market drop.
According to the S.E.C., stock-index futures floor traders did not provide needed cash that might have stabilized the market. Rather, the S.E.C. said, when the market began to drop, the traders were active sellers, representing 50.1 percent of the total Standard & Poor's 500 futures sell volume.
But Steve Manaster, the director of the futures commission's division of economic analysis, said that the floor traders also accounted for 42 percent of the buying volume.
Richard Ketchum, the director of the S.E.C.'s market regulation division, told reporters this afternoon that the two regulatory agencies were considering whether to extend the so-called ''circuit breakers'' that require temporary halts in trading after a specified drop.

Chilmark Stake In UJB Financial

 BODY:
The Chilmark Management Corporation, an investment management firm in Woodcliff Lake, N.J., said it had bought more than 2.2 million shares, or more than 5 percent, of the UJB Financial Corporation, a banking company in Princeton, N.J. UJB, which owns United Jersey Bank, has been hurt by the slowdown in the New Jersey economy, but has remained profitable. In the first quarter, despite a sharp rise in its reserve for loan losses and troubled loans, UJB earned $24.7 million. A year earlier, the company earned $31.9 million.
After trading as high as $28.75 in the last half of 1989, UJB's stock fell to as low as $13.25 earlier this year. It closed yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange at $16.375, up 12.5 cents. Chilmark bought its shares at $13.50 to $19.50 each. UJB has 250 banking offices in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania.

HEADLINE: Stocks Ease As Dow Dips 0.71 Point

BYLINE: By ROBERT J. COLE

 BODY:
Stocks weakened a bit yesterday amid signs that inflation is too strong for the Federal Reserve to act to bring down interest rates.
By the close the Dow Jones industrial average stood at 2,855.55, down 0.71 point, breaking a string of three successive new highs that began Monday.
Volume slid to 155.1 million shares, from 172.3 million the day before, with 791 stocks down and 725 ahead.
''It feels like a semi-holiday,'' one trader remarked. ''The market's slow and lethargic.'' 
The broader Standard & Poor's 500 index, which rose on Wednesday to within 0.51 point of breaking the record it set last October, sank 0.88 point, to 358.41, suggesting that many investors remained too skittish to move more cash into stocks.
Traders said that heavy selling of Philip Morris stock contributed to the weakness, after Harvard University and the City University of New York said they would sell their tobacco shares.
Although the Government reported yesterday that the gross national product, or the total value of goods and services, grew only 1.3 percent in the first quarter, weaker than the 2.1 percent initially reported, analysts maintained that the economy still remained fairly robust.
''We've been hearing about inflation going away in the last couple of weeks,'' said Tracy G. Herrick, economist of Jefferies & Company in San Francisco, ''but investors are still sensitive to it.''
He noted that ''the G.N.P. numbers had very little overall affect on the market, and it was doing O.K. when the numbers first came out.'' He went on, ''But when investors looked deeper at the inflation component, which stayed high, the market took a temporary dip.''
By 11 A.M., the Dow had slid 13 points, but by noon, it had bounced back 17 points and then seesawed its way through the rest of the day.
Philip Morris, the food and tobacco giant, which fell as low as 43 during the session, ended at 44 1/8, down a point, with 3.67 million shares changing hands. It was by far the most active stock of the day. Traders said that banks, insurance companies and other big investors lightened up on their portfolios of tobacco stocks.
Other tobacco stocks responding to the report were American Brands, down 1 3/8, to 67 5/8, on 447,200 shares, and UST, formerly the United States Tobacco Company, down a point, to 29, on 285,600 shares.
Early in the day, after the huge selloff, Ronald B. Morrow of Smith Barney, Harris Upham recommended them as a good buy, so some investors bought them back.
In another day of strong gains among the technology stocks, Motorola rose 3 3/4, to 83 3/4, after Rajiv Chaudri of Goldman, Sachs recommended the stock because the company had won $35 million in Japanese contracts.
Novell, reaching a high of 49 1/4, jumped 4 3/4, to 49, on 2.6 million shares, No. 2 among the most-active over-the-counter stocks. The computer company reported higher-than-expected profits in the quarter ended April 28. George Kelly of Morgan, Stanley and Louis Giglio of Bear, Stearns subsequently issued new buy recommendations.
Lotus, the software company, surged 2 3/4, to 36 3/4, on 1.5 million shares after Timothy R. McCollum of Dean Witter Reynolds and Michelle Preston of Cowen & Company issued new buy recommendations.
Quantum, maker of disk drives, rose 1 3/4, to 22 5/8, after reaching a 22 3/4 high, on 2.2 million shares. Douglas van Dorsten of Shearson, Lehman, Hutton raised his recommendation on the stock.
Dell Computer rose 1 7/8, to 12, on 2.2 million shares after reporting stronger-than-expected first-quarter profits. Microsoft, which introduced its new Window 3.0 software earlier this week and lent strength to the technology group, reached a high of 78 3/4 and ended at 76 1/2, up 5/8, on 2.04 million shares.
After reaching a high of 81 3/4, Nike, the athletic shoe company, closed at 81 3/8, up 2 7/8, on 763,000 shares. Josephine Esquivel of Shearson and Heidi Steinberg of Salomon Brothers recommended the stock.
Ms. Steinberg also recommended L.A. Gear, a Nike competitor, which rose 1 5/8, to 50 1/8, also in heavy trading.
Time Warner, the publishing and entertainment company, rose 2 7/8, to 107 1/8, after Mara M. Balsbaugh, leisure analyst for Smith Barney, issued a new buy recommendation. ''Entertainment stocks as a group have really come back to life,'' she told Reuters. Paramount Communications rose a point, to 47 1/2.
In the indexes among the smaller stocks, the Nasdaq composite rose 1.42, to 458.29, while the Amex market-value rose 1.11, to 360.76.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Treasury Securities Dip in Price

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities dipped in thin trading yesterday, as dealers sold securities after an unexpectedly poor auction of $8.5 billion worth of new five-year notes.
Bids at the auction produced an average yield of 8.54 percent, virtually unchanged from the average yield of 8.53 percent at the last five-year auction on Feb. 22.
But market participants and analysts said the results were disappointing because demand for the new notes was much less than anticipated.
Just under $22 billion worth of bids were received for the notes. Consequently, the ''coverage'' ratio of bids to notes sold was the lowest since the five-year auction in May 1987, said Raymond W. Stone, a managing director at Stone & McCarthy Research Associates, a Princeton, N.J. firm that provides analysis and commentary on developments in the foreign exchange and credit markets. 
Despite the weaker demand, the auction was not without its positive elements, Mr. Stone said.
To begin with, he said, ''it's the last Treasury auction of coupon securities for a month.'' He continued, ''In addition, it looks like Wall Street firms did not end up owning a big chunk of the issue.''
Performance in the credit markets tends to improve when dealer inventories are not swollen with unwanted securities bought at the Treasury auctions.
The new notes did not trade well after the results were announced.
Late yesterday the notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.57 percent.
''The issue was way overpriced before the auction,'' one trader said.
Market participants focused only briefly on the Commerce Department's downward revision of its estimates for first-quarter growth. Revision of the G.N.P. The G.N.P. revision, to 1.3 percent from 2.1 percent, was slightly larger than Wall Street economists had anticipated. But much of the reduction was a result of a more rapid inventory liquidation than had been estimated previously. As a result, Mr. Stone and other economists said that inventories replenishment should help to push up second-quarter growth somewhat.
''There is only a very small probability of a recession,'' said Francis H. Schott, senior vice president and chief economist at the Equitable Life Assurance Society. ''At the moment, I see no basis for the Federal Reserve Board to ease monetary policy.''
The downward revision caused prices in the secondary market for Treasury notes and bonds to move up in early trading. But the gains were wiped out following the 1 P.M. note auction.
By late in the day, the 8 7/8 percent bonds of 2020 were offered at a price of 101 17/32, down 14/16, to yield 8.60 percent. Late Wednesday the benchmark bond was offered at a price to yield 8.57 percent.
Among note issues, the 8 7/8 percent 10-year notes were offered at 101 5/8, down 9/32, to yield 8.62 percent. And the 8 1/2 percent two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 8.48 percent.
 
Slight Rise in Bill Rates
Treasury bill rates rose slightly.
In late trading, three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 7.66 percent, up three basis points, or hundreths of a point. Six-month bills rose by a similar amount, to a late offered rate of 7.69 percent.
In the corporate bond market, TRW Inc. offered $100 million worth of 30-year bonds through an underwriting syndicate led by Merrill Lynch Capital Markets.
The 9.35 percent bonds, which mature Sept. 15, 2020, are ''putable'' in 2000. They were priced at $99.65, to yield 9.40 percent, 83 basis points over the prevailing yield on the 8 7/8 percent 10-year Treasury notes at the time of pricing.
The issue is rated A-2 by Moody's Investors Service and A-minus by the Standard & Poor's Corporation.
In the secondary market for investment-grade corporate bonds, dealers said that prices of most actively quoted issues were unchanged to down 1/8 point.
Participants in the secondary market for tax-exempt municipal bonds said that prices of most issues slipped by about 1/8 point in very slow trading.
In other developments, the Federal Reserve Board reported yesterday that all three measures of the nation's money supply fell during the week ended May 14.
The report had no impact on prices in the credit markets.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Ends Session Higher On U.S. Official's Remarks

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar rose against most currencies yesterday on remarks by a United States Treasury official that the currency was probably undervalued except against the Japanese yen.
The comment, by the Assistant Secretary for Economic Policy, Sydney Jones, in a speech in Chicago, pumped life into what was otherwise a slow market.
Activity was dampened by the closing of major European centers for the Ascension Day holiday, and the approach of the Memorial Day holiday in the United States. 
The dollar closed in New York at 150.90 Japanese yen, down from 151.25 Wednesday, and at 1.6840 West German marks against Wednesday's 1.6760.
 
U.S. Economy Slowing
Earlier, the dollar eased after a report of weaker-than-expected growth in the United States gross national product during the first quarter. The report helped underpin the belief that the economy is slowing and interest rates will decline.
The 1.3 percent revised gain in first-quarter G.N.P. was below market expectations of 1.7 percent and down from the orginal estimate of 2.1 percent.
Analysts said the West German mark was the focus of further uncertainty over the political and economic impact of monetary union between East and West Germany, which is expected to take place July 2.
''The weak mark is lending the dollar a good deal of support at the moment,'' said Jeremy Hawkins, senior economic adviser at the Bank of America.
Dealers said the pound drew support from expectations of Britain's early entry into the European Monetary System, although many in the market say entry before the end of this year is unlikely. Governments of system members pledge to keep their currencies within certain ranges.
The British pound was at $1.6875, compated with $1.6950.
Although many traders think the British pound will enter the European Monetary System in a wide 6 percent fluctuation band, Commissioner Sir Leon Brittan of the European Community said yesterday that the pound should be subject to a narrow 2.25 percent band.

HEADLINE: Patients' Grades Help to Set Pay for Health-Plan Doctors

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
A growing number of large health-care plans are asking patients to grade their doctors: How long are they kept waiting in the office? Can the doctor be reached at night and on weekends? Does the doctor listen as patients describe symptoms? How well is a treatment explained?
Some health maintenance organizations use the grades as one criterion in paying the doctors. Not surprisingly, many doctors think this is a bad idea.
At least 34 million Americans are enrolled in H.M.O. plans, and more than 2.9 million are in plans that use patient evaluations to help determine doctors' bonuses. The number of such plans is steadily increasing. 
 
Attempts to Set Standards
Measuring patient satisfaction is one step in a growing effort to set national standards of health care, doctors and health-care executives say. It is also a way for the health plans to persuade clients that their opinions are valued, in the hope of keeping them as customers.
The plans pay doctors a set fee of $10 a month, on average, for each family member enrolled, no matter how much or how little care is required. The system is intended to discourage doctors from ordering expensive tests and procedures that may not be needed.
Critics say a patient's health may sometimes suffer because doctors are rewarded for withholding care to meet budget goals. Indeed, some people enrolled in the plans have complained of the difficulty of persuading their general-care physicians to refer them to specialists.
The H.M.O.'s say the patients' evaluations - the grades are excellent, very good, good, fair, poor - count for 25 to 33 percent of a doctor's overall rating. The doctor's ability to hold down costs provides 33 to 50 percent of the rating.
The balance of the rating reflects other measures of care, including an examination of patients' charts to determine whether the care seems appropriate.
Doctors with poor ratings lose out on bonuses, and some plans reduce the set fees the doctors receive for each member under their care. If the scores do not improve, the plans often stop referring new members to the doctors or simply drop the doctors from their roster.
U.S. Healthcare Inc., one of the first health plans to link patient evaluations to doctors' bonuses, said it drops 1 or 2 percent of its 3,600 primary-care physicians each year because of low ratings. It began the program in September 1987.
Dr. John R. Ball, executive vice president of the American College of Physicians, which represents 69,000 internists, objects to using patient evaluations to determine bonus payments. Improving a patient's health is more important than the patient's feelings of satisfaction, he said, adding, ''The kindly physician may not be treating the patient optimally, but the patient may feel satisfied and rate him highly.''
 
'Hostage' to Standards
Dr. James S. Todd, acting executive vice president of the American Medical Association, commented: ''Physicians should be paid for what they do, and if they do not do it properly they should be re-educated. They should be paying the primary-care physicians a reasonable income and not holding them hostage to some predetermined standards.''
But Maryann O'Sullivan, executive director of Health Access, a consumer advocacy coalition based in San Francisco, welcomed the idea of a report card. ''Anything that bolsters the doctor-patient relationship and educates doctors in establishing those relationships has got to be good for the patient's health,'' she said.
Health-care executives and economists say the health plans have strong business reasons for keeping their members satisfied. The plans rely on keeping a large number of relatively healthy members so that costs are widely spread. ''People who are essentially well are the basis of the whole thing,'' said John E. Ware Jr., a senior scientist at the New England Medical Center in Boston.
Dissatisifed members ''have feet -they'll walk away from you,'' said Leonard Abramson, president and chief executive of U.S. Healthcare. The company, based in Blue Bell, Pa., sent questionnaires to 909,000 adult members last year and received 201,000 responses.
Several of the nation's largest health-coverage plans now offer bonuses in addition to the fixed payments. And Dr. Michael R. Soper, national medical director of the Cigna Corporation's H.M.O.'s, said they had increased the doctors' basic pay under the new system.
The bonus systems are an attempt by health maintenance plans to find a way to replace the widespread practice of withholding part of the doctors' fees and not making full payment unless the plan meets its annual budget goals. If a plan agreed to pay a doctor $1,000 a month to treat 100 patients, for example, it might pay $800 a month and distribute the other $200 a month in a lump sum at the end of the year - but only if the plan stayed within its budget.
 
A Growing Practice
Plans that use the patient report cards as one measure of performance include U.S. Healthcare, Cigna, at least one Blue Cross H.M.O., some units of the Kaiser Foundation Health Plans in Northern California and AV-MED Inc., an H.M.O. based in Miami. The Aetna Life and Casualty Company, which has 1.5 million people enrolled in its health maintenance organizations, is planning a similar program, said Dr. David L. Potash, Aetna's vice president of medical affairs.
U.S. Healthcare also reviews patient charts to determine, for example, if children receive immunizations and if doctors order appropriate periodic tests, like checking patients' blood pressure and cholesterol levels.
The H.M.O.'s also look at such practices with an eye to holding down costs. When family-care physicians, internists and pediatricians are found to send patients to specialists and hospitals more often than average for those participating in a plan, they are often put on notice that they are exceeding the plan's budget goals.
The Kaiser Foundation, whose plans have 6.3 million members, said its medical centers regularly surveyed patients. In some Kaiser centers, including the one in San Rafael, Calif., ''the results become a basis of decisions on merit and bonuses,'' said Dr. David Lawrence, a senior vice president. He said Kaiser patients in Hawaii were surveyed in an ''exit poll'' as they left the waiting room after an appointment.
But not all the Kaiser surveys are directly tied to physicians' pay. ''We want to do better, to give feedback to the staff,'' Dr. Lawrence said. ''The emphasis is not on linking to pay, but on linking to performance.''
Some companies insist that the administrators running their employee health plans make sure their patients are satisfied.
''We don't want to lose sight of how the patient feels,'' said Patricia M. Nazemetz, the benefits director of the Xerox Corporation, which has signed up Kaiser, U.S. Healthcare and four other plans. ''They are required to measure member satisfaction on our behalf.''
She said Xerox plans to make its own survey of employees' feelings about ''the plan, the care, the access, the overall opportunity.''
 
Evaluations May Be Difficult
But evaluating the evaluations is not always easy.
Dr. Arnold S. Relman, editor of The New England Journal of Medicine, said: ''How satisfied patients are with the care they get is one of the important criteria of quality. But there is a lot of work to be done before we can be satisfied that we know how to measure quality.''
And one concern for doctors is that they often cannot control some problems that annoy patients, like delays in obtaining results of laboratory tests, said Dr. Donald M. Berwick, a pediatrics professor at Harvard Medical School and expert on health-care quality.
''The agenda we need in health care is to make the whole process better,'' he said. ''You can't expect doctors to do that alone. It's a joint task, the job of management.''

HEADLINE: Arafat, in Geneva, Calls on U.N. To Send Force to Occupied Areas

BYLINE: By PAUL LEWIS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: GENEVA, May 25

 BODY:
Yasir Arafat, the leader of the Palestine Liberation Organization, urged the United Nations Security Council today to send a new international force to the Israel-occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip to protect Palestinians and pave the way for eventual Israeli withdrawal.
In a long address to the 15-member Council, which moved here from New York to hear him, the P.L.O. chairman bitterly assailed Israel and outlined an approach for ending the violence in the occupied areas. Most of his ideas are unacceptable to both the United States and Israel, and in any case, no vote on his proposal is expected until after the Council returns to New York next week.
This is the first time that the Security Council, as distinct from the General Assembly, has moved here. The meeting was called by Arab nations to focus attention on the Palestinian cause and the recent wave of violence in the occupied territories, which started when an apparently deranged Israeli man killed seven Palestinian day laborers near Tel Aviv. 
By meeting in Geneva, the Council relieved the Bush Administration of having to decide whether to grant a visa to Mr. Arafat to come to the United States. Allowing him into the country would have provoked criticism from many members of Congress, who accuse the P.L.O. of terrorism, and would have further strained ties with Israel. But blocking him would have led to criticism from Arab countries and raised questions about the continuing American dialogue with the P.L.O.
Israeli officials have complained that holding the special meeting to hear Mr. Arafat is evidence of anti-Israeli bias in the United Nations. The meeting was called after the lone Israeli, a discharged serviceman, killed the seven Palestinians last Sunday, provoking violence in the occupied territories and in Israel itself, and leading to the deaths of about 20 other Palestinians.
The Israelis noted that no Council meeting was called after a leading Islamic cleric was killed this week in Kashmir and 30 other Muslims were slain by Indian troops in the protests that resulted.
Today, Mr. Arafat was unsparing in his condemnation of Israeli policy in the territories. ''The Israeli occupation forces,'' he said, ''have been waging a war of extermination on all fronts.''
The P.L.O. leader insisted that his organization remained committed to a negotiated settlement and that it would cooperate with the Bush Administration's efforts to bring about talks between Israelis and Palestinians looking to elections in the occupied territories.
In his plan for ending the violence in the occupied territories, the P.L.O. leader first asked the United Nations Secretary General, Javier Perez de Cuellar, to appoint a permanent mediator to oversee the peace process.
He then called on the Council to send a new international force into the territories to protect Palestinian lives and property and also ''with the purpose of ending completely the Israeli occupation of our Palestinian lands.''
Mr. Arafat asked the Council to order Israel to halt all new Jewish settlements in the territories. And he urged the Council to enact economic sanctions against Israel in retaliation for what he said was its mistreatment of the Palestinians.
Before he spoke, Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, told a news conference that his country has ''no intention of accepting any kind of United Nations observer force'' to protect the Palestinians.
But he hinted that it might allow a limited United Nations investigation into recent acts of violence in the territories, saying it had done so in the past after similar Arab complaints.
 
A Meeting Without Purpose
Later, he told the Council there was no justification for its meeting at all because the Arab nations had called the session with the aim of ''inflaming passions and inciting violence'' and not to promote a peace settlement.
The P.L.O. leader appeared in the makeshift Council chamber in his usual green military uniform, and kaffiyeh, the Arab headdress.
Both the United States and Israel made it clear today that they oppose any major new United Nations presence in the occupied territories. However, both left the door open to a more limited United Nations investigation.
 
U.S. Seems to Shift Ground
A senior American official said the Bush Administration might agree to let the United Nations conduct a small fact-finding operation in the occupied territories, similar to the mission it sent in 1988 after earlier Palestinian complaints of mistreatment by Israeli security forces. But he said the United States opposes any new permanent international presence there, implying it would use its Security Council veto.
This formulation of the American position appeared to modify the stance taken by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d earlier this week. At a Washington news conference, the Secretary of State raised Arab expectations by saying the Administration was now willing ''to discuss the question of a United Nations observer team'' if the Arabs asked for one at today's Security Council session. This suggested to many that the United States might accept some new and more permanent United Nations presence in the occupied territories, as Mr. Arafat demanded today.
 
'DISTORTIONS,' ISRAELI SAYS
JERUSALEM, May 25 (AP) - A senior aide to Israel's Prime Minister, Yitzhak Shamir, said today that Mr. Arafat's speech in Geneva was ''full of lies and distortions.''
''Here again, Arafat has used the United Nations as a platform for a vicious attack on Israel, making accusations that are full of lies and distortion,'' the aide, Avi Pazner, said. He added that Mr. Arafat raised ''proposals that he knows have no chance whatsoever to be accepted by Israel.''

HEADLINE: FOREIGN AFFAIRS;
A Two-Eyed Summit

BYLINE: By Flora Lewis

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The customary deliberate downbeat so as not to risk bloated expectations from an imminent Soviet-American summit meeting is the current Washington sound. And there almost surely won't be the grand agreements on arms reductions that President Bush optimistically anticipated last year.
But this isn't because the intricate treaties have run into roadblocks. The big difference in the approach to Mikhail Gorbachev's sixth encounter with an American President is that the purpose has been vastly enlarged. 
When the two leaders meet, the central issue will no longer be just reducing tensions, although that is already turning the world around. It is how to move to a whole new basis for superpower relations in an international system leaving the cold war behind.
Aleksandr Bessmertnykh, the new Soviet Ambassador to Washington, has an interesting formula for testing the summit meeting's success. It isn't the number of documents signed, he said in an interview, but whether Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev can part with each ''sincerely convinced that relations are on the right track. That will calm anxieties all around and leave each to focus on his domestic problems. Mr. Bush has some too,'' he said with a laugh.
The couple of years ahead are a historical crossroads, as important to coming generations as the years immediately after World War II were to fixing the scene until now. There is a fluidity that won't last after the critical decisions are made on Germany, on Europe, on international security.
As Mr. Bessmertnykh put it, ''we all have to find our places in a new structure.'' Moscow sees it as a ''stage by stage'' development and worries that the Germans ''are in too much of a hurry.'' He regrets the West took a firm stand on including a united Germany in NATO instead of ''sitting down and talking it over together,'' but he doesn't sound tough on this. The Soviet Union isn't looking for parity in Europe, he said, but for ''stability.''
Obviously, the idea of parity between NATO and the Warsaw Pact has been swept away by the upheaval in Eastern Europe. But the Soviets fear being left out in the cold. Mr. Gorbachev needs to take home to his people a sense that he hasn't given away the ramparts on which they were long told their security depended, but has traded an unsustainable order for new opportunities and a more reliable future.
This deserves American understanding. It is in our interest. The more the Russians relax, the less they menace. The West Europeans see it, arguing that a settlement imposed at a time of Soviet weakness could lead to a German-type syndrome, an aggrieved, resentful nation dreaming of revenge, as after the Versailles Treaty.
The extent of the reversal of perceptions is highlighted in a tiny item in the news. A generation ago, when the West was distraught about a Soviet ''master plan to take over the world,'' the Russians were claiming that ''as is well known,'' they had invented practically everything and were inherently superior. Now, it is reported, they have invited Americans, from Anchorage, to teach them how to make sausages efficiently.
But there's no scheme yet for settling the Russians - and whatever peoples they retain in their Union -into an open world in a way they and everybody else can be comfortable with. Mr. Bessmertnykh complained that by integration the West seems to mean Western integration, perhaps inviting some East Europeans to join.
Moscow is vague on its ideas, and emphasizes ''process.'' The Ambassador said it doesn't want to delay or obstruct German unity, but needs respect for Soviet rights, and that Lithuania is entitled to ''independence and sovereignty'' but through constitutional procedures.
The key is transition. On Germany, the outlines of an accord are emerging. Essentially, it will be economic, not only Bonn paying occupation costs to the Red Army in Germany in hard currency for a few years (mind-boggling, but coming) but also honoring East Germany's trade agreements with Moscow. Demolishing the East bloc's complex trade system overnight would be disastrous, but transformation is expensive and will take time.
The U.S. is right to insist that NATO, embracing Germany, is needed as far ahead as the kaleidoscopic future can be seen. Moscow will have to get used to the idea, but it needs help in the form of guarantees. It would like to institutionalize them in the 35-nation Helsinki framework. The U.S. is opposed to abandoning a successful security system for paper, but it could afford to add some paper on longer term goals.
The differences aren't so great if the need for keeping an eye on the ground and on the horizon is kept in mind. Too much is at stake for one-eyed diplomacy, but the prospects are good.

HEADLINE: Private Pension System Is Alive and Well

 BODY:
To the Editor:
On May 9, you published an Associated Press article about a Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation (P.B.G.C.) press release which identified the 50 companies with the largest underfunded pension plans (''Shortfall in Pension Funds Cited''). Unfortunately, that article gave a distorted view of the overall excellent health of the U.S. private pension fund system.
The aggregate assets in the private pension system were equal to 138 percent of total liabilities as of 1987 (the latest data available), and based on the latest available Department of Labor surveys, over 80 percent of private pension plans have assets that exceed their accumulated benefit obligation (termination liability). 
We believe the P.B.G.C. data are flawed in three major areas. First, the low interest rate of 7.75 percent significantly overstates liabilities and is well below prevailing market rates at the time of valuation. Settlement rates with major and healthy insurers were significantly higher at the time. Second, some companies appear on the list solely because foreign subsidiary and non-qualified plans, for which the P.B.G.C. bears no liability, were included in the study. Third, the article gives the impression that the figures apply to the total pension plans of the listed companies while the data were compiled from underfunded plans only, plans that in many cases represent just a fraction of the company's total plans.
For those company plans that are less than fully funded, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (Erisa) mandates strict minimum funding standards in order to insure that benefits will be fully funded during the remaining working careers of the employees.
While we support efforts by Congress and the P.B.G.C. to insure that workers receive their full pension benefits, we would caution against studies that oversimplify and therefore misrepresent an area that is so critical to current and future retirees of our nation. The greater risk facing the private pension system in the U.S. is the myriad of legislation and regulation that is threatening the viability of defined benefit plans, whose demise, all concede, would be detrimental to U.S. workers.

HEADLINE: Georgia Judge Rule Klan Is Persecuted

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ATLANTA, May 25

 BODY:
Calling the Ku Klux Klan ''a persecuted group,'' a Georgia state court judge ruled today that a state ban on the wearing of masks illegally restricted the group's free speech.
In a sweeping ruling, the judge, Howard E. Cook of Gwinnett County State Court, ruled that a 1952 Georgia law against wearing masks in public, enacted to curb the Klan's activities, ''violates freedoms of speech, free association and equal protection guarantees, as well as being vague and overbroad, and is therefore unconstitutional.''
Judge Cook ruled that widespread hostility to the Klan meant that members might need the anonymity provided by a mask to exercise their First Amendment rights without fear of reprisal. He also said the law impeded the Klan's ability to attract new members. 
 
Return to Old Ways Feared
The Gwinnett County prosecutor's office immediately filed an appeal with the Georgia Supreme Court. Lawyers with the county and the Georgia Attorney General's office expressed shock at the ruling.
''I take particular exception to the judge's characterization of the Klan as a persecuted group,'' said David M. Fuller, chief assistant prosecutor for the county. ''History has shown time and again the Klan is a persecuting group.''
Mr. Fuller expressed confidence that the judge's ruling would be reversed. But he said that if it is upheld, the ruling could have disastrous consequences.
''When this statute was enacted there were a lot of people being murdered and terrorized,'' he said. ''There was vandalism of property, and this act stopped that. If upheld by the Georgia Supreme Court or the U.S. Supreme Court, this would give the Klan carte blanche to revert to how it operated in the 30's and 40's. The Klan is not deserving of the anonymity the mask would afford it.''
The 1952 law, similar to laws in many other states, bans the wearing of masks in public, with several exceptions, including holiday costumes, sportswear or occupational face gear. It was passed by the Georgia Legislature explicitly to combat the Klan's anonymous terror.
 
A Deliberate Challenge
The case stems from a Feb. 28 challenge to the 1952 law mounted by Shade Miller Jr., an unemployed member of the Invisible Empire Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. After telling the authorities of his intentions a day earlier, Mr. Miller showed up at a courthouse in Lawrenceville northeast of Atlanta in his Klan hood.
He was arrested and charged with a misdemeanor violation of the mask law, a charge that carries a maximum penalty of a $1,000 fine and a year in prison. His lawyer, Michael R. Hauptman, who is president of the Georgia American Civil Liberties Union but is defending Mr. Miller on his own, then filed a motion as part of the criminal case charging that the mask law was unconstitutional.
State officials said they felt the law was potentially vulnerable to complaints that it was overly broad, but they were shocked by the judge's far-ranging attack on it. Judge Cook compared the Klan case to lawsuits involving the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People in Alabama during the height of the civil rights movement or Iranians here who wore masks at demonstrations critical of the Shah during his reign. He said both groups of critics were given legal sanction for anonymity so they could exercise their First Amendment rights.
''Persecuted groups and sects from time to time throughout history have been able to criticize oppressive practices and law either anonymously or not at all,'' he ruled. ''The court finds that the Klan is in effect a persecuted group in that its beliefs may be so abhorrent to most members of society that the Klan members and their families may be in the same amount of danger'' as the Iranian students or N.A.A.C.P. members were.
 
Shock at Judge's Comparisons
Mr. Fuller said the Klan provided no testimony that supported its claim of danger to its members. And he said that the issues in this case were not the same as those involving the N.A.A.C.P. and that the judge was making an inappropriate comparison.
Officials with organizations that keep track of hate groups said the ruling and the judge's logic were appalling.
''I sat through that hearing and I don't recall one shred of evidence that any Klansman had been lynched, firebombed or assaulted because of who they were,'' said Eva Sears of the Center for Democratic Renewal in Atlanta. ''A Klansman in a Klan mask does have an organizational history of violence.''

HEADLINE: Scientists Urge Rapid Action on Global Warming

BYLINE: By CRAIG R. WHITNEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON, May 25

 BODY:
A panel of scientists warned today that unless emissions of carbon dioxide and other harmful gases were immediately cut by more than 60 percent, global temperatures would rise sharply over the next century, with unforeseeable consequences for humanity.
While much of the substance of the report has already been disclosed, the report had immediate political consequences. Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain, breaking with the Bush Administration's skepticism over the need for immediate action, said today that if other countries did their part, Britain would reduce the projected growth of its carbon dioxide emissions enough to stabilize them at 1990 levels by the year 2005.
West Germany's Environment Minister, Klaus Topfer, has proposed that Europe should go further and cut present emissions by 25 percent by that time, but the United States has said until now that the scientific case for global warming - the so-called greenhouse effect - has not been made and that no action needs to be taken. 
Mrs. Thatcher's action is a blow to the Bush Administration, which was counting on her as its major ally in slowing any international action to reduce the industrial pollution that causes global warming.
The report by a working group of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was approved by all but a handful of the 90 delegates from 39 countries, said Dr. John T. Houghton, chairman. The report said that if nothing at all was done, the global mean temperature could rise 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit by the end of the 21st century.
It said that in that case, ocean water would expand and ice stored at the poles could melt, raising the level of the sea by 25.6 inches. That would be enough to submerge the Maldives and inundate the coastal plains of Bangladesh and the Netherlands, oceanographers say.
Mr. Houghton, Britain's chief meteorologist, said that only a handful of the scientists in the panel disagreed with the findings, which he said were dramatic confirmation of how rapidly the carbon dioxide, methane, chlorofluorocarbons and other gases released into the air by industrial processes, the burning of tropical forests and other factors had been changing the earth's atmosphere since the end of the 18th century. A draft of the report was previously disclosed.
 
Britain and U.S. Percentages
Britain, with 1 percent of the world's population, is responsible for about 3 percent of its carbon dioxide emissions, Mrs. Thatcher said. The United States, with 5 percent of the population, is responsible for about 25 percent of the emissions, American scientists say.
Prof. Bert Bolin, the chairman of the intergovernmental panel, described Mrs. Thatcher's action as ''very useful'' but said, ''It is not enough in the long term.'' If all countries did as Britain suggested, Dr. Houghton said, it would still not be enough to stop the enhanced greenhouse effect. ''If you want to stop it, you have to cut by 60 percent immediately,'' he said at a news conference in Englefield Green, where the working group discussed its findings this week.
''She has taken a kind of halfway position between the aggressive moves being considered by the West Germans and the 'What, me worry?' position of the United States,'' said Michael Oppenheimer, an atmospheric physicist of the Environmental Defense Fund of New York City, who was in a group of scientists Mrs. Thatcher invited a year ago to advise her on global warming.
 
Called Too Little Too Late
British environmental groups denounced Mrs. Thatcher's proposal as too little, too late. ''It does not even go as far as the very modest first step that the European Community proposed back in March of stabilizing emissions at the present level by the year 2000,'' said Andrew Dilworth, a spokesman for Friends of the Earth.
Mrs. Thatcher, in her speech at the opening of a center for climate prediction and research in Bracknell, said, ''It is no good setting political targets for action which are just not realistic in practice.'' Mrs. Thatcher, who had been briefed on the working group's findings earlier this week, said today that reducing projected increases in British carbon dioxide emissions by 30 percent in 15 years would mean ''significant adjustments to our economies - more efficient power stations, cars which use less fuel, better insulated houses and better management of energy in general.''
The working group's report is one of three that were commissioned in November 1988 by the United Nations Environment Program and the World Meteorological Organization for a global climate conference in Geneva in November. Another working group headed by the Soviet Union is considering the impact of climate changes on agriculture, forests, fisheries, water resources, and sea barriers, and the third, headed by the United States, is considering strategies for responding to climate change. Professor Bolin said today that he would not discuss the draft reports of either of them.
 
Cut of 60% Recommended
The United Nations group's report today said that just to stabilize atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide and chlorofluorocarbons at today's levels, there would have to be immediate cuts of more than 60 percent in their output. Depending on how much was actually done to cut emissions, it said, global mean temperature would still keep rising between 0.1 degrees centigrade (0.18 degrees Fahrenheit) and 0.2 degrees centigrade (0.36 degrees Fahrenheit) per decade.
Global mean surface air temperature has already increased by 0.3 degrees centigrade (0.54 Fahrenheit) to 0.6 degrees centigrade (1.08 degrees Fahrenheit) over the last 100 years, it said, with the five average warmest years all occurring in the 1980's.
Scientists who study global climate trends concede, however, that the computer models on which they base their predictions are flawed. While the researchers can measure gases in the atmosphere with precision, they have not perfected methods of predicting their effects on particular regions on earth.
So far, there has been only one major step to control greenhouse gases - the major industrialized countries' pledge last year to ban production of chlorofluorocarbons, used as refrigerants and propellants, by the end of this century because they rise to the upper atmosphere and destroy the ozone molecules that block most of the sun's harmful ultraviolet radiation.

HEADLINE: Prices of Long-Term U.S. Bonds Decline

BYLINE: By H. J. MAIDENBERG

 BODY:
Prices of long-term Treasury bonds tumbled yesterday in a shortened pre-Memorial Day weekend session. The Treasury securities market, which normally does not have fixed trading hours, closed at 2 P.M., Eastern daylight time.
Dealers said the sharp markdowns in prices of long-term Treasury bonds reflected the disappointing results at Thursday's auction of $8.5 billion of five-year notes. The notes, which produced an average yield of 8.54 percent, closed yesterday at a yield of 8.59 percent. 
But as is usually the case in a weak Treasury debt market, the most pronounced declines were posted by the longer maturities. For example, the Treasury's benchmark long bonds, the 8.75 percent issue maturing in 2020, were being offered at 100 29/32 at the close. This represented a drop of 20/32 on the day.
 
Yield Up to 8.66%
 The long bond's yield, meanwhile, rose to 8.66 percent, from 8.60 percent the day before, but was still below the 8.69 percent yield of a week ago. The Treasury's long notes, the 8 7/8's of 2000, declined by 11/32, to 101 9/32, for a yield of 8.68 percent.
But the $10.8 billion of two-year notes auctioned on Wednesday at an average yield of 8.52 percent closed down 3/32, at 99 31/32, for a yield of 8.51 percent.
''The results of the five-year auction began undermining prices late Thursday, but did not really manifest itself until this morning,'' said William V. Sullivan Jr., senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. ''Some of today's selling was probably caused by traders wanting to square their books before leaving for the three-day weekend, but there is growing concern about the market's ability to absorb the flood of Treasury debt. An increasing portion of this debt can be traced to the bailout of the thrift industry.''
 
Dollar's Decline a Factor
 Also unsettling the fixed-income market was the overnight decline in the dollar against the yen. The dollar fell below 150 yen for the first time since March 6. ''With Japanese stock and bond markets rallying, it may limit Japanese interest in our markets,'' Mr. Sullivan said.
Still another concern weighing on the bond market was the Government's release yesterday morning of data showing unexpectedly strong consumer spending in April. The Government said that April personal consumption expenditures were up by six-tenths of 1 percent, ''which was above expectations, given all the bearish economic data we have been getting for April,'' Mr. Sullivan added. Personal income for the month was up by three-tenths of 1 percent, which economists had expected.
At the short end of the Treasury market, the discount rate on 90-day bills rose 7 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, to 7.75 percent; six-month bills were up 4 basis points, at 7.75 percent, and one-year bills climbed 8 basis points, to 7.67 percent.
 
Thursday Auction Planned
 The Treasury announced that it planned to auction $10 billion of new one-year bills this Thursday. The sale would raise some $1.4 billion in new cash. The Treasury also said it planned to auction $6 billion each of cash management bills on May 30 and dated June 1 in two segments. Half the bills would mature on June 21 and the other half on Sept. 20. Cash management bills are issued only in denominations of $1 million.
The Federal Reserve, meanwhile, added $1 billion of reserves to the banking system to accommodate holiday weekend needs. The key Federal funds rate, which banks charge one another for temporary loans, was trading at 8.25 percent at the time the reserves were added, but later edged up to 8 5/16 percent.

HEADLINE: Home Resales Fell in April

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Sales of existing homes fell by 2.1 percent in April, the third drop in four months as mortgage rates remained high, a real estate trade group reported today.
The National Association of Realtors said resales of single-family homes in April totaled a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.33 million units, down from the March rate of 3.4 million. 
Sales of existing homes hit their 1989 peak of 3.56 million units in November and December and then fell in January, February and April. Sales were unchanged in March. According to the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, mortgage rates ranged from 10.25 percent to 10.56 percent in April. They had dipped to 10.33 percent by today.
John A. Tuccillo, chief economist of the realtor group, said the high rates were keeping many prospective buyers out of the market in hopes of future rate declines.
But despite the cost of mortgages, the sluggish Northeast market posted the only gain in April. Sales rose 4 percent, to 520,000 units, in what the president of the realtor association, Norman D. Flynn, called a ''buyer's market'' caused by supply exceeding demand.
Sales slipped 1.1 percent, to 900,000 units, in the Midwest and dropped by 3.7 percent, to 1.31 million units, in the South. But they plummeted by 7.9 percent, to 580,000 homes, in the West.
The realtor group said the national median price for an existing home in April was $95,300, down by 1 percent from March but up by 2.6 percent from April 1989. The median price means half of the homes cost more, half less.

HEADLINE: Quarterly Trade Deficit A 6-Year Low

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
The United States trade deficit shrank to $26.4 billion in the first quarter, the smallest quarterly imbalance in more than six years, the Government said today.
The Commerce Department said the 8.2 percent improvement in the trade balance in the January-to-March period resulted from record-high export sales that offset the highest volume of oil imports in more than 12 years.
The improving trade performance, if it continues, would be good news for the American economy. Over the last three years, rising exports have accounted for more than a third of total domestic growth, as United States manufacturers enjoyed an increase in foreign sales. 
 
The Growth Outlook
 ''We have continued strong export growth, and that is leading to better trade numbers than a lot of people were predicting,'' said Howard Lewis, the vice president for international economic affairs at the National Association of Manufacturers, the industry group based here.
David Jones, an economist at Aubrey G. Lanston & Company, a government securities dealer in New York, said export growth should continue to be an important source of strength for the United States economy for some time.
But some analysts cautioned today that it was too soon to tell whether the first-quarter performance would continue for the rest of the year. They said oil imports were surging because the nation's crude production had dropped to 25-year lows and that the strength of the United States dollar in comparison with the Japanese yen could start showing up in rising imports of Japanese products, which are cheaper in dollar terms when the currency strengthens.
 
Exports Up 4.7%
 For the first quarter, United States exports rose by 4.7 percent, to a high of $96.04 billion. Imports were also at a record level, reflecting the surge in oil demand. They climbed by 1.6 percent, to $122.4 billion.
Oil imports surged by 17 percent, to $15.6 billion, with the average number of barrels imported daily climbing to 8.9 million, the highest level since the third quarter of 1977.
The first-quarter trade performance marked the second consecutive quarterly improvement in the deficit. In the fourth quarter, the gap between exports and imports fell by 3.5 percent, to $28.7 billion.
The report today on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance-of-payments basis confirmed trends already noted in the department's monthly merchandise trade reports. They showed a first-quarter deficit of $23.9 billion. The disparity in the figures results from the exclusion of military sales by the Government from today's report, and includes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures.
America's deficits declined with several countries, including Japan, which was down by $1.9 billion, to $10.4 billion for the quarter.

HEADLINE: Rise in April Spending Topped Income Increase

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 25

 BODY:
Americans spent more last month despite a slump in income gains, the Commerce Department said today, providing a continuing stimulus for the economy at the start of the second quarter.
But personal income rose only by three-tenths of a percent in April, the smallest monthly increase in seven months, after solid gains of eight-tenths of a percent in each of the two preceding months. The last time a smaller increase occurred was September last year, when incomes rose by two-tenths of a percent. 
Spending, however, rose at a pace that was stronger that had been forecast, increasing by six-tenths of a percent last month, after gains of five-tenths of a percent each in February and March. The Government said consumers spent at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $3.68 trillion, making it the largest gain since a 1.2 percent jump in January.
 
Payrolls Fall $2.3 Billion
 Consumer spending acounts for about two-thirds of total consumption of the nation's output of goods and services and is closely monitored because a downturn can foreshadow a weaker expansion.
Manufacturing payrolls fell by $2.3 billion last month, a sharp reversal from March, when employees in goods-producing industries were paid $4.8 billion more than in February.
By contrast, payrolls in the service industry went up by $11.7 billion last month, after a $5.7 billion rise in March. Government wages and salaries increased by $2.8 billion, after a $3 billion March rise.
The Commerce Department on Thursday scaled back its estimate of growth in the first quarter of this year to an annual rate of 1.3 percent from 2.1 percent, largely because businesses cut production and sold off inventories.
 
Some Expansion Seen
 Analysts said the revised estimate left the economy in a position to continue expanding, albeit at a sluggish pace, while inventories were rebuilt.
Kathryn Kobe, an economist for Joel Popkin & Company, a forecasting firm here, said the rise in April spending was surprisingly large in light of other signs of declining sales.
''It's good news, except that we're already seeing weak May car sales so we're not likely to see a big pickup in durables spending continuing,'' Ms. Kobe said.
The sales of American-made cars and trucks in mid-May were 17.5 percent lower than in the comparable period last year. Total retail sales dropped in April for a second straight month after being flat in February.
 
'Low-Growth Scenario'
 Ms. Kobe said that policy makers at the Federal Reserve Board would probably not mind if sales eased.
''The fact that personal consumption is not real strong is good from the Fed's point of view,'' Ms. Kobe said, ''They want a low-growth scenario to keep inflation down.''
As a result, Americans' savings rate, savings as a percentage of disposable income, slipped to 5.5 percent in April, from 5.8 percent in March. It had been 5.5 percent in February, up from 5.3 percent in January.
Total disposable income, seasonally adjusted at annual rates, was $4.01 trillion in April, compared with $3.99 trillion the previous month. Savings fell to an annual rate of $221 billion last month from $234 billion in March.

HEADLINE: Your Money;
Retirees Need Investing Acumen

BYLINE: By Jan M. Rosen

 BODY:
For retirees, making the right investment decisions can be crucial because the income from investments must often replace earned income for living expenses. Consequently, most retirees feel they cannot afford to risk any loss of capital.
That makes it tough to make investment decisions, particularly for people with a substantial amount to invest for the first time in their lives, such as a person who has received a lump sum retirement distribution or a recently widowed person who has received insurance proceeds.
Experts discussed investing for retirees at the annual forum of the New York City chapter of the International Association for Financial Planning last week. Although the forum was intended to meet the continuing education needs of financial professionals, the advice can help individuals. 
''There is really no one way of handling it,'' said Connie S. P. Chen, a financial planner who is a member of the chapter's advisory board, adding that the starting point is to make a cash-flow projection, considering income from all sources, including pension, profit-sharing or 401(k) plans, individual retirement accounts and Social Security.
Then look at expenses. If they exceed those sources of income, calculate how much income from investments is needed to make up the difference. In this way retirees can determine what portion of their money to invest for current income and what portion to invest for capital appreciation.
Many retirees are afraid to invest for appreciation, because that can mean buying stocks that might lose value instead of gaining, so they want to put all their assets into safe havens like Treasury securities or certificates of deposit. What advice can be given to such clients? ''If they are going to achieve their goals in today's economy, they are going to have to take risks,'' replied Donald R. Pitti, president and chief executive of Seligman Marketing Inc. That is because the life expectancy of a 65-year-old man is 20 years, and it is longer for a woman, he said, and few pensions are indexed to inflation.
Thus, as the cost of living rises, people who are several years into retirement may need to increase the value of the assets in their portfolios that they can sell and reinvest for greater current income.
The risk can be limited by buying into a mutual fund with a good track record, Mr. Pitti added. ''There are at least a dozen mutual funds with a history of double-digit performance documentable over 30 years,'' he said. An aggressive growth fund would be inappropriate, he added.
Martin Jaffe, chapter chairman, suggested investing in serial maturity bonds and using any excess income they produce to build up an equity portfolio. ''It's not quick, but it will get you there,'' he said. Mr. Jaffe, who is senior vice president and chief operating officer of Wood, Struthers & Winthrop, the investment management subsidiary of Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette, elaborated on his approach afterward.
''I use serial bonds to reduce volatility,'' he said. ''I normally suggest allocation to meet income requirements,'' he continued, and bonds provide a predictable source of income. For example, if 70 percent of a person's capital will produce income for current needs, it can be put into Government bonds and the other 30 percent in equities.
But for those who may have been burned once and are afraid of the stock market, all or most of their money can be invested in bonds and the excess income used to build up an equity portfolio gradually. ''I've used it; it works,'' he said.
''Never take more risk than you need to take,'' Mr. Jaffe added. ''The only reason for equities is to have something that will grow in value to produce more income for tomorrow.''
Annuities appeal to many retirees. This is an insurance product in which the investment grows on a tax-deferred basis to produce an annual income. While annuities may fit into a diversified portfolio, care must be exercised in selection.
Jerome S. Golden, chairman of the Golden Financial Group, cited as risks their illiquidity and the lack of an inflation hedge. He recommended that people in their 60's select an annuity for a certain period, not a life annuity.
Another important consideration for retirees, he noted, can be disability. A person who becomes disabled may face burdensome expenses for care. Therefore, he suggested a retiree disability feature, in which the annuity holder accepts an actuarial reduction in normal annual income in return for a double payment in the event of disability.
One key to reducing risk is diversification. ''Build as much flexibility as possible,'' Ms. Chen said. One way is to invest in a family of mutual funds.

HEADLINE: Aid Resumed Too Argentina; Debt Talk Set

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
The International Monetary Fund approved the resumption of aid to Argentina yesterday and, at the same time, Argentina and its commercial bankers said they will start debt negotiations on June 7.
The two announcements are breakthoughs in the long-delayed effort to reduce Argentina's debt under the Bush Administration's debt strategy. With $62 billion in debt to banks, international institutions and governments, Argentina is the third-largest debtor among developing countries after Brazil and Mexico. 
The first discussion between the bankers and Argentina will focus on the country's resumption of interest payments. They have been cut off for about two years, and Argentina is now about $6.1 billion behind in interest payments.
 
Details Left to Negotiators
 Ernesto Feldman, Argentina's representative at the I.M.F., said in an interview last night that the monetary fund's board had given ''reassurances that in the framework of negotiations Argentina would resume regular payments to the banks.'' But he added that the ''sequence and size'' of the payments would be left to the negotiators.
Mr. Feldman said that the board was worried about the interest arrears but that Argentina's commitment to pay interest and the start of negotiations on debt reduction with the bankers ''was very helpful.'' The monetary fund has come under criticism for providing loans to countries that are behind in interest payments to their banks. Many bankers argue that this encourages countries not to pay interest.
The monetary fund's board approved the resumption of aid to Argentina that originally received approval last fall only to be cut off in February after the Government's economic program ran aground.
But in March, in another attempt to tame inflation, stabilize the currency and open its markets, the Argentine Government announced a new, tough program. In a statement, the monetary fund cited ''the forceful program'' being put into effect as the reason for the resumption of aid to Argentina.
The original aid to Argentina totaled $1.44 billion. The Argentines got $240 million of it last fall and will get another $240 million immediately. The $240 million payment due in February will be lost.
The final three installments of $240 million each will be available to be used in any debt agreement to provide incentives, like guarantees on interest rates or principal, to get bankers to reduce the level of debt the country owes. Of the $62 billion in total debt, Argentina owes about $30 billion in medium- and long-term loans to its bankers.
The resumption of the debt negotiations with the 13-member bank advisory committee was announced in a statement from William R. Rhodes, senior executive-international at Citibank, and chairman of the bank negotiating committee.
In a related matter, some bankers said yesterday that the meetings this week with the Brazilian Economics Minister, Zelia Cardoso de Mello, were disappointing. They added that there were no indications when Brazil would begin paying interest to the banks or when the country would try to begin negotiations with its bankers on debt reduction. Brazil is about $5.5 billion behind in interest payments.
But one banker, who asked not to be identified, said that Argentina's move to resume some interest payments could put pressure on Brazil. With reserves of $8 billion, Brazil is in a far better position to pay some interest than Argentina, which has reserves of only $1 billion, the banker said. The banker added that there was also growing concern about problems with the stringent Brazilan economic program, which froze about 80 percent of the country's bank accounts for 18 months.

HEADLINE: Black Unionists Cheer Dinkins in New Orleans

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW ORLEANS, May 25

 BODY:
Mayor David N. Dinkins was loudly cheered today as he arrived to address the Coalition of Black Trade Unionists meeting here.
More than 1,500 workers from 76 international and national unions were expected to attend the weekend event. 
Mr. Dinkins expressed his gratitude to the coalition for their longstanding support, and then spoke of a new mood of ''mutual respect'' in New York City.
''The voices of the great, vast majority of New Yorkers are rising in a chorus that demands an end to bigotry and bias, injustice and violence,'' he said.
Mr. Dinkins also criticized the Federal Government's urban policies.
''For 10 long, hard years,'' he said, ''our national government has treated cities as if we were from another planet.''
He called for more Federal funds for cities, and said he hoped to address that issue next fall when he convenes a meeting of mayors from throughout the nation for the purpose of creating a national urban agenda.

HEADLINE: New Jersey Suburbs Attack Florio's Plan to Shift Their School Aid

BYLINE: By ROBERT HANLEY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HACKENSACK, N.J., May 25

 BODY:
Gov. Jim Florio's proposed plan to shift tens of millions of dollars in state education aid from prosperous suburban school systems to poorer urban and rural districts was sharply criticized by surburban school officials today as unfair, divisive and shortsighted.
''He's made a political and economic statement that shows no understanding of what it takes to educate kids for the 21st century,'' said Dr. Vincent Doyle, school business administrator for Teaneck, one of the 63 towns in suburban Bergen County that will begin losing at total of nearly $100 million in state money in the 1992-93 school year.
''All he's saying is this is how much money is in the pie - you 600 districts go fight for it,'' Mr. Doyle said. ''It completely misfocuses on the needs of all the state's kids - Camden's kids, Teaneck's kids and the kids in between.'' 
By mid-1996, Teaneck would loose $5.6 million of its current annual state aid of $9.4 million.
 
'It's Devestating for Education'
Like other critics, Mr. Doyle extolled the part of Mr. Florio's plan that would pump millions of dollars into inner-city schools. But, he said, the money should not be taken from high-achieving suburban systems already buffeted by residents' anger over increasing property taxes and Governor Florio's proposed income tax increases.
Ridgewood, another of Bergen's highly regarded districts, would lose half of its annual $7.8 million in state aid under the plan.
''It's devastating for education in Ridgewood,'' said its superintendent, Frederick J. Stokley. ''We're going to have to make up $3.9 million. Excellent school systems in the state will become mediocre. I don't agree with the theory of tearing down school systems with high commitment to education to solve the problems of the inner cities.''
Statewide, 356 systems, primarily those in inner cities and the sparsely settled outlying reaches of the state, would start receiving more aid in the 1991-92 school year from nearly $1 billion in Mr. Florio's proposed income tax increases.
However, 222 other school districts, predominately middle class and upper income, would receive no new aid for 1991-92, and then lose a total of $227 million over the next four years. The cuts would come in 25 percent reductions each year off the 1991-92 level.
One of the 222 is Hackensack, county seat of hard-hit Bergen County and an urban district where 60 percent of the 3,500 students are black or Hispanic. It would lose $5.8 million of its current $8.6 million in state aid by June 1996.
''I'm stunned,'' said Hackensack's superintendent, Anthony Marseglia. ''For a community like ours, it would absolutely destroy our system and the economy of the community would go awry. We'd be looking at increasing taxes a million and a half dollars a year. Many of our people are blue collar or retired on fixed incomes and they're already up in arms over property taxes.''
While Bergen's schools would face the deepest cuts, other suburban districts across the northern half of the state would be cut as well. Wayne, a rapidly growing middle-class suburb in northern Passaic County, would lose $7.3 million of its $11.4 million in state aid by mid-1996. Princeton, one of the state's premier districts, would lose $3.1 million of $4.2 million.
Money for State-Mandated Programs Like a growing number of suburban school executives, Princeton's business administrator, Dr. Robert Rader, complained about aid cuts and increased costs for what he said are educationally superfluous state-mandated programs, like testing schools for radon and digging up aging oil storage tanks.
''We spend a lot of money complying with state requirements that don't improve the education of our students,'' Dr. Rader said. ''If they're going to take away our aid, then take away some of these requirements.''
Princeton and Wayne are among 151 districts deemed too prosperous to receive money under the Governor's new funding system, called foundation aid. What determines whether a district qualifies is its property value per pupil and its personal income per pupil. The 356 districts that would receive foundation aid generally fall below the state average for property value and income. The 151 that do not qualify and another 71 districts that would receive smaller amounts of foundation aid than what they now receive from the state in other aid generally exceed the state average.
These 222 districts would be guaranteed that their 1991-92 state aid levels would match 1990-91 levels. Then four years of cuts would start in 1992-93, and the money cut would go to increase foundation aid to other districts.
Governor Florio's chief education advisor, Thomas B. Corcoran, today defended the proposed shifts in aid, saying the 356 districts that would get increases have 73.5 percent of the state's 1.1 million school children. The other 222, he said, are best able to endure the cuts.
''These are the districts that are wealthiest, and it's fair they should pay their fair share,'' Mr. Corcoran said. ''Plus, the reductions are going to be phased in over four years, so it shouldn't have that big an impact.''
Of the $969 million in foundation aid to be shared by 356 urban and rural districts, 41.5 percent, or about $402 million, will go to the state's 20 poorest cities, including Newark, Jersey City, Paterson, Elizabeth, Camden, Perth Amboy, Trenton, East Orange, Millville and Vineland.
The only current state spending that would not be included in the foundation aid system would be for transportation and special education. No districts would be cut in these areas.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
Gorbachev's Need: To Still Matter

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 26

 BODY:
What President Mikhail S. Gorbachev seems to need most of all from the Washington summit meeting that begins on Wednesday is not arms control or economic aid, not agreement on Germany or sympathy on Lithuania, but proof that he still matters.
A crowd-pleasing performance in America may no longer be enough to distract the Soviet public from its woeful domestic obsessions, but it is only on the international stage these days that Mr. Gorbachev seems to his own people a commanding figure, a shaper of the world. He has never needed that reminder more.
 
Anxiety at Profound Change
It is not that any particular rival threatens his place, or that any faction is poised to overthrow him. His five-year term as President runs until March 1995. But his authority seems to be dissolving beneath him as his popular support slackens and he struggles to keep pace with events. 
People who once viewed any threat to Mr. Gorbachev with alarm, believing that everything depended on him, have now begun to contemplate life after Gorbachev, or at least a life in which Mr. Gorbachev is an officeholder with no real power.
The Soviet leader's comrades say Mr. Gorbachev is not suffering a crisis of trust, simply the natural anxiety that accompanies profound change.
''Of course, the euphoria dies when the leadership starts doing unpopular things,'' Yevgeny M. Primakov, a member of Mr. Gorbachev's Cabinet, said in an interview. ''But at the same time that does not mean we are weak. We are strong enough to continue this course.''
Yegor Yakovlev, editor of the reformist Moscow News, points to the astonishing transformations that have taken place in the last year alone. New political parties are being born, the Communist autocracy is giving way to a constitutional presidency and the Government talks of building a market economy on the ruins of Communist planning.
''Where you see chaos, I perceive the dismantling of the old system,'' the editor wrote in this week's issue.
Indeed, that has been Mr. Gorbachev's style - to instigate a kind of havoc and trust in his own ability to sort out the disorder.
Yet on all fronts - the unraveling of the Communist political system, the dissolution of the Eastern bloc, the cascade of economic discontents - it seems that the breakdown of the old order is accelerating faster than something stable can be built in its place.
 
A Time of 3 Crises, All Coming Home
 The summit takes Mr. Gorbachev from Moscow at a time when three major political crises are coming home at once.
His Government's new economic plan is already under fire from consumers alarmed by the promise of price rises, and by market advocates who say the five-year transition program takes too long to dismantle central planning.
Lithuania is due to run out of oil any day as a result of a selective economic blockade imposed by Mr. Gorbachev to punish the republic's declaration of independence.
And his political nemesis, Boris N. Yeltsin, has mounted a strong challenge for control of the largest Soviet republic, Russia. Even if Mr. Yeltsin falls short, the new Russian Parliament has shown a strong inclination to lessen the republic's subservience to Soviet economic and political managers.
''Yeltsin is a bigger problem for Gorbachev than Bush, because he's right here,'' said Leonid Gurevich, a journalist and a deputy from Murmansk, aptly summing up the priority list of Mr. Gorbachev's headaches.
 
Holding the Center: Soviet Tug-of-War
 Politically, Mr. Gorbachev has tried to hold a stable center as the country polarizes into rival camps of radical change and resistance.
Mr. Gorbachev has alienated a broad alliance of self-styled democrats who have proven substantial popular support at the ballot box and who now control such important enclaves as the Moscow and Leningrad City Governments.
These groups have pushed for innovations like market economics and a multiparty system long before Mr. Gorbachev publicly endorsed them, and have reaped the rewards in public support.
The Soviet leader and his supporters disparage the democratic opposition as ambitious and irresponsible sniping from the sidelines.
As this group grows in strength and self-confidence, and moves from the sidelines into the city halls, it is more and more inclined to regard Mr. Gorbachev as a slightly passe elder statesman and to resent American fascination with the Soviet leader.
''You are all so infatuated with Gorbachev,'' scolded a middle-aged man marching through Red Square on May Day as part of an unofficial column organized by groups demanding greater democracy.
The man was earnest and clean cut, a little embarrassed by the crowd around him that hooted and yelled at Mr. Gorbachev and the other Soviet leaders assembled atop Lenin's mausoleum. But he was sympathetic to their message.
''It seems to me that Gorbachev has brought us this far, but he is not the leader of the future,'' he said. ''It will not be long before he leaves the political stage.
''People like Popov are the wave of the future,'' he said of Gavriil K. Popov, the market economist named head of the Moscow City Council.
The striking thing was that the man was not a dissident or a Westernized intellectual, but a major in the Ministry of Internal Affairs.
Sergei A. Kovalyov, a close confidant of the late human rights campaigner Andrei D. Sakharov and now a member of the Russian republic's Parliament, contends that the Western reluctance to pressure Mr. Gorbachev on issues like Lithuania is shortsighted.
Without Western pressure, he said, the Soviet leader is freer to appease his hard-liners in the party and military, and in doing so he slips farther behind the public mood.
''Up to a certain point, Gorbachev's evolution inspired us to hope,'' Mr. Kovalyov said. ''But he always acts too late. And I don't know whether he's capable of really learning, or only of adapting.''
On issue after issue, Mr. Gorbachev has slipped behind the changes he once seemed to lead.
 
The Cry of 'Gorby! May Be a Lost Chant
 Just last fall, East German youths were chanting ''Gorby! Gorby!'' and hopeful democrats around the Eastern bloc saw him as their liberator and model. Now Mr. Gorbachev's Soviet Union lags behind its former allies in political and economic daring, and some citizens here are beginning to bemoan the loss of the European order they feel that they won in World War II.
At home, Mr. Gorbachev gave the country the closest thing it has had to free elections, but in assuming a new presidency this year he did not dare stand for election himself.
The result is that he governs without a mandate, and is fearful of using his new presidential powers to push through unpopular measures.
Critics say that he seems more remote from public opinion and that Mr. Gorbachev's hubris sometimes seems to blind him to simple political niceties.
This week, Moscow grocery shoppers snorted with indignation as their leader accepted a pay raise and appeared on television squiring Princess Anne through the Kremlin while his Government was announcing plans to triple bread prices.
''Before he listened,'' said a Soviet journalist. ''Now he only listens to himself.''
 
Out in the Cold On the Economy
 On the economy, Mr. Gorbachev experimented with half-measures for five years until the shortages, plummeting productivity, strikes and technological backwardness had discredited the very idea of a planned economy. But his experiments have squandered the good will necessary to sell the public a more sweeping and more painful transformation.
Mr. Gorbachev has so far kept his distance from the economic plan disclosed this week, letting his Prime Minister, Nikolai I. Ryzhkov, take most of the heat.
The prevailing opinion in Moscow is that if the economic plan is put to a public referendum, as some senior officials promised this week, both the plan and Mr. Ryzhkov would be out in the cold.
''This Government will fall because it is unwilling to introduce a market,'' predicted Igor Gryazin, an Estonian deputy in the Soviet Parliament and a free-market advocate. ''The next government will fall because it will introduce a market. Then we''ll have the third government, and maybe things will start to be normal.''
Whether Mr. Gorbachev will ride out this period of falling prime ministers, Mr. Gryazin added, is of no great consequence, ''because he will in any case be powerless.''
To address the challenge of his assertive ethnic minorities, Mr. Gorbachev now promises to remake the Soviet Union into a loose federation, where each republic would govern itself while delegating matters like defense and communications to the center. Even a year ago, such a proposal might have been hailed as a stroke of genius.
But before he has even produced a draft of this new ''union treaty,'' he has already effectively lost several republics. The three Baltic states have declared they want no part of any union, and others have begun to flout Moscow's will on issues like the military draft.
 
Even a Struggle For Russia Itself
 This week Mr. Gorbachev was struggling for control over Russia itself, the republic containing more than half the Soviet population and three-fourths of its territory, as the Russian Parliament mulled plans to put the republic's laws above Soviet law.
Some scholars look beyond Mr. Gorbachev and foresee the disintegration of the soviet union.
Valery L. Makarov, director of a leading research center, the Central Economics and Mathematics Institute, said Moscow was so incapable of imposing uniform laws across its domain that the Soviet Union would ''inevitably'' dissolve.
''Every republic will introduce its own currency, its own banking system, its own monetary system,'' he said in an interview. ''some countries - that is, some republics - will move to a market economy more quickly, others more slowly.''
Public-opinion polls show the populace to be pessimistic, impatient and mistrustful of authority, especially the authority of the Communist Party.
One of the most potent new documentary films, ''This Is No Way to Live,'' raises the question of whether the Communist Party should be subjected to trial along the lines of Nuremberg.
After a recent preview at the cinematographer's union, the director Stanislav Govorukhin said he did not support a criminal trial because ''the moral trial of the party is already under way.''
The federal authorities resisted releasing Mr. Govorukhin's film, but this week the Moscow City Council overrode the central authorities to let it open. The director was wistful about the impotence of the censors.
''Authorities in this country have become so weak that they cannot even prohibit a movie.'' he said. ''But if authorities are unable to do something simple and bad, it implies they are also incapable of doing something simple and good.
''The institutional structure of authority in this country has weakened dramatically, and it makes me feel more sorrow than happiness.''
 
Who Gets Blamed? The Party, It Seems
 The polling data show that the Communist Party is blamed most of all for the country's crises, but that people are also losing faith in the newer institutions that Mr. Gorbachev has introduced to supplant the party, like the Parliament, and in Mr. Gorbachev himself.
''As far as the leader's personal prestige is concerned, it is impossible not to see that its peak has been left behind, in the time of the cloudless hopes of the 'original' perestroika,'' said Yuri Levada, a poll taker writing in Moscow News.
Those who call for Mr. Gorbachev to step down are a small minority, and those who see an available replacement are even fewer.
The critics' message to the West is not to abandon Mr. Gorbachev but not to let him off so easy.
''Well, all right, focus on Gorbachev,'' said Mr. Kovalyov. ''But then force him to make the right steps. And don't greet everything he does with cries of hurrah. I think the tendency in the West now is to justify every obvious blunder of Gorbachev's by his difficult circumstances, by the fact that he's not free, and to rouse enthusiasm over every little step he makes in the right direction. I think Sakharov was right in saying that the best help for Gorbachev is constructive criticism.''
 
 
 
THE PEOPLE'S PESSIMISM
 Opinion polling in the Soviet Union has been fragmentary over the last few years, but has been gaining in respectability, scope and methodological rigor. Here is a sampler of results of opinion polls of Soviet citizens, based on varying methods of interviewing and covering different parts of the Soviet Union.
May 1988: 73 percent of Muscovites with telephones say they strongly support perestroika, and 23 percent say they support it with reservations; 40 percent say their standard of living in the next five years will improve because of perestroika, and 18 percent say they think things will get worse. - Telephone pollMoscow residents conducted by the Institute for Sociological Research of the Soviet Academy of Sciences for The New York Times and CBS News.
June 1988: 73 percent of poll respondents say that ''instead of real perestroika, we are just having a lot of talk''; 3 percent say they feel there have been ''major achievements'' in the economy, while 35 percent say that ''practically nothing has been achieved'' on the economy. - Poll conducted by the Institute for Sociological Research of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. More than 11,000 people at 120 main industrial plants were interviewed.
March 1989: Tatyana Zaslavskaya, a top Soviet sociologist, says polls show that 80 percent of respondents said they believe that perestroika is proceeding slowly.
October 1989: 90 percent of poll respondents say they consider the nation's economic situation bad or critical, and a majority say Mr. Gorbachev's policies are at least as responsible as the mistakes of his predecessors; 52 percent say the country's economic situation has grown ''significantly worse'' in the last two or three years. - Poll conducted by the National Public Opinion Research Center, Moscow, in 16 large and small Soviet cities.
March 1990: In a poll, 41 percent of respondents in a poll said they favor rapid change, while 35 percent favor a slower pace; 19 percent said the Communist Party always acted in the people's interest, while 18 percent said it never did. Almost 50 percent said they were satisfied with their own lives. - Nationwide poll conducted by the National Public Opinion Research Center in Moscow; Emory University in Atlanta and the University of Pennsylvania.

RUSSIAN MAVERICK AGAIN FAILS TO WIN TOP REPUBLIC POST

BYLINE: By BILL KELLER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 26

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin narrowly failed today in a second round of voting for the presidency of Russia, after a day of political passions and intrigues that left the fates of the outspoken candidate and the largest Soviet republic in doubt.
Mr. Yeltsin, whose campaign for Russian sovereignty is a direct challenge to the authority of the Soviet President, Mikhail S. Gorbachev, outpolled a Communist Party hard-liner in a runoff election in the Russian Parliament, but he fell 28 votes short of the majority required for victory.
He said he would try again when the Parliament reconvenes on Monday. If that ballot also proves inconclusive, he said he would invite rival factions in Parliament to begin negotiating a power-sharing arrangement for the Russian government. 
 
Truce With Gorbachev Urged
Some of Mr. Yeltsin's supporters predicted an outpouring of public support that might turn up the needed votes by the end of the weekend. But strategists from the Communist Party apparatus were expected to put forward a more moderate candidate next time, in hopes of stealing votes from Mr. Yeltsin.
''Too many people believe in me, and their confidence cannot be betrayed,'' Mr. Yeltsin told reporters, when asked if he would drop from the race.
''If the Parliament cannot decide, the decision must be made by the people,'' he said later, renewing his call for the presidency to be filled in a general election that he would be strongly favored to win.
Mr. Yeltsin called on Mr. Gorbachev to put aside their bitter rivalry and suggest a compromise on the future of the Russian republic.
 
A Humiliating Sendoff
''He can at least refrain from using the words he directed at me in this hall,'' Mr. Yeltsin said. ''He has lost face in the eyes of the country and the world.''
Mr. Gorbachev is scheduled to leave Moscow on Tuesday for Canada and then travel to the United States, and a Yeltsin victory would be a humiliating sendoff. The two men have been public rivals since the Soviet leader jettisoned Mr. Yeltsin from the Communist Party Politburo in 1988.
Mr. Gorbachev has thrown his personal prestige into the Russian contest, vilifying Mr. Yeltsin in a speech to the Parliament on Wednesday. Throughout the week, scores of Communist Party functionaries, allowed onto the Parliament floor as guests, worked as a whip system to line up votes against the popular renegade.
After an initial vote Friday night narrowed the race to two candidates, the corridors of the Great Kremlin Palace today were a noisy political bazaar.
 
Opponents Assail Yeltsin
Members of the Democratic Russia bloc, supporting Mr. Yeltsin, lobbied frantically to win support of deputies from the military and K.G.B., with little success.
''Yeltsin's program is a program for the disintegration of the union,'' said a three-star general, who declined to give his name after a corridor debate with a Democratic Russia whip. Mr. Yeltsin has argued for Russia's virtually total political and economic independence from central control.
The division of power between the Soviet Government and its republics is now one of the most explosive issues facing Mr. Gorbachev. The Russian government, traditionally a docile body that essentially echoed and carried out policies made at the federal level, has now joined many other republics in asserting its right to govern independently.
An opposing faction of orthodox Marxists, called Communist Russia, produced the Russian nationalist writer Vasily Belov to argue that Mr. Yeltsin's market-oriented economic program would mean the sellout of Russia's natural resources to multinational corporations.
This afternoon, copies of an anonymous flyer appeared in the hallways questioning Mr. Yeltsin's patriotism and credibility. #28 Votes Short of Victory One factor that opponents used against Mr. Yeltsin and the Democratic Russia bloc was the Moscow City Council's decision on Friday to restrict food sales in Moscow shops to city residents.
The action by the City Council, now governed by a Democratic Russia majority, was intended to contain panic buying brought on by the Government's announcement of forthcoming food price increases. Hard-liners contended that that shopping policy showed that liberals like Mr. Yeltsin are indifferent to the provincial population, which flocks to Moscow's stores.
In the secret ballot, Mr. Yeltsin won 503 votes, to 458 for Ivan K. Polozkov, the hard-line party chief from the southern Russian region of Krasnodar. Victory requires 531 votes, a majority of the 1,060 members of the Parliament. Another 71 deputies voted against both candidates.
Mr. Yeltsin and others predicted that on Monday the party would advance a more centrist candidate, probably Yuri A. Manayenkov, a low-profile secretary of the Soviet Communist party.
''If nothing emerges from the next round, then the five largest groups of deputies should confer on how to share the ministerial portfolios'' in a coalition government, Mr. Yeltsin told reporters.
Mr. Yeltsin said he would not compromise on the issue of Russian sovereignty, which in his program includes a separate and convertible Russian currency, an independent Russian K.G.B., and complete control over the republic's oil, timber and other natural riches.

HEADLINE: THE NEW YORK TIMES/CBS NEWS POLL;
Grudging Public Thinks Tax Rise Now Must Come

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES

 BODY:
Americans overwhelmingly expect their Federal taxes to go up to reduce the budget deficit, and they are grudgingly willing to accept some new taxes if the taxes are the right ones, the New York Times/CBS News Poll has found.
The latest poll, conducted last week as President Bush and Congressional leaders embarked on their budget negotiations, found the public much more resistant to cuts in spending for Social Security, the environment or education than to various tax increases.
The survey also included unsettling news for Republican Party strategists, supporting their fears that President Bush, in saying that there are no preconditions for budget talks, may be weakening the party's image as the bulwark against taxes.
 
Neither Party Has Advantage
After at least a decade in which the public viewed Republicans as much stronger than the Democrats in opposing taxes, neither party gained a clear advantage in the latest survey when Americans were asked which party was more likely to raise taxes. About 38 percent said Republicans were, and 42 percent picked the Democrats, a statistically insignificant difference because each figure could vary in either direction by as much as three percentage points. 
Fear that they are losing one of their best issues has drawn cries from many prominent Republicans. That frustration was voiced last week by Jack F. Kemp, Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, who broke with the White House and declared that even if nobody else in the Administration will argue against higher taxes, ''I will.''
Sixty-eight percent of Americans say they expect President Bush to ask Congress to increase taxes, the survey found.
The survey findings underlined the political problem facing the budget negotiators, who find that the total of spending cuts and tax increases that are both acceptable to the public and achievable in the budget still leaves them short of the $50 billion they need to avoid breaching the deficit ceiling set by law for next year's budget.
 
Taxes on Alcohol and the Rich
If higher taxes are needed, about 8 of 10 people say they would accept increased levies on beer and liquor and on upper-income taxpayers, the poll found in a telephone survey of 1,140 adults conducted nationwide Tuesday through Thursday. But in equally large numbers they say that if spending cuts are needed it is unacceptable to delay Social Security increases or to reduce the sums for education or the environment.
Americans, by 2 to 1, accept cuts in military spending. They still oppose an increase in the Federal gasoline tax, but not as strongly as they did in other polls earlier this year.
Across-the-board cuts in spending, which is what will take effect if the budget negotiators fail to reach an agreement that meets the goals set by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget-balancing law, were described as acceptable by 41 percent of those polled, while 51 percent said they were unacceptable.
Public concern about the deficit is on the increase, the poll suggests. It found that 76 percent of Americans now regard it as a very serious problem calling for immediate action, while 16 percent say it is serious but does not need to be solved immediately.
Shortly after Mr. Bush's inauguration early last year, 29 percent of the public told a Washington Post/ABC News poll, in response to a slightly differrent question, that the deficit was a very serious problem, while 56 percent said it might become a serious problem in years to come.
Some of the increased concern is no doubt in reaction to increased attention to the budget by President Bush, and thus an increase in news reports, in recent weeks. But the rising concern also coincides with a broader increase of pessimism about the economy and the general direction of the country, trends noted in other recent polling.
 
Skepticism About Progress
In the face of such concerns, Americans are deeply skeptical that anything is being done. Only 29 percent say the White House and Congressional budget negotiators are making a serious effort, the poll found, while 54 percent say they are not.
President Bush has declined to say whether his staunch campaign opposition to tax increases is still in effect, and other Republicans have sought to stress that it is really the Democrats who want to raise taxes.
But the public's reluctance to give an advantage to either party, as measured in the new poll, is a sharp departure from the attitudes early in Ronald Reagan's Presidential years.
In a 1981 survey, for example, 42 percent of Americans said Republicans would do a better job holding down taxes while only 15 percent said that of the Democrats. That poll was conducted by the Opinion Research Corporation in November 1981.
In the latest Times/CBS News Poll, Republicans still hold an advantage on taxes in the views of political independents, the crucial swing voters who often decide elections. But in a note that Republicans may perceive as ominous, the youngest voters, by 50 to 36 percent, say the Republicans are more likely to raise taxes. These 18-to-29-year-olds are also the group that most strongly opposes new taxes.
 
Generation Gap, Yet Again
The poll found several sharp cleavages between the generations on questions of taxes and spending.
Senior citizens are more willing than other groups to cut spending on the environment and education, and they support tax increases more than any other group. Young people are just as firm as senior citizens in opposing delays in Social Security increases, but they are far more strongly opposed to tax increases.
Americans over 65 are more likely than the population as a whole to identify themselves as Democrats, and Americans between 18 and 29 are more likely to say they are Republicans. Yet it is older people, by 47 percent to 23 percent, who say that Democrats are more likely to raise taxes, while younger people say Republicasn are more likely.
In a variety of ways, Americans seem resigned to tax increases.
Four in 10 say they do not believe President Bush ever meant his campaign pledge of ''no new taxes,'' and another 23 percent said he meant it only to apply for a year or two. Another 29 percent say he meant no new taxes of any kind.
About 7 in 10 Americans say they think Mr. Bush will ask Congress to increase taxes. The percentage who think he should do that has risen somewhat, from 31 percent immediately after the 1988 Presidential election to 38 percent in the latest survey.
 
Views That Contradict
Americans' attitudes toward higher taxes remain deeply ambivalent. For example, 55 percent of the people say they believe tax increases will be necessary to substantially reduce the deficit. Yet 57 percent, responding to a different question, say they think President Bush should not ask Congress to increase taxes.
Earlier Times/CBS News polls and other analysts of public opinion have found that at least part of the explanation for such contradictory views is that Americans believe substantial sums are wasted in Washington and they do not trust the Government to spend new taxe revenue properly.
These are precisely the political complications that the White House and the Congressional Democrats are trying to navigate in their budget negotiations, largely an exercise aimed at insuring that neither side is saddled with too much blame for whatever painful solutions emerge.
The political problem becomes clearer when the actions Americans would support are considered in light of the $50 billion in reduced spending or increased revenue, or both, that budget experts say is needed. For example, 8 in 10 people say they approve of cuts in foreign aid, but even if the foriegn aid budget were wiped out, it would save only $16 billion or so. In any case, President Bush is asking for an increase in foreign aid for the next budget year, which begins Oct. 1, so the United States can support the emerging democracies of Central America and Eastern Europe.
 
Acceptable Tax, Limited Effect
One proposal discussed often in Washington is an increase in the Federal excise tax on beer, wine and liquor to 25 cents an ounce of alcohol. While the the poll finds that this would be accepted by the public, it would produce only about $7 billion a year in revenue. An increase in the cigarette tax to 32 cents a package would raise another $2.8 billion.
While there is deep division among Republican officials about raising taxes, among the public there are no clear partisan differences on whether President Bush should seek a tax increase.
Republicans are the most opposed to the idea, with 61 percent saying he should not. But that is not statistically distinguishable from the 58 percent of Democrats who say he should not.
Democrats and independents are far more likely than Republicans to dismiss the current budget negotiations as not a serious effort to curtail the deficit.
 
 
 
HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED
The New York Times/CBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted from May 22 to May 24 with 1,140 adults around the United States, excluding Alaska and Hawaii.
The telephone exchanges called were selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country. The exchanges were chosen to assure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population. The telephone numbers were formed by random digits, thus including both listed and unlisted numbers. The numbers were then screened to limit calls to residential telephones.
To reach a larger number of black respondents and make possible more reliable analysis of blacks' opinions, another sample of numbers was drawn from a survey conducted last month by The Times. Telephone numbers of black respondents from the earlier poll were called again, yielding 51 additional black people, for a total of 151. The results were then weighted to reflect the actual racial composition of the adult population. The results have also been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephone lines and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region, sex, age and education.
In theory, in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than three percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by questioning all American adults.
The percentages reported are the particular results most likely to match what would be obtained by seeking out all adults. Other possible percentages are progressively less likely the more they differ from the reported results.
The potential sampling error for subgroups is larger. For example, for blacks it is plus or minus eight percentage points.
In addition to sampling error, the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll.

HEADLINE: BIG SCIENCE: IS IT WORTH THE PRICE?
A periodic look at the largest new research projects.;
Heavy Costs of Major Projects Pose a Threat to Basic Science

BYLINE: By WILLIAM J. BROAD

 BODY:
The Federal Government has embarked on the most ambitious array of big science projects ever, with some experts saying they herald a new age of discovery while others are warning that their great cost could cripple vital parts of the nation's scientific effort and eventually the American economy.
The scale of American science has never been greater. Examples are the $1.5 billion Hubble Space Telescope now orbiting high above the Earth, the $3 billion project to map the human genetic structure, the $8 billion Superconducting Supercollider planned for the plains of Texas and the $30 billion space station Freedom taking shape on computer design consoles. $100 Billion Operating Costs All told, new projects now planned for completion in the 1990's will cost more than $60 billion to build. And that is just the start. More than $100 billion will be needed to operate the instruments over their lifetimes, placing a heavy mortgage on the nation's research spending well into the future.
Virtually all the projects have worthy objectives, or at least a plausible rationale. Some, like the supercollider, may be close to indispensable if certain scientific gains are to be made in the search for elementary particles and forces. Backers of the projects generally see them as the key to the nation's future success in pushing back the frontiers of science. 
''Bigness is an inevitable component of the evolution of science and we must learn to live with it,'' said Dr. Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel laureate in physics at the University of Chicago and a former director of Fermi National Laboratory, which runs the nation's largest particle accelerator so far.
 
Critics Cite Big Drain
But critics say big projects drain funds from small-scale research vital to the creation of new products and jobs and often to the advance of science itself.
''Big science has gone berserk,'' said Dr. Rustum Roy, professor of materials science at Pennsylvania State University, who is an adviser to the House Committee on Science. ''Good minds and a lot of money are going into areas that are not relevant to American competitiveness, American technological health, or even the balanced development of American science.''
Dr. George F. Chapline, a physicist at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in California, said the trend bodes ill for the nation. ''It is very questionable whether these projects will contribute much to stopping America's industrial decline, and may even exacerbate it,'' he said.
Moreover, the big instruments can take so long to plan and build, sometimes a decade or more, that they are sometimes seen as obsolete when switched on because science now moves so fast. Perhaps most troubling, this same lag is seen as causing bright graduate students to abandon some fields now dominated by giant instruments as they search for timely projects on which to base their Ph.D. research.
 
Science Being Altered
Most experts agree that the big projects are fundamentally altering the nature of American science and that the situation is serious because of the nation's fiscal troubles.
''We have a crisis developing,'' said Representative George E. Brown Jr., a California Democrat who has served on the House science committee for nearly a quarter century. ''We're freezing out a lot of our good work because of the commitment to big science.''
Even Administration officials concede that some big projects may eventually have to be delayed, canceled or undertaken with foreign partners to defray expenses.
''The country needs the supercollider and the space station,'' said Erich Bloch, director of the National Science Foundation, the Government's main agency for the support of general science. ''But somewhere you have to make a decision about priorities when you find you can't do all of them simultaneously.''
 
Real Spending Is Steady
Adjusted for inflation, overall Federal spending for research and development in science and technology, including the military's, is little greater than at the height of the Apollo moon program. In 1967 the Government spent $46 billion, according to the National Science Foundation. For 1990 the figure is $48.2 billion.
But while money has remained roughly constant, the number and size of big projects has grown substantially, taking a growing share of the Federal science budget and enveloping dozens of areas of astronomy, physics, chemistry, molecular biology and space science.
A revealing catalogue of big scientific instruments has been complied by the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress. It lists all instruments costing more than $25 million. An analysis of that inventory shows the nation built nine projects in the 1950's for physics, astronomy, materials science and space science. The number rose to 34 in the 1980's. Moreover, the cost of the projects soared, even after discounting for inflation. The 1950's bill came to $260 million. The 1980's bill was $6.7 billion.
 
The History
 
Easy Discoveries Have Been Made
 Behind the push for big instruments is a fact scientists seldom mention. Most of the discoveries that can be made with simple instruments and little labor have already been achieved, so in many cases the scientific tools have to be large and powerful.
''It's unfortunate but inevitable in all fields,'' said Dr. Richard A. Isaacson, a science foundation program manager. ''After you do the easy things, it gets harder and harder. Eventually the next step is very difficult and requires a lot of money and large facilities.''
Dr. Isaacson said that it was important ''to keep a balance'' and make sure that small science projects at universities are adequately financed. ''But it's painful, he said. ''Maybe at some point science will come to an end because we can't afford the big facilities.''
Experts have no formal definition of ''big science,'' but for the purposes of this article it is seen as any civilian research project whose construction costs are $100 million or more. This definition excludes military endeavors like the Strategic Defense Initiative, or Star Wars, on which more than $20 billion has been spent so far, and high-technology development programs like the proposed $5 billion aerospace plane that would fly off a runway into earth orbit. Such programs can have much the same impact in siphoning off money and technical talent from other worthy projects, but they are not usually considered scientific in nature.
 
Others Wait in the Wings
Beyond the big science projects already under way, others are waiting in the wings for Federal approval. These include the Compact Ignition Tokamak, a $480 million device for controlled nuclear fusion; the Advanced Neutron Source, a $500 million reactor for studying materials; and the Space Infrared Telescope Facility, an $800 million orbiting observatory for studying stars.
Compounding the strain on the Federal budget is the fact that project costs often rise from the original estimates, sometimes precipitously. The space station was originally sold to Ronald Reagan's Administration and to Congress on the basis of an estimated cost of $8 billion, but its projected price is now more than $30 billion. Experts say part of the problem is that project officials deliberately underestimate expenses while seeking Federal approval.
''There's willful self-delusion on the part of all the participants.'' said Frederick N. Khedouri, a budget official in the Reagan White House who oversaw most of the nation's big-science projects. ''They know the estimates are understated.''
In dealing with inevitable costs rises, Mr. Khedouri said, managers at Federal agencies often ''sacrifice less visible but probably more important programs.'' The overall effect, he said, ''is a system in which bad science tends to drive out the good.''
 
The Problems
 
Big Projects And Big Politics
 Nowhere is the ascendancy of big science more evident than in the field of particle physics. The $8 billion supercollider is to be a behemoth some 54 miles in circumference, the biggest instrument in the history of science. Housed in a tunnel 150 feet beneath the rolling prairie of northeast Texas, the colossus is to boost proton beams to nearly the speed of light and smash them together, yielding debris expected to provide clues to the building blocks of nature.
Scheduled to be switched on in 1999, the machine will cost $313 million a year just to operate. Over its 30-year lifetime, operations will run to an estimated $9.4 billion, with inflation taken into account.
While many experts say the supercollider is on the forefront of science, some big projects are not viewed so kindly. Pork barrel politics, with the promise of lucrative contracts and jobs, are sometimes seen as a driving factor in their genisis. Another factor is the sheer expansionism on the part of Federal agencies.
 
Assessment Depends on Size
''The rigor with which new projects are assessed varies inversely with their size,'' said Dr. Lewis M. Branscomb, a physicist who held top science posts in the Federal Government and is now director of the Science, Technology and Public Policy Program at Harvard University.
For instances, requests for small Federal science grants have to pass a gantlet of review committees and Government examinations. In contrast, some huge projects, like Star Wars, have their origins largely in high-level politics.
At the same time, smaller projects can sometimes produce better science than the big ones, critics say. As an example they point to the space agency's $17 billion Earth Observing System, a group of six huge satellites now under development to monitor changes in the earth's environment at the turn of the century. Some critics say its size has been largely dictated by political forces and that a series of smaller craft would cost less, operate sooner and have greater flexibility to pursue fast-changing scientific questions.
 
Small Can Mean Quick
''In a timely way they would give the global warming information everybody is eager for,'' said Dr. Robert Jastrow, a space scientist at Dartmouth College. Moreover, he said, a quick return of data would help universities rebuild populations of bright young graduate students who are leaving for lack of challenging projects.
''You can't plan a graduate career on a 10-year wait,'' Dr. Jastrow said. ''The field will dry up on the present timetable.''
Dr. Freeman Dyson, a physicist at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, said in his book, ''Infinite in All Directions,'' that some of the big projects take so long to build that they are virtually obsolete when completed.
''The cutting edge of science moves rapidly,'' he said. ''The bigger and more ambitious the missions become, the more difficult it is to reconcile the time scale of the missions with the time scale of science.''
 
The Results
 
Mad Scramble For a Few Dollars
 As big projects have bloomed, small ones have withered. Critics fear that some of the most fertile areas of science are now falling into neglect. ''Significant advances in science typically result from small projects - not large ones,'' said Dr. Chapline of the Livermore laboratory. For instance, A.T.&T. Bell Labs, with a relatively small budget for physics, has produced seven Nobel laureates in that field.
An oft-cited example of small-science productivity comes from the field of superconducting materials that work at high temperatures and promise to revolutionize electric devices. A key breakthrough was made in 1987 by Dr. Paul Chu, a University of Houston physicist. That year his laboratory ran on $130,000, about half from the science foundation.
Despite its allure, and a sizable amount of subsequent Federal financing, the endeavor has recently been eroded by budget pressure. ''Every worker in the field of the basic science of superconductivity in this country is experiencing repeated and severe funding cuts,'' Dr. Philip W. Anderson, a Nobel laureate at Princeton University, told Congress in March.
 
Squeeze Is Surprising
The squeeze is somewhat surprising since the science foundation, a main Federal patron of small science, has received substantial budget increases in recent years. This fiscal year it is spending $2.08 billion, up from $1.72 billion in 1988. But much of the increase has gone to science education and the establishment of large centers for science and engineering. And now the foundation has embarked on a spate of relatively large-scale science projects as well, including the $110 million High Magnetic Field Laboratory and the $190 million Gravitational Wave Observatory.
The science foundation's budgets for small ventures in mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, biology and computer science have generally fallen, after inflation is taken into account, below their 1988 levels, according to John C. Crowley and Patrica Ann Levy, analysts at the Association of American Universities in Washington. ''They are weakening steadily,'' the analysts concluded in a recent paper, noting that two thirds of science foundation's competitive research programs were in budgetary decline.
 
Trials of Individual Researchers
''As projects grow larger, the politics of science change drastically in favor of sustaining the larger commitments,'' Mr. Crowley said in an interview. ''Over time, the individual investigator is being squeezed, both in terms of the real value of the average grant and in terms of the numbers of awards.''
Of particular concern to some experts is the science foundation's physics budget, which supports small-scale research critical to the nation's industrial health but, after inflation is taken into account, has been decling for half a decade.
''Things are out of whack,'' said Dr. Neil W. Ashcroft, a professor of physics at Cornell University. ''Condensed-matter physics is at the heart of modern technology, of computer chips, of all the electronic gadgets behind the new industrial order. Yet relative to the big projects, it's neglected.''
 
The Proposals
 
Strict Goals And More Money
 Remedies to the big-project drain on Federal science funds have been offered with increasing frequency in recent years. They include delays, cancellations, the imposition of cost ceilings and the sharing of expenses with international partners. A radical approach calls for doubling the Federal research budget so all science could be better financed.
In an attempt to stop the upward creep of project costs, Congress last year limited to $1.6 billion two new NASA spacecraft, the Cassini Saturn Probe and the Comet Rendezvous and Asteroid Flyby, with the proviso that one be scrapped if there was a cost overrun. More recently, the House voted to put a $5 billion ceiling on the supercollider, with the remaining $3 billion to come from Texas and foreign partners.
Another tactic, much discussed but seldom used, is to delay projects. The idea was broached most notably in April 1988 by Dr. Frank Press, president of the National Academy of Sciences, the prestigious honorary group for scientists. In a speech, he suggested that the pace of big projects might be slowed to permit the financing of less visible but important endeavors.
 
Priority for AIDS Research
He personally gave his highest priority to grants for individual researchers, to crises such as the AIDS epidemic and to science breakthroughs like high-temperature superconductors. Of secondary importance, he said, were large projects like the supercollider and the human genome.
In an interview, Dr. Press reiterated his support for this approach given ''the current budgetary crisis.'' But over the coming decade, he said, the only real solution would be to double the Federal money spent on science.
''With Reagan we doubled the defense budget without a hiccup,'' Dr. Press said. ''If you look at the competition around the world, science and technology is our sole advantage. Because of the relatively low cost, it's a very good investment.''
Mr. Bloch, the science foundation's director, expressed skepticism over whether so much money would materialize. ''I don't think it's realistic,'' he said, adding that it was more important to make sure existing funds were ''spent wisely'' by instituting priorities and rearranging the budget.
He urged that small-scale research be protected. ''We should not sacrifice the science base in in order to do these projects,'' Mr. Bloch said.
 
Bush Backs Big Projects
The Bush Administration has largely ignored proposals to delay big projects, forging ahead with a number of old and new endeavors. Some of these have yet to be approved by Congress, which might yet reject them. They include the $400 million Relativistic Heavy Ion Collider, $190 million Gravitational Wave Observatory and $140 million Eight-Meter Optical Telescopes.
The Administration is seeking increased funds as the main way of achieving its goals for both big and little science. For the next fiscal year, it has requested a 12 percent rise in Federal funds for civilian research and development, from $23.8 billion to $26.7 billion.
In an interview, Dr. D. Allan Bromley, science adviser to President Bush, praised the large facilities as essential ''tools young people will need in 5 or 10 years.'' But he also conceded the Administration had so far failed to support small science to the extent it wished.
''We're not satisfied,'' he said, adding that in the next budget cycle the Administration would start a special initiative ''to make sure individual investigator projects are not squeezed out.''
 
Foreign Partners Sought
In addition to making new money available, the Administration wants to internationalize some of the nation's big science. It has three foreign partners for the space station and is seeking ones for the supercollider and some other projects.
President Bush told the National Academy of Sciences last month that his Administration was ''exploring new ways to encourage international cooperation on big science,'' adding that the huge machines were of ''unprecedented scope and importance.'' He also pledged to double the sceince foundation's budget by 1993.
Absent a dramatic rise in the financing of small-scale scientiic research or a sudden reversal in the Administration's plans for big projects, many scientists foresee a serious decline in the health of American science, with eventual damage to the nation's economy.
''We've got to make some serious decisions,'' said Dr. Stephen M. Younger, a physicist at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. ''I'm a fan of the supercollider. I think we should build the space station, too. But unfortunately, there are people sleeping in the streets and the Japanese are running circles around us on projects like high-temperature superconductors. That's going to kill us.''

HEADLINE: New York and 3 New England States Sign Pact on Saving Forests

BYLINE: By ALLAN R. GOLD

 BODY:
In an unusual example of regional cooperation, the governors of New York and three New England states have agreed to increase land purchases and adopt tax incentives to preserve their sprawling northern forests and to support forest-related industry.
The accord, announced last week, reflects the growing anxiety in the Northeast over increasing development in the 26 million acres of nearly contiguous northern forests in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine.
That the states were able to overcome their usual doubts about interstate cooperation suggests how great their concern is, conservationists and government officials said.
 
Seeking Federal Grants
The four-state consensus was reached by the Governors' Task Force on Northern Lands, formed two years ago to study changes in the woodlands. In a report, the 12-member group recommended the creation of a Northern Forest Lands Council to carry on the study of the region and to promote land conservation. 
The task force called for Federal grants of $25 million a year for four years for full or partial purchase of threatened lands. To encourage landowners to sell to conservation groups instead of developers, the group recommended that the owners be excused from paying income taxes on the money they make from those sales. The group also proposed giving state tax credits to those who donate land to conservation groups.
''The old, comfortable protection techniques of the past are not enough to insure forest conservation,'' Thomas C. Jorling, New York's Environmental Conservation Commissioner, said in a statement accompanying the release of the report. ''We must look for innovative new approaches to deal with the growing pressures on forest lands.''
A coalition of 17 conservation groups praised the task force's proposals, describing them in a statement as ''a significant positive step toward taking substantive action to protect these vital lands.'' The conservationists also support a longer-term protection strategy using coordinated land-use planning and a bigger Federal role.
The report coincided with one released by the United States Forest Service, which examined ownership and land use in the region. It offered 28 tax and acquisition strategies for use by Congress or the states to conserve environmental, recreational and economic interests in the forest.
 
Uproar Over Land Sale
Congress authorized the report, the Northern Forest Lands Study, in 1988 after a big industrial landowner, Diamond Occidental Forest Inc., put up for sale one million acres of forest land in New York, Vermont, New Hampshire and Maine. The sale created an uproar, prompting fears that cherished lands would be sold to developers for the building of vacation homes. Some of those fears were realized.
''Changes in land ownership and use clearly threaten the long-term integrity and traditional uses of the land in parts of the study area,'' the Forest Service concluded.
''As a result,'' it said, ''open space, forestry, farming and recreational uses of 22 million acres of private land in the northern forest are gradually giving way to residential and recreational development.''
Similar conclusions were reached in a recently released study by the Governor's Commission on the Adirondacks in the 21st Century. The commission, appointed by Gov. Mario M. Cuomo of New York, recommended some of the approaches offered by the Forest Services and the governors' task force.
But the New York commission went further than the other groups in proposing proportionately more land acquisition and greater state regulation, including a one-year building moratorium on 90 percent of Adirondack Park's privately held lands.
Indeed, the four-state Governors' Task Force had trouble agreeing on some issues and solutions. In part, the differences reflected the New England states' longtime skepticism of government land ownership and regulation. New York has been more willing to use these conservation approaches.

HEADLINE: Auto Dealer's 'Christian Plan' Is Called Bias

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FAIRFAX, Va., May 26

 BODY:
One night last August the letters C, M, B and P popped into Freddy (Action) Jackson's head. Business at his car dealership has never been the same since.
''I started with the C,'' said Mr. Jackson, whose dealership, Brown Lincoln-Mercury, is the subject of a dispute between a national Christian organization and civil rights and Jewish groups, ''I wrote everything down that began with C that had to do with Christ or Christian. I did the same thing with the letter M. I stayed up all night trying to figure out what those letters meant.'' 
The next morning, he said, he had it: ''Christian Members Buying Plan.'' Christians would buy cars at bargain prices and a percentage of his profit would go to their church.
The American Civil Liberties Union and the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith say Brown Lincoln-Mercury discriminates against non-Christians.
A lawyer for the A.C.L.U., Victor Glasberg, told the Federal Trade Commission this month that the policy violated equal-opportunity credit laws. A spokesman declined to say whether the commission was investigating.
A spokesman for Mary Sue Terry, Virginia's Attorney General, said the plan apparently did not violate state or local law.
Mr. Glasberg said that unless Mr. Jackson makes the same sale terms available to all, the A.C.L.U. will sue.
 
Repugnant, A.D.L. Aide Says
''Freddy Jackson figures this is a good way to mix two of the important things in his life: business and religion,'' said David Friedman, Virginia director of the Anti-Defamation League, which is considering a suit. ''He doesn't see that the very idea of doing business with people on the basis of their religion is repugnant.''
A countersuit is threatened by the Christian Coalition, a national organization whose director, Ralph Reed, calls the attitude of the two other groups equally repugnant.
''We are sick and tired of Christians and Christian values being expunged from every area of public life,'' he said. ''This isn't separation of church and state; this is a private merchant.''
Under Mr. Jackson's plan, a Christian who fills out a certificate naming his his church and his pastor gets a set price of $600 over cost on Lincolns and $250 over cost on Mercurys. Pastors get a similar discount.
Depending on the car, 10 percent or more of the amount over cost then goes to the church of the buyer's choice. At the end of the year, the church with the most purchases gets a $2,000 bonus.
Despite its charitable aspect, Mr. Friedman said, the plan is flawed. ''Just the very nature of having people declare their religion to get a deal on a car is obnoxious,'' he said.
Three years ago, the Anti-Defamation League was involved in a similar dispute in Pensacola, Fla., where Jerry Harrison, an Exxon station owner, had put up a sign reading, ''For Christians Only: 10 percent discount on labor.''
 
'There's a Force Here'
The league complained to Exxon, and the company asked Mr. Harrison to take the sign down. An agreement was reached, and Mr. Harrison removed his original sign but replaced it with ''10% discount For Those Whom Jesus Loves.''
Mr. Jackson says he will not drop his Christian buying policy. ''There's a force here,'' he said. ''There's something more here than Freddy Jackson and something more than his managers. We're not trying to play church. We're just trying to do the right thing.'' A spokesman for the National Automobile Dealers Association, Mary Beth Robinson, suggested that economics might have been a greater motivation. Sales in the car industry have been sluggish, she said, and dealers have turned to promotion deals.
Mr. Jackson admits business has improved since he inaugurated the plan. ''We're in business to make a profit,'' he said. ''Your Senator and your Congressman, when they run for election, they go to a church or a Sunday school class because they want the votes of the people there. It's the same principle.''

HEADLINE: Chicago Studies Plan to Spur Industry Revival

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CHICAGO, May 26

 BODY:
Loft condominiums carved out of aging factory buildings have become hot commodities here, symbols of a growing urban battle between industry and developers of commercial and residential real estate.
At its heart, this battle over land is defined by the shifting economy in Chicago and other aging industrial cities where the booming service industry has largely replaced manufacturing, eliminating thousands of factory jobs.
In the next couple of months, the administration of Mayor Richard M. Daley is expected to announce a new land-use policy to protect a number of low-cost industrial areas in the city from the commercial development.
For manufacturers, competing with commercial developers is often a losing proposition as increased demand pushes land prices well above the $3 to $8 a square foot that most industrialists say is the most they are willing to pay. 
Commercial developers, willing to pay at least $40 a square foot, have bought vacant land and antiquated industrial buildings on the North Side, which has undergone sweeping gentrification in the last 15 years.
According to the brokerage firm Corporate Realty Advisors, which publishes a quarterly newsletter detailing market changes, prices for industrial property rose 77 percent on the city's North Side and 65 percent on the South Side from 1986 to 1989. As a result, shopping centers, shopping malls and housing developments have replaced factories, which have moved to the suburbs, where land costs less.
Like Chicago, other major cities are confronting the problem by restricting commercial development in industrial areas. Last year, Boston cleared the way for the creation of light-manufacturing districts in neighborhoods that want them. New York City has a zoning ordinance that provides financial penalties for commercial developers who convert manufacturing space into office space.
Chicago has hundreds of acres of vacant land, but industrialists say the affordable property is inaccessible to heavy vehicles, is in blighted and dangerous neighborhoods or has obsolete buildings that are costly to raze.
 
Strategy Is Explained
At the center of Chicago's industrial plan is an effort to convert industrial-zoned parcels into areas that could accommodate several industries with similar needs.
''One of the strategies is to make those undesirable areas attractive, looking like suburban sites,'' said Wim Wiebel, an associate professor in the School of Urban Planning and Policy at the University of Illinois in Chicago, who has worked with the city's economic development department.
Responding to charges by advocates for industrial growth that the city's zoning laws have been too easily changed by forces supporting commercial development, Joseph J. James, the city's Commissioner of Economic Development, said the city would try to provide zoning that was ''predictable, not whimsical.''
In a 10-point draft, Mr. James described a policy that could provide support for existing industry. It would, for instance, speed up the city permit process to ease construction costs for expanding companies, provide some improvements in industrial areas and strengthen the city's loan programs.
Mayor Daley has not yet said whether he supports Mr. James's proposal. The City Council would also have to act on it.
Acknowledging fears of real estate developers that the new policy could hinder development, Mr. James said it would make only limited use of a zoning ordinance approved by the City Council two and a half years ago allowing the city to designate areas where land-use changes are prohibited.
 
A Revival Is Perceived
So far, the measure has been applied to 115 acres along a strip of warehouses, factories and vacant land that abuts the affluent Near North Side.
The introduction of the industrial plan comes at a time when new technological businesses are reviving the industrial economy and competing heavily for affordable land.

HEADLINE: Bogota Chief Tells of Drug War's Toll

BYLINE: By JAMES BROOKE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BOGOTA, Colombia, May 26

 BODY:
On the eve of the presidential election here, President Virgilio Barco Vargas said Colombia's cocaine traffickers had widened their goal and were determined to bring down the nation's democracy.
''Their goal now is to destroy our democratic system,'' President Barco said on Friday in an interview at the heavily guarded presidential palace.
In the last two weeks, 10 car bombings in three Colombian cities have killed 40 people and wounded about 320, chiefly passers-by. Mr. Barco said the bombers' intention apparently was to scare voters away from polling booths on Sunday.
 
'Intimidation Campaign'
''To have a 50 percent turnout - and I think it could be higher - is even more significant if you take into account the intimidation campaign in which the narco-terrorists are engaged,'' said the President, who is not a candidate in Sunday's election. 
Nine months after starting a war on the cocaine traffickers, Colombia's 68-year-old leader showed no sign of retreating.
Increasingly, the price of resistance comes closer to home.
On Monday, bodyguards for his grandchildren snuffed out the burning fuse of a bomb composed of 350 sticks of dynamite, which had been placed near gasoline storage tanks at the children's private school here.
''There would have been 500 dead children,'' the President said, leaning forward in anger from his chair during the interview. ''It just shows the perversity of these people.''
 
Visit to the United States
In a rare trip beyond the walls of his Spanish colonial palace, Mr. Barco is to travel next week to meet with President Bush in Washington on June 5. In the United States, Mr. Barco will also deliver the commencement address at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, his alma mater.
Mr. Barco plans to ask Mr. Bush to extend United States assistance by removing barriers and improving prices for coffee, bananas and flowers, Colombia's legitimate exports.
''We are still concerned that economic measures designed to assist this region have been slow in coming,'' he said. ''In fact, in trade and financial matters related to the drug war, there have been more words than results.''
This week, Colombian business leaders learned that they may have to buy ''war bonds'' to help finance the drug war, which currently engages 60 percent of the Colombian Army and 85 percent of its police forces. $1 Billion a Year ''It costs our economy at least $1 billion a year, a figure that is increasing some 20 percent every year,'' said Mr. Barco, an engineer and an economist.
Mr. Barco will also seek further American cooperation on blocking black-market arms sales and mercenary assistance to drug trafficking gangs. Earlier this month, the Federal Bureau of Investigation arrested two Colombians in Miami who were believed to have been trying to buy 24 Stinger shoulder-held, ground-to-air rockets.
Colombia has also issued formal protests against illegal arms and mercenary training involving Israelis. This month, for the first time, Colombia imposed visa requirements on Israelis.
''We are tying to obtain extradition of those foreigners involved in illegal activities in Colombia,'' the President said. ''But without real international cooperation, we will never be able to stop completely the dirty trade in weapons and the mercenary activity.''
 
Extradition Angers Traffickers
In Colombia, the extradition of drug suspects to the United States is the issue that most angers the traffickers, who have little to fear from Colombia's intimidated judiciary. Although about 15 suspects are awaiting extradition, none have been sent to the United States for trial in the last two months.
''Extradition, as an instrument to battle drug traffickers, remains in force,'' the President said.
An American diplomat here speculated earlier this month that extraditions were suspended to avoid provoking the traffickers during the last two months of the presidential campaign.
''We will not negotiate with terrorists; no deal can be made with the killers of my people,'' the President said in a written answer to several questions.
Mr. Barco said contacts between members of his Government and representatives of the cocaine traffickers in January were limited to winning the release of kidnapping victims. He said the reduced level of violence that followed these meetings was ''an international public relations ploy'' to win good will during the meeting between President Bush and leaders of the Andean nations in February.
 
Search for Pablo Escobar
Mr. Barco, whose four-year term will end when a new President is inaugurated on Aug. 7, showed no sign of winding down the drug war in his final months and gave no indication that he would ease off the search for the cocaine cartel leader, Pablo Escobar. The leader of the Medellin cartel, Mr. Escobar is believed to have directed the wave of bombings that preceded the elections.
''Pablo Escobar is on the run, in this country, apparently never staying in the same place for more than one day,'' the President said. ''We are following him closely. Sooner or later, we will find him.''

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
As Soviet Union Grows Tense, U.S. Tourists Start to Shy Away

BYLINE: By FELICITY BARRINGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
American tourists, who flocked to the Soviet Union in record numbers in 1988 and 1989, are thinking twice this year, travel companies and agents specializing in Soviet tours say.
Though Americans are still eager to witness the changes in Soviet society, tour operators say, they are wary of running into perestroika's unlovely offspring - crime and ethnic unrest. Jay Schaffner, president of Anniversary Tours Inc., estimates that about 100,000 American tourists will visit the Soviet Union this year, down from about 120,000 last year.
While tour operators say they have no sure way to measure the decline in the number of tours and the size of tour groups, they think that the travel advisory about street crime issued earlier this year by the State Department, the reports of tension in the independence-minded Baltic states and the violence in the Caucasus have helped depress the market. 
 
Neither Peak Nor Valley
''It's a political market,'' said Caroline Cavalli, president of the Russian Travel Bureau in New York. ''If somebody sneezes on either side, it affects it. For 20 years we've had totally peaks and valleys. This is not really a valley, but it's not a peak either.''
A continued increase in prices, which have nearly doubled over the last five years, has not helped, they say. ''What's happened with this whole perestroika business is that every Soviet company is trying to make more hard currency than ever before,'' said Sidney Reiner, president of Cosmos Travel.
The price increases have been steep, particularly from 1987 to 1989, when there was a 25 percent jump in Soviet-controlled costs, Mr. Schaffner said. And, Ms. Cavalli said delicately, ''there has to be a commensurate increase in service'' - a reference to the often-haphazard and sometimes churlish attention lavished on tourists in Soviet hotels and restaurants.
Mr. Schaffner said the State Department's advisory on crime had caused four high school groups and two student groups from Northern Illinois University to cancel their plans, although one of the university groups recently rebooked for October.
 
Perennial Frustrations
Paradoxically, the falloff in tourism has not shortened the visa lines at the Soviet consulate in Washington, where a three-hour line of business executives, scientists, professors and tourists recently stretched for two blocks.
The perennial frustrations of Soviet travel, from creaky bureaucracies to nonexistent restaurant service, have lessened somewhat over the last few years, but tour operators say Americans' curiosity and willingness to endure frustration may be eroding, particularly when there are new places to be curious about. Ms. Cavalli said the summit meeting between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev may change that.
''Some of this is going to be cyclical, especially if there's something new out there,'' said Deborah Kolt, president of the Washington-based Academic Tours Abroad Inc. ''Berlin is swamped. You can't get a hotel bed in Berlin to save your life. People are going to Hungary and Czechoslovakia.''
A first class twin-bed room in a four-star hotel in Moscow costs about $143 a night, Intourist officials say. A 15-day group tour, which in the mid-1980's could sell for as little as $1,400, now is almost impossible to find under $2,200 - and often costs $2,800 or more.
 
Pressure on Exchanges
The same drive by Soviet organizations to insure their economic future by bringing in as much hard currency as possible is also putting pressure on the academic and cultural exchanges. Most exchanges are based on reciprocal visits, with Americans paying for the Soviets who come here and Soviet organizations hosting American students, writers, artists and musicians there.
But the Soviet airline Aeroflot and some Soviet hotels are insisting that all tickets and rooms for foreigners must be paid for in convertible currency, not the increasingly scorned ruble. Soviet hosts - educational institutions, the Soviet concert agency Goskontsert, the Academy of Science -are reluctant to part with convertible Western currencies, which are in short supply in most Soviet organizations and are often the only way of paying for sophisticated technical equipment.
''The ideas for exchanges are there, the interest is there, but it's increasingly hard to put these things together,'' said Molly Raymond, deputy coordinator of the President's United States-Soviet Exchange Initiative, a United States Information Agency office that handles exchange activities. ''I see a lot of frustration out there.''
In particular, she fears that the new scramble for dollars and the determination of Aeroflot to earn hard currency are raising new complications for the growing array of American-Soviet exchanges. Many are fledgling efforts involving small towns, high schools or community hospitals that may have large resevoirs of good will, but little understanding of the frustrations involved.
 
Aeroflot's Requirement
Aeroflot earlier this year announced the requirement that all foreigners' tickets be paid for in convertible Western currencies, regardless whether they were tourists, who have always paid hard currency, or the guests of Soviet organizations, who have not.
Aeroflot officials could not be reached for comment, despite several telephone calls. But the Soviet airline, like most other Soviet industries and service organizations, is part of the Government-mandated self-financing program, learning how to survive in an quasi-market economy.
''I can understand why they are doing it,'' said Vasily Istratov, a Senior Research Fellow from Moscow based at Middlebury College. ''They are trying to teach themselves how to manage in real business.''
''We have a growing power of individual institutions and a deteriorating power of the center,'' he said. ''The situation is imbalanced in the country as a whole. The thing you can be sure of is hard currency.''
Mr. Istratov works with 65 Soviet students who are studying at 25 schools around the country as part of the undergraduate exchange program of the Intercollegiate Consortium.
Charles Dillingham, president of the Entertainment Corporation U.S.A., said that Aeroflot brought up the issue of ticket prices in connection with the planned Soviet tour of the English National Opera Company later this month, but that Goskontsert, the Soviet sponsor of the tour, defused the problem.
Could the regulation limit future eudcational and cultural exchanges?
''No question.'' Mr. Dillingham said.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
Less Luster for Traveling Gorbachev

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Soviet delegation to the Washington summit meeting is hawking a glossy magazine with a smiling couple on the cover and the legend ''The Gorbachevs: Mikhail and Raisa at Home and Abroad.''
Phones are ringing at network news bureaus with offers of analysis and commentary from Soviet officials. And the Washington bureau chief of CBS News is having nightmares in which President Gorbachev pops out of his limousine to visit Bloomingdale's. 
The curtain has gone up for a return engagement of the traveling glasnost and perestroika show. The Kremlin hopes to take Washington by storm with the sort of public-relations push it has refined in recent years to advertise Soviet policies when Mr. Gorbachev travels abroad. But there are some signs that the luster has dimmed a bit.
The Soviet delegation held the first of a series of pre-summit news conferences today. Five officials answered questions for an hour.
 
Impromptu Appearances Likely
A few years ago, the room would have been jammed. But there were only about three dozen people in attendence, most of them Soviet officials and journalists. And the mood was, well, sleepy. At one point, one of the panelists, Aleksandr Bovin, an Izvestia columnist, dozed off, his face dropping to his shirtfront.
It may have been because it was a rainy Memorial Day weekend. Or it may have been that the mere appearance of Soviet officials talking with apparent candor about domestic political problems has lost its edge as a news event. In any case, the Soviet delegation was undeterred.
Over the next week, Mr. Gorbachev will meet with American public figures at the Soviet Embassy. His new spokesman, Arkady A. Maslennikov, is to appear at the international press center beside Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman.
And there are likely to be impromptu appearances on the streets of Washington, Minneapolis or San Francisco by a head of state who demonstrated his showmanship in earlier visits with stops on a Washington street corner and in the middle of Broadway.
 
Sympathetic Look at Gorbachev
While Mr. Gorbachev meets with President Bush, top aides and prominent Soviet academicians and politicians will fan out across town, visiting American research centers, Government organizations and public institutions. They will appear on network news programs as commentators. They will hold news conferences with titles like ''Restructuring of Political System in U.S.S.R.''
Some of that is intended to get across a viewpoint on the summit meeting, an effort that the Americans will conduct just as vigorously. But it also is intended to give an American audience a sympathetic look at the Soviet leader and his political and economic problems.
Hence the magazine Soviet Life, with its cozy photograph of the Gorbachevs on the cover and pictures inside of the couple feeding a squirrel and snuggling with their grandchildren in a garden swing.
Although Mr. Gorbachev has to rely to some extent on surrogates, he likes to handle much of his public relations personally. But not too personally.
Last week, a Soviet official was ruminating about how Mr. Gorbachev might be able to ''talk to students'' when he visits Stanford University on June 4. He shook his head at the suggestion that the Soviet leader might invite 10 or 20 students to a private meeting.
No, he said, the Soviet President was thinking more of a speech. Perhaps at the university football stadium. It seats 80,000.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
Gorbachev Rules Out Leading Role for NATO

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 26

 BODY:
The Soviet Union will never agree to allow the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to play the leading role in building a new European security order, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev says in an interview to be published by Time magazine on Sunday.
Mr. Gorbachev offered strong opposition to allowing a unified Germany to stay in NATO. He suggested that if the United States were unwilling to discuss the creation of a new European security institution, the Soviet Union would want to link the unification process ''as closely as possible'' to the negotiations on cutting conventional arms in Europe. 
On the eve of his second summit meeting with President Bush, Mr. Gorbachev was asked if he expected to have a major disagreement with Mr. Bush on Germany's continued membership in NATO. ''I wouldn't say I expect a major disagreement,'' he said. ''I'd state for a fact that there will be one.''
But Mr. Gorbachev spoke of great improvements in the relationship between the two superpowers, especially in nuclear arms control and cultural and scientific cooperation.
Mr. Gorbachev dwelt on the economic and political problems gripping the Soviet Union and his own political leadership as he met with reporters and editors from Time. He also provided written answers to questions submitted in advance by the magazine, which named him ''man of the decade'' last December.
Mr. Gorbachev said relations between the United States and Soviet Union had reached a critical juncture. ''The strength of our relationship is being tested and it will be tested again in the future,'' he said.
The Soviet leader repeated his proposal for the creation of a new, Europe-wide security system to replace both the Warsaw Pact and NATO.
''Regardless of what is being said about NATO now, for us it is a symbol of the past, a dangerous and confrontational past,'' he said. ''And we will never agree to assign it the leading role in building a new Europe. I want us to be understood correctly on this.''
Mr. Gorbachev said that as he took the steps to relax Soviet control over Eastern Europe he ''had an idea'' of the dramatic change that might result. But he said, ''When people speak to me about various models and timetables, as though all this had happened according to a train schedule, I can only smile.''
Speaking of his economic plans, Mr. Gorbachev said he thought ''market mechanisms and the infrastructure'' for a new economy could be put in place within one or two years. ''But then,'' he said, ''it will take a long time to develop a real market economy.''
When his questioners said there could be no radical reform of the Soviet economy without large amounts of inflation and unemployment, Mr. Gorbachev said, ''I think both things will happen.''

HEADLINE: Campus Life: Sarah Lawrence;
Debate Persists Over a Professor Accused of Bias

DATELINE: YONKERS

 BODY:
The late Joseph Campbell, the teacher and philosopher, continues to make his presence felt at Sarah Lawrence College, where he taught for 38 years. Mr. Campbell was known for his work on mythology.
Under pressure from a small group of students and alumni, concerned that Mr. Campbell had made anti-Semitic and racist remarks, Sarah Lawrence has canceled a videotape presentation honoring Mr. Campbell. The event, scheduled for next Saturday, was to have been part of an alumni fund-raising weekend.
The college's commitment to minorities had been an issue in a debate over a teaching chair named for Mr. Campbell, which some students argued should be reserved for minority scholars. Late last month, the college president, Dr. Alice S. Ilchman, responded to the demands by revising the conditions for the chair, setting it aside for people of ''diverse cultures,'' including African, Asian, Native American, Latin American and Middle Eastern. 
Students have taken the issue a step further, calling for more formal policies outlining the financing of teaching chairs and the conferring of honorary degrees. Mr. Campbell received an honorary degree in 1986, a year before he died at the age of 83.
 
'Questionable Merit'
''We should not confer high honors on someone of questionable merit,'' said Patrick Larvie, a student senator and senior.
Dr. Ilchman said in an interview last week that the controversy was over. The college, she said, has no way to prove the allegations against Mr. Campbell, and the administration knew little about the accusations of anti-Semitism and racism until the $1 million endowment for the Campbell chair was accepted two years ago.
''Joseph Campbell made an impact on the lives of many students who wanted to honor him with an endowment,'' Dr. Ilchman said. She said the accusations against him came from ''a few alumni and students.''
After the Public Broadcasting Service televised a series of interviews with Mr. Campbell in 1988, an alumna and a few faculty members, including two literature professors, Arnold Krupat and Daniel Kaiser, came forward to criticize Mr. Campbell as anti-Semitic and racist. Shortly afterward, Brendan Gill, in The New York Review of Books, questioned Mr. Campbell's philsophy of ''follow your bliss,'' and his use of anti-Semitic and racist remarks.
''Campbell's bigotry had another distressing aspect, which was seemingly ineradicable anti-Semitism,'' Mr. Gill wrote in September. ''By the time I came to know him, he had learned to conceal its gross manifestations. But there can be no doubt that it existed and that it tainted not only the man himself, but the quality of his scholarship.''
 
Graduate Recalls a Tirade
When Sarah Lawrence accepted the endowment from 60 friends and alumni, several students denounced the administration for holding a event honoring Mr. Campbell. The event showcased celebrities like the interviewer in the PBS programs, Bill Moyers; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and George Lucas, creator of ''Star Wars.''
When the video presentation of a the series, ''Celebration of Joseph Campbell,'' was announced, a Sarah Lawrence alumna and writer of children's books, Eve Feldman, of New York, was, she said, astonished to receive a flier about it.
In 1988, when the endowment was announced, Ms. Feldman said, she had recounted to the administration an anti-Jewish tirade Mr. Campbell delivered in a private conference session when she was a senior. She said she had been told that the teaching chair was already set up.
''He said that Jews were the cause of all that was bad with Western civilization,'' Ms. Feldman recalled, adding that faculty members had told her at the time that such remarks by Mr. Campbell were common knowledge. She dropped the course.
This semester, students petitioned the college to denounce Mr. Campbell's views.
 
Only Four Teaching Chairs
Dr. Ilchman questioned why there was concern, considering that Sarah Lawrence has few endowments and because few students and alumni have complained. Four teaching chairs and three honorary doctorates have been established since the college opened as a women's school in 1926, she said. It became coeducational in 1968.
Last March, 250 students conducted a sit-in demanding cultural diversity on campus, including the hiring of additional minority professors and recruiting students of diverse ethnic and economic backgrounds.
''Our concern was to increase students and faculty of color and diversify the curriculum,'' Megan Parke, a student senator and senior, said. ''But the Campbell controversy showed that they chose to capitalize on the money regardless of the students' views.''
Dr. Ilchman said the minority population had doubled since 1985, to 14 percent of the 950 students, of whom 5.8 percent are black, 4 percent Hispanic and 4.8 percent Asian. The 20 minority professors include 14 blacks, 4 Asians and 2 Hispanics.
Dr. Ilchman noted that the curriculum had changed to include Indian art history and Asian and black studies.

CORRECTION-DATE: June 10, 1990, Sunday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
A report in the Campus Life pages on May 27 about Sarah Lawrence College referred incorrectly to selection standards for the Joseph Campbell professorial chair. Drawn in rotation from several disciplines, scholars appointed to the chair will be specialists in the peoples and cultures of Africa, Asia, Native America, Latin America or the Middle East. The chair is not limited to minority scholars.

Sad Thursday for Magazine Crowd

BYLINE: By GEORGIA DULLEA

 BODY:
Thursday will be the last gathering of the Last Thursday of the Month Club at the Zig Zag Bar and Grill in Manhattan. For the past year or so young magazine editors, writers, art directors and photographers have been flocking to these industry parties where the conversation, like the configuration of the bar at the Zig Zag, has a way of veering off at crazy angles.
This is especially true after midnight when one of the owners, Allen Bernstein, breaks out the Old Weller bourbon. But now the 35-year-old Mr. Bernstein, a founder of the Last Thursday Club, is leaving the bar on West 23d Street to restore vintage Porsches at his shop in Chatham, N.J.
 
Core of Group Is From Esquire
While the monthly party draws names from the mastheads of magazines as diverse as Mirabella, Hot Rod, Spy and The New Republic, most of the organizers work or used to work at Esquire. When the talk turns to how the parties began the young editors laugh and break into broad parodies of young stockbrokers at play. Oh, they say, it's their ''intense, high-pressure jobs,'' their ''need to cut loose,'' and so on. 
Mention networking and the editors look horrified. ''Our parties are a little like those Jerry Rubin things,'' one picture editor acknowledged, ''but don't quote me because I can't stand the way it sounds. We're not Wall Street types, most of us who work in magazines.''
What they are is a generation of ''schmoozers,'' a term that crops up with some frequency at the Zig Zag.
''It's a bunch of magazine people schmoozing around in a low-keyed way,'' said Paul Schneider, a free-lance writer who showed up for a party on crutches once and in a cast another time.
Michael Hirschorn, associate editor at Esquire, said: ''It's encoded in our gene pool, this endless desire to schmooze with other journalists, to navel gaze. Our self-involvement is legendary.''
He was perched on a bar stool, drinking martinis with two of the other co-hosts at the parties, Temple Smith and Kathy McCarver. They and the bar owner are among the few constants at the Last Thursday parties, where the 100 or so faces in the crowd change just as the jobs change in the world of musical magazines. Most guests are in their 20's and 30's, they say, and single, but not necessarily looking for dates.
''No great romances come out of these parties,'' said Ms. Smith, a photo consultant, adding that great gossip does emerge, along with an occasional job offer, free-lance assignment or testy encounter. ''Nobody knows who'll show up, so you may see art directors on adjacent bar stools who've been battling each other for years. It's fun to watch.''
Most Last Thursdays have themes, if only to give Ken Kneitel, the graphic artist who designs the announcements, something to play with. The April party was a bring-your-own resume affair honoring three publications that recently disappeared from the newsstands - 7 Days, Model and Taxi.
There was the usual cash bar, but the invitations noted that food stamps would be accepted and unemployment checks cashed. Among the ''exciting door prizes'' listed were straitjackets, dart boards and Librium. Among the free appetizers was Hartz Mountain birdseed, which is made by a company owned by Leonard Stern, who published 7 Days.
''The party was on the same day we got our National Magazine Award, and everyone was struck by the irony,'' said Diane Cardwell, a former 7 Days staff member who is now features editor of Egg magazine.
 
More Than Paychecks Lost
In the magazine world losing a job may mean more than losing a paycheck. There was talk of this at the penultimate meeting of the Last Thursday of the Month Club. One editor's name was switched to the B list at a fashion show. Others were off the press lists for screenings and parties. Press agents they used to dodge would not return their phone calls. They were out of the gossip hub.
The Last Thursday Club provides ''sort of an outreach and counseling service in their time of trouble,'' Mr. Hirschorn said, adding that the house has been quick to buy drinks on such occasions.
When not schmoozing, young magazine people sometimes indulge in freeloading. ''It's an art form with master practitioners,'' Mr. Hirschorn said. ''But most of us are neophytes.''
As for the last Last Thursday of the Month Club (at least at the Zig Zag), Mr. Bernstein predicted that it would be ''a classic, a real Irish wake.''

HEADLINE: DANCE VIEW;
Appreciating the Choreographer's Palette

BYLINE: By JACK ANDERSON

 BODY:
The inventive choreographer often makes much out of only a few steps.
To illustrate: Peter Martins sent 23 dancers hurtling through space in ''Fearful Symmetries,'' his exciting new work that received its premiere by the New York City Ballet earlier this month. In contrast, Claire Porter scarcely moved at all in ''Fitness Digest,'' the comic modern-dance solo she offered last month; instead, she pretended to watch other, invisible people move. Despite the radically different scales of their creations, both Mr. Martins and Ms. Porter were choreographically accomplishing the same thing. 
Let a third choreographer amplify - and brilliantly exemplify - what they were up to. Several years ago, Paul Taylor remarked in an interview that ''the limitations you set up for yourself are a very important part of choreography,'' adding that it is necessary to know ''how to limit your movement palette. And if you know how to limit your palette for a section, or even for the entirety, of a piece, you'll be able to relate movements, and you can make a whole dance out of a minimum of material.''
His words are worth heeding at a time when, perhaps because young dancers today receive such fine technical training, many choreographers cram works with steps that, though physically demanding and visually astonishing, are ultimately ineffectual because they seem unrelated to one another. Mr. Taylor is a master at limiting and controlling his palette. That was especially evident this spring during the Paul Taylor Dance Company's season at the City Center. One program, for instance, contained two striking items from Mr. Taylor's repertory, each with a distinctive movement palette.
''Brandenburgs,'' to excerpts from Bach's Brandenburg Concertos, ends with a wonderful sequence of leaping and spinning. What helps make this conclusion so effervescent is the way the remainder of the choreography artfully contrasts restlessness with rest. Four soloists -a man and three women - often move simply, while an ensemble of five men dashes in and out like frisky puppies. At other times, when the soloists grow lively, the ensemble poses in solid sculptural groupings. Speaking of ''Brandenburgs'' in terms of Mr. Taylor's image of a movement palette, it could be said that this is a work in sunny yellows and cerulean blues.
There is neither brightness nor serenity in Mr. Taylor's ''Danbury Mix.'' With its relentless seethings and scramblings, this creation to orchestral pieces by Charles Ives equates kinetic unrest with social chaos. The members of the community Mr. Taylor depicts are always ready to tear one another apart. Although, once, they do manage to assemble for a parade, it looks as artificially optimistic as much Fourth of July oratory sounds, and it is followed by fits of trembling. An imposing woman who could be a goddess, a saint or the Statue of Liberty occasionally tries to lead them, only to be attacked by them, and she eventually joins them in a riot. ''Danbury Mix'' may have a varied musical spectrum; choreographically, it is all stormy gray.
Mr. Martins's ''Fearful Symmetries'' is as tumultuous as ''Danbury Mix.'' However, the way its space-devouring steps are confidently performed at breakneck speed makes this a choreographic mural in vibrant reds. The title of ''Fearful Symmetries'' comes from the dance's propulsive score by John Adams, who in turn took that phrase from William Blake's poem about a tiger. Nothing restrains the cast's men and women as they leap, sometimes back and forth from side to side, sometimes in long diagonal lines.
Unrelieved abandon can eventually grow musically and choreographically monotonous. Therefore, Mr. Adams shrewdly includes a section in which the music slows a bit - though it never really calms -and to it Mr. Martins has devised a series of pas de deux filled with twistings and coilings, all of which suggest that the energy that had previously been directed outward is now turned inward. Nonetheless, the basic choreographic power remains undiminished. Encounters with space give way to implicitly erotic encounters between two people. When the musical tempo picks up, steps again become extroverted; when the music eventually subsides, the crowds of dancers dwindle away and ''Fearful Symmetries'' fades to an end.
Ms. Porter did nothing but sit on a stool in ''Fitness Digest,'' the solo she performed as part of a Choreographer's Showcase sponsored by Evolving Arts at Dance Space Inc., in lower Manhattan. Portraying a physical-fitness teacher conducting a class, she gave verbal commands to her imaginary pupils, leaned forward to get a better look at them and gestured energetically to spur them on. As the class progressed, she acted stranger and stranger. She was cloyingly sweet one moment, dictatorial the next. Her commands made increasingly less sense until they degenerated into gibberish. At the same time, her gestures grew ever more manic. Her tension ultimately implied that horrifying passions seethed within her. This fitness guru was obviously a monster and possibly also a fake.
Ms. Porter made her points economically. She could have roamed nervously about, demonstrating outlandish exercises; she could have assigned other dancers the roles of timid or bumbling students. Instead, she kept her sketch a solo and sat on a stool. And by doing little - but by doing everything so that the slightest movement counted - she made ''Fitness Digest'' a satirical cartoon drawn in black ink with the sharpest of strokes.

The Force Of Conviction Stirred by the 80's

BYLINE: By Michael Kimmelman

 BODY:
The decade under scrutiny in ''The Decade Show'' - on view through Aug. 19 at three of New York's most innovative museums - is the one that recently ended. But this exhibition could not be more timely. Among its roughly 200 paintings, sculptures, photographs, installations and works on paper is a large-scale drawing from 1987 by a young artist named Y. David Chung that depicts a Korean grocery store in a predominantly black neighborhood, the sort of establishment now so much in the local headlines. Mr. Chung's subject is racial misunderstanding and economic inequality, which he represents by giving to the image an edgy, uneasy and vertiginous feel.
This work, like many others in ''The Decade Show,'' is a cautionary tale. Precisely when vocal elements in New York are advocating strife, the exhibition calls for breaking down barriers. 
It has been organized by the Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art and the New Museum of Contemporary Art - both on lower Broadway - and the Studio Museum in Harlem. Their intention was not to provide a complete survey of art during the last 10 years but to focus on six broad and loosely defined topics that were felt by curators at these institutions to have been ignored or ill represented by the major art museums. At the Museum of Contemporary Hispanic Art are objects under the headings biography/autobiography and sexuality/gender; the New Museum focuses on myth/spirituality/nature and discourse/media, and the Studio Museum concentrates on social practices/cultural criticism and history/memory/artifact.
In each of the museums has been installed a slanting wall hung with paintings that does not so much separate topics as provide a metaphor for the ideas of going against the grain and creating a new order, ideas that are so fundamental to the exhibition.
Included among the 94 American artists in ''The Decade Show'' are names as familiar as those of Eric Fischl and Barbara Kruger, and as unfamiliar as that of Ken Chu, a painter whose iconography is the history and identity of the Chinese-American. The exhibition's strength resides partly in its capacity to make the familiar look fresh. If, for example, Jean-Michel Basquiat's splattered and energetic paintings have been described largely in terms of their links with the neo-Expressionist wave of the 1980's, here their connections with social and political art of the 80's, particularly work involving the use of texts and of pop images, emerge strongly. Basquiat's ties to Tim Rollins and K. O. S. and to artists like Raymond Saunders become immediately apparent.
''The Decade Show'' is the latest and in some ways the most important exhibition yet to address certain major shifts that have rocked the art world in recent years. Principal among these changes has been a multisided attack on the art-historical canon as being Eurocentric, sexist and elitist. The attack has come from within the universities, which are now finding themselves pressured by certain faculty members and students to put social art history and feminism high on their agendas, and from artists like the ones in ''The Decade Show.''
These artists, many of them black or Hispanic or Asian-American, have found inspiration in a diversity of cultures. They have questioned the disjunction between a mainstream culture and a marginal culture by asking, ''Who's mainstream?'' They have attacked the media and advertisers for codifying what they believe to be a language of discrimination. And they have sought alternative texts, other ways of describing and giving dignity to their own experiences.
Sometimes the results are as simple and undeniable as Alfredo Jaar's video display for Times Square, which is represented at the New Museum in still photographs. Entitled ''America,'' it depicts first a United States flag, then the words ''This is not America's flag,'' then a map of both North and South America.
There are also many works in the exhibition that do not rise above the level of agitprop. Some of the objects are heavy with slogans and images preaching to the converted or simply haranguing a viewer. The issue of audience and context has not always been as satisfactorily resolved as in Mr. Jaar's case, or even in the case of the AIDS activist organization Gran Fury, which has designed a poster on the occasion of the exhibition to be distributed throughout New York City.
But there are works here that bear witness to an obvious pain and anger, and that succeed through the force of their convictions. And there are many works that persuade in a gentler way, like the deceptively modest assemblage of a Coke bottle and a cane by David Hammons that exploits allusion and wordplay (the idea of cocaine and its crippling effects) and that endows these mundane objects with a certain humanity.
Cecilia Vicuna makes similar use of found objects, including pieces of wood and bone, to create small-scale sculptures that can remind some viewers of Paul Klee's mystical inventions but that have their sources in pre-Columbian and Andean cultures. Ms. Vicuna's works are meditations on the fragility of the environment. The same subject concerns Maren Hassinger, who has transformed steel, rope and concrete into a sculpture resembling a billowing wheat field that is also a subtle commentary on the uneasy relationship between industry and nature.
In fact, for an exhibition so full of protest and accompanied by a thick catalogue heavy with predictable fury and declamation, ''The Decade Show'' includes an unusually large proportion of works that make their points quietly. Beverly Buchanan's tiny and meticulously constructed shacks pay homage to the experiences of the blacks in the South who have lived in this sort of ramshackle house.
Tomie Arai constructs beautiful mixed-media works that seem to derive partly from Japanese painted screens and that deal eloquently with the experiences of Asian immigrants in the United States. Martin Puryear is represented by a sensually curved construction in red cedar and pine that can bring to mind an ancient tool or an object of ritual significance.
That is to say, there are a good number of works that demand to be judged not simply on polemical grounds but also on formal terms, although the roots of their formalism are not necessarily European. Abstraction - in the form of violent and energetic paintings like Carlos Alfonzo's ''Gulfstream,'' or elegant and seemingly Japanese-inspired works on paper like Ismael Frigerio's ''Disruption of the Body (The Others' Great Utopia Series)'' - has been included in the exhibition.
But abstract works seem, in this context, to refer to particular places and events. Mel Edwards's welded steel ''Gate of Ogun,'' for example, which is inspired by a gate that the artist saw in Africa, cannot fail to raise the issue of passage - passage from one culture to another, perhaps, or from freedom to slavery.
''The Decade Show,'' in other words, embraces many ways of looking at things, many sources, many voices. What binds this large and diverse show together is indicated by its subtitle, ''Frameworks of Identity in the 1980's.'' This identity may be defined as Asian-American or Hispanic, black or Native American, gay or lesbian. It may be defined as someone who has been diagnosed as having the human immunodeficiency virus. It may not be defined along racial, sexual, economic or physical terms at all, but according to spirituality or psychology.
In any case, it is expressed in myriad ways that the exhibition seems to argue are all valid. High among the show's goals is the promotion of a cultural pluralism that will anger those who regard this philosophy as an assault on inalienable artistic values and standards. But to see the exhibition simply as an assault on tradition is to overlook the conciliatory tone that is also an essential aspect of the display. This ultimately is what makes ''The Decade Show'' so timely. In a city that seems increasingly divided along racial and ethnic lines, it speaks about inclusion and accommodation.

An article May 13 (''Are We Eating Our Seed Corn?'') discussed the extent to which many large American corporations, and the General Electric Company in particular, are buying back their stock and thus spending less on research and development and missing opportunities to develop innovative products. Business executives, members of Congress, academics and other experts on American industrial policy said in the article that such financial engineering often reflects short-term thinking and is sapping American competitiveness. G.E. officials defended the plan to buy back $10 billion of its stock over the next five years, pointing out that the company is a world leader in those fields in which it has chosen to compete and that its research and development is adequately funded.

Deregulation of Bank Interest Is the Key
 
To the Editor:
 You quote the critics of the corporations that spend billions to buy back their own stock instead of using the capital to develop new products. The buybacks presumably reflect ''short-term thinking and a lack of confidence'' and damage American competitiveness. Your report overlooks what may be the most important underlying factors.
It is widely known by now that firms buy their own stock to drive up share price, thereby heading off corporate raiders about to attempt hostile takeovers. The managers have little choice but to make share values increase at a faster rate than shareholders could obtain from insured bank accounts. Because the firms often must borrow money to buy back the shares, the ironic result is that share values increase as the firms become more burdened with debt. Meanwhile, the managers are widely applauded for having increased share values.
The basic cause of the foolishness is largely ignored. The deregulation of depositor interest rates has caused financial turmoil everywhere, this example being only one of many. Companies cannot be bothered with research and development when they must offer shareholders higher rates than the government guarantees.
Depositor rates will be re-regulated one day, although we may have to experience another Great Depression before common sense returns. Obviously, buybacks artificially drive up share values to dangerously inflated levels.

 Where Are the Leaders?
 
To the Editor:
 Where are this country's industrialists? While the United States has a rich supply of entrepreneurs and an ample coterie of industrial policy advocates, where are the individual business leaders capable of mobilizing the capital and human resources needed to capture global dominance in emerging industries - particularly new electronics industries?
As the era of data processing comes to a close and a new era of social computing is born, computer technology will move from the corporate back office into our schools, our cars and our living rooms. Bold new products - representing the merger between today's consumer electronics and computer businesses - will generate hundreds of billions of dollars in worldwide sales. What if the American leadership in data processing becomes a handicap instead of a strength as growth shifts to these new markets?
If American corporations rely on financial managers, bureaucrats and dealmakers to establish industrial priorities, as a nation we will miss the boat. Taking long-term risks and supporting innovation in pursuit of growth is the responsibility of individual leaders who think of themselves as creating new industries and contributing to enduring cultural values. The significant difference between the United States and Japan in this regard isn't the cost of capital - it is the capacity to mobilize sufficient quantities of risk capital. Indeed, as suggested in your article, it would be interesting to know how Mr. Welch's goals compare with those of Mr. Morita.

HEADLINE: ALL ABOUT;
AFTER A DECADE OF CONSOLIDATION, HARD TIMES AWAIT CARPET MAKERS

BYLINE: By JOSH KURTZ

 BODY:
For the American carpet companies that survived waves of consolidation during the 1980's, the real challenge is just beginning. Now they face an era of slack demand from their customers in real estate and the automobile industry. New products are at best a distant promise. And the growth of Shaw Industries Inc. threatens its rivals.
Analysts say the industry will become still more concentrated. A report to be issued by Carpet and Rug Industry magazine counts 170 domestic carpet makers in 1990, down from 350 in 1980. The leading and third-ranked producers from 1980 are gone. Thirteen North American mills have been sold in the last 16 months, with nine independent carpet makers absorbed into other companies.
 
From Luxury to Necessity
Three Decades Of Strong Growth 
Before the late 1950's, carpeting was a luxury. Now, the mills turn out so many millions of yards, so rapidly and inexpensively, that carpeting is usually far cheaper than hardwood floors. ''Now we almost take it for granted,'' said Ronald E. VanGelderen, president of the Carpet and Rug Institute in Dalton, Ga. Almost three-quarters of the nation's carpet mills are in the Dalton area, where labor and water remain plentiful and relatively cheap.
Carpet production set a record in 1989 of almost 1.4 billion square yards, or, as Mr. VanGelderen is fond of saying, ''an amount equal to a nine-lane interstate highway, fully carpeted, around the Equator.'' But the age of strongly increasing sales appears to be over. Production rose 224 percent in the 1960's and 76 percent in the 1970's. But output rose only 13 percent during the 1980's, and that gain was largely due to the introduction of stain-resistant carpeting.
Now that roughly 80 percent of all residential carpeting made in the United States has some form of stain blocker, even the industry's optimists admit that the rush to buy carpeting has subsided. Still, Mr. VanGelderen sees some profits even in economic adversity. Housing starts are down, but people who are moving, or updating their current homes, often call for new carpeting, he says. Fifty-five percent of all residential carpeting sales are replacements, with the other 45 percent for new homes. Five years ago, those numbers were reversed. As for commercial buildings, Mr. VanGelderen said: ''If there are office-building gluts, the realtor will want to spruce up the place, and that will include new carpeting.''
It's tough enough to double and redouble sales in a high-tech, high-growth industry like computer software. But Shaw Industries, also of Dalton, has expanded rapidly in a slower business where soft ware means shag carpeting.
In 1980, Carpet and Rug Industry magazine listed West-Point Pepperell, with $402 million in annual sales, as the nation's leading carpet maker. Armstrong World Industries was third, with $240 million, and Shaw sixth, with $213 million. A decade later, with sales up 656 percent, Shaw heads the list. Sales of almost $1.2 billion for the year ending last July 31, before a recent acquisition, gave Shaw almost three times the volume of its nearest competitor, Burlington Industries. West-Point and Armstrong? They are both owned by Shaw.
Analysts attribute the company's success to its president and chief executive, Robert E. Shaw. He saved money but sustained employee motivation by hiring a young, aggressive sales staff and paying straight salaries with no commissions. He signed relatively short, flexible agreements with retailers, keeping prices down by being one of the first manufacturers to eliminate distributors.
 
The Rise of Shaw
A Fast, Flexible Style Pays Off
In an industry that is now thoroughly modernized, Mr. Shaw was one of the first to automate. He maintained strong cash flow, so that when other mills came up for sale, he was able to buy. ''Bob Shaw is one of the great mavericks of the carpet industry,'' said Frank O'Neill, editor of the Carpet and Rug Industry magazine.
Most analysts predict that the company's market share, now 22 percent, will continue to grow. Mr. O'Neill believes Shaw could pass 40 percent in the 1990's through more acquisitions. Mr. Shaw says his company can dominate the carpet business the way the General Motors Corporation once dominated the market for cars.
''It's not unusual in a maturing industry for the industry leader to have that kind of market share,'' he said.
Not that Shaw's path will be easy. On May 9, John Baugh, an analyst with Wheat First Butcher & Singer Securities, said that the weak economy was the reason for cutting his earnings estimates for Shaw - by eight cents a share, to $2.15, for the year that ended March 31, and 12 cents a share, to $2.85, for the current fiscal year.
The day Mr. Baugh revised his figures, Shaw stock plunged 2 7/8 points, to 30 1/4, and lost an additional 1 1/2 points the next day. It has recently recovered somewhat to hover at about 31. Mr. Baugh said he was shocked by the stock's jumpiness. ''A company usually doesn't fall on such minor changes,'' he said. When it comes to carpet companies, ''I think it tells you how skittish the market is.''
More and more carpet makers, frustrated with the industry's weak growth, are ready to give up. Armstrong World Industries Inc., a home furnishings manufacturer, had a carpet division that was one of the industry's leaders, with 1988 sales of $368 million. Last fall, after sales and earnings had been slipping for eight months, Armstrong sold its carpet operations to Shaw.
 
The Rise of Shaw
A Fast, Flexible Style Pays Off
With many other smaller companies leaving the business, Mr. O'Neill doubts that consolidation will abate or that another company will rival Shaw's size. If anyone can challenge Shaw, Mr. O'Neill picks Beaulieu of America, also based in Dalton. Although ranked 31st in the United States, with estimated sales of $68 million last year, it is owned by the Beaulieu Group of Belgium, with worldwide sales of about $970 million.
Mr. Shaw said that Beaulieu could hinder him if he tries to expand overseas. Carpeting is seldom exported, because shipping it is so expensive. American carpet mills have been largely free from the foreign competition that has afflicted other textile industries. But Beaulieu has opened a mill in the United States. ''They are obviously intent on establishing a presence in this industry on a worldwide basis,'' said Mr. O'Neill.
If Shaw can't be surpassed in volume, smaller, nimble companies might rely on creative marketing or imaginative design. A few small companies are successfully making higher-priced designer carpets. Karastan-Bigelow has reached about $320 million in sales, fifth in the nation, by producing decorative area rugs and reproducing American designs from the 19th century. Other less resourceful companies face a struggle. ''Right now, I'm really pessimistic about the rest of the industry'' Mr. O'Neill said. ''If companies don't establish themselves to try to find a niche, like fashion, they're going to have a hard time competing with Shaw.''
 
 
 
CAN CARPETS MAKE YOU ILL?
In a Washington office building, the brown tweed carpeting installed in 1987 seemed like nothing more than standard government decor. But within days, employees complained of dizziness, sore throats and flu symptoms, with one rushed to a hospital in respiratory shock. It was one of the carpeting industry's worst moments: Everyone who became ill worked for the Environmental Protection Agency.
No one at the E.P.A. has proved what caused the illnesses, but most point to the carpeting. Ronald E. VanGelderen, president of the Carpet and Rug Institute, says that the carpeting might have deteriorated while stored in a warehouse for more than a year.
The incident prompted the industry to work with the E.P.A. and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to develop carpets that give off fewer vapors and are less prone to chemically react with fluids like animal urine or medication. In the last three years the safety commission has received more than 130 complaints about carpeting, mostly about eye and throat irritation.
Mr. VanGelderen said tests will show there is no danger from properly stored carpeting installed in adequately ventilated buildings (the E.P.A.'s windows did not open). Dr. Mark Van Ert, director of the University of Arizona occupational safety and health program, says that a suspect chemical in carpeting has been cleared in testing so far. ''That doesn't mean we're ready to give it a clean bill of health yet,'' he said. ''But at least it suggests that it's not highly toxic.'' He says that the adhesives used to secure carpeting might be the culprits. Many scientists believe that indoor pollutants have contributed to the symptoms of illness as much as the carpets.And Mr. VanGelderen contends the problem may be one of perception, because, he says, new carpeting often gives off strong, though harmless, odors.
Even as the industry seeks to debunk the odor theory, some might try to profit from it. Just as stain-resistant carpeting increased revenues during the 1980's, Mr. VanGeldern hopes that the introduction of fume-free carpets - in a few years, maybe - will aid the industry in the 90's.

FOREIGN INVESTORS, LOCAL POLITICS

BYLINE: By JOHN CAHILL: John Cahill is the managing director and chief executive of BTR P.L.C.

 BODY:
In the first contested takeover of the 1990's, the company I manage, BTR P.L.C., announced its desire to purchase the Norton Company in what securities analysts viewed as a model tender offer. BTR raised its cash through traditional bank loans, not ''junk bonds,'' and pledged that it had absolutely no plans to sell off parts of the company, close plants or even move Norton's headquarters from its hometown of Worcester, Mass.
While I had hoped to work out an agreement with Norton on amicable terms, the reaction to our offer was as negative as it was instantaneous and astonishing. Encouraged by Norton's management, workers who had never heard of BTR - or BTR's long history of helping its subsidiaries operate and prosper on a semi-autonomous basis - declared that the British industrial manufacturer was a ''corporate raider.'' On the day I visited Worcester to explain BTR's intentions to local constituencies, Norton employees demonstrated without hearing what I had to say. They shouted ''U.S.A., U.S.A.'' and burned the Union Jack. 
This reaction was quickly echoed by state politicians. Local leaders boasted in the press that they had immediately begun work on ''emergency'' legislation to ''save'' Norton. The legislation was quickly passed by a sparsely attended, informal session of the Legislature. It took two hours for a handful of lawmakers to change radically corporate law in the commonwealth.
Not to be outdone, Gov.Michael Dukakis signed the bill the next morning in a Norton plant. Before cheering Norton workers, Mr. Dukakis compared BTR's tender offer to the British invasion of America during the Revolutionary War, explaining that it was ''another attempt by a foreign power to interfere with our ability to shape our own destiny.''
Meanwhile, Norton management continually claimed that a foreign company would be an unfit parent because of Norton's highly sensitive ceramics work for the American defense industry. Norton's defense claims were pressed upon Congress despite Britain's close ties to the United States and BTR's own work for the Defense Department. These efforts culminated in a letter to President Bush, signed by 120 congressmen, warning that a foreign acquisition of Norton would jeopardize national security.
So where did all the talk of foreign powers and national security take us? Weeks later, Norton announced that it had signed a merger agreement with a French company, Compagnie de Saint-Gobain, under terms similar to what BTR offered but for substantially more money than BTR was willing to pay. Furthermore, despite all the anti-foreigner hysteria generated by Norton, Norton management knew for much of the time after our bid that it could merge with the French company on terms amenable to senior management.
In the end it can be said that the free market worked, in spite of politics. Norton stock is now worth almost twice as much as it would have been without BTR's initiative. But the attempt by Norton management and its political allies to interfere with that system is most concerning, both for the integrity of state government and for America's ability to preach the virtues of free and fair markets to Japan and the world.
I would suggest that there are at least two lessons to be learned from the battle over Norton. The first is that responsible business mergers should not be confused with the junk bond-financed takeovers of the 1980's. Globalization and market consolidation in Europe, the United States and elsewhere promise more international business combinations in the years ahead. If economics drives politics, then this trend - promoted by the United States for decades - will surely create the sort of global economic interdependence that insures world peace and stability.
The second lesson is that state governments are clearly setting a precedent to become the unquestioning defenders of local management. And as the Norton case demonstrates, entrenched managements will not shy away from manipulation, even when they know those manipulations will become obvious. Company employees and local politicians have every right to be skeptical of proposed takeovers. But if they do not apply the same skepticism to their own management, they are likely to be left with executives who are much more adept at playing politics than they are at managing competitive companies that generate jobs and prosperity over the long haul.

THE PYRAMID AND THE WEB

BYLINE: By SALLY HELGESEN; Sally Helgesen is author of ''The Female Advantage: Women's Ways of Leadership.''

 BODY:
Over lunch one day with Frances Hesselbein, the national executive director of the Girl Scouts, I listened as she described the ''circular management system'' she had devised. ''Here's me, in the center,'' she explained, setting her glass of iced tea in the middle of the table, then surrounding it with a circle of cups, more glasses, a pepper mill, ''and this is my first management team.'' She constructed more circles, building outward concentrically, then began linking them, using knives and forks as radials. ''The great thing about the circle is it does not box you in. You can connect with any other point. As the circles extend outward, the fabric becomes more interwoven.''
I watched fascinated, for the woman who Peter Drucker says ''could manage any company in America'' had created the perfect image of a spider's web, that delicate tracery whose purpose is to draw other creatures into it. 
It is not unusual that women, setting up their own companies or running divisions of larger corporations over which they have relative autonomy, would create organizational structures different from those developed by men during the long years when they defined and managed the public world of work. The women in business whom I have studied have tended to disdain that most traditional of business structures - the hierarchical ladder. When they described their place or role in their companies, they, like Ms. Hesselbein, spoke of a desire to be in the center of things, rather than at the top, which they perceived as a lonely and disconnected position. Inseparable from this notion of being in the center was the women's desire to be connected to all those around them as if by invisible strands or threads constructed around the central point.
These images - the hierarchy and the web - are in a way mirror opposites, since the most desirable place in the one is the worst spot in the other. Hierarchy values position, individual achievement won by competition, while the web puts a premium on affiliation, on staying close.
Until recently, the hierarchical pyramid was considered the very model of organizational efficiency, and for heavy industry this may have been true. But as today's companies attempt to restructure in response to the very different needs of the information age, the value of the old pyramid is being questioned: Didn't hierarchy give birth to slow-moving bureaucracy? The old military model chain-of-command increasingly is seen as too lumbering and muscle-bound for a fast-changing global economy - and far too expensive as well. Progressive companies are trying out new structures. And it is in this restructuring that the web of inclusion - that product of the female psyche - has a contribution to make.
The advantages of a web structure are many. For one thing, because it is not primarily concerned with where people stand or how they are ranked, it permits flexibility without lowering morale. A person can serve on various teams without worrying about whether the assignment is appropriate to his or her status, thus taking full advantage of the person's talents and skills. As Ms. Hesselbein explained to me as she constructed her circles, ''When someone gets shifted, it doesn't feel like a demotion, because there is no up or down.''
Another advantage of the web structure is that it permits a greater flow of information, because there are more points of connection or contact. In a hierarchy the information flow is strictly up or down, along appropriate channels. And because information is power, there can be a tendency to hoard it.
The web's more direct, free-flowing, multiconnected mode mimics the workings of the microchip or circuit board. This feminine method of management is more appropriate to today's environment than a model first developed to serve the needs of Caesar's army.

HEADLINE: 'Junk Bond' Anxiety Shakes the G.I.C.

BYLINE: By DEBORAH RANKIN

 BODY:
The collapse of the ''junk bond'' market and the well-publicized troubles of the First Executive Corporation, whose California insurance unit has the largest investment portfolio of the high-risk, high-yield bonds, have prompted employers and employees to stop and take a closer look at what has been a popular vehicle for retirement plans.
At issue are the billions of dollars that have been placed in Guaranteed Investment Contracts, or G.I.C.'s, the investment option chosen by most employees who participate in 401(k) plans. Under these plans, employees salt away pre-tax rather than after-tax dollars by agreeing to defer part of their salary and invest it in one of several types of options offered by their companies. Even though a stock mutual fund is typically one of the choices offered, roughly two out of three employees - wary of placing their retirement savings in equities in the wake of the two October stock-market crashes - select a fixed-income option.
While it might go by some unrevealing label, like Fixed Income or Capital Preservation Fund, the underpinning for this option is a G.I.C. For large employers, participants' money is more likely invested in a handful of G.I.C.'s issued by several insurance companies, with maturities ranging from one to five years. 
Until recently, G.I.C.'s were almost a no-brainer, widely considered to be the safest choice (even though stocks significantly outperform bonds over the long term), because the insurance companies guaranteed the interest rate on the money.
''Participants got a good rate of interest, guaranteed to be competitive, without the risk of losing principal,'' said Murray L. Becker, president of Becker & Rooney in Teaneck, N.J., a leading G.I.C. consulting firm that serves large employers. For example, top rates on three-year G.I.C.'s, which are typically compared with Treasury securities of the same maturity, are about 9.3 percent, or half a point or so above Treasuries.
Most large employers have always known, however, that the guarantee behind a G.I.C. was only as good as the creditworthiness of the insurance company that issued it. And when the junk-bond market began to unravel - and First Executive's troubles began to surface - plan sponsors were deluged with questions from employees about the safety of G.I.C.'s.
First Executive announced an $859 million charge against earnings in 1989 to reflect the declining value of the junk bonds held by its subsidiaries, including the California-based Executive Life Insurance Company and, to a lesser extent, the Executive Life Insurance Company of New York. The bonds constituted nearly 45 percent of the assets of First Executive's operating units.
First Executive'S chairman, Fred Carr, says that people are focusing on a safety problem that does not exist. ''We have a very, very strong capital position and a very, very strong cash position and high liquidity,'' he said.
Moreover, industry experts are quick to point out that Executive Life of California accounts for less than 2 percent of all G.I.C. contracts and that only a small percentage of retirement money overall is in junk bonds. And they note that no G.I.C. participant has ever lost a dime.
Nonetheless, ''employers are now getting bombarded with inquiries, if not from rank-and-file employees, then from senior managers,'' Mr. Becker said. ''Plan sponsors have become more sensitive to the employee-relations aspect of G.I.C.'s.''
Indeed, large employers who sponsor 401(k) plans are getting fussier about which insurance companies to use. ''Everybody's very nervous, and plan sponsors, because of their fiduciary responsibility, are leaning toward safety,'' said John B. Kleiman, a vice president at Conning & Company, a Hartford investment firm.
The mounting concern is creating opportunities for commercial banks, which already had been making inroads into the 401(k) investment business, to increase their share of the G.I.C. market. The financial stakes are enormous and the battle for turf has already set off a skirmish in Washington.
The G.I.C. market is estimated to total between $150 billion and $160 billion. About $30 billion of new contracts are written annually, including maturing contracts that are reinvested. Although there is no central source of statistics, it is estimated that banks (which call their version of the contracts Bank Investment Contracts, or B.I.C.'s) obtained from one-tenth to one-third of the new contracts written last year, and are expected to do about as well in 1990.
Insurance companies maintain that banks have an unfair advantage because they are able to ''pass through'' Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation coverage.
''Life insurance companies are backed by their own full faith and credit, while banks have a universal guarantee provided at taxpayer expense,'' said Henri Bersoux, a spokesman for the American Council of Life Insurance, an industry trade group based in Washington.
The life insurance industry maintains that the pass-through of deposit insurance will encourage small, weak banks to take unwarranted risks in bidding for G.I.C. business, and could lead to problems for commercial banks that would rival the savings and loan crisis. (An attempt to ban the pass-through of F.D.I.C. coverage was narrowly defeated in Congress last year, but the council plans to begin another effort again this year.) Such protection already has reached its limits, Mr. Bersoux said. ''How much is enough? The F.D.I.C. already insures your savings account and your checking account.'' Eventually, he predicted, banks could become the dominant players in the G.I.C. business.
''That would be nice, but I don't think it's very likely,'' said David J. Salvin, vice president of global funding for the Bankers Trust Company, the leading issuer of B.I.C.'s.
In fact, the three banks that have the lion's share of the B.I.C. business - the others are Citibank and Morgan Guaranty - have said they would be glad to give up the insurance coverage if they could also give up paying the premiums that are tied to B.I.C. contracts, something that is not an option now.
Many consulting firms view the additional competition in the G.I.C. field as a positive development. ''The entry of a new class of issuers - banks - is healthy in a growing market,'' said Marjorie E. Zwick, a principal with William M. Mercer Asset Planning Inc., a New York pension consulting firm. ''It has helped to even out the supply-and-demand equation.''
One likely outcome of the continuing changes in the G.I.C. business is that plan sponsors will seek even more diversification, Mr. Salvin of Bankers Trust said. Companies that are neither banks nor insurers could enter the market, floating G.I.C.'s of their own, he said.
In a separate development, a group of state regulators, the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, proposed new guidelines earlier this month that may have the effect of limiting insurance company ownership of junk bonds. The guidelines, which would be phased in over a period of five years, are expected to be approved by regulators in June.
For now, experts say that a large-scale insurance industry default involving household names is almost unthinkable and that even if an insurer as big as Executive Life of California were to default, it would still have valuable assets that could be sold, enabling participants to recover most of their investment.
To show how minimal the effect would be, Mr. Becker of Becker & Rooney provided a worst-case scenario should Executive Life become insolvent. A 401(k) plan might have 10 percent of its assets invested with that insurance company; and if the company had to write down 25 percent of its assets, a plan participant might see the value of his or her account shrink by 2.5 percent.
''But this would only happen if your plan had placed money with Executive Life,'' Mr. Becker said. ''Since the rest of the insurance industry has not followed down Executive Life's path, the vast majority of G.I.C.'s are not at risk.''
Other insurance experts say that junk bonds are not the only problem facing insurance companies. ''You've got to look at the entire portfolio of a G.I.C. issuer,'' said Bill Morris of the Laughlin Group, a Beaverton, Ore., G.I.C. consulting firm. ''Some companies that have invested heavily in the oil patch areas of the Southwest and in parts of New England have a much greater exposure to real estate problems than they do to junk bonds.''
Still other factors can impair an insurer's creditworthiness, Mr. Morris added. His firm has recommended, for example, against awarding G.I.C. contracts to several insurance companies with healthy investment portfolios because they either had a lack of reserves to cover a risky new line of underwriting business or because their profits were being ''diverted and upstreamed'' by the insurer's corporate parent.
All of these concerns are causing employers to start setting credit targets for their G.I.C. holdings, often aiming for portfolios with an overall credit rating of at least AA. (See box.) ''We are seeing more clients who are adopting minimum credit requirements for the purchase of future G.I.C.'s and B.I.C.'s,'' said Ms. Zwick of Mercer Asset Planning. ''Some may have had informal minimums before, but we certainly think it is prudent for them to adopt a formal investment policy now.''
 
 
 
INSIST ON THE DETAILS
Should you be worried if your 401(k) plan is in a Guaranteed Investment Contract? Probably not. But to sleep well at night, you might want to find out exactly where that money is invested. The goal is ''not to have all your G.I.C. eggs in one basket,'' said Marjorie E. Zwick, a principal with William M. Mercer Asset Planning Inc., a New York consulting firm.
The place to begin your inquiries is with your plan administrator, typically your company's employee benefits department. Ask which insurance companies and banks are represented in the plan's G.I.C. portfolio, and what portion of the portfolio each issuer accounts for.
In the past, it was not unusual for plans to place all their fixed-income money with one issuer. But now the norm among large companies is to spread that money among several insurers or banks. Smaller plans, however, may still have just one or two G.I.C. issuers. That is probably fine, as long as your plan has not put all of its fixed-income money into G.I.C.'s issued by a company with a big portfolio of troubled ''junk bonds.'' The quality of an issuer's portfolio, as well as other factors, is reflected in its credit rating. The higher the credit rating, the less likely the company (and its G.I.C.'s) will run into trouble.
Ask your plan administrator for the credit rating of each issuer. Top-rated insurance companies will have an AAA rating, while top-rated banks generally have an AA rating. Issuers with ratings below single-A are considered more risky.
If you are troubled by what you learn, it may be time to consider making changes in the way your 401(k) contributions are invested. While participants in a minority of plans are given no say about how their money is invested, most plans allow investment options to be changed, typically two to four times a year. You might want to follow the example of managers of large pension funds, who put about two-thirds of the money they handle into the stock market and the rest into bonds and cash.
But it is doubtful that you would be allowed to pick and choose among G.I.C. issuers and keep, say, the 25 percent of your holdings issued by insurance company A, but liquidate the 75 percent issued by companies B and C. And it is probably not prudent to liquidate all your current holdings in fixed-income investments and convert them to equities. Diversification - among types of investments, as well as among types of issuers - remains a key to both safety and performance.
''So don't throw the baby out with the bath water,'' Ms. Zwick warned.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Will Oil Gush Again? Ask the Saudis

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Do the Saudis know something that American oil traders are only beginning to suspect?
That question arose last week as the Saudis were reported to be dumping gold, which plunged in price in response to the sales. A widespread rumor had it that they sold the gold to pay for American Treasury bonds, of all things. 
The conventional wisdom in the brokerage community this year has been that oil prices are headed up, at least in the long term. The world is again running short of oil, goes the argument, and the oil exporters have learned their lesson and will restrict production enough to push up prices.
As it happens, on the same day that the Saudis sold gold, oil prices fell in reaction to reports that showed rapidly rising inventories of crude. But the prevalent Wall Street view sees that as temporary, which is why crude prices for delivery next year fell only a bit, even as prices for nearby delivery were plunging, with July futures down $1.62 a barrel for the week, to $17.80.
The available evidence now is that if any oil producer is cheating on production limits imposed by the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, it is probably Kuwait. ''We know Saudi Arabia is adhering to its new quota,'' said William Randol, an oil analyst at the First Boston Corporation who thinks the long-term bullish case for crude is still intact.
But if the Saudis are loading up on Treasury bonds, one has to suspect that they have an opinion on bond prices - that they will rise as yields fall - that is unlikely to be accurate if oil prices zoom higher. Historically, rising oil prices have usually meant bad news for both the stock and bond markets. And if any country can hold down oil prices, simply by pumping more oil, it is Saudi Arabia.
Falling gold and oil prices helped to restrain inflationary fears, but the small rebound in gold prices after the Saudis stopped selling may indicate that the plunge in gold reflected the illiquidity of that market more than a changing investment outlook. Gold futures for June delivery traded as low as $361 per ounce, but ended the week off just $7.20, at $368.40.
If the rumored market moves by the Saudis turn out to be wise, that would be good news for the stock market. But after struggling upward for most of last week, share prices fell on Friday as the Government reported personal income was a bit higher than expected in April, thus damaging the case that a slowing economy will force the Federal Reserve to ease interest rates. It was the first time since January that consumer spending rose more rapidly than income, a fact that depressed bond prices.
The Dow Jones industrial average ended the week up 1.01 points, to 2,820.92, after setting a new peak of 2,856.26 on Wednesday. Some chart readers saw significance in the fact that the market rally died just as the Standard & Poor's 500 was making its second unsuccessful attempt at topping the record close of 359.80 it reached last October. It closed at 359.29 on Wednesday, having reached 359.69 in January. For the week, the S&P slipped 0.06 to 354.58.

HEADLINE: What's Big and Hairy And Worries Wall Street Silly?

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The stock market has been hitting new highs in recent weeks, but Wall Street can't get its mind off something else that has gone through the roof: the Federal budget deficit.
With the White House and Congress engaged in yet another highly publicized effort, the fifth in nine years, to pull the United States out of its budgetary morass, many on the Street are saying that time is running out. A failure to achieve a credible budget reduction this time around, they say, will consign the country to years of sub-par growth and, sooner or later, to a recession that might otherwise have been avoided.
''A budget deal is of the utmost urgency,'' contended Rimmer de Vries, chief economist for J. P. Morgan & Company. ''If we are to prevent a recession, we have to have an agreement.'' 
Indeed, with the deficit approaching $200 billion this year, twice as much as the Administration estimated just four months ago, the concern is deep enough that many Wall Streeters say they would accept tax increases, even a hike in the income tax, if this were needed for a budget breakthrough.
''If it takes tax increases, that's the price we have to pay,'' said Darwin L. Beck, an economist at the First Boston Corporation.
''I wish we didn't have to,'' added Carl B. Weinberg of High Frequency Economics Ltd., an advisory firm based in New York, even as he acknowledged that higher taxes are probably inevitable. He noted that most of his overseas clients regard American taxes as ''ridiculously low.''
As it happens, the noble-sounding sentiments about deficit reduction largely coincide with Wall Street's self-interest. A tax increase might well send the stock market up further, at least in the short term, said some on the Street, explaining that almost any serious action on the deficit would be greeted warmly by the markets.
The call for action was heard repeatedly in interviews with people in the securities and financial industries. Fiscal policy was first on nearly every agenda for change involving Washington, handily eclipsing even such emotion-laden subjects as trade policy with Japan or, in some quarters, the transfer of regulatory authority over stock-index futures to the Securities and Exchange Commission. (See box.) If taxes are to go up, the most likely candidates appear to be ''sin'' levies on tobacco and alcohol. Energy taxes have big revenue potential but involve regional rivalries. Raising income taxes seems to be everyone's last resort, but most appear to be willing to bite that bullet, too. The raise most likely would take the form of an across-the-board top rate of 33 percent, instead of the current ''blended'' mix of rates that results in a final bracket of 28 percent for the biggest earners. The increase could be made more palatable by linking it to a restoration of the break for capital gains.
To be sure, not everyone thinks a trade-off like that would be acceptable to most of those who work on the Street.
''They just don't want to give up any more of their paychecks,'' said Lawrence A. Kudlow, the chief economist for Bear, Stearns & Company and a former official in the hard-line anti-tax Reagan Administration.
Nonetheless, various combinations of spending cuts and tax increases would win considerable support, those interviewed generally said, as evidence that the nation's political leaders were finally finding a way to deal with the long-festering problem.
Warnings about the deficit sparking a recession have been sounded before during the budgetary gridlock of the past half decade or so, yet the business expansion of the last seven and a half years, the second-longest on record, remains intact. Now, however, economic growth has slowed substantially because the Federal Reserve has been forced to counter fiscal laxity with persistently high interest rates. So, the risks may have climbed. Wall Street itself has made the consequences of any recession more dire because of its role during the 1980's in increasing corporate America's reliance on borrowed money.
The economy, in fact, is looking fragile enough for some people to question whether it could stand the amount of deficit reduction that would now be required to meet fully the targets specified by the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation. Gramm-Rudman, which was adopted in 1985, set deficit-reduction targets originally intended to lead to a balanced budget by 1991.
Senior people on Wall Street are in overwhelming agreement that what is needed most to keep the economy growing is a plan to bring the deficit down in a gradual but steady way.
''Wall Street has gotten pretty skeptical, if not cynical,'' about the political process, said James R. Schlesinger, a long-time Washington hand who serves as a senior adviser to Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. The remedy, he added, is to put the fiscal problem ''on a path toward solution over the intermediate term - the next five years or so.''
The Gramm-Rudman legislation, of course, is one such attempt but American budget discipline has been so poor that there is no longer any realistic hope of meeting the Gramm-Rudman goals. Its standards have already been officially compromised by allowing the law's deficit targets to recede by two years.
Dismayed by Washington's proclivity to respond to Gramm-Rudman with little more than smoke and mirrors, many critics in the financial markets and elsewhere insist that the budget-making process become more transparent and less vulnerable to accounting tricks and unrealistic hopes.
Isn't something very wrong, asked Roger M. Kubarych, a manager at Henry Kaufman & Company, when almost nobody noticed until eight months into the current fiscal year that the budget had gone into a ditch?
''We're not looking for a miracle here, just more clarity, more openness and more honesty,'' Mr. Kubarych said.
While those who, say, trade bonds for a living may revel in such lurches, it is widely accepted that the economy, the markets, investors and society at large would fare better if Washington found the will to put the deficit into a soundly conceived shrinkage.
Such an accord would almost certainly reduce interest rates, even if the economy continued to expand and, as now seems to be the case, even if the nation's shrinking trade deficit puts fewer dollars in the hands of foreigners for reinvestment here.
The Federal Reserve, no longer needing to regard itself as the sole defense against inflation, could relax monetary policy. With the Government's priority claim on the capital market diminished, private savings would increase. Investors could finance more enterprises. Productive capacity could expand, supporting economic growth while keeping a lid on prices.
There are some alternatives if a grand budget compromise cannot be reached. M. Kathryn Eickhoff, president of Eickhoff Economics Inc., a consulting firm in New York and Washington, is one of those who thinks the President should be given authority to veto individual budget items and to rescind previously approved spending.
''Something's got to be done,'' Ms. Eickhoff said, even while acknowledging that these measures remain a political long shot.
But will anything be done? Last week, President Bush angered Democrats in Congress when he said that Congress bears the primary responsibility for solving the fiscal mess. In turn, the Democrats accused Mr. Bush of jeopardizing the budget talks by refusing to offer a plan of his own. Some of the Democrats are already saying that the talks could break down within weeks.
That would only confirm Wall Street's worst fears. The Street's own scandals notwithstanding, many in the securities industry say that Washington has behaved like an irresponsible teen-ager in handling money - and could well continue to do so.
''I'm extremely discouraged about how we make decisions,'' said Donald H. Straszheim, senior economist at Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Inc., pondering this year's jump in the deficit. ''This is insanity.''
 
 
 
FEARS FOR TRADE AND THE FED, TOO
There are other things on Wall Street's Washington agenda, of course, besides the deficit. Perhaps the most important is the mechanism for the steady expansion of world trade.
''Wall Streeters would like to see a more open global economy, in terms of both goods and services,'' said Robert D. Hormats, vice chairman of the Goldman Sachs International Corporation. He said he expected the Bush Administration to press vigorously for American interests in the current round of negotiations to improve the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
Another vital interest, though one not seriously threatened, is the continued ability of the Federal Reserve to conduct an independent monetary policy, largely shielded from passing political pressures. Some Congressional proposals would dent the Fed's armor in this respect but they are not expected to be adopted.
A more immediate fear is that Washington would go overboard in responding to the surge of interest in environmental matters and would jettison the cost-benefit analysis and market-based policy that the Administration and others have sought, with a certain amount of success, to achieve.
''There is great concern that actions on the environmental front will be taken with too little consideration of the economic and financial impacts,'' said James R. Schlesinger, who served as Energy Secretary in the Carter Administration and now is a senior adviser to Shearson Lehman Hutton Inc. A Senate-House conference is expected to spend much of the summer debating measures to strengthen the Clean Air Act, which cleared the House last week.
Many on Wall Street are eager for additional regulatory action to reduce wild price gyrations in the stock market.
One of the best ways to accomplish this, according to the Securities Industry Association, would be to consolidate authority in the Securities and Exchange Commission. In a crisis, said Marc E. Lackritz, executive vice president of the brokers' trade group, ''you don't want to have three or four people all trying to reach one another.''
The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, which now oversees stock futures, is strenuously resisting a transfer of authority to the S.E.C. Support for the idea, however, appears to be growing.

HEADLINE: Currency Psychology and the Yen

 BODY:
It was a milestone of sorts for the Japanese. The dollar fell below 150 to the yen on Friday, a key psychological break for the Japanese currency. Although still weak, the yen has risen 5.9 percent against the dollar in three weeks and is at its strongest point since the beginning of March. If the dollar remains below 150, the yen could gain more momentum as the Japanese switch their hedges, which would mean buying more yen. The Tokyo stock market, as it has on other recent signs of strength in the yen, rallied 482.13 points on Friday, nearing the 33,000 level on the Nikkei 225 index. At the same time, the dollar rose against the West German mark, which has been troubled by the uncertainty and costs surrounding the pending economic union of the two Germanys.

Putting Ivan Boesky on Trial
 
The Mulheren trial is turning into the Boesky trial. Ivan F. Boesky was forced to testify last week that he kept millions in profits from insider trading, took a tax deduction for half of his $100 million settlement and illegally paid other prisoners to do his laundry. Mr. Boesky, who finished a three-year prison stay last month, is cooperating with the Government in the securities fraud trial of John A. Mulheren Jr., the former head of Jamie Securities. In appearance, the star witness was the Boesky of old, with a dark suit and a gold ring on his pinky. In manner, he was reduced from a braggart to a mouse, afraid to mutter a word without having a document under his nose. Members of Congress demanded another look at his settlement, which now seems less onerous than it had appeared.
 
 
Grab the Prize, But Skip the Drink 
 
For Cracker Jack it works fine. But the Coca-Cola Company can't get the knack of tucking prizes into its product. Special Coke cans - dubbed MagiCans - have prizes that pop up from spring-loaded vials. No plastic trinkets these; the awards are bills from $1 to $500 or coupons for merchandise or travel. The winning cans are weighted with a foul-tasting chlorinated fluid in their bottoms to keep wily customers from picking them out. But with some defective MagiCans, customers might accidentally drink the fluid. Then their wily lawyers might file product liability claims against the company. Coca-Cola has had to take out full-page newspaper advertisements explaining that, unlike Cracker Jack boxes, its cans offer product or prize, but not both.
 
Creeping 'Baby Bellism'
 
The ''baby Bells'' are boasting of an advance in their campaign to enter new lines of business. A Senate committee voted on Tuesday to let the regional Bell operating companies design and manufacture telephone equipment. Not that the Bell companies want to slug it out with all the mass-market, cut-rate electronics companies. ''They don't have any interest in being broad telecommunications manufacturers,'' said Frank Governali, an analyst at First Boston. At most, they would work on software, switching equipment or other products for the telephone companies themselves. The real value of the Senate bill for the companies would be as a precedent for letting them pursue other businesses restricted under the terms of the Bell breakup in 1984. They hunger to offer information services, like databases and electronic banking, that other companies guard as their own domains. But even the measure that cleared the Senate committee is a long way from becoming law.
 
Dumping Tobacco Stocks
 
It might have taken a 29-year-old public health student to help get the nation's largest university endowment to sell its tobacco stocks. Dr. Philip Huang, at Harvard, belongs to a national anti-smoking group, Doctors Ought to Care (DOC) that has produced mock advertisements for ''Emphysema Slims'' and the ''Smoking is Not Kool Jazz Festival.'' At Harvard, he helped create an advertisement broadcast on the school's radio station that derided President Derek Bok for failing to unload the school's tobacco shares. Harvard decided last September to sell its stocks, and the City University of New York followed last week. In the wake of the announcements, tobacco stocks tumbled.
 
Ivan's Exploding Television Set
 
How can you get Soviet viewers to sit still for commercials when they fear that their television sets are about to explode? A study by the D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles agency, released last week, raised this worry as the major obstacle for companies wanting to advertise on Soviet television. Manufacturing defects have caused many televisions there to burst into flames. But the Soviets are trying to sell advertisements, and Western advertising agencies are rushing into the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe as their clients make plans to expand their sales.
 
Bush Son on the Spot
He did what hundreds of other directors at failed savings and loans have done: He sought and approved loans for business associates, failing to disclose his connections. But because Neil Bush is the President's son, he is receiving special attention. Appearing before a House committee last week, he complained about finger-pointing. But he admitted that he won his seat on the Silverado Banking, Savings and Loan Association board in 1985 in part because his father was Vice President. Some of the loans in question have gone bad, contributing to bailout costs for Silverado that are likely to reach $1 billion.
 
In Brief
 
General Motors Corporation stockholders approved a pension plan that will increase the benefits for Roger Smith, the retiring chairman, from $700,000 to $1.2 million a year.

GNP Commodities Inc. and its chairman, Brian Monieson, were each fined $500,000 and expelled from the futures industry on Friday. Both are likely to appeal. Mr. Monieson is a former chairman of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange.

Adobe Systems Inc. shares fell 15 1/4 to 35 1/4 on Friday after the computer software company predicted lower earnings.
 
 
 
THE ECONOMY
 
A Few Signs of Life
 
The economy remains slack, but not as lifeless as the latest estimate of the gross national product implies. The Commerce Department said last week that first-quarter gross national product rose at an annual rate of just 1.3 percent, lower than the initial estimate of 2.1 percent. But much of the revision came from reduced inventories, especially of automobiles. Some economists say that factories will have to maintain or increase production to replenish their stocks. ''You have less of an inventory problem to put a damper on economic growth,'' said Steven R. Ricchiuto, chief economist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd Securities.
 
 
The Light Touch
 
President Bush has handled trade with China as delicately as a Ming vase. Last week, he announced his decision to renew China's most-favored-nation status for another year. Despite weeks of careful preparation - with lawmakers given statistics on how Chinese trade benefits their districts - Congressional leaders mauled his plans. But they will have trouble gathering two-thirds of each house to deny continued trade privileges. The President said at the same time that he will not ease trade with the Soviet Union as long as the Lithuanian dispute continues.
 
 
In Brief
 
President Bush vetoed a bill on Thursday to continue subsidizing Amtrak, with $700 million in the coming year.
 
*
 
The International Monetary Fund approved the resumption of aid to Argentina as Argentina and its bankers agreed to hold negotiations.
 
 
The Crisis Deepens
 
The Bush Administration acknowledged last week that twice as many savings and loans as expected would collapse. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady told the Senate Banking Committee that more than 1,000 insitutions - 40 percent of the total - might eventually be seized. The Administration had insisted for more than a year that its estimates of bailout costs were adequate, even as regulators, Congressional officials and private analysts repeatedly raised their figures. Congress appropriated $73 billion for the bailout last year, but the job will take $89 billion to $130 billion, Mr. Brady said. Other Administration officials warned that increased Government borrowing to clean up the industry will raise interest rates and risk tipping the economy into a recession.

 
F.D.I.C. Fund Fades
 
The fund that insured the nation's savings and loan deposits has long been gone, and the fund for bank deposits is going. With $13.2 billion at the end of the year, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation had just 70 cents for each $100 in bank deposits, down from 80 cents in 1988. Some analysts say that bank failures will continue draining the fund this year. But as banks pay higher insurance premiums, the fund's health is likely to improve over several more years to the $1.25 level considered safe. Only a sharp recession and the collapse of several major banks might deplete it, analysts say. Then the banks, like the savings institutions, would need their own Federal bailout. Congress has pledged to stand behind all insured deposits no matter what happens.
 
 
 
INTERNATIONAL
 
 
Gorbachev's Bizarre Play
 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev should have hired some slick American political consultants years ago. Run for President while you're popular, promise no higher food prices, win your mandate, they would have said. Then, when the economic crunch comes, blame it on Boris Yeltsin. Instead, Mr. Gorbachev is staking his economic program on a referendum this year. ''Truly bizarre,'' said Michael Mandelbaum, at the Council on Foreign Relations. ''It's the Soviet equivalent of a Hail Mary pass,'' a desperate throw by a losing quarterback. A plan approved last week would triple bread prices on July 1 before the vote, with other price increases to take effect Jan. 1. Mr. Mandelbaum said that the Soviet President's only hope for winning the referendum is to portray himself as an opponent of the status quo. ''If it turns into a referendum on his stewardship of the economy,'' said Mr. Mandelbaum, ''he's not in good shape.''
 
 
Soviet Oil Exports Likely to Rise
 
The Soviet Union is likely to get much more of its oil out of the ground and into world markets. Last week, the Soviet Union signed its first oil production agreement with a Western company, Elf Aquitaine Inc., of France. The Soviet Union is still the world's largest oil producer, but output and exports have been falling, and hard-currency earnings slipping, for years. Soviet extraction methods are primitive and inefficient, leaving a good deal of oil in the ground. As Marshall Goldman, of the Russian Research Center at Harvard, said, ''The Soviet Union is a very rich country in natural resources, but those resources have to be used intelligently.''

HEADLINE: New Taxes Without Fear

 BODY:
Your taxes are going up. President Bush knows that. Congress knows that. And according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll, taxpayers know it too. Politicians might not admit that until after the November elections. But there is no other way to control the yawning deficit and still pay for needed Federal programs.
That need not, however, inspire fear and trembling. There are sensible ways to generate revenue without imposing unfair and onerous burdens. 
 
How Much?
Congress will undoubtedly amend the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget law to keep next year's deficit cut under $65 billion. But reducing the deficit that much might push the economy into a recession. Cutting the deficit by $30 billion would keep reductions headed steadily downward relative to the size of the overall economy. That's good enough. And it would be reasonable to raise half that, $15 billion, with tax increases.
 
Which Taxes?
The income tax would be the fairest. Boosting the 15 percent tax rate to 16 and the 28 percent rate to 30 would do the trick.
But there are two barriers. One is President Bush's obdurate refusal to contemplate income-tax hikes. The other is the bargain struck to achieve the 1986 tax reform. The top rate was lowered to 28 percent from 50, in exchange for eliminating most loopholes. That magnificent achievement should be unraveled only for dire necessity.
There's agitation in Congress to undo another part of the 1986 package, an anomaly known as the ''bubble.'' The law is written so that marginal tax rates jump from 28 to 33 percent on family income approximately between $75,000 and $200,000, and then fall back to 28. People make too much of the bubble. Even with it, the rich still pay higher taxes. The bubble, more ungainly than unfair, is not a compelling reason to breach the 1986 pact.
Taking everything into account, the best choice is higher energy taxes. They would raise revenue, conserve energy and fight pollution. They would fall on the rich and the poor alike, but Congress could readily compensate low-income families by, for instance, boosting the Earned Income Tax Credit.
And the best way to raise energy taxes would be to impose a small tax on all energy consumption -not just gasoline or oil. A tax as low as 5 percent would raise about $15 billion and still leave U.S. energy prices below those of Western Europe.
Another good option is to raise $10 billion a year with higher ''sin'' taxes on alcohol and tobacco. Energy and sin taxes, with offsets for the poor, could solve Congress's problem.
 
Index Capital Gains
Well, not quite. There is still the matter of capital gains - the increase in value of assets like stocks and bonds. President Bush insists on a highly ill-advised reduction in the tax rate on capital gains. The principle underlying the 1986 tax reform was to tax capital gains and wages alike.
The President does make a valid point, however. Despite identical tax rates, taxes end up unlike. The reason is inflation. Assets are often sold many years after purchase. Inflation in the interim raises the sale price even though the asset is actually worth less. Despite the loss in real value, the I.R.S. collects a tax.
The answer is to index capital gains: tax only the increase in value adjusted for inflation. But Congress should restrict indexing to new investments. Otherwise it would confer an indefensible windfall gain on individuals who invested with full knowledge of the existing tax laws.
To offset indexing or any other shortfall in collections, Congress can choose other sensible changes, like limiting the tax deductibility of fringe benefits. But even then, it would still have done only half its job. There will still be another $15 billion in deficit reduction that will have to come out of present programs. And those reductions will have to be made after a decade in which non-military programs have been starved.
But first Mr. Bush and Congress have to own up to what they already know. Sizable tax increases need not be forbidding, but they are necessary.

HEADLINE: Today's NATO - and Tomorrow's

SERIES: Designs For Europe - An Occasional Series

BYLINE: By Stanley Hoffmann; Stanley Hoffmann is chairman of the Center for European Studies at Harvard.

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass.

 BODY:
Many American officials and strategic analysts seem to be making the preservation of NATO the principal objective of American policy in Europe. This goal makes sense in the short run. NATO is still the only organization that gives the U.S. a preponderant role in Europe, and it remains critical to preserving stability and balance there. But for the longer run, we need new institutions, and we had better begin thinking about them now.
And for both the long and short run, the West has to pay careful attention to the Soviet Union's humiliation arising from its loss of the cold war.
This blow could be softened if the Western allies made it clear that today's NATO -an integrated military alliance dominated by the U.S. - is entering its final phase and will need to be transformed when the period of European transition is over. 
American policy makers' devotion to NATO is understandable. NATO not only helped to safeguard peace in Europe through the worst years of the cold war, it also successfully managed the initially traumatic issue of West German rearmament.
NATO forces are also still needed to counterbalance Soviet forces. For reasons of policy, prestige and practicality, Soviet troops will not be removed entirely from what is still East Germany for some time. Some Soviet forces may remain in Poland as long as Poland is not fully reassured that Germany intends to abandon its claims on Polish areas that were once German.
Moreover, NATO as well as what is left of the Warsaw Pact will play a useful role in negotiating reductions of conventional forces and tactical nuclear weapons in Europe.
Above all, NATO is still needed as a home for Germany. Nobody has an interest in a neutralized and united Germany, unattached and tempted again to be a freewheeling major player or subject to fits of insecurity because of real or imagined threats from the East or West.
Why do the Soviets still talk about a neutralized Germany? Because a united Germany in NATO - even a Germany that guarantees that NATO forces will not move into the former East Germany - would be psychologically painful: it would symbolize the Soviet Union's loss of the political empire and Eastern European security buffer zone won in the war.
But Moscow has not pushed hard for a neutralized Germany because this goal has no support in Eastern Europe. The Soviet Union is not really convinced that a freewheeling Germany is in its long-term interest. Nor does Moscow have cards strong enough to insist on neutralization.
Neither are the Germans enticed by the idea of neutrality, because they do not want to risk repeating their history. And Moscow's threat to keep Soviet forces in East Germany until the Germans and their Western partners agree on a formula to remove Germany from NATO could boomerang. These forces would find themselves amid a hostile population, far from their homeland and isolated if Germany induced Poland to request the departure of Soviet troops from Polish soil.
In effect, the Soviets have already acknowledged the inevitability of German unity; it is remarkable that they have not tried to use their acceptance of unification to gain Bonn's agreement to certain security arrangements. At the least, they can try to obtain a reward for having made unification possible.
Such arrangements would include limits on German weapons and forces, which Germany and its NATO allies would have no reason to refuse; perhaps an agreement on the removal of U.S. nuclear weapons from German soil and an economic deal for German contributions to the failing Soviet economy.
Beyond these immediate issues, the need is for long-range thinking.
Against what enemy would today's NATO need to be preserved? None of the main hypotheses about the Soviet Union's future - a victory of perestroika, disintegration and civil strife, an authoritarian and repressive reaction against disorder and separatism - entails the likelihood of a Soviet military threat against Europe for many years, if at all.
How long, under these circumstances, would Germany want to remain a subordinate member of a U.S.-dominated alliance and to be the last occupied country in Europe? Not long. This would be especially true if U.S. forces remained in the western parts of Germany well after the Soviet troops left the eastern parts.
How long, indeed, will the American public and Congress want to pay for today's NATO once the Soviet threat has been removed, once the European members ''confront'' only far weaker, entirely friendly and Western-oriented Central and Eastern European nations, and once the only rationale for preserving the old NATO is ''stability''? (That code word means ''distrust of Germany,'' which, ironically, is America's most powerful NATO ally.) Can NATO's present structure be maintained once U.S. conventional and tactical nuclear forces are reduced? West Germany's army, NATO's largest, has been under direct U.S. command. How acceptable will this arrangement be to the Germans and other Europeans once the U.S. military presence has shrunk?
In the long run, a restructured European security order will have to be able to deter any Soviet threat - a concern likely to be especially intense among the now liberated Central and Eastern European countries.It must reassure all of Europe against the possible resurgence of German aggressiveness or militarism.
It must also provide an environment in which an economically and financially very powerful Germany will feel sufficiently secure to continue seeking influence and prestige through wealth - and the political benefits wealth brings - rather than through military might.
Finally, it must set up adequate procedures for peacefully resolving interstate and secessionist conflicts that traditional rivalries and ethnic tensions, especially in Central and Eastern Europe, might well provoke. It should also be prepared to contain and quickly end violence should attempts at peaceful settlement fail.
Given this multiplicity of aims, a diversity of institutions is the only sensible answer. Instead of the present NATO, we would need a system based on the North Atlantic treaty of 1949, which did not set up any integrated military structure but provided an American security guarantee to Western Europe.
The Council of Foreign Ministers of the signatories would be the foreign-policy coordinating body. And as long as some U.S. forces remained in Europe, organs for joint military planning and cooperation should persist.
The European Community ought gradually to take over the dominant security role in the alliance and set up a new Western European defense organization. It is the Community that is destined to insure that the ties between Germany and its partners are so numerous and strong that they cannot be severed. These ties would provide Germany with more influence than it would have if fully sovereign.
The road toward turning a potential single market into a political union -with a central bank, a common currency, coordinated diplomacy and a defense system that intimately links the now independent French and British nuclear deterrents and German conventional forces - is likely to be long.
The results may never resemble the Union that forms the United States. But European unification is by far the best solution for nations that realize that their national objectives can no longer be achieved by purely national means.
The new Western European defense organization ought to have the task of cooperating with the nations of Central and Eastern Europe to provide protection and deter or cope with any renewed Soviet threat.
Finally, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe could provide the broadest security framework. It would limit the forces of all its members in such a way that Germany would not be singled out as the only country with special restrictions. It might ban the stationing of nuclear weapons in countries that have none of their own.
The conference could insure the participation of the U.S. and the Soviet Union in European security without providing them any possibility for renewed hegemony and could serve as the framework for procedures for settling European disputes.
In this intricate arrangement, separate alliances might well persist - for example, Western European countries and the U.S.; the Soviet Union and Poland. But there would be sufficient security, strong enough economic and political links in the European Community and close enough links between the Community and other European nations to divert Germany from nuclear ambitions. Such ambitions could only recreate the nightmare of anti-German coalitions that past German clumsiness and expansionism fostered.
Obviously, the superpowers' grip on Europe would be enormously loosened. But it is too late to try to preserve a crumbled bipolarity or to revive a Warsaw Pact whose main function was the management of a Soviet hegemony in Eastern Europe. Moreover, it is insulting to suggest that the Europeans, left to themselves, would make the same mess as before the two world wars. As the main victims of their errors, they, too, have learned a lot.
Today, peace and prosperity are the concerns - indeed, in Eastern Europe a desperate need - of all Europeans. The moment to build on their hopes and good dispositions is at hand.

HEADLINE: ON MY MIND;
The League of Terror

BYLINE: By A. M. Rosenthal

 BODY:
The Presidential commission on terrorism in the air has turned in a report that is clear, thoughtful, brave and of commanding importance. Therefore the likelihood is that the Administration will try to shove it into oblivion as fast as possible.
That is not intended as cynicism. It is an interpretation of something very much in style these days in Washington - pragmatism. 
The report centers on the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the 270 lives lost in that act of mass murder. But its conclusions go to the heart of terrorism and how to fight it - with a policy of retaliation against the ''League of Terror,'' the governments that sponsor the murder gangs.
In the last five years alone, terrorist attacks against planes of a half-dozen countries have killed 1,030 people. Not one nation has taken retaliatory action.
In Washington, Bush Administration ''pragmatism'' on terrorism has meant doing nothing to take action against the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, General Command, the gang that blew up Pan Am 103, or its masters, Syria and Iran.
Nothing - although the Government knew almost from the beginning that Iran paid and dispatched the killers, that Syria gives them safe haven and that Libya supplies the murder gangs of the world with the special plastic explosive that destroyed Pan Am 103.
It is hard to think of anything the Administration has done publicly to fight terrorism stronger than saying thank you, thank you Syria and Iran, for any small bones of mercy they might throw us from time to time.
The report is full of criticism of air security - the Government's and Pan Am's - and has a long list of specific security recommendations. But in its analysis of terrorism and its policy for action, it has special importance going even beyond the tragedy of Pan Am 103.
These are the essentials of the analysis:
The victim world has been lurching from terrorist attack to attack, always caught without response strategy. Terrorism remains a deadly weapon of the weak and cowardly, cheap and effective enough to change the policies of major nations. Once terrorism was the isolated acts of individuals, now it is state-sponsored acts of war and aggression.
These are the essentials of the policy proposals against terrorism:
Zero tolerance. The U.S must take leadership. The American public must show and exercise a national will to fight terrorism and support Government action. Retaliation must be threatened and carried out, retaliation graded upward from political and diplomatic to economic to military attack against terrorist targets in the League of Terror states.
''The commission finds unacceptable the idea of holding ourselves in all cases to a criminal standard of proof before we act . . . The U.S. must be ready to view some terrorist attacks as a matter of security or an act of aggression.''
The President appointed the commission because of the determination of people who would not surrender -the families of the victims of Pan Am 103.
It turned out to be a runaway commission, polite but independent. Its members told the President the truth, knowing it would not appeal to him.
It was headed by Ann McLaughlin, a former Secretary of Labor, a strong leader. Other members were Representatives John P. Hammerschmidt, Republican of Arkansas, and James L. Oberstar, Democrat of Minnesota; former Secretary of the Navy Edward Hidalgo; Gen. Thomas C. Richards, Air Force, retired; and two Senators, Frank Lautenberg, Democrat of New Jersey, and Alfonse D'Amato, the New York Republican who by his commission service earns dehexing for voting to uphold a Presidential veto of a bill protecting Chinese students.
Since the commission's most important recommendation is to make sure the terrorist states know they will pay a price, it carries a never-stated but implicit criticism of the existing do-nothing policy.
So what seems to await the report is a deep file drawer somewhere in the Executive Offices.
But if a policy of retaliation is not announced as a preventive warning and another American passenger plane is blown into scraps of metal and flesh, this report will creep out of that drawer to haunt the Administration.
So it is just possible that given enough public and Congressional courage now, the Administration will have to take account of the report and its plain words on terrorism.
We have that hope, thanks to the McLaughlin commission, which is better than what we have had so far - pragmatically, nothing.

HEADLINE: THE COUNTRY IN THE CITY: A GREAT NOTION LIVES ON IN BROOKLYN'S PROSPECT PARK

BYLINE: By DOUGLAS MARTIN

 BODY:
The weather willing, armies of picnickers, many lugging elaborate barbecuing gear, will descend on Prospect Park in Brooklyn this Memorial Day weekend. Others will come just to sit or sleep or sip in the Long Meadow -six times the size of the Sheep Meadow in Central Park and said to be the longest continuous open space in any American urban park.
The air will be filled with multifarious balls, Frisbees, model planes and the hypnotizing beat of Caribbean drums. ''Coming to the park is like taking a bath,'' said a 60-year-old man who has been a regular for half a century. ''I leave with a refreshed mind.'' 
This essay will stroll through the optimistic origins and triumphant rise of this 526-acre patch of green, pause to consider its decades-long decline, then let out a bit of a hoot over its resurgence.
By any measure, Prospect Park is a great achievement. And great achievements spring from confidence and fear. The park's birth in the middle of the last century reflected a separate municipality, then the nation's third largest, on the make and proud of it.
In the 1860's, the value of Brooklyn's manufactured goods and its population had both burgeoned. But just across the East River, Manhattan was growing faster and richer. Brooklyn was in danger of becoming a dumping ground for Gotham's most obnoxious industries, bone-boiling for one. And as the cost of Manhattan living surged, more poor people arrived on the busy ferries.
The American way is to marry economic need, almost always defined by class interest, with idealistic goals. By building a park arguably superior even to the newly completed Central Park, Brooklyn's city fathers hoped to lure affluent residents and increase the tax base.
So how marvelous that these hard-headed goals perfectly coincided with prevailing progressive ideology. Parks were seen as specks of sanity in sinister, dehumanizing cities. America might have been teeming with new immigrants, torn by new technologies and dominated by robber barons, but this was at heart an agrarian nation. There was also the thought that parks might act as a civilizing influence on the foreign hordes, perhaps making them less prone to riot.
Using designs owing much to the picturesque tradition of English landscape design, they used heavy equipment to contrive bucolic settings in emphatically non-rural areas. Sort of no-charge theme parks for would-be Daniel Boones with 12-hour-a-day factory jobs.
 
The Masters of Design
 Enter the kings of park design. Frederick Law Olmsted, a social philosopher, and Calvert Vaux, an architect, first collaborated on Central Park, begun in 1859. Prospect Park, begun in 1866, was their next achievement, the one Olmsted always deemed greatest. These two visionaries working together, and then Olmsted working alone, would leave their mark on magnificent parks from Buffalo to Chicago to Montreal to Seattle to the Capitol.
The Olmstedian vision has a distinctly anti-urban tinge: cities were hells to escape. His idea was to find ''the greatest possible contrast with the restraining and confining conditions of the town, those conditions which compel us to walk circumspectly, watchfully, jealously, which compel us to look closely upon others without sympathy.''
From the beginning, Prospect Park fulfilled its joyful purpose. Sepia photographs show Sunday-only gentry and a flock of sheep crowded on the Long Meadow. There was a wind-powered carousel on the lake, a penful of deer in the woods. Traditions coalesced: fishing contests, ice carnivals, Maypole dancing.
Then came ornate Italianate buildings like the boathouse, sitting well with popular taste. In the 1930's, Parks Commissioner and master planner Robert Moses brought more pedestrian but utilitarian things - a zoo, bandshell and skating rink with all the charm of a freeway Howard Johnson's. On an obscure hillside, the Quaker cemetery endured.
But after the Korean War, the world and Prospect Park changed. Soldiers bought houses in the suburbs; poor blacks forced from their homes by urban renewal landed in the houses of those who left. By the 1960's, the Dodgers and neighboring Ebbets Field were history and Brooklyn was a sadder place. The Goldman Band, which had played free concerts in the park since 1918, saw attendance drop, particularly at the once popular ''Music of Eastern Europe'' and Italian programs.
By the mid-1970's, the fiscal crisis had dealt more brutal blows. Maintenance grew dreadful; buildings were boarded up. A poll showed 44 percent of New Yorkers thought no one should ever venture into the park.
But as money came back to the city, Brooklyn brownstones started to look good to a housing-hungry city, and people came back to the park, too. Ever more hesitantly, the sun peeked over the horizon.
It rose with the appointment in 1980 of a permanent Prospect Park Administrator, the utterly peripetatic Tupper Thomas. She begins her day walking her labrador, Sheffield, in the park, and is liable to drive trucks, press higher-ups for more funds and personally greet visitors.
A torrent of volunteers has also descended. On Thursdays, adults come; on Saturday, children. On Sundays, the Brooklyn Bird Club works on a wildflower meadow atop Lookout Hill. The city has not been silent, spending almost $50 million on 14 big projects in the park's most recent decade. The long-neglected woods are looking a bit more like Olmsted and Vaux designed them.
 
Helping Hands
 Then there are the 250 auxiliary police to reassure the new waves of visitors, and the Prospect Park Alliance, formed in 1987 by prominent private citizens deeply committed to the park. Though much poorer than the Central Park Conservancy, Ms. Thomas says, the alliance represents a watchdog, a high-powered independent advocate in case City Hall ''drops the ball.''
Today's dangling question mark is whether a financially strapped New York can afford what Robert Moses called ''the immediate jewel of Brooklyn's crown.'' But in the sweep of history, Ms. Thomas sees only a minor interruption in Prospect Park's uphill course. Brooklynites will demand nothing less.
So let us sing the praises of the Long Meadow that somehow seems to rise from both directions. Let us marvel at that superbly unruly Camperdown elm memorialized in Marianne Moore's poem. And let us check out the events that draw people to the park in groups of every size: the Metropolitan Opera and New York Philharmonic, lectures on the history of slavery in Brooklyn, quilting classes.
And let us be surprised, for this is a surprising park. The Haitian artist, Deenps Bazile, who carves stumps into magnificent African visages. Three homeless men living in the Music Pagoda who regularly volunteer for park improvement projects. A restored zoo and carousel, both now happening. Two perfect lovers who the other day sat on a blanket with a bottle of champagne, a single rose in a crystal vase and each other.

HEADLINE: Glasnost Byproduct: Virulent Anti-Semitism

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Some of your readers might think that Irina Ginsburg, the Moscow novelist, was exaggerating when she declared, ''We Russian Jews Fear for Our Lives'' (Op-Ed, May 5). But as non-Jews who have visited Moscow several times over the past few years, most recently in March, we can confirm that anti-Semitism is indeed on the rise in the Soviet Union and presents a serious threat to Soviet Jews.
The paradox of glasnost is that it has opened up the media not simply to calls for freedom and justice but also to the raw anti-Semitism of members of the ultra-rightwing nationalist organization Pamyat and kindred individuals and groups. Prospective members of Pamyat must submit the names and addresses of five Jews; three names and addresses are sufficient if they belong to Jews ''trying to conceal their Jewishness.'' As a Pamyat leader asserted recently, those ''hidden Jews,'' seeking to attack Russian culture from the inside, are the nation's most dangerous enemies. 
There is an obvious parallel between Soviet society today and German society prior to the rise of Hitler. Here again is a weak democracy -really, a democracy in its infancy -where the leadership has no popular support, including Mikhail Gorbachev. Economic collapse seems imminent. Just as Germany went through the hyper-inflation of the 1920's, so Russians find their rubles growing increasingly worthless. (In March, we could not find a single cab driver who would take us anywhere for rubles; packs of American cigarettes are the required currency.) In the midst of the growing corruption, Russians feel frustrated and angry. We listened in Moscow apartments to fears of famine in the countryside within a year, accompanied by street demonstrations and riots in Moscow itself. Such anxieties piled on top of justified exasperation over the denigration of Russian culture during much of the Soviet period makes many Russians give in to the all-too-human desire to find a scapegoat. Inevitably, the old belief in the Jew as the source of the Russians' troubles has re-emerged.
Some Russians do condemn anti-Semitism and call upon their compatriots to accept responsibility for the present crisis, but theirs are voices in the wilderness. All too many want to believe that the Jews are guilty, just as the Germans eagerly accepted Hitler's claim that they were responsible, in some vague manner, for Germany's defeat in World War I. What is particularly distressing about the anti-Semitic wave in Moscow is that it is being led by writers and other intellectuals. While conducting interviews for our book ''Inside the Soviet Writers' Union'' [reviewed April 11], we were treated to the most breathtaking expressions of raw anti-Semitism from privileged members of the organization. Seemingly sophisticated and sensible persons asserted that Jews had been responsible for the terror-famine in the Ukraine, which the Soviet press has now acknowledged starved millions to death. That Lazar Kaganovich, a member of Stalin's Politburo, was a Jew proved the Jews' guilt.
A leading figure in the Russian nationalist, anti-Jewish movement is Igor Shafarevich, a close friend of Alexander Solzhenitsyn and a corresponding member of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Shafarevich, following Solzhenitsyn's example, has popularized the term ''Russophobe'' as a codeword for Jew.
The Russian Republic branch of the Writers' Union has as members many well-known Soviet writers who have used the pages of journals under the union's jurisdiction for the worst sort of hatred of the Jews. The journal Nash Sovremennik carried the allegation that the Jews themselves were responsible for the murder of Jews at Dachau and Auschwitz. Valentin Rasputin, a respected writer who has just been appointed to Mr. Gorbachev's Presidential Council, stated that the Jews ''killed God'' and were responsible for the October Revolution and the mass terror that followed it (New York Times Magazine, Jan. 28).
The transcripts of meetings of the Russian Republic branch of the Writers' Union read like accounts of speeches at Nazi rallies in the 1930's. Jews who are major figures in Russian literature, such as Babel, Pasternak, Grossman, are said to belong to ''literature in the Russian language,'' not Russian literature proper. Anyone who opposes these views is condemned as a Jew, whether or not he is Jewish. In other words, the very word Jew has become a term of abuse.
Things are falling apart inside the Soviet Union. The center is not holding, and yet another ''blood-dimmed tide'' is gathering strength. Before its fury is loosed upon the world, let us hope that the intended victims are able to escape.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Israel Looks Around, and Finds New Cause to Worry

BYLINE: By YOUSSEF M. IBRAHIM

DATELINE: JERUSALEM

 BODY:
Israelis are casting a wary eye on the summit meeting of Arab leaders that begins Monday in Baghdad, conscious of a resurgent mood of belligerence that Israel has not had to face in more than a decade.
The Israelis have been weaned on fear of the Arab world that surrounds them, and they have always been skeptical about the steadfastness of Western support. Now they see both the Arabs and the West trying to force them into radically changing the policies they have followed in the Arab territories of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, which they have occupied since 1967.
Conversations in the last week with Israeli officials, political and military analysts, academics and ordinary citizens showed four major worries: Israelis fear the rise of a new threat from an eastern military coalition led by Iraq, they lament the evident loss of active support by the West, they are perplexed as they watch Egypt return to the Arab fold, and they are appalled at the inability of their politicians to form a government that can put forward a coherent policy to face these challenges. 
Foremost is what the country's military establishment views as a dangerous political alliance being forged between Jordan, the Palestine Liberation Organization and Iraq, whose President, Saddam Hussein, has threatened to scorch half of Israel if it attacks his country.
 
The Hussein Alliance
 For almost 20 years, King Hussein of Jordan was viewed as an Arab ruler with whom Israel had reached a tacit understanding of non-aggression. But now Israelis are watching with astonishment as the King moves into what they believe to be a growing military, political and economic reliance on Iraq.
Alarm bells rang loudly here recently when Jordan allowed Iraqi air force planes to fly along its borders with Israel, and even louder when the King enthusiastically supported the Iraqi President's insistence on Baghdad's right to produce chemical weapons and to seek to match Israel's nuclear capability.
''The entire volume of King Hussein's involvement with Saddam goes far beyond what is considered natural geopolitical considerations,'' commented Yosi Olmert, an expert on Middle East affairs.
Egypt's recent efforts to broker a Syrian-Iraqi reconciliation, thus bringing Syria too back into the Arab fold, could heighten the threat to Israel, said Ehud Ya'ari, a writer and television commentator, by raising ''the specter of a military Arab alliance to our east.''
Israeli politicians are also concerned about the palpable decline of expressions of support that they see coming from Israel's closest ally, the United States. And they worry over the cooling of ties with Western Europe, where pro-Palestinian sentiment is becoming more pronounced.
Others are distressed at the drift of Egypt, the only Arab country that has a peace treaty with Israel, to a not-so-friendly common Arab front.
Many Israelis say the most immediate danger is that the intifada, the 29-month-old uprising of Palestinians against the occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, will spread beyond the occupied lands.
Last week the revolt crossed the ''velvet line'' dividing the occupied territories from Israel, and reached into the towns where the estimated 650,000 to 800,000 Arab citizens of Israel have lived since 1948.
Perhaps more significantly, the revolt shook the refugee camps in neighboring Jordan where hundreds of thousands of Palestinians live. This left King Hussein caught between the threat of an intifada by Palestinians on his own soil and a mounting challenge from Muslim fundamentalists at home, while he also tries to fix a shaky economy.
''The worst thing of all would be if everything falls apart in Jordan, forcing the King to seek Iraqi materiel or military assistance,'' said Mark Heller, a Middle East affairs expert at the Jaffee Center for Strategic Studies in Tel Aviv. ''This would eliminate Jordan as a buffer between us and the Iraqis. Then everyone could lose control.''
Even the issue foremost on the minds of most Israelis - the inability over the last eight weeks of either major political party to form a government after the latest inconclusive elections - may be intractable.
The problem is so difficult, in the view of Zeev Schiff, defense affairs editor of the daily newspaper Haaretz, because it is intimately tied to a similarly intractrable problem -''the outcome of the Palestinian intifada and the Palestinian problem.''
Speaking of the riots this week that followed the slaying on Sunday of seven Palestinians by an Israeli gunman who the authorities said was deranged, a senior Israeli official expressed fear that events are headed for an explosion. ''With the intifada reaching a turning point this week, there is more room for miscalculations all around,'' the official said.
About the only certainty in the view of Israelis and Palestinian analysts here is that the tensions could transform the conflict between Palestinians and Israelis into a regional one. ''Since the peace with Egypt 10 years ago, the conflict has been an introverted conflict between us and the Palestinians,'' Mr. Schiff said. ''Now the Arab world is dragging it back into being an Arab-Israeli conflict.''
Israelis who preferred to believe that their conflict with the Palestinians could be insulated from the wider Arab world are clearly reassessing strategies after this last bloody week, when at least 23 Palestinians died and nearly 900 were injured in the rioting that followed the shooting of the seven Palestinians.
What the Israelis cannot agree on is whether a settlement with Arab nations like Egypt, Syria or Jordan would be enough to eliminate the Palestinian problem, as hard-liners insist, or, as liberals say, that a deal exchanging land for peace with Palestinians under occupation would be enough to end Israel's confrontation with Arab nations.
Either way, Professor Heller asserts, the Arab meeting on Monday will again make it clear that ''the Palestinians are at the center of all Arab politics that concern Israel.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
The Tear Gas Clears, The Tensions Remain

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: KWANGJU, South Korea

 BODY:
When student protests commemorating a massacre of demonstrators here 10 years ago slowly tailed off and then stopped, there was almost a palpable sigh of relief from Koreans. After a decade of persistent violence in the streets, most Koreans seem eager to put the disruptions behind them and breathe in some of the country's air of economic success rather than tear gas.
Few mistake the relief for optimism, however. The streets, for now, may not be the favored venue for airing grievances, but many experts say the kind of frustrations that fed the violence remain, fueled by lopsided government development policies that have left important regions feeling left out of the country's economic miracle. 
As many scholars and some politicians here note, the growing problem of Korean regionalism is particularly surprising for a country that will soon be the last to suffer from the painful and highly emotional effects of a Communist-enforced division. Yet the problem seems to be growing.
Some of the dissatisfaction is felt in the northwest, but nowhere is the anger being expressed more poignantly than in South Cholla province, where Kwangju, a flat, dusty university town of a million residents, is the capital. Cholla takes up most of the southwest tip of the divided Korean peninsula, an emerald mosaic of rice paddies punctuated with craggy mountains. Handsome though that landscape may be, the people here are resentful when they compare it with the neighboring province.
Just a few miles to the east, in Kyong-san province, is an often less attractive but more prosperous landscape that houses Korea's largest auto plants, shipbuilding yards and ports, all constructed within the last few decades under the firm hand of Korea's authoritarian governments. The government decides where to focus that development, and Cholla has received little.
Song In-Sung, a specialist in regional development at Chonnam National University in Kwangju, said the central problem is relatively simple: those in power accumulate most of the wealth, and those in power have traditionally been from Seoul or the eastern provinces. Seoul, he said, has about a third of South Korea's population and about 80 percent of its wealth.
He cited figures laying out the problem even more bluntly: in the last 30 years, the population of South Korea has doubled; in that time, the population of South Cholla has declined slightly as young people fled the hard life on farms for the cities.
That, he said, has only made things worse, because when they move to the cities, these former farmers bring their simple ways and tend to take the lowest level jobs. That has made being from Cholla something of a stigma in the eyes of many Koreans; a businessman here complained that, in Korean movies, petty criminals often have distinctive Cholla accents.
It does not help that the United States is demanding that Korea open its agricultural markets. Farm imports would clearly hurt Cholla province more than other regions, so these demands have fed anti-Americanism among students here.
Yoo Jong-Hae, a professor of public administration at Yonsei University in Seoul, has studied another facet of the problem -the numbers of people from Cholla in key sectors of government and industry.
''They just do not have any means of entry into the government,'' he said, pointing to figures he had collected on the paucity of people from Cholla in the police, customs offices, the military, the civil service, even big corporations and major banks.
Mr. Yoo added, ''all they can do is join the PPD,'' or the Party for Peace and Democracy, the power base of Korea's best known opposition leader, Kim Dae Jung, who is also Cholla's most famous native son. Mr. Kim and his Cholla-based party were conspicuously the only big opposition group left out of a recent merger between the ruling party and two other opposition groups, isolating Cholla even further.
 
Feelings of Frustration
 ''Their grievance is right,'' Mr. Yoo said. ''They feel total frustration.'' The government has proposed a new development program to try to alleviate these imbalances. Under the plan, funds would be poured into better highways, rail lines, airports and industrial plants. The overall goal would be to prepare this region for a burst in trade with China, just off Korea's western shores. The two countries do not have diplomatic relations because China recognizes Communist North Korea, but they have been warming up to each other slowly and expanding trade.
Many are skeptical of the plan. Substantial growth in the China trade still seems a long way off. And the Korean legislature has yet to show much enthusiasm, Mr. Song said, for committing to Cholla large sums that might be spent in the home districts of the new ruling party's members.
''The western development program has been effective - as a slogan,'' said Mr. Yoo.
Kwangju's history of student demonstrations has also hurt Cholla's image in the rest of Korea. It has created an impression that people from Cholla are combative and more prone to violence. Cholla residents complain that the national government is quicker to use force on demonstrators in their region, as evidenced by the brutal killings in Kwangju 10 years ago, when at least 200 pro-democracy demonstrators were slain by troops.
''There is only one answer, which is more government investment in things like infrastructure,'' Mr. Song said in his sunny office last week, high above a gathering of students attending a funeral for a young man killed accidentally during the most recent demonstrations. ''They don't want to take the first step, but I can assure you, there would be an immediate response if they really made the investment.''

HEADLINE: THE NATION;
Deficit Reduction, Phase 1: The Staring

BYLINE: By SUSAN F. RASKY

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
For all the hand-wringing on Capitol Hill and at the White House over how to cut the budget deficit, the truth is that are infinite possibilities.
Want to save a quick $3 billion in 1991? Make the Federal Aviation Administration a private corporation. Looking for bigger savings? Eliminate cost-of-living increases for a year on Social Security and Railroad Retirement benefits and squeeze $7.6 billion out of the 1991 deficit. Or go for the grand slam: impose a 5 percent value-added tax, in effect a national sales tax, to raise $89 billion by 1992 and $532 billion over five years.
If it were really that simple, the mutually suspicious Democrats and Republicans called together by President Bush for a ''budget summit'' would not have spent the last two weeks staring at each other across the conference table waiting to see who blinks first. After four sessions, largely devoted to an Administration tutorial on the deficit, the economy and the rising costs of the savings and loan bailout, about the only thing the participants have agreed to is holding some more meetings when Congress returns from a Memorial Day recess on June 5. 
''These first meetings were a testing of the willingness of each side to participate in good-faith negotiations,'' said Representative Leon Panetta, the California Democrat who heads the House Budget Committee. ''We haven't gotten to the hard stuff.''
The hard stuff is deciding what combination of spending cuts and tax increases can be cobbled together to make a credible assault on what now looms as a deficit of somewhere between $138 billion and $199 billion for the 1991 fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1. But the really hard stuff is spreading the political pain and blame evenly enough so that neither party can bludgeon the other for what finally emerges.
Senator Wyche Fowler, the Georgia Democrat who is serving as Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell's representative at the talks, says that a genuine concern for all the Congressional negotiators is that even if they painfully come to an agreement among themselves, they will leave the talks only to find that they do not have enough troops waiting to follow. It is one reason that the participants have been so edgy about discussing their discussions.
To the extent that they are talking publicly at all about what they would like to see in the way of deficit reduction, the numbers are extraordinarily ambitious. Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who heads the Senate Budget Committee, speaks of a $60 billion deficit cut in 1991 and a cut of $600 billion over five years. Senator Pete V. Domenici of New Mexico, the senior Republican on the budget panel, says that $45 billion to $50 billion for 1991 and $450 billion to $500 billion over five years is more realistic.
In each instance, the magnitude of deficit reduction is far greater than anything Congress has ever attempted, let alone achieved. Privately, lawmakers in both parties acknowledge that even their own best efforts at this point fall short of the goals they have proclaimed.
''Without using the traditional smoke and mirrors process, you're talking about some very tough political choices that have to be made on defense, entitlements and taxes to make the numbers add up,'' Mr. Panetta said.
Senator Alan K. Simpson, a Wyoming Republican known for not mincing words, put it more bluntly. ''We all know what we have to do, and it's ghastly,'' he said.
If and when the negotiators finally lay their cards on the table, they will be looking at four main ways to cut the deficit: the military budget, which accounts for about one-fourth of total Federal spending; the so-called entitlements, like Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, farm subsidies and veterans' benefits, which account for about half; a category of ''discretionary'' programs, which includes everything that is not an entitlement or not part of the military budget; and tax increases.
Over the last decade, the discretionary programs, accounting for roughly 17 percent of Federal spending, have borne the brunt of budget-cutting. House Democrats vowed this year to begin devoting some new dollars to them, earmarking about $5 billion in their 1991 budget for areas like education, housing and basic research.
Republicans, who would also like to see increases in some of these areas, maintain that the additional spending has to be offset by cuts in other discretionary programs. But they have not said where, and privately lawmakers on both sides admit that their estimates of what will be saved or spent on discretionary programs are more wishful thinking than realistic possibilities.
Reducing spending on the entitlement programs, which grow automatically, is politically perilous, especially in an election year. Lawmakers assume that they can eke out several billion dollars in savings by reducing Medicare reimbursement rates for physicians and hospitals. But any significant savings would have to come from actual reductions in benefits. That probably means paring farm subsidies, freezing annual cost-of-living adjustments, or perhaps taxing a larger portion of benefit income for wealthier Social Security recipients. So far, neither party is willing to publicly embrace those options. That leaves the military budget and taxes. ''You've got the classic problem here of Democrats looking at the defense budget as a place where substantial cuts can be made, and you've got Republicans saying let's cut the entitlements,'' Senator Sasser said. ''Neither side is saying let's restore the revenue base because that means raising taxes.''
Enter George Bush, whose views on the subject of tax increases, or for that matter any other aspect of deficit reduction, remain a mystery to the Democrats in the budget summit. They insist that the President will have to be the first to call for tax increases.
Senator Bob Dole of Kansas, the Republican leader, said no one wants to claim parentage for such a plan. ''Somewhere along the line, we'll have to find a piece of paper on the table,'' he said, ''and of course nobody will know where it came from.''
In the meantime, the only revenue number any of the negotiators will publicly own up to is the $20 billion in the now-outdated budget that Mr. Bush submitted to Congress in January.
His ''read my lips'' pledges notwithstanding, the President called for $13.9 billion in increased revenue and about $6 billion in assorted ''user fees.''
The President has again proposed cutting the capital gains tax rate, a plan the Democrats say would mainly benefit the wealthiest Americans. In return, they will likely demand an increase in the top income tax rate for upper-income taxpayers. Under the current law, those with the highest incomes pay a top rate of 28 percent, while those just below pay a top rate of 33 percent.
Other tax ideas bandied about - whenever negotiators forget that they are not going to talk about them until Mr. Bush does - are a rise in the gasoline tax and an oil import fee. The two are generally paired on the theory that the combination would neutralize conflicting regional interests of the West and the Northeast.
Increasing excise taxes on beer, wine, spirits and tobacco is a perennial possibility, and a one-year halt in the adjustment of tax brackets for inflation is often mentioned as a quid pro quo for any freeze in retirees' cost-of-living adjustments. Several months ago, the House Ways and Means Committee Chairman, Representative Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, proposed all of these tax increases and a domestic spending freeze as a challenge to the Administration.
Now, as part of the Democratic negotiating team, he figures it's the President's turn to ante up. As he told his colleagues during one recent session, ''I received an invitiation to this garden party, and I'm not bringing the bread and I'm not bringing the wine.''

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
TIME TO DEAL?

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
As he meets with President Bush this week, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev has an overriding interest in more trade with the United States as the key to restructuring the Soviet economy and integrating it into the world economy.
He is hoping President Bush will end more than a half-century of trade discrimination against Moscow by offering most-favored-nation status, which would allow the lowest possible tariffs on imports from the Soviet Union.
Regardless of whether that happens at this meeting, the Soviet President has little choice but to bank on closer commercial ties with the United States in the long term. For when he talks about trade with this country, he means it in the broadest sense: a flow of investments, technology and finance needed to help invigorate Soviet industry and agriculture and get more goods on the shelves for Soviet consumers.
For the United States, a commitment to sound commercial relations with the Soviet Union would be both a chance to get an early toehold in a potentially lucrative market and a vote of confidence in the Soviet economic reform process - and in Mr. Gorbachev as he struggles to put those reforms in place. 
 
'Trade Relationships Are Pivotal'
 ''It is of central importance to Gorbachev that this agreement be signed during the summit because economic and trade relationships are pivotal to the Soviet Union at this time and supersede the importance of the arms control agenda,'' said Roger W. Robinson Jr., former chief economist at the National Security Council.
But there are obstacles to any agreement to grant favorable trade status, and it is far from certain that a pact will be signed this week. The Jackson-Vanik amendment to the Trade Act of 1974 bars trade concessions to countries that impede free emigration, and President Bush told Mr. Gorbachev at their previous meeting, in Malta, that he would seek a waiver that would give the Soviets the favored trade status once the Soviets codified their emigration law. Jewish emigration from the Soviet Union has now risen dramatically, and the emigration bill is awaiting action in the Supreme Soviet, but the summit meeting is likely to begin before the Supreme Soviet acts.
Now a new test has emerged for offering the tariff concession - the way Moscow deals with the issue of independence. President Bush noted last week that Moscow's sanctions against Lithuania had generated ''a political climate in this country that would make it extraordinarily difficult to grant'' favorable trade status to the Soviets, although it was renewed for a more hard-line Beijing.
''I think he knows that we're not trying to undermine him or make his life complicated for him,'' the President said of Mr. Gorbachev on Thursday. ''But we have certain differences with the Soviet Union, which I'll be perfectly prepared to talk about.''
As seen by the maneuvering over the trade pact, questions arise over how far the United States will actually go in normalizing the economic relationship. Some want Washington to maintain economic pressures to further weaken the Soviet empire and reduce a still existing military threat. Others argue that since the Soviet Union remains the one country with a nuclear arsenal that could destroy the United States, it is far better to pursue peaceful competition and cooperation and slowly work to bring the Soviet Union into the world economic community.
The Bush Administration has already taken a step in this direction by approving Soviet observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which promotes freer trade in the world.
''Establishing an international climate that allows Soviet leaders to focus on domestic reform would be a major U.S. contribution,'' said a Harvard international security specialist, Joseph S. Nye Jr., in a new book, ''Bound to Lead.''
Although a stronger Soviet Union could again threaten the United States, its precipitious decline presents even greater risks.
''Who's the enemy?'' asked President Bush. ''Instability and unpredictability. I would repeat that I don't want to have two ships pass in the night, the Soviet Union and the United States.''
Here is an outline of what the Soviet Union and the United States want from a trade agreement.
 
Commerce
 
So Many People, So Few Goods
 In 1989 the United States and the Soviet Union traded goods worth about $5 billion. Largely because the Soviets are big buyers of American grain, the United States enjoys a huge trade surplus, one of the few countries with which the United States is in such a position. Last year the surplus was $3.5 billion.
Although there could be flourishing long-term trade expansion, no one expects any short-term surges. Other obstacles remain. The Soviet Union's lack of hard currency means American companies would have to continue entering into barter arrangements to sell their wares. Payment is in Soviet goods that they undertake to sell in world markets. Meanwhile, there is little the Soviets now produce that Americans want.
But in such specific sectors as nitrogen fertilzers, ferroalloys, nonferrous metals, furs, textiles, paper, chemicals and structural steel, some import increases are possible with lower tariffs.
Given high-running protectionist feelings, domestic producers of these items, particularly textiles, are likely to complain about intensified price competition, possible worker displacement and financial woes arising from the imports.
Despite the short-term prospects, some American companies express keen interest in the Soviet market of 280 million people, one of the last big markets where there is no real Western competition.
''The economic rationale for expanded trade is overwhelming,'' said Dwayne O. Andreas, president of the Archer Daniels Midland Company, a leading agricultural exporter. ''I estimate we could double our agricultural sales to the Soviet Union if we would simply open our doors and give them the opportunity to sell to us on the same terms and conditions as other countries.''
American companies see their Western European and Japanese competitors rushing into the market, leaving the United States at a competitive disadvantage.
 
Investment
 
'Thanks for Using A.T.&T. Moscow'
Should the United States finally offer the concessions needed to normalize trade relations, investment activity could pick up dramatically.
Latest Soviet figures indicate there are about 1,400 joint ventures between Soviet enterprises and Western companies. Of these a relatively modest 140 are with American companies.
Consultants and law and accounting firms lead the way, but many leading American multinational companies have been studying such operations as well.
The American Telephone and Telegraph Company has just signed an agreement with the Soviet Ministry of Communications to explore future joint ventures that would include such activities as telecommunications services, research and development and equipment manufacturing. It also participates in a consortium led by U S West to build a trans-Siberian fiber-optic cable telecommunications link between Europe and Asia.
The American Trade Consortium, including Chevron, Eastman Kodak, Johnson & Johnson, Archer Daniels Midland and RJR Nabisco, has a number of joint ventures under negotiation ''in varying stages of completion,'' according to a spokesman.
The Soviets are enthusiastic about making deals with Americans. But American officals complain that the one thing the Soviets don't seem to understand is the reality of what they will have to do on hard currency.
''Their needs for it are desperate,'' said John A. Hinds, president of AT&T International. ''But still they don't seem to understand that Western entities have to get hard currency out at some point, to derive benefits of some kind.'' Another problem is the controls that the United States maintains against the flow of possibly militarily useful high technology to the Soviets.
 
Technology
 
The Password Is Computer
The United States and 16 other Western countries are members of the Coordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls, or Cocom, which has been working since the early cold war years to deny the Soviet Union the industrial know-how to make war.
Political changes in Eastern Europe and the virtual disappearance of the Warsaw Pact have led Cocom to revamp its controls policy, aiming at higher walls around fewer products. But some now wonder why it is necessary to have the controls at all. Without strong strategic reasons for doing so, many countries may be unwilling to keep restrictions on their exporters for very long.
''We are entering an era in which small technical adjustments in our export controls are no longer appropriate,'' said Charles E. Hugel, chairman of ASEA Brown Boveri Inc., a big European-based power equipment company.
Under pressure from European allies and the business community, the Bush Administration proposed last month to reduce 25 percent of the categories on Cocom's industrial list. But such action would still keep most advanced telecommunications equipment and computers out of Soviet and Eastern European hands. The proposals also would make it easier for Eastern Europe to get the technology than the Soviet Union, which many West Europeans regard as impractical.
 
Finance
 
Comrade, Can You Spare a Billion?
A trade agreement is expected to be followed by a bilateral investment treaty that would make the Soviet Union eligible for a number of American programs, such as Export-Import Bank credits and insurance from the Overseas Private Insurance Corporation.
Another agreement the Soviets are likely to reach with the United States would be important in terms of financial flows. This is the pact to settle an estimated $1.52 billion of World War II lend-lease and other Soviet debts to the United States. Moscow would then be free to raise money in the American bond market for the first time.
But the Soviet Union is now in arrears in its payments to many of its major suppliers from the West and Japan. The Center for Security Policy, a Washington-based policy research organization, places late payments owed to Western companies in the range of $2 billion to $3 billion.
The Soviet financial troubles have hit at a time when many American banks and investment houses are still holding devalued third world debt and are not anxious to make new foreign commitments.
 
Prospects
 
Other Fish In the Sea
 Should trade curbs and other economic restraints be maintained by the United States, Moscow still has Western Europe and possibly Japan as potential partners.
Continued Soviet occupation of four islands seized in 1945 off Hokkaido has kept a lid on the Japanese relationship, but the islands issue is expected to be resolved by next spring, when Mr. Gorbachev visits Tokyo.
West German aid offers so far are substantial, including bank credits, money for the continued stationing of the Soviet Union's 380,000 troops in East Germany and the pledged assumption of East Germany's supply contracts with the Soviet Union once the two Germanys are united.
One reason the United States is so important to Moscow is that politically the Soviets cannot tolerate a reliance on Western Europe dominated by Germany.
Already the largest bank in Poland is the Deutsche Bank. That it or other German institutions could dominate portions of commerce in the Soviet Union is unacceptable.
From Washington's point of view, the economic changes in the Soviet Union seem to offer a real chance to set the world on a new course. One American businessman weighing a Soviet connection recalled an old Russian proverb: ''Fat people don't dig foxholes.''

Talks Stumble On Expanding Soviet Flights
WASHINGTON Amid all the talk about nuclear missiles and the realignment of Europe in Soviet-American relations, the United States and Soviet Union have been working on something promising more practical impact on Americans' lives - a new agreement on commercial airline traffic.
Prospects for signing the accord when President Mikhail S. Gorbachev comes to Washington this week seemed to have fallen through last week.
But once the tough issues are resolved, a new agreement should make it easier for American travelers to get a firsthand view of glasnost and perestroika, not to mention Red Square.
Currently, Pan Am is the only American airline that flies directly to the Soviet Union, with four afternoon flights each week to Moscow and Leningrad from Washington and New York.
The proposed agreement would expand the number of United States carriers that can fly to those cities. It also would open four cities in the western part of the Soviet Union - Kiev, Riga, Minsk and Tbilisi - and two cities in the Far Eastern region - Magadan and Khabarovsk, the eastern terminus of the trans-Siberian Railroad - to American carriers. 
With five or six United States airlines expressing interest in the routes, flights could become available from virtually every region of the United States.
For those who would like to travel on the Soviet airline, Aeroflot, which now flies only to New York and Washington, the proposals would allow Aeroflot to fly to Chicago and Miami and to San Francisco, with a stop in Anchorage.
Many details have not been worked out, including precise schedules, a final agreement on the new Soviet destinations and the toughest question of all: whether American companies will be allowed to sell tickets to Russians for rubles. All that may delay the moment when a traveler in Chicago, say, or Atlanta will be able to call a travel agent and ask, ''What's the supersaver fare to Moscow and how much frequent flier mileage will I earn?'' - ANDREW ROSENTHAL
 
Airlines Offer Terror 'Bounty'
United States airlines are teaming up with the Federal Government to deter terrorist attacks as the summer tourist season nears. The Air Transport Association, a Washington-based organization of major commercial carriers, is offering a bounty of up to $1 million for information that either prevents a terrorist attack or leads to the arrest and conviction of terrorists responsible for attacks against United States airlines.
The $1 million will supplement a $2 million reward offered by the State Department, according to Stephen D. Hayes, vice president of the association.
''We think this might be a deterrent,'' he said. ''This reward program is one more element in the way of initiatives government and industry are taking together.''
The reward offer took effect May 1. The association president, Robert Aaronson, said the program would be a ''powerful incentive for people within or close to terrorist organizations to reveal plots before they are hatched.''
The association expects the State Department to take the lead in publicizing the reward in the Middle East and Europe.
 
Lyons Flights
After a year, American Airlines is discontinuing its daily nonstop flights between Kennedy International Airport and Lyons, France. The service is to be dropped at the end of the month. Lyons was to serve as a gateway to the south of France and to the Alps.
American needed the aircraft for Latin American routes it bought from Eastern, which also included Continental's Miami-London service and the Chicago-London service bought from T.W.A., according to John Hotard, a spokesman for American. Business on the New York-Lyons run was ''marginal,'' he said.
 
Cost Watching At Motels
How much did you pay when you last stayed at a motel? If you were looking for lower rates and paid more than $40 for a double room, you are missing something, according to the latest edition of ''The 1990-1991 National Directory of Budget Motels.'' The 80-page booklet says that budget motels offering all the basic amenities - including air-conditioning, television, full bath and swimming pool - generally charge $22 to $33 for a single and $26 to $37 for two. Some major chains, the directory says, charge as little as $23 for a double.
It lists more than 2,000 motels in the United States and a few dozen in Canada and also includes headquarters of 26 of the budget chains, most of which have toll-free 800 numbers.
Rates are not given for individual motels because of ''unpredictable cost factors in the economy,'' but the directory does include umbrella rates along with its listing of motel chains.
Rates at Budget Host Inns, for example, are given as from $18.88, double. Among other starting rates, for two, are: Days Inns, $25; Econo Lodges, $21.99; Hampton Inns, $36; Motel 6, $24.95; Super 8 Motels, $22.50; Susse Chalet, $39.70, and TraveLodge, $28.
Write or telephone the motel and ask for mailed confirmation of a guaranteed price, the directory suggests, particularly during holiday periods.
Request a room rate before checking in and inquire about the lowest rates.
Travelers should also ask about the family, senior citizen and other possible special-group discounts.
Certain areas, including the Northeast, and places with major tourist attractions and resorts offer few budget motels, the directory warns. The booklet is available solely from the publisher, Pilot Books, 103 Cooper Street, Babylon, N.Y. 11702 at $3.95 a copy plus $1 for postage.
 
Spoleto Tickets for Early Risers
It's not too late to attend the Spoleto Festival U.S.A. in Charleston, S.C., which began Friday and runs through June 10. Tickets to the festival's top two draws - Mozart's ''Marriage of Figaro,'' directed by the festival founder, Gian Carlo Menotti, and Oscar Wilde's ''Salome,'' directed by Steven Berkoff - can be obtained with a little sweat and a lot of patience. And tickets for many of the other 118 events being presented this year remain available through normal channels.
Although both ''The Marriage of Figaro'' and ''Salome'' are listed as sold out, people willing to get out of bed early can buy tickets on the day of each performance. The Dock Street Theater, the historic, 463-seat theater where both works are being performed, withholds 40 tickets to every show and sells them to the first 40 people in line. Sales begin at 10 A.M. at the festival's main box office at 14 George Street, and lines form before breakfast. (''The Marriage of Figaro'' is being performed on May 27 to 30 and June 1, 2, 5 and 7; ''Salome'' is being performed May 27 to June 4 and June 7 to 10.) Among other noteworthy performances to which tickets are not as scarce are the world premiere of a Philip Glass opera with text by Allen Ginsberg (May 27 to June 2 at the Sottile Theater), and dance performances by the Martha Graham Dance Company (May 27 and 28, Gaillard Municipal Auditorium), the Joffrey Ballet (June 8 and 9, Gaillard), and the Urban Bush Women (May 30 to June 3, Garden Theater). There is also a variety of chamber music, orchestral and choral concerts, and jazz concerts, among others, by Chick Corea (May 28, Gaillard) and Chet Atkins and Stanley Jordan (June 3, Gaillard).
Ticket prices range from $8 to $150 and can be ordered at 800-868-7228 or from the box office at 14 George Street in Charleston. For a brochure write Spoleto Festival U.S.A., Post Office Box 157, Charleston, S.C. 29402 or call 803-722-2764.

HEADLINE: What's Doing In;
Seattle

BYLINE: By Timothy Egan; TIMOTHY EGAN, the Seattle bureau chief of The Times, is the author of ''The Good Rain'' (Knopf), a nonfiction book about the Northwest to be published next month.

 BODY:
Every city likes to show off after a major remodeling, and Seattle is no exception, despite lingering traits of Scandinavian bashfulness. For the last four years Seattle has been under almost constant construction, but now virtually everything - the new skyscrapers, the pocket-park in the center of town, the underground bus tunnel - is finished, or in the final stages.
The paint is drying just in time. From July 20 to Aug. 5 Seattle will be the site of the Goodwill Games, a sports and arts extravaganza expected to draw upward of 150,000 visitors from out of town.
Not since the World's Fair of 1962 has Seattle thrown open its doors with so much to offer. The games, a creation of Ted Turner, the cable television broadcaster, were originally planned as a cold war antidote, bringing the best Russian and American athletes together between Olympic years. 
The games have been opened up since they were first held in 1986 in Moscow; now more than 2,500 world-class athletes from at least 50 countries are expected to compete.
The accompanying arts festival should be equally grand. From the Bolshoi Ballet, presenting the American premiere of ''Ivan the Terrible,'' to a $2 million Seattle Opera production of ''War and Peace,'' to a rare unveiling of the long-hidden Northwest treasures of the Seattle Art Museum, the bounty of high culture has never been greater.
In recent years Seattle has been through so much change that its native citizens still seem shellshocked. With its souped-up economy and boom times real estate market, the city's pace has quickened and traffic has slowed. Those looking for a quiet and green Northwest experience should cross Puget Sound, to the Olympic Peninsula, or go south of the Columbia River, to slower-paced Oregon.
Nonetheless, this remains a calming and livable city, where ancient cedar forests and bald eagles can be found on the bluff of Discovery Park in West Seattle, 15 minutes from downtown. To sample the new urban treats of Seattle without an afternoon in the wild is to miss what makes this city different from most.
 
The Sights
A walking tour of downtown is the best way to get acquainted with the new face of Seattle. Beginning in Westlake Center, a small plaza at Pine and Fifth Avenue, follow your nose down Pine Street to the Pike Place Market, one of the oldest, best-known and most authentic outdoor fresh food markets in the country.
Then, heading south on First Avenue, boutiques, small bookstores and coffee shops line a street where porno shops and X-rated shows used to proliferate. Turn left on the steep hill of University Street up one block to the Washington Mutual Building, a 55-story tower by Kohn Pederson Fox that many architects have called the best addition to the Seattle skyline since the Space Needle.
Farther up the hill, turn left at Sixth Avenueand follow it to 2 Union Square, which presents a sleek face to the wind, in a design bow to Boeing jetliners. Finally, at Fifth and Pike, is Pacific First Centre Building, heavily ornamented outside with a boisterous retail center inside.
There should be a good run of sockeye salmon making their way back to spawning grounds above Lake Washington this year. The best place to observe a fish obsessed with its journey home to die is at the Hiram M. Chittenden Locks in Ballard, known informally as the Ballard Locks (3015 Northwest 54th Street; 206-783-7059). The salmon can be seen through glass walls. The run should be at its peak in late June through mid-July. It's free.
A Washington State ferry, (206-464-6990 for schedules), leaving about every 45 minutes from the Colman Dock downtown at the foot of Madison Street, will cross Puget Sound to Winslow, on Bainbridge Island. From the west side of the island it's a 10-minute drive to Bloedel Reserve (7571 Northeast Dolphin Drive; 206-842-7631).
The reserve is 150 acres of lush landscaped grounds. Open Wednesday to Sunday, from 10 A.M. to 4 P.M., the cost is $4 , $2 for seniors, free for children under 5. Reservations required.
 
Arts and Sports
Seats are still available for many of the prime sporting and artistic attractions of the Goodwill Games, although the best seats have generally been sold. Tickets for track, wrestling, diving, ice hockey, rowing and other events can be had by calling 206-292-1990; the prices range from $5 to $25.
The best events - such as the opening ceremonies and races between Olympic-caliber athletes in track and field - will be held in Husky Stadium, on the shores of Lake Washington at the University of Washington campus.
The Bolshoi Ballet will open its 1990 American tour at the Goodwill Arts Festival with the United States premiere of ''Ivan the Terrible,'' July 2 to 8, at the Seattle Center Opera House (Mercer Street, at the Seattle Center; 206-292-1990.) The work is choreographed by Yuri Grigorovich, the Bolshoi's artistic director. Although most tickets had to be ordered by May, some seats may open up in late June. Prices range from $20 to $125. In its most ambitious production in years, the Seattle Opera will present a $2 million production of Prokofiev's ''War and Peace,'' the Tolstoy masterpiece, conducted by Mark Ermler of the Bolshoi Opera produced in Seattle by Speight Jenkins, general director. A cast of 200 will be led by the American Sheri Greenawald and soloists from the Kirov Opera, including Vladimir Chernov. Performances are scheduled for July 22, 25, 27, 29, 31, and Aug. 2 and 4, at the Seattle Center Opera House. Call 206-443-3299 or 206-292-1990 for tickets, which range in price from $32 to $85.
Beginning next Friday and running through the end of September, ''Moscow: Treasures and Traditions,'' more than 250 Russian masterworks from five centuries will be on display at the Washington State Convention and Trade Center, Eighth Avenue and Pike Street. Tickets are $7.50, $6.50 for students and seniors and $4.50 for children 3 to 12(206-292-1990).
During roughly the same period, the Seattle Art Museum (Volunteer Park, 1400 East Prospect Street; 206-625-8901), which has a fine permanent collection of Asian art, will mount its most extensive collection ever of Northwest art spanning the past 100 years - 1,800 pieces from regional artists. Tickets are $2 and $1 for students and seniors.
 
Where to Eat
The most exciting newcomer on the fast-changing local scene is Palomino's (Pacific First Centre Building, corner of Fifth Avenue and Pike Street; 206-623-1300). Situated inside a bejeweled new skyscraper, Palomino's describes itself as as a purveyor of European-Seattle cuisine - traditional Northwest fare done in the latest recipes from the Mediterranean. Palomino's is quite loud and a bit showy. Dinner for two with wine is $60 to $100.
Underground and intimate, at the Pike Place Market, is Il Bistro, (93A Pike Street; 206-682-3049)a candlelighted cavern serving Italian food coupled with the best of fresh local products. The atmosphere alone, with its hint of intrigue and hushed coversations, might be worth the visit, but Il Bistro delivers in almost every way. Its wine list is extensive, with pinot noirs from Oregon and cabernet sauvignon and merlots from the Columbia River Valley to complement Tuscan standbys. Pasta dishes are in the $12 range. Heavier Bistro favorites such as rack of lamb or veal chops run $20 to $30 for entrees. Dinner for two with wine $65 to $100.
Another Pike Place Market favorite, Cafe Sport (a block north of the market on Western Avenue; 206-443-6000) is faster-paced and more prone to experimentation than the Bistro. The food does stimulate, but not without warning. It serves Pacific Rim specialties, blending spicy Asian influences.The choice of fresh fish list is always extensive. Expect to pay $60 to $100 for dinner, with wine, for two.
For a taste of old-salt Seattle charm with a view of the biggest fishing fleet on the American Pacific shore, try Chinook's (Fisherman's Terminal, 1735 West Thurman; 206-283-4665). It is a large, friendly, inexpensive restaurant with a 125-item menu.Chinooks is a good place to sip a Seattle ale and watch the mariners clean their boats. Dinner for two with local brews is about $30. No reservations, so arrive early, late or expect to wait about 30 minutes.
 
Where to Stay
This summer is supposed to be the busiest in decades. But local tourism officials expect that there will be some rooms at the major hotels in the three weeks of the Goodwill Games. In the week of July 4 to 8, it will be virtually impossible to find a room , because of a national convention of Alcoholics Anonymous.
A Seattle landmark for more than 60 years, the Four Seasons Olympic Hotel (Fifth Avenue and University; 206-621-1700) was renovated a few years back to restore some of the luster it lost in the 1970's. In the heart of downtown, the Olympic is one of the few major hotels in Seattle that cannot boast stunning views of the Puget Sound or the mountains. What it does offer are rooms stuffed with fine furniture, superb service and attention at all hours, the right touches of chandeliers and marble in the lobby and grand ballroom, and a staff that is ever knowledgable and helpful. An oyster bar downstairs, called Shuckers, and the main dining room just across from the lobby, the Georgian Room, are both excellentin their way. Room rates run from $190 to $265 for a small suite.
The Seattle Sheraton Hotel and Towers (Sixth Avenue and Pike Street; 206-621-9000) is a high-density high-rise, 840 rooms in all, with a good track record among travlers, and a restaurant, Fuller's, that some consider reason enough for the stay. Close to the Convention Center and the retail section, the Sheraton is bubbling at all hours. Upper floors have goods views of the sound. Double room rates range from $125 to $195.
Less costly, but close to all the attractions in the center of town, is the West Coast Roosevelt Hotel (Seventh Avenue and Pine Street; 206-621-1200). Built in 1929, as an Art Deco showoff, the Roosevelt was completedly renovated two years ago with a new restaurant, Von's. As with the Sheraton, the Roosevelt is within walking distance of the shopping frenzy at the Westlake Center and the Pike Place Market. Standard rooms are a bit small, but prices, $83 to $93 for a double, make the Roosevelt a buy in the high rent district. Budget choice: Meany Tower Hotel (45th Avenue and Brooklyn Avenue N.E.; 206-634-2000), is in the University of Washington district, the area north of Lake Union where most of the athletes at the Goodwill Games will be staying. Views are good from most rooms. On weekend nights the U-District, as its called, can get a bit noisy from exuberant students, but the Meany is well-insulated. Doubles run $88

HEADLINE: Where Genghis Khan Is In

BYLINE: By Nicholas D. Kristof; Nicholas D. Kristof is chief of The New York Times's Beijing bureau. He and his colleague Sheryl WuDunn were awarded this year's Pulitzer Prize for international reporting.

 BODY:
MACHOL SIPPED DEEPLY FROM THE BOWL OF FERMENTED MARE'S milk and pondered democracy. Machol knew all about horses and sheep and wolves, but now this unfamiliar concept was sweeping Mongolia. His wife and five children hovered silently in the rear of the gur, the white felt tent that is a herdsman's home, waiting for his judgment. Sunlight peeked through the smoke hole at the top of the gur and dappled his leathery features but brought no inspiration. 
''Sometimes it's difficult to follow all those new political words,'' Machol finally said, as he put some tobacco in a piece of the Communist Party newspaper - Truth - and rolled it into a cigarette. ''My life is full just taking care of livestock.'' After decades of domination by the Soviet Union, which has 50,000 troops stationed within its borders, Mongolia is preparing to become the first Communist country in Asia to ditch Marxist orthodoxy and clamber aboard the democratic bandwagon toward free elections and a market economy. Prodded by thousands of demonstrators who rallied in subzero temeratures earlier this year in Ulan Bator, the capital, the Mongolian Communist Party gave up its monopoly on power and permitted the formation of opposition parties. Free elections are expected this summer. Not since the 13th century, when Genghis Khan formed the Mongol Empire and subdued most of the known world, has the West paid much attention to what went on in Mongolia. It took until 1987 - 66 years after Mongolia declared its independence - for Washington to get around to recognizing it as a sovereign nation. There is still no resident American Ambassador. The incumbent, Richard L. Williams, a career diplomat, lives in Washington.
Almost three times the size of France, with only 2 million people, nearly half of them herding livestock, Mongolia is pretty much the end of the world. Credit cards are unknown; the only international air connections are to the Soviet Union and China; and even if an international telephone call can be arranged, one must yell so loudly that an instrument is almost superfluous.
Today, all of Mongolian life is in a ferment as the people redefine their history, their economy, their political system, their religious faith, their allies, their trade partners and their alphabet. This is a country that is concurrently moving forward and backward, frantically lunging in both directions at once.
''There are two fads here now,'' declares a young Mongolian diplomat. The first, he says, is to learn English. One of the country's most popular television shows teaches the language. The program's popularity reflects the national drift out of a tight Soviet orbit and toward an independent status with close ties to the United States, Japan and Europe. The second fad, he says, is to learn the traditional Mongolian script, abandoned by Communist leaders four decades ago for the Cyrillic alphabet used in the Soviet Union. The old Mongolian script is likely to become the official alphabet as soon as enough people can master its intricacies. What is startling is that so many Mongolians are simultaneously struggling with English, in order to plug into the modern world, and old Mongolian, so that they can resurrect their ancient culture. In Ulan Bator workmen construct modern glass-and-steel skyscrapers, but on the outskirts of the city there are still horse carts and large encampments of gurs, better known by their Russian name, yurts. Many older people still wear the long wide-shouldered cloak that is the national costume, but young people prefer Western clothing brought in from Moscow, which comparatively speaking is a center of haute couture.
Striking change is evident at a recent rock concert by the hottest band in Ulan Bator, Hongk, whose name means ''bell'' - to awaken the people from national stagnation, according to its leader. The packed auditorium is, by Western standards, subdued, but the adrenalin flows and the lid blows off when a portrait of Genghis Khan is lowered from the ceiling and the band launches into the song that would be No. 1 on the rock charts if Mongolia had charts. Fans clap and cheer and join in as the band intones: ''Will you forgive us?/ For we used to focus/ Only on the black spots of your life,/ Distorting the record of history/ And thus deceiving future generations.'' Genghis Khan has returned as national hero, 800 years after he was first pronounced a khan, or chieftain, and several decades after he was relegated to the ash heap by Communist historians as a regrettably talented thug. Mongolians concede he went a bit far - tens of millions of deaths are attributed to his armies - but they quickly add that he was a brilliant general and a patriot.
If the ancient Mongols' brutality is hard to exaggerate, so is their success. The 13th-century Mongol warriors conquered a vast area from China to Central Europe, and after Genghis Khan's death they might well have continued westward except that they were called home to choose a new khan of khans. Otherwise, we might now all be speaking Mongolian.
The threat these days is not that some new khan will emerge and sweep across the steppes, but that this long-forgotten nation will become a wellspring of ideas that could be no less alarming to the established order of its neighbors. The Soviet Union's 500,000 ethnic Mongols, just across the border, are already becoming more nationalistic, but the impact is likely to be greater elsewhere.
For the Communist archipelago in the East - especially China, North Korea and Vietnam - the fear is that the idea of democracy will take root on Asian soil and that the seeds will then blow across their borders. If democracy can function on the grasslands of Mongolia, then perhaps it could also take hold in the rice paddies of China and Vietnam or the hills of North Korea.
THAT THE DEMOCRACY MOVEMENT REACHED MONGOLIA AT ALL IS remarkable. A quarter of the nation's population lives in Ulan Bator. Leave the city in any direction and after 20 minutes there is no sign of life, only snow-dusted mountains and a sea of grass. The southern part of the country is Gobi Desert. Even more remote is the west, with immense lakes and the mighty Altai Mountains, home to the snow leopard and Gobi bear. There are hopes that region will attract more and more free-spending(Continued on Page 32) American big-game hunters in search of gazelle, antelope and the argali, a wild sheep.
The vastness of Mongolia and the herding tradition still dominate the nation's psyche, but for many young urban residents, the core of the democracy movement, this legacy has little relevance. Many of these youngsters have never spent a night in a gur and have no idea how to ride a horse. They admire the economic success of Japan, but such a pattern of industrialization could scarcely be further from Mongolia's immediate future.
For many of these young urbanites, life can be rather boring. There are some movie theaters and a few places to dance, but Mongolia suffers from the Communist failure to provide sufficient leisure activities.
The country's only with-it teen-ager is Faye Senko, the 17-year-old daughter of the American charge d'affaires, Michael J. Senko. Faye, who is doing her best to spread American pop trends, says: ''They're very interested in Western fashions and culture. They look you over from head to toe, to see what's fashionable.'' They also like to borrow her Western magazines, and even want lessons in lambada dancing.
Mongolia has never been a prudish society. In fact, some think of it as a Sweden on the Steppes. This image may be rather exaggerated, but as one Mongolian woman explains: ''If you're out on the grasslands, and there's not much else to do but look after the livestock, then it's pretty natural to curl up with anyone who comes along.'' Foreigners who live in Mongolia are quick to warn visitors to be cautious; some of the prevalent sexual diseases are unknown to Western doctors and can be fatal.
Yet, in sexuality, as in everything else, Mongolia is moving in two directions at once. There is more indulgence, but there is also a growing ascetic religious movement that seeks to restore Buddhist monasteries.
At the time of the 1921 Communist revolution, Mongolia had some 120,000 Buddhist lamas - 40 percent of the male population. Almost all were forced to leave the monasteries, all but one of which were closed down. But today the Gandan Monastery in Ulan Bator is bustling with Mongolians dutifully turning the dozens of prayer wheels at the main building and praying for children and other blessings.
''I was a monk from the age of 5 until I was 27, when I had to leave the monastery,'' says Luvsanosor, a wizened 78-year-old man who, like many other Mongols, uses a single name (given names are sometimes preceded by patronymics). ''But I believe in my faith, and now it's time to go back to the monastery.''
HOW DID EVEN THE faintest whispers of democracy reach such an isolated country?
Sanjaasuren Zorig is part of the answer. Inspired by news of the Eastern European protests, about which extensive information was available in the Soviet newspapers that reach Ulan Bator only a few days late, Zorig and a handful of others began to organize pro-democracy demonstrations. To put pressure on the country's leadership, they formed the Mongolia Democratic Association.
If the Mongolian democracy movement was ever made into a film, Hollywood would never cast Zorig, a skinny 27-year-old lecturer in Marxist theory, to play himself. The part calls for a dynamic organizer and a natural leader; the real Zorig has handsome features, but he rarely laughs, and he speaks more like a diffident professor than a revolutionary.
A colleague and I found him in a classroom, where he was talking with his lieutenants in one corner while elsewhere in the room other teachers relaxed and a student cleaned blackboard erasers. Zorig seemed less than overjoyed to meet intrusive journalists, but he agreed to chat with us. He told us that his father, now deceased, was a historian, that he lives with his mother, who is a doctor, and that neither of them had particularly suffered under the Communist regime.
Does he favor socialism or capitalism? Does he favor public ownership? Does his movement aim to help Mongols living in China? Will his party oppose the ruling Communist Party, or form a coalition?
Zorig parried each question, but his vagueness was coupled by occasional hints that his party might enter a coalition with the Communists, even nominating the same candidate for president in elections expected in July or August. Collectively, such assertions and ambiguities suggest that the Democratic party is a much gentler opposition than those that confronted Eastern European Governments.
Namhai, a leader of the Social Democratic Party, is a bit more specific than Zorig. ''We don't like any kind of 'ism' - capitalism, socialism and so on,'' he said firmly at a news conference with foreign reporters. ''But if you persist, we would say that the Social Democratic forces believe the models in Austria or Sweden are the ones we would like to see followed in Mongolia.''
In addition to young professionals like Zorig and Namhai, the mostly peaceful protests in Ulan Bator apparently had the tacit backing of factions within the ruling party. Kinayatyn Dzardyhan, a 50-year-old advocate of rapid restructuring who in March became Deputy Prime Minister, is said to have supported the demonstrations. There were others, like P. Nergui, a 56-year-old economist; Boshigt, a 49-year-old doctor who advised the opposition; and, according to the Ulan Bator rumor mill, possibly even Tserendashiyn Namsray, at the age of 50, the youngest member of the old politburo. All these Communist Party members share a deepening sense of dissatisfaction with Mongolia's closed political and economic system and an apprehension that time is passing their nation by.
''Socialism is facing a deep crisis today,'' Dzardyhan said in a recent interview on Radio Ulan Bator. Yet he insists that socialism is Mongolia's eventual goal, and that democracy and openness should be expanded only within the paradigm of a socialist country.
MORE IMPORTANT THAN any Mongol activist was another man: Mikhail S. Gorbachev.
The Soviet Union has controlled Mongolia ever since freeing it from China's clutches early in this century. Perhaps it is this longtime domination that helps to explain the emergence of Zorig and others like him who studied in the Soviet Union (as did most of Mongolia's best and brightest). They were particularly attuned to the contrast between Soviet ferment and Mongolian stagnation. Since December, they and several thousand protesters have been periodically gathering in Ulan Bator's central Suhbator Square to wave banners and demand democracy.
In the Government Palace, next to the square, the Communist leadership was wracked by indecision after the first demonstration. Zhambyn Batmonh, the President and party leader and a former university rector, appeared to understand the need for change, though he was less sympathetic to calls for his own dismissal. At first, Batmonh tried tolerance, even allowing protest leaders to discuss their demands on television. Later, he banned the demonstrations. The protestors blithely violated the ban, just as students in China had a year ago.
Could the Mongolia protests have ended in bloodshed, as did the ones in Tiananmen Square? Indeed, there is considerable evidence that the Mongolian leadership came very close to resorting to force. Few foreign correspondents were at the scene and so the drama was underreported at the time. The crisis began after more than 4,000 demonstrators gathered in Suhbator Square on March 5 to call for the resignation of the entire Government. When their demands were not met, they began a hunger strike.
Debates raged among top party leaders about what to do, and for a time the hardliners seemed to be in control. Knowledgeable Government officials say that military forces had been put on alert and that troops were moved into the Ulan Bator stadium, a 20-minute march to the square.
Two days later, the Central Committee chose as its new party leader a popular reformist, 61-year-old Gombogavyn Ochirbat. In late March, the Great People's Hural, the national parliament, chose a new president, Punsalmaagiyn Ochirbat, a former Economics Minister, who had tried to cultivate relations with the West. (The two Ochirbats are unrelated.) Then at an extraordinary party congress in April, the Communists - whose formal name is the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party - excised the word ''communism'' from their constitution and declared that their aim was to build ''dem-ocratic humane socialism.'' The party also replaced its central committee with much younger members more open to change.
Perhaps Mongolia did not take China's path of violently crushing opposition because it was in the Soviet orbit and so had had five years to absorb some of Gorbachev's lessons in political liberalization. The degree of liberalization is striking: not only does Mongolia appear not to have any political prisoners, but when foreign reporters visit, the Government happily arranges news conferences at which dissidents excoriate the leadership.
Some officials have suggested that only pro-socialist parties should compete in the parliamentary elections expected to be held this summer, but at least five new opposition parties of various persuasions have already sprung up.
What is striking about Mongolia is that the Communist Party could actually maintain its power through free elections. If that happens, China and North Korea might be more inclined to experiment with democracy; if the Communists lose, the hardliners in Beijing and Pyongyang will have even more reason to be alarmed.
Much will depend on voting patterns among rural families, which constitute nearly half the population. Herdsmen are not very political, and the Communist Party, with its organizational edge, may be able to arrange for them to cast their ballots for familiar names. So far, the herdsmen have watched the political goings-on with more bewilderment than passion.
''The hunger strike was very unusual in a country like Mongolia,'' Tselema, a 54-year-old grandmother and herder, told me as we sat in her gur in the grasslands near the town of Sergelen, in the east central section of the country. ''Normally, people have enough to eat in Mongolia.''
The interperter, a young Foreign Ministry diplomat, was puzzled at first by her comment. But after questioning Tselema, he explained: ''It seems she doesn't understand the hunger strike. She thought they didn't have enough to eat.''
As for democracy, Tselema said, ''I don't know very much about that,'' but she seemed prepared to vote for the Communist Party, especially if it would get her more fuel to keep the generator running at night so that the 10 people living in the tiny family gur could enjoy electric light.
Suhkbator, the head of a newly formed Mongolian Herdsmen and Peasants Union, welcomes such recent changes as an end to restrictions on the number of livestock any family may own, but says that such measures are not enough: ''We want the life of Mongolian peasants to reach international standards.'' He was less specific about how to achieve this, but indicated that a market economy was part of the answer. He, too, seemed prepared to back the Communist Party: ''If it manages to reform itself, it should be the main force in Mongolia.''
POLITICAL Restructuring is at the top of Mongolia's agenda, but there is also a broad consensus for the need to build a market-oriented economy. Mongolia's former leaders tried to build a Stalinist, heavy industrial economy on the grasslands, but with little success.
And although World Bank figures suggest that Mongolia has a per capita income of about $1,000 a year, compared with about $300 for China, this is largely due to exchange-rate distortions. In fact, the standard of living is probably roughly comparable. Mongolians are more likely to enjoy good schools and hospitals, but the Chinese enjoy the fruits of a decentralized economy and small-scale free markets - an abundance of varied foods, colorful clothing and electronic products. Mongolia's economy is still run according to the central planners' vision, and incentives and private enterprise scarcely exist.
Any economic restructuring is likely to lead to new tensions with the Soviet Union, partly because Mongolia owes the Russians 9.7 billion rubles ($5.5 billion). ''We would like the Soviet Union to cancel the debts,'' says Suh-Erdene, a leader of the new National Progressive Union. In the past, the Soviet Union has been very generous about debt reschedulings, but the present agreement expires in 1991 and the next round of talks will probably be the toughest yet.
There is a nearly universal conviction here that the Soviets have been robbing Mongolia blind of its natural resources, paying far below market rates for minerals and meat. How else, the Mongolians ask, can there be meat shortages in a nation where livestock outnumber humans 12 to 1? In fact, Mongolians may overstate the plunder. They tend not to factor in the oil, machinery and foreign aid they get from Moscow. The resentments are compounded by the presence of tens of thousands of Soviet citizens in top jobs in Ulan Bator, where they also tend to have the best housing and life styles. One of the risks of being a Westerner in Mongolia is that people will mistake you for a Russian and beat you up. Several Western reporters have been menaced on the street and have slipped out of tight spots only by proclaiming their nationality. Alicia J. Campi, a Mongolian-speaking American diplomat now setting up a Mongolian-language program in Ulan Bator for diplomats, says she gets terrible service in the shops until she identifies herself as an American.
''Before, the United States was all bad, bad, bad,'' she reports. ''Now it's all good, good, good.'' As for foreign trade, although Mongolia is increasingly attuned to potential international investors, the cost of doing business there is high. Transportation is a major problem, with only a single-track railway into the country. But the Japanese have been looking to sell manufacturing equipment and American companies have expressed interest in importing Mongolian vodka, processing yak and camel hair into textiles and exploring for oil. As yet, there has not been any real action.
IN ITS FOREIGN POLICY, Mongolia is moving toward greater neutrality. This spring, in a blow to North Korea, it formally recognized South Korea. But the most important realignment is Mongolia's determination to remove itself from the Soviet umbrella. The two countries have agreed that Moscow will withdraw all of its combat troops from Mongolia by the end of 1991 and all remaining military staff by the end of 1992.
But a visitor from Beijing cannot help but wonder if the Mongolians shouldn't be concerned. After the Soviet troops leave, does China pose a threat? No diplomat expects China to attack or harass Mongolia, but it takes a brave analyst to rule anything out where China is concerned. What if the 3.5 million Mongols in China began demonstrating and received assistance from their kinsmen across the border?
Many Mongols living in China listen to Mongolian radio stations and perhaps absorb dangerous ideas about democracy and nationalism. There is little sign of unrest so far, but Chinese authorities acknowledged during the recent national legislative session that they were concerned.
The Mongolian who drove me around Ulan Bator said he felt strongly that ''there should be a relationship with Inner Mongolia. We are one people, and we used to be one nation.''
As part of the effort to redevelop ties with China - and reassure Beijing that it need not worry - President Ochirbat visited there early this month. It was his first trip abroad since assuming office, and the first visit to China by any Mongolian head of Government since 1962. Yet Mongolians have very mixed views about whether the democracy movement should stop at their borders.
The topic came up at a news conference as Mongolia's new Social Democratic Party was announcing its formation. Batbaiar, a biologist who is a party leader, was very diplomatic: ''We want to develop democracy in Mongolia, not in China. Democracy in China is its own affair.'' But another party leader, Lamjav, a mathematician by profession, objected to the Mongolian Government's refusal last summer to protest the killings of pro-democracy demonstrators in China. ''We regard our Government's position at that time as immoral,'' he declared. ''We would take an entirely different position, proceeding from high morality.''
After the news conference, several reporters questioned Lamjav further. He noted that other countries had protested the killings in Beijing, but we pointed out that those countries were protected by distance, while Mongolia is a tidbit sandwiched between two Communist giants.
The translator looked at us soberly for a moment, and then before interpreting our question to Lamjav, she said, ''That is Mongolia's tragedy.''

A HIGHER KIND OF LOYALTY
A Memoir by China's Foremost Journalist.
By Liu Binyan.
Translated by Zhu Hong.
294 pp. New York:
Pantheon Books. $22.95.
''The fact is, I had always overestimated the amount of freedom that was allowed.'' This laconic lament by a Chinese journalist who spent most of his working life in Maoist purgatory may be the understatement of the year. Liu Binyan portrays himself in this moving memoir as a wise fool. Again and again he calls attention to the wrongs he sees in Chinese society in the belief that the Communist Party, his party, will put things right. Again and again he is gagged, purged or incarcerated for telling the unpalatable truth. 
Mr. Liu's is a singular story because nobody else in China confronted the regime as directly as he did in his role as star investigative reporter for party newspapers. But the misfortunes he describes in ''A Higher Kind of Loyalty,'' ably translated by Zhu Hong, were also typical of China's tiny, tormented intellectual community. There has hardly been a year since the Communists came to power that some members of what Mao called the ''stinking ninth category'' were not under attack, usually for far milder challenges than Mr. Liu's. Indeed, by comparison with the random barbarism that Bette Bao Lord chronicles in her new book, ''Legacies,'' Mr. Liu's persecution was rational: he outraged party bosses by revealing their abuses of power and was duly punished.
What is unfathomable to a non-Chinese is why it took Mr. Liu more than three decades to break with his persecutors. He was a loyalist but never blind. His search for the man ''who is not afraid to differ'' got him charged with ''an anti-Party stance'' as early as 1955. Once this case against him, based on forged letters, was thrown out, however, he felt ''as if the Party were really more reliable than ever.'' The next year, Nikita Khrushchev's secret speech on Stalin shattered many of Mr. Liu's illusions about Communism but only bolstered his faith in China's innovative Leninist, Mao Zedong.
''I do not remember a moment in my life more exhilarating,'' Mr. Liu writes about the day in February 1957 when Mao's speech inviting criticism of the party was released. Later that spring, Mr. Liu sent a letter to Mao, protesting against the misdirection of his Hundred Flowers free-speech campaign, but the chairman had already decided to rid himself of this meddlesome muckraker. Mr. Liu was eventually persuaded of his own guilt: ''Between Mao and myself, there could only be one wrong, and since he was beyond wrong, it could only be me. Thus I accepted my fate.''
That fate was to be trucked out to the countryside for three years of labor reform, followed by another year dragging night soil through the streets of Beijing. For nine years Mr. Liu and his stoically loyal wife waited for the liberating moment when his rightist label would be removed. It came in March 1966. Three months later, Mr. Liu arrived at his newspaper to see a poster declaiming, ''Liu Binyan has not retreated from his anti-Party stand!'' With the Cultural Revolution in full swing, Mr. Liu became a ''class enemy'' as well as an unreconstructed rightist. The punishment was another eight years planting rice and raising pigs.
Mr. Liu was not permitted to take up his pen again until the winter of 1979, after the second resurrection of China's current ruler, Deng Xiaoping. For the next eight years he served as self-appointed ombudsman for victims of party tyranny. He became a best-selling writer in China. Yet even in these years, when Mr. Deng was de-Stalinizing the economy and granting intellectuals more leeway than ever before, independent thinkers like Mr. Liu were periodically harassed. ''Still I remained confident that the Party and Deng Xiaoping would understand that my goals were the same as theirs . . . that we were fighting on the same front.''
The party and Mr. Deng never did understand Mr. Liu's notion of ''a higher kind of loyalty.'' But although Mr. Liu was stripped of party membership for the second time in 1987, he did not abandon his faith until the tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square. The massacre and its repressive aftermath stopped Mr. Liu from returning home after a year as a Nieman Fellow at Harvard, where he completed this autobiography and delivered a series of lectures on China's corrupt and unresponsive Communists (to be published later this year). Today Mr. Liu is a leader of the Front for a Democratic China, which is crusading from abroad for a change of rulers and a change of political direction in Beijing.
Like Chinese dissidents everywhere, Mr. Liu and his fellow exiles were exhilarated by the events in Eastern Europe. Yet the collapse of European Communism has also provoked intense soul-searching. Many protesters both inside and outside China are now blaming themselves, and a flaw in China's national character, for their failure to take the Tiananmen movement all the way. Others, like Mr. Liu, are still pinning their hopes for democratic change on forces within the ruling elite. The people's movement that Mr. Liu foresees is not a rerun of Tiananmen but a spreading grass-roots assertiveness that will reinforce reformers at the top.
A year ago, Mr. Liu's excoriation of the ''Gang of the Old'' sounded like a radical war cry. Today, not only China's rulers but also their critics seem out of step with the times. This is mostly a function of history. While Chinese writers have been breaking through official barriers for years and suffering for it, and intellectuals have been quietly exchanging ideas on political reform, China has never produced an organized opposition like Solidarity, or human rights groups like the Helsinki committees.
Would-be dissidents were intimidated by the tightest state controls outside Romania, and inhibited by the absence of any mediating institution such as a church. And unlike the Havels and the Walesas, who opposed tyrannical regimes from outside, China's democratic reformers saw themselves as the ultimate insiders, part of a 2,500-year-old tradition of mandarins whose mission was to advise the state.
Liu Binyan shares this Confucian-cum-Communist yearning to serve; he is a Chinese of his place and his time. His book illuminates how a Marxist true believer became a campaigner for human rights. But the central conundrum remains: how could a clearsighted man know so much about the underside of Communism without concluding that the system, as well as its leaders, was fatally flawed?
 
'WE WERE TRULY UNTOUCHABLES'
 I had thought that I would take my punishment and start over again, minus a Party card, but as a cadre nevertheless. At the first meeting of the rightists in the countryside, I spoke my mind and was immediately admonished by the ''good'' comrades in charge of us: ''Don't forget your rightist label.'' Only then did I realize not only that I would have to bury myself in the countryside, but that I would be branded forever with a rightist label.
If we had known at the time that we would have to bear that label for twenty-one years (the removal of the tag in the early sixties converted us into ''rightists with labels removed''), I wonder how many of us would have gone on living. . . . I labored in the countryside, separated from my wife and children, off and on, for thirteen years in all. What was harder to bear was the stigma we carried with us. . . . We were truly untouchables.
Mao was much cleverer than Stalin. Why kill off your enemies? Crush them under a label, and if that doesn't work, there's the reformatory, and after that, jail. If Mao had killed off all his political opponents, all the landlords and all the rich, then his rallying cry of four years later - ''class struggle must be kept in mind, year in and year out, month in and month out, day in and day out'' - would have been pointless. And eight years later, during the Cultural Revolution, the Red Guards would have had no targets on which to focus their revolutionary ardor. The label also served to stir up competition among the rightists themselves. Beginning in 1959, a few were ''unlabeled'' every year, and this spurred the remaining ones to improve their performance. And what better way than to report on their fellow victims? That is exactly what happened. From the very beginning, there were those who reported on or even slandered their own kind. So there was a lot of mutual criticism among us seventeen rightists: ''You have the wrong attitude,'' ''you are persisting in your reactionary point of view,'' and so on. All these were very effective in adding to our load of guilt.

HEADLINE: THE SEEDS OF OUR OWN DESTRUCTION?

THE GENOCIDAL MENTALITY
Nazi Holocaust and
Nuclear Threat.
By Robert Jay Lifton and
Eric Markusen.
346 pp. New York:
Basic Books. $22.95.
The subject of Robert Jay Lifton and Eric Markusen's book, ''The Genocidal Mentality: Nazi Holocaust and Nuclear Threat,'' is ''nuclearism,'' which the authors define as ''an exaggerated dependency on nuclear weapons for strength, protection, and safety.'' Nuclearism, they claim, is inherently contradictory because the weapons are themselves ''instruments of genocide.'' While they reserve their harshest criticism for scientists who design the weapons and military strategists who rationalize their production and deployment, by inference we are all guilty since we have all ''passionately embraced'' the weapons as a ''solution to death anxiety and the threat of extinction.'' Thus, the reader is both subject and object of the book. 
The authors specialize in identifying ''group themes,'' or the ''psychological environments'' in which certain groups operate. In this case their focus is on two groups: the progenitors of and the present day participants in ''nuclearism.'' Their premise is that genocide cannot be conducted (or even contemplated) without the cooperation of both groups. And so the book explores in some detail how ''disciplined professionals'' are euchred into the service of monstrous policy, and why onlookers merely look on. More generally, the authors begin to tackle a question that should haunt historians long after this era is over. They ask how a nation as free, democratic and pragmatic as ours purports to be, can have contemplated (in some quarters, systematically planned) the destruction of the world?
They say the answer lies in the evolution of a ''genocidal mentality'' that began with the development of the first atomic bomb at Los Alamos in 1945, spread to think tanks where nuclear strategy was invented and refined and eventually infected the entire population. Meanwhile, lulled by ''cycles of nuclear normality,'' the rest of us were ''psychically numbed'' into passivity while we waited for whatever was to be.
Enter the Nazi doctors. The search for ''group themes'' brings Dr. Lifton and Mr. Markusen to the central and surely the most controversial thesis of their book: there is a fundamental sameness between Nazism and nuclear genocide, and the ''disciplined professionals'' in the service of both can be compared. Mindful of the criticism this thesis is bound to elicit, the authors list the many differences between the two. But, they submit, there is also much in common. Both are in the ''genocide business,'' both are able to put their humanity on hold through psychological ''doubling'' when they indulge their working selves and both are convinced of the rightness and urgency of their mission. While ''nuclearism,'' the authors are quick to point out, ''has nothing to do with race or any clear-cut social or political principle . . . like the Nazi biomedical vision, nuclearism as an ideology is charismatic, overarching, anchored in 'logic,' and inherently genocidal.'' The main difference, it seems to me, is that unlike Nazi genocide - and for reasons the authors fail to explore - nuclear genocide simply hasn't happened, although we and the Soviet Union still have thousands of warheads aimed at each other, and other nations also have nuclear weapons.
After the thesis is set up, each succeeding chapter begins with the retelling of some event, the description of some behavior or simply the defining of some working principle on the part of professionals in the employ of Adolf Hitler, and then proceeds to analyze some ''comparable'' activity on the part of their American ''counterparts'' in the nuclear establishment. The reader begins to feel queasy. For in this analysis the Pentagon is accused of a ''near worship of weapons'' that is equivalent to Nazi claims of ''scientific racism.''
But the military is by no means the worst offender. American science and a generation of American scientists are also ''Nazi-like'' in their unthinking attachment to their technologies. The authors remind us that some engineer designed the Nazi gas chambers, some chemist the infamous Zyklon B gas, and that the historian Benno Muller-Hill, whom the authors quote, viewed Auschwitz as a ''monument of science and technology.'' But this in no way demonstrates that a majority of physicians, engineers and scientists - German or American - would have participated in the wholesale gassing of Jews, or that Muller-Hill was correct. To go from Auschwitz to America's defense establishment strains credibility and diminishes what is valuable about the book: its reminder of a not so distant way of thinking and its warning that as long as such weapons continue to exist, we are not out of the woods.
In their insistence on a ''psychohistorical treatment'' of the nuclear era, the authors can deal but clumsily with the complexities of both strategic and moral issues. The problem is that they are writing about politics without dealing with politics, and the context and the nuances are blurred. For example, counterforce nuclear warheads targeted at an enemy's military facilities instead of at highly populated industrial centers may seem more moral because civilian damage would be limited. But counterforce doctrine encourages the acquisition of many more weapons than would be required for simple deterrence; and, because such weapons might not lead to Armageddon, they inspired the idea of limited nuclear war.
In another simplification, Los Alamos becomes just another ''killing institution,'' comparable to Nazi death camps, and the ''high'' that scientists experienced there in the 1940's only a fascination with power or, in some perverse way, with destruction. What the authors dismiss is the urgency our scientists felt racing, as they knew they must, against German physicists and engineers for the prize. Theirs was no mindless commitment. They fully expected to be consulted about how, where and whether the bomb would be dropped. Then and now, weapons scientists are more diverse than these authors would have us believe. Their own interview with Hans Bethe, a Los Alamos physicist who left and then returned to weapons work, is revealing. It was politics (the outbreak of the Korean War), more than a sense or absence of morality, that dictated what he would do.
Still, the authors' questions produce insight. National policy that is incoherent and even dangerous may begin in individual behavior that becomes a system-wide tendency (for instance, what they call ''nonresponsibility''). Collective ''dissociation,'' the authors believe, accounts both for how Nazi doctors could block out the killing they were involved in and how American nuclear strategists could have invented the policy of ''mutual assured destruction.''
Since, in the authors' view, any attempt to respond to the nuclear threat, that is any nuclear strategy, is just another variant on ''nuclearism,'' we should not be surprised that Dr. Lifton and Mr. Markusen cannot acknowledge deterrence (what they see as the epitome of ''dissociation'') as a reasonable and ultimately successful strategy for avoiding nuclear war. Nor can they concede that arms control, however puny its outcomes, has been a useful way of managing a deadly arms competition during periods of intense rivalry and tension. And certainly they would never admit, as some historians may conclude, that in the end the hydrogen bomb kept the peace.
With the cold war winding down, we might have expected Robert Jay Lifton, who has contributed so much to our understanding of the nuclear era, to offer a reassessment of the nuclear threat, one that would explain how the two superpowers managed not to annihilate each other, and possibly the entire planet, during their 40-year nuclear standoff. It is disappointing that this book does not include a reassessment. Critics will find in it ''old think'' - the Doomsday incantations and finger-pointings of yesteryear - and an annoying tendency to offer us names of syndromes (''heroic scientism'') in place of explanation. But in their zeal to analyze the psychological environment that blinds human beings to the moral consequences of their actions, they mean to rattle our cages and our complacency even as the first real nuclear disarmament begins. That is a rattling we need.
 
ONCE THE WEAPONS ARE RELEASED
 As with the Nazis, political or economic problems of almost any kind can lead to mass violence. . . . But, in contrast to the Nazi model - where the habit of killing led, more or less piecemeal, to a genocidal point of no return - crossing the nuclear threshold is likely to be sudden and total. To be sure, there could be buildups and retreats . . . but once the weapons were actually released, a definitive step would have been taken. At the same time, the principle of ideological and structural readiness for genocide - along with a genocidal dynamic, as in the Nazi case - applies to the nuclear in strikingly similar ways. The Nazis created their own ''blind alley'': the anti-Semitic policies which brought about the ghettoization of the Jews; and then the near insoluble problem of feeding the Jews and preventing typhus epidemics among them that could spread to German personnel - all of which motivated the Nazis to ''break the vicious circle'' and kill them. The ''vicious circle'' in the nuclear sense - the unending quest for ''security'' and ''stable deterrence'' - can be ''broken'' only in one or two ways: by setting the weapons off, or else by getting rid of all or most of them. And insofar as a genocidal system moves strongly towards weapons use - or perceives its adversary to be doing so - there is a powerful temptation to set off one's weapons quickly so that the command-and-control structure of the enemy, rather than one's own, can be destroyed.

HEADLINE: GLOBAL TRADE: THE SECRETS OF SUCCESS

 BODY:

THE COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE OF NATIONS
By Michael E. Porter.
855 pp. New York: The Free Press. $35.
This book starts in the right place: trade surpluses do not make for national success; trade deficits do not make for national failure. A country's success depends on a high and rapidly rising level of productivity. In the long run, productivity, and nothing else, determines our standard of living.
''The Competitive Advantage of Nations'' also ends in the right place: private companies, not governments, are primarily responsible for productivity's rate of growth. If businesses are to increase productivity, however, they must have the help of their workers' best efforts. This requires a large investment in education and training by governments, businesses and individuals. These investments must then be backed up by even larger investments in plants and equipment, research and development, and infrastructure. 
Sophisticated, demanding, but quick to buy, customers must force their vigorously competitive companies to produce leading-edge products. Those companies serve global markets, but, to be successful, they have to have a strong home base; they must work with their customers and suppliers to insure the superiority of their products.
Owners and managers must be long-term builders, not so-called ''market harvesters'' who focus almost exclusively on short-term profits. They must relentlessly set their sights on the leading company in their industry and do whatever is necessary to be better.
Governments have an indirect role to play in all this. They insure that the raw materials of success (investment in training, education, and research and development, and in plants and equipment) are present and that vigorous internal competition is kept alive. Spending on research and development, for example, helps companies to adopt new technologies whose economic payoffs should be high.
Michael E. Porter, who teaches at the Harvard Business School and is the author of ''Competitive Strategy'' and ''Competitive Advantage,'' is correct to point out that America's economic problems do not lie in the openness or lack of openness of Japanese markets, but in too little investment in skills, plants and equipment, research and development, and infrastructure. American consumers are willing to put up with trashy products, and companies don't know how to build up their home bases by working with customers and suppliers. Competition in the United States is often tepid; almost all American owners and managers are often market harvesters protecting their own wealth, rather than investors strengthening their companies' global economic position. Based on the evidence of the past decade, America's standard of living now doubles every 51 years, instead of every 22 years as it had since the onset of the Industrial Revolution. And that would be the case even if every other competing nation were to disappear from the face of the earth.
In between the right beginning and the right ending, Mr. Porter provides a lengthy tour through the 50 most successful export industries in each of 10 leading industrial countries. His aim is to look for the common denominators of success. Unfortunately, this long journey is made even longer by prose that is so turbid and turgid that sentences and paragraphs often have to be read several times to decipher their meaning. Even the author sometimes loses track of his argument.
Mr. Porter preaches the economic equivalent of survival of the fittest. The closer one looks, however, the less predictive power this theory, like its counterpart in the study of evolution, seems to have. No one viewing Homo sapiens 100,000 years ago would have predicted the species' dominance today. No biologist can say precisely what characteristics caused a species to become extinct, since there is almost always some other species with exactly those characteristics that did not die out.
The same is true of Mr. Porter's tour through 500 successful export industries. For every example there is a counterexample. Japan and Italy are the two countries with the largest post-World War II increase in exports. The former has a Government organized to help its industries; the latter has one organized, it seems, in effect to disorganize its economy. The rising value of the yen from 1985 to 1989 forced Japanese companies to become more efficient; a rising dollar from 1981 to 1985 caused American companies to go out of business. All of Mr. Porter's findings predict that Olivetti cannot be successful in Italy, yet it is. In both biology and economics, the more detailed the analysis, the more random the result appears to be.
The heart of Mr. Porter's examination is what he calls the national ''diamond,'' the four corners of which are, he writes, ''the nation's position in factors of production, such as skilled labor or infrastructure, necessary to compete in a given industry''; ''the nature of home demand for the industry's product or service''; ''the presence or absence in the nation of supplier industries and related industries that are internationally competitive,'' and ''the conditions in the nation governing how companies are created, organized, and managed, and the nature of domestic rivalry.'' To have a high standard of living, both government and business must act to strengthen this ''diamond.'' He sees this happening in various industries throughout the world: ceramics in Italy and robotics in Japan, for example.
In the end, Mr. Porter fails exactly where everyone else has failed. Why do some countries grow? Why do other countries decline? Like earlier intellectual explorers, he looks for stages of national growth that are the equivalent of youth, maturity and old age. For Mr. Porter, early development starts with cheap labor. Youth is a body-building phase during which the engine of growth is huge investments in upgrading the quality of such factors of production as plants and equipment and work-force training. The country gains full maturity when it enters an innovation-driven period in which growth comes from product upgrading and improved manufacturing processes. Old age brings a wealth-driven stage during which countries seek to protect what they have, and companies ''harvest'' their market positions by not continuing to invest enough to insure their survival.
The problem is that no one can say when or why a country stops increasing productivity and enters the wealth-driven stage of decline. From Mr. Porter's perspective, Britain has been in this stage for most of the century; America entered it 25 years ago; and Germany, Sweden and Switzerland are headed into it. But all of this is, of course, a tautology. When productivity ceases to rise rapidly, the wealth-driven stage is said to exist. Calling decline the wealth-driven stage, however, does not help us to better predict, understand or reverse decline.
While it is correct to say that government can never be the prime actor in international competition, Mr. Porter too lightly brushes over actions by foreign governments that have created problems for the United States. What does one do about the European consortium Airbus Industries? Without a huge worldwide backlog of airplane orders, this publicly owned and subsidized company would be driving Boeing out of business. What does one do about a Japanese Government that prevents foreign companies from using superior technologies to gain an established market there (Motorola's cellular phones, Corning Glass's fiber optics)? Foreigners are welcome only when they have lost their technological edge.
Mr. Porter says that demographic trends may force American business to be more innovative in the 1990's. Without a rapidly growing labor force in the 90's, companies will have to invest in equipment to replace the workers they can no longer hire. But demographic trends could be the cause of, as well as the cure for, American problems. The growth in population during the 70's and 80's (the maturing baby boomers plus new immigrants) should have led to falling real wages. It did. Real wages for nonsupervisory workers have been decreasing since 1973. Falling wages should have led to lower capital-labor ratios. They did. The need to feed all of those people and provide them with consumer goods should have led to a low savings rate and too little investment. It did. Put bluntly, if a nation breeds at the rate of an underdeveloped country, it must live like an underdeveloped country.
Mr. Porter has come to conclusions very similar to those reached by others, and none of their writings has made a dent in the system. I suspect his analysis won't either. We all know that we should consume less and invest more in education, research and development, plants and equipment, and infrastructure. But we don't. We all know that the American financial system places a dangerous emphasis on short-term profits. But we don't change the system.
What we need is what we don't have: a President willing to tell the people that the news from the competitiveness-productivity front does not bode well for our future standard of living. What we don't have is a political process that would then support a President in changing what must be changed. As Mr. Porter's analysis of Britain illustrates, decline does not within itself contain the seeds of regeneration. Those seeds must come from elsewhere, and neither Mr. Porter nor any of the other writers toiling in these fields knows where that elsewhere is to be found.

THE ROAD TO A FREE ECONOMY
Shifting From a Socialist System:
The Example of Hungary.
By Janos Kornai.
224 pp. New York: W.W. Norton & Company. $16.95.
The political upheavals within Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have captured global attention. Country after country has been swept up in a frenetic rush to establish new governments based on democratic principles of pluralism and free elections. The economic changes, of necessity, have proceeded more slowly, but they will play a critical role in defining the future direction of these countries. For the new political institutions are fragile, and vulnerable to collapse if the economic reforms fail to satisfy expectations of improved living standards. 
In a small treatise originally published last fall in Hungary as an emotional appeal to his countrymen, Janos Kornai, an eminent Hungarian economist who is also a professor at Harvard, outlined the reforms that he believed must be undertaken. ''The Road to a Free Economy'' is the English version of that book, rewritten to reflect recent events. It provides us with an insight into the debate over economic reform taking place in many of the Eastern European countries.
Mr. Kornai achieved prominence through his critical analysis of the socialist system, and he leaves no doubt about where he wants Hungary to go: he desires a Western-style market economy centered around laissez-faire capitalism. He argues against market socialism, the proposal to combine state-owned companies with a market economy, which he sees as an extension of past efforts to establish pseudo-businesses operating in pseudo-markets. He wants the real thing. In fact, Mr. Kornai finds most of the social welfare states of Western Europe to be unacceptable compromises with the socialist principles that he and many Eastern European intellectuals deplore. Traumatized by state control, they leap to the opposite extreme, rejecting all but the most minimal role for government. Mr. Kornai has far more in common with Margaret Thatcher than with those leaders on the Continent who favor a balance between capitalism and the welfare state. He is averse to progressive income taxation, for example, favoring reliance on sales taxes or wage taxes.
Like all of us, Mr. Kornai understands the capitalist goal better than how to get there. American economists, who thought deregulation of the United States airline industry was a big deal, boggle at the magnitude of the task confronting the Eastern European countries, where the prices of products bear only a minimal relationship to the costs of producing them. Competition among companies in Eastern Europe is rare because the Communists regarded it as wasteful duplication. Thus, when they relaxed central control, they ended up with thousands of little monopolies that cut production and pushed up prices.
Under the new regimes, state ownership of enterprises has come to mean no ownership, as managers and workers operate companies for their own benefit and treat capital, allocated by the government, as though it were a free good. The old joke that workers in Communist countries pretend to work and the state pretends to pay them remains all too true. The required change in attitudes of workers and managers may turn out to be the most difficult part of the transition. On top of these problems, the East Europeans lack the institutions and laws governing commerce that Westerners tend to take for granted. Banks, for instance, are simply institutional devices for passing out subsidies to failing businesses.
Mr. Kornai's book is presented as a comprehensive plan for transformation, but it focuses on privatization of the economy, stabilization policies and the strengthening of political support for economic liberalization. This means that a lot of issues are treated very briefly or ignored. What institutions are truly critical to a market economy? In what sequence should the reforms be introduced?
Mr. Kornai has enormous faith in private enterprise as the key to the reform process, but there are major problems with converting the existing state enterprises. Some suggest that the companies should be sold; but at what price? For many years their value will be almost impossible to determine. And to whom should they be sold? Private citizens have little wealth with which to purchase them. Extensive foreign ownership of a country's key industries raises political problems. A transfer to the current workers would be quick but highly inequitable, since many workers would be acquiring only losses. Perhaps the enterprises could be converted to corporations owned by large mutual funds in which all citizens would have shares. Diffuse ownership, however, would be like no ownership, exerting little pressure on managers and workers to restructure their enterprises.
The ultimate answer will probably be a mixture of these options, but for many years these economies will be dominated by large state enterprises. Recognizing this problem, Mr. Kornai would severely restrict the supply of credit to the state companies, while promoting the rapid expansion of new private businesses.
Mr. Kornai sees inflation as the Achilles' heel of the reform process. New markets with weak competition are inflation-prone, and new governments will be under pressure to use debt as a major means of financing public demands for social programs. Providing credit to failing businesses to avoid the pain of restructuring is a Hungarian tradition. The result has been excessive monetary expansion and inflation. Mr. Kornai proposes to fight inflation with tight budgetary constraints, restrictions on credit to state enterprises and, most important, a system of controls on wages. This is easier said than done - particularly in light of the unemployment that the policy is likely to induce.
This book dramatizes the magnitude of the challenge raised by the effort to transform these economies, but it falls short of providing the means. The transformation, if it is mismanaged, could easily lead to economic stagnation or, worse, collapse. The previous failure of reform in Hungary has clearly pushed Mr. Kornai in the direction of favoring a dramatic liberalization of the economy, what is sometimes called the ''big bang'' approach. An experiment with rapid liberalization is currently under way in Poland, but the outcome of the elections in Hungary suggests that the new Government in Budapest may follow a more gradual path.
We all have much to gain from the economic reform of Eastern Europe, as a successful transformation would promote the further development of stable democratic institutions and the full integration of these economies into the world economy. Help (and prayers) are in order. But, clearly, we should not expect miracles.

Illegal Alterations
 
Question: There are two apartments on the floor above me and it appears they are being converted to four units. Workmen are removing all the old plaster walls, the ceilings and the floor planks. Some of the work has resulted in large holes in my living room wall and damaged electrical and telephone wiring.
However, the work permit reads ''install bathrooms and replace kitchens.'' It seems to me this means renovation, not reconstruction. Doesn't the work being done have to be the same as described in the permit? Is there anything I can do if it is not? . . . E. K., Manhattan 
 
Answer: The answer to both questions is yes. According to Vahe Tiryakian, a spokesman for the Department of Buildings, work must conform exactly to the description in the permit. Moreover, the work you describe would also require an amendment to the building's Certificate of Occupancy to reflect the change in the number of units. If you believe that there is a violation of the law, you can contact the Building Department's complaint section (call 312-8530) and request that an inspector be sent. If violations are found, a stop-work order can be issued until the building is restored to its original condition or approved plans are filed that reflect the work being done.
 
Security Deposit
 
Question: I have been living in my rent-controlled apartment since 1937. My landlord has billed me for a security deposit. As far I know, my husband, now deceased, never made such a payment. Is my landlord entitled to collect a security deposit of one month's rent from me? . . . F. K., Manhattan
 
Answer: Probably not. According to Thomas R. Viola, a spokesman for the State Division of Housing and Community Renewal, if no security deposit was required in the past the landlord cannot demand one now. To collect one, the landlord would have to prove a deposit was required when occupancy started and you and your husband never complied with the requirement.
 
Repairs in a Co-op
 
Question: I have been a shareholder since 1981 in a co-op where I own two apartments. I do not live in the building but have rented the apartments. Whenever repairs were needed the superintendent took care of them and sent me the bill. It has been decided by the board that the superintendent no longer has the responsibility to do this and it is up to me to hire someone to do the work. Meantime, however, the superintendent will continue to take care of any problems in the sponsor's apartments. Is this double standard legal? . . . D. S., Queens
 
Answer: Maybe. When it comes to basic services - those that affect common areas and other apartments as well as your own - there can be no distinction between units owned by the sponsor, resident shareholders or nonresident shareholders. But according to Arthur Weinstein, a lawyer who is a vice president of the Council of New York Cooperatives, the distinction is that the work you described does not fall into the category of basic services provided under the terms of the proprietary lease.
Mr. Weinstein added that for practical reasons, the board can limit the amount of work the superintendent and the other building employees do under private arrangement, like changing fixtures or doing paint jobs.
''This is a close call,'' he said. ''But it seems to me that the corporation can set reasonable employment guidelines for staff concerning outside jobs. Permitting the superintendent to have one outside employer - in this case the sponsor, whose apartments are almost always rented out - may not constitute discrimination against other shareholders. The test, under the business judgment rule, would be, what is in the best interest of the corporation.''

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: 179 West Street;
A Lonely Reminder of the Days of Waterfront Glory

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
For 20 years, the little building at 179 West Street, which went up in 1845 between Warren and Chambers Street, has been a lonely holdout on an urban-renewal site, bypassed by the growth around it. Now the city is trying to sell or lease the largely cleared four-block area for development. A community group, the TriBeCa Task Force, is calling for a park.
As both sides struggle, the four-story high, 23-foot-wide building with ragged sidewalls flanked by vacant lots remains as a reminder of a time when West Street was a center of international shipping. 
Maritime activity favored the East River in the 18th and early 19th centuries and by progressive filling the shoreline was expanded farther into the river. Shipping gradually extended around the Battery and the opening of the Erie Canal in 1825 brought a constant stream of barges down the Hudson.
The original Lower West Side shoreline ran along Greenwich Street, but by 1766 filling had extended it halfway to the present Washington Street. Additional expansion established the final waterfront along a new commercial boulevard - West Steet - in 1830.
Development was intermittent at first but boomed by the 1840's and 50's, ''the high noon of New York's maritime empire'' as Ellen Rosebrock said in her book ''South Street.'' International commerce and local passenger and freight service located on West Street.
In 1845, Edward G. Faile, a resident of the Bronx with a grocery business at 181 Front Street, put up buildings at 179 and 180 West. They were not fancy - plain brick with granite lintels, granite storefront framing and a modest cornice. Faile, whose name survived as a street in the Bronx, never actually made the move to the Hudson River, choosing to rent out his new buildings.
The first identified occupants of 179, in 1851, were Theron L. Carman and Cornelius T. Nostrand, grocers who may have specialized in provisioning ships or as wholesalers. They moved out by 1853 and later 19th-century occupants are unidentified, though a marginal view of about 1880 in Frederick Lightfoot's ''19th-Century New York'' shows the building with a large ''Provisions'' placard at the top and the customary shed roof extending over the sidewalk.
It also shows West Street choked with traffic. The new larger steamships favored the deep-water piers along the Hudson and West Street became New York's principal waterfront.
By the 1930's, West Street was a conundrum - ''the most valuable waterfront property in the world,'' according to the W.P.A. Guide to New York City, worth $470,000 an acre, but also a long stretch of ''cheap lunchrooms, tawdry saloons and waterfront haberdashers.''
In the 1930's, the Erie Cafeteria occupied the ground floor of 179 with the rest of the building used for storage. The restaurant was unoccupied for most of the 40's and McCluskey's Liquors took over the space around 1950 - their tiled ''McC'' remains as an entrance step.
An aerial view of the 40's shows 14 freighters moored along West Street south of Canal; a similar view in 1966 shows only one, and in the mid-60's New York City proposed an urban renewal project for much of this stretch. On the portion called Site 5B and 5C from Greenwich to West, Murray to Chambers, everything was condemned and demolished except for 179 West Street.
According to ''Holdouts,'' by Andrew Alpern and Seymour Durst, Mardig Kachian won the right to remain in 179 until redevelopment plans were firm. The project has been amended six times but nothing has been built except a public school at the northwest corner of Warren and Washington Streets in 1988.
Mr. Kachian, who owns a 24-unit apartment house at 7 Harrison Street, declined to be interviewed. But Roz Post, a spokesman for the city's Department of Housing Preservation and Development, said Mr. Kachian pays $160 a month for two floors in the building. For years, the giant, empty granite-framed doorway of 180 West Street, which somehow escaped demolition, rested against 179. But it has collapsed, leaving 179 alone on a barren landscape.
Although the city would like to sell or lease the site for office development, the TriBeCa Task Force is maneuvering to get the land dedicated to recreation. Nancy Page, a co-chairman, said TriBeCa has only 2 percent of what the City Planning Commission says is the norm for such space. Meanwhile, the population of TriBeCa has gone from 382 in 1970 to 7,800 in 1990. Ms. Page projects that school enrollment this fall will be four times that of 1985.
The task force has called for ballfields, basketball courts and related facilities on the site but has taken no position on 179 West Street. So far, the little brick building has survived on uncertainty and this latest skirmish will only extend its startling presence.

HEADLINE: New Rules Tighten Mortgage Process

BYLINE: By IVER PETERSON

 BODY:
Shaky real estate values and tougher Federal banking rules are causing mortgage lenders to take a much harder look at loan applications than they once did.
In most cases, the tougher standards for writing mortgages will mean nothing more than a few extra days' wait for mortgage approval, or a requirement for a letter confirming employment instead of a pay stub as proof.
But buyers who were counting on low teaser rates on an adjustable-rate mortgage, or mortgages that let borrowers pile part of the interest charges onto the debt, or whose work does not provide a clear earnings record may find that mortgages that used to be easy to get are becoming hard to find.
''The feedback I am getting from my correspondents out there shows that, yes, there is a tightening up,'' said Brian Bragg, editor of U.S. Housing Markets, a research newsletter published in Detroit by Lomas Mortgage USA of Dallas. ''Banks are taking much more time to confirm sources of income, sources of down payment, making it difficult to slip through a poor quality loan.'' 
Paul Havemann, a partner in HSH Associates, mortgage analysts in Butler, N.J., seconded this view.
''The plain vanilla borrowers probably won't notice the difference except that the bank may squint a little harder,'' he said. ''The one who will be affected is the guy who wants to buy that third house using lots of creative financing, who wants to take back a second mortgage and borrow the down payment from grandpa. That's not going to fly anymore.''
The villain in tighter mortgage rules, Mr. Havemann said, is the soft real estate market.
''It's a complete reversal from before,'' he said. ''It used to be that high appreciation would bail out the imprudent borrower. If he got into trouble with one of these new, creative mortgages, he would just unload the property and the worst that could happen was that he broke even. Now it's just the reverse.''
Most of the tightening of lending standards was introduced several years ago by the country's two big secondary mortgage marketers, the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation, or Freddie Mac, and the Federal National Mortgage Association, or Fannie Mae.
Where the tightening has been perceived more recently, some bankers say, is from portfolio lenders, banks that keep their mortgages as assets instead of selling them, and who are trimming their practices to match the big banks' practices, as well as new capital requirements of Federal banking law. ''A lot of lenders, such as ourselves, go by standards that are pretty much nationwide in scope,'' said Walter Henderson, first vice president of Mechanics and Merchants Bank in Bridgeport, Conn. ''Lenders who have always followed those standards are considered possibly a little harder to deal with because of those standards, and I think that the rest of the market that has not in the past followed those guidelines are now being seen as tightening up.''
Ellen Feldschreiber, president of Manhattan Mortgage Company, a mortgage broker active in the city's expensive co-op market, agreed.
''Lenders are looking very carefully at approvals, particularly in a marketplace where there is a concern about values,'' she said. ''Something that may have had a certain value 12 months ago may not be worth as much now. If you're buying a co-op or a condo, banks are also looking more carefully at the solvency of the project itself, particularly at how many units are unsold or retained by the sponsor.''
The unsettled housing market has sometimes left bankers and borrowers so far apart that they don't even agree on the value of a property, some bankers said, with the result that bankers refuse mortgages on properties they think the buyers had paid too much for.
The problem has abated, they said, as an appreciation of the stagnation and even slump in the real estate market settles in to the public consciousness, with sellers no longer insisting on unrealistically high valuations for their properties, and buyers more inclined to bargain prices down to a level the banks consider safe.
''The market is depreciating, and offering prices are more likely to reflect this than before,'' said Mr. Henderson of Mechanics and Merchants Bank. ''So appraised values and offering prices are both becoming more in sync now than they were six or eight months ago.''
Problems with differing views of appraisals have sometimes extended to relations between banks and the secondary mortgage market. About a year ago Fannie Mae sent a stern warning to all of its lender banks against trying to protect local market values, and therefore the value of the bank's loan portfolio, by pressing appraisers to give higher appraisals on properties that have lost value.
''Recently we have been advised that some lenders have given appraisers the impression that future assignments might not be forthcoming unless the appraiser removed or changed information in the appraisal report that might be considered detrimental to a specific property or its neighborhood,'' the memo said. ''Such attempts to unduly influence the appraiser are clearly unacceptable.''
Besides the long-term problems of the savings and loan bailouts and tightening Federal regulation of the thrift industry, mortgage lenders are contending with a sudden upturn in the overdue mortgage payment rate. After declining steadily for several years during the market boom, the Mortgage Bankers Association of America reported a sudden increase in the number of borrowers who are more than a month behind on their mortgages, from 4.53 percent in the second quarter of last year to 5.05 percent for the third and fourth quarters. This year's first quarter rate has not yet been calculated.
The sharpest increases in delinquency are in the adjustable-rate mortgages, Mr. Havemann said, which comes as no surprise to Richard Peach, an economist with the Mortgage Bankers Assocation.
Research shows that the amount of equity an owner has in a property is probably the most important factor in explaining defaults, Mr. Peach said. Defaults are more likely when falling prices leave owners with little or no equity in the house, he said.
One of the little-known features of adjustable rate mortgages, Mr. Havemann said, is the widespread provision that removes all caps on increases in monthly payments if the value of the property falls below a certain point, usually 25 percent less than the mortgage balance.
In Dallas, Denver and Oklahoma City, where depressed energy prices pushed housing values down sharply a few years ago, resale prices of many condominium apartments fell to half or less of their original values. Mortgage holders, seeking to protect their collateral, often demanded payments to cover the lost value, just as a stock broker will demand cash to cover the margin of a stock bought on credit.
''Adjustable-rate mortgages were once hailed as the savior of the thrift industry,'' Mr. Havemann said. By tying interest rates to an index of money costs, they were intended to make it possible for thrifts and other home-mortgage lenders to charge enough for mortgages to remain competitive for deposits.
But what the so-called ARMs gave the banks in flexible income, they took away in safety. ''They are getting harder to get than they used to be,'' Mr. Havemann went on. ''You would be lucky to get one with 15 percent down any more, because their default rate is higher than on fixed rates, and in these days of declining real estate values and rising interest rates, the banks are insisting that you put in more equity.''
Fannie Mae now refuses to buy adjustable rate mortgages whose borrowers were not shown to be financially qualified in the second year of the mortgage, when the teaser rate is phased out and the actual rates begin to apply.
Negative amortization mortgages, in which part of the interest is piled on to the mortgage principal, have also become rare.
The giant mortgage buying agency also takes a hard look at mortgages on property that was sold with builder give-backs and buy-downs, such as a $5,000 rebate on closing or offers to pay mortgage origination fees.
''Instead of reducing sale prices, sellers sometimes like to use gimmicks like buydowns on interest rates or rebates on the house,'' said Robert J. Engelstad, senior vice president for mortgage and lender standards at Fannie Mae.
''It concerns us because we will only put a mortgage on a house that has a loan-to-value ratio that is real, and if a builder is selling a house for $100,000 but putting in $5,000 worth of concessions, we think that house is worth $95,000, not $100,000.''
Freddie Mac, meanwhile, is also serving notice of stiffer standards in its dealings with banks that originate mortgages, beginning last year with a new set of rules for lenders to make sure borrowers can meet their payments, and the mortgaged properties provide sufficient collateral to make the loan safe.
James E. Crum, director of customer administration for the North Central Region, said in a recent report that 17 percent of the mortgages Freddie Mac rejects for the secondary market are on properties where the sale was made with too small a down payment; 15 percent of the rejects failed to establish comparable value of the property; 15 percent involve borrowers having too much debt to safely carry the mortgage and nine percent involve unverifiable borrower assets.
Above all, Mr. Crum wrote, lenders should be able to defend the value of the loans they offer for sale.
''The point is that our ability to understand why the lender believes a loan is good quality is critical to a decision about the investment quality of the loan,'' he said.
Mr. Crum noted that the documentation for a loan takes on special importance these days, and Mr. Engelstad of Fannie Mae said he shares this view.
During the boom years, Mr. Engelstad said, many lenders developed low-documentation loans, no-documentation loans and time-saver loans as marketing tools in a competitive market. A low-documentation loan may mean only that last year's W-2 income report is accepted as proof of employment, instead of the traditional letter from an employer, a request that may take weeks to be filled.
A tightening up on documentation is not the same as a tightening of credit standards, Mr. Engelstad emphasized. The credit standards - down payment requiremnnts, debt limits and so on - are the same, but banks will demand more documentation to prove employment, the source of the down payment, and income, he said.
But bankers and analysts alike come back to the theme that, despite the tougher scrutiny that prospective borrowers may be subjected to, money for mortgages is still readily available.
''I haven't picked up any feeling that the solid-credit people are being turned down,'' said Mr. Bragg of U.S. Housing Markets.
''The money is there as long as the lender is satisfied that the quality of the loan is going to be high. The banks are just making damn sure that the credit worthiness is there.''
Ms. Feldschreiber of Manhattan Mortgage Company added that mortgage banks still have their own priorities, their own personalities and their own marketing agendas, and that customers should not assume that, because one bank makes impossible demands for proof on this or that detail, another bank won't let the mortgage application sail through.
''I think there is a perception out there that the banks have tightened up much more than they really have,'' she said. ''When you talk about the S & L crisis what you're generally talking about are the big construction loans that got into trouble, not the invividual mortgage. So you may find a bank that wants to increase the amount people have to put down on a house, that doesn't mean you couldn't find another bank that will write a mortgage for 95 percent. They're all different.''

HEADLINE: A New Hand at the Tiller for Landmarks

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
Although much of her preservation work has been done building by building, Laurie Beckelman hopes to bring a wider perspective - that of whole neighborhoods - to her new job as chairwoman of the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission.
''I want to look at areas that have been ignored in the past,'' said Ms. Beckelman, who came to her civic post from the private New York Landmarks Conservancy. She means areas like Harlem, the Bedford-Stuyvesant section of Brooklyn and Jackson Heights, Queens, which will soon be considered by the commission.
Ms. Beckelman, who is 39 years old and lives on the Upper West Side, was hired by the Municipal Art Society in 1973, not long after graduating from Boston University. 
From 1981 until last month, she was executive director of the conservancy, whose purpose is to protect, preserve and revitalize significant historic properties. Her predecessor in that job, Susan Henshaw Jones, is returning as executive director.
As the seventh person to head the 25-year-old landmarks panel, Ms. Beckelman will preside during a critical period, as designations come under the scrutiny of the City Council for the first time and as a number of religious organizations press their constitutional challenge to the landmarks law.
Another critical development will be the commission's growing regulatory role at a time of shrinking municipal spending. Critics of the commission have long complained about procedures that they see as complicated, time-consuming, arbitrary and hostile to economic concerns.
The commission itself will be undergoing significant change. All the current members are serving beyond the expiration of their terms, as they may do until reappointed or replaced. Some are expected to be retained, said Ms. Beckelman, because ''it's important to keep the continuity and the institutional memory.''
But, she added, Mayor David N. Dinkins ''would like to see a mosaic on the commission'' and will probably have appointed an entirely new majority on the 11-member panel by year's end.
Ms. Beckelman, who is at once soft-spoken but forceful in articulating her views, clearly has her own mission: the city's neighborhoods.
''Harlem is a main priority of mine,'' she said, as ''one of the most lush areas for revitalization.'' Indeed, Ms. Beckelman is currently renovating a brownstone on West 146th Street, to be sold as a condominium.
Although there are small historic districts in Harlem, she said, there are ''rows and rows'' of undesignated homes and other properties that are eligible for landmark status. If designated, they might benefit from low-interest loans, rehabilitation grants or even money from the state's Environmental Quality Bond Act.
Asked whether neighborhood emphasis implied a maintenance of existing scale, as opposed to the greater density at which developers would prefer to build, Ms. Beckelman answered, ''If we are talking about compatibility, we're not talking about out-of-scale design.''
''The Upper West Side, now that it's designated, should have more contextual, compatible zoning,'' she continued. ''I think people have had enough of the extremes in development and that a sense of coherence is really important. You have more and more developers wanting to invest and develop in historic neighborhoods because you have a coherent volume.''
Her call for complementary zoning presumes a link between the landmarks panel and City Planning Commission that has not been much in evidence in recent years, with the exception of the Upper East Side Historic District. She said she is committed to a ''very serious ongoing dialogue'' with city planners.
Besides the sweeping themes, Ms. Beckelman will have to deal with a number of specific issues, among them the fact that this is a time of bare-bones municipal budgets.
There is, for example, only one person on the staff to monitor work that is done on designated buildings without the commission's approval. ''I mean to be extremely tough on people who are creating violations,'' she said. ''But how can I be when I don't have the manpower to enforce the landmarks law?''
The law will face a critical legal test during Ms. Beckelman's term: a constitutional challenge by St. Bartholomew's Episcopal Church on Park Avenue, whose effort to replace its Community House with an office tower has been blocked by the city.
A number of religious leaders, organizations and congregations have attacked the landmarks law, saying that it forces them to place the maintenance of physical properties ahead of their mission, diverting scarce dollars from social and spiritual programs.
With the St. Batholomew's case pending in Federal appeals court, Ms. Beckelman declined to comment specifically. Speaking generally, however, she said:
''I don't believe the argument that 'we're being forced to maintain our buildings before we minister to our constituents.' If these buildings had been maintained properly over the years - I'm not putting the blame on anyone - and you started from the beginning, you could phase anything in and meet those goals and not have ongoing disasters.''
Ms. Beckelman is also inheriting the case of the 78-year-old Audubon Theater and Ballroom, between 165th and 166th Streets, across from the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center, where Malcolm X was assassinated in 1965.
Columbia University seeks to replace the theater with a biomedical research building, but there is a growing movement to preserve the Audubon as an architectural and cultural landmark, and as a memorial to Malcolm X. Although the commission passed up the chance years ago to designate the theater, Ms. Beckelman said, ''I want to see if there's some way that the Audubon building can be incorporated into the new structure.''
Another pending issue is a personal one, involving Ms. Beckelman's three-story brownstone in Harlem, at 425 West 146th Street, which she has been converting into a condominium. The building is not a landmark.
She said it was almost completed. However, she may have to sell the building earlier than planned, if her continued ownership is deemed to pose an ethical conflict by the city's Conflicts of Interest Board. An opinion is pending.
''I don't want to be an absentee landlord,'' Ms. Beckelman said. ''I've always been interested in preservation development and I thought this would be a wonderful way to sink my teeth into something. I'm really proud of the work that we're doing.''

HEADLINE: The Other Side Of Welfare Debate

 BODY:
It is entirely appropriate that Ruth Brandwein, Suffolk's Commissioner of Social Services, should express her concern for all those receiving welfare benefits on Long Island and to explain the reasons, in her opinion, for their inability to leave the welfare role. (''Freedom From Welfare, the Best Hope Yet,'' Opinion, April 29).
But let's look at the other side of the coin and the case of the alleged ''affluent'' citizens on Long Island. Yes, many were born to affluency and since this is not a socialist country, they are entirely entitled to their plateau in society as a result of their noble birth. 
There are many others, however, who drive beautiful cars, own typically ''middle class'' homes with well-manicured lawns, who vacation, who pay for their children's educations and who have obviously captured a fair share of the American Dream entirely under their own steam with no assistance from any agency whatsover! How did they earn their share? The key word is ''earn.'' Many were born of immigrant parents and grandparents who had high ideals and strict work ethics, who often worked 12 to 16 hours a day to feed their families. But families also supported each other. Child care existed in the form of grandparents and relatives caring for children to enable their parents to earn a living and to live in dignity without financial assistance.
And many migrated to Long Island from the boroughs of New York City, where they had used subways and other forms of public transportation to reach whatever jobs were available. They were familiar with the indignity of being subjected to steamy hours spent on poorly ventilated subways that often broke down for hours in dark, airless, poorly lit tunnels.
But they were undaunted and persisted with their goals, which sometimes required working at two and three jobs. A large number of these emigres still travel back to the city from ''bucolic,'' affluent Long Island, either spending four hours daily on the Long Island Railroad or hours trapped in traffic jams on overcrowded Long Island highways.
Due to the recent downturn in the Long Island economy and increases in taxes, many are facing the loss of homes and jobs. Senior citizens who contributed a wealth of benefits to society are also suffering as a result of increased taxation on homes which they are desperately trying to maintain on fixed incomes.
Should they be subjected to paying taxes for those who are receiving welfare assistance but who look at public transportation as too arduous?
Should these citizens be taxed to provide case management for those who are already receiving public assistance but who cannot or will not look to family members or friends for support in the area of child care, who refuse to travel to provide that care and who need the government to give them direction?
Should those who are earning minimal salaries and paying huge sums in annual health care benefits be taxed additionally to provide these benefits for those who cannot or will not find meaningful employment?
Should we, who are enjoying middle-class affluence, pay taxes to guide others through the ''rough'' times when we have spent a lifetime of coping with these ''rough'' times and building our own self-esteem through hard work and endurance?
And should we be paying taxes to cover the cost of additional case workers in the Department of Social Services when Suffolk County government is looking to lay off workers while encouraging others to retire early to reduce the cost of running the government and decrease the burden of taxes for those who are striving to maintain what they have righfully earned?
The answers to creating a society free from homelessness, poverty and those who would surely perish without financial assistance from the government are not simplistic. In this age of technological miracles and the bounty that many Americans enjoy, it seems quite ironic for severe poverty to co-exist with apparent affluency. But let's not create yet another generation fraught with hopelessness and dependency.
Let's restore spirit and self-esteem. A step in the right direction, might be to supply crash courses (along with temporary assistance) in techniques of coping, how to work hard to succeed despite drawbacks and how to be proud of what is ''earned'' rather than look for what can be gained through government assistance.
We, the people, are the government. And we pay for whatever is granted in financial assistance. Let us try to instill motivation such as that which built our great country, so that each of us is responsible for our own destiny.

HEADLINE: Handling Growth In Somerset County

 BODY:
The fine article ''In Morris County, a Changing Outlook on Development'' (April 15) summarized the impact of growth and increased employment opportunities on one central New Jersey county. Somerset County was noted as having enjoyed the same kind of economic growth and prosperity in recent years.
I am quick to point out, however, that Somerset County and many of the major employers here are aware of the impact that rapid population growth, industrial and business expansion and new housing development can have on the region. And we are proud of the fact that those of us in Somerset County have already taken the initiative to deal with the more obvious problems of traffic congestion, the lack of affordable housing, the need for family care and the importance of economically viable town centers. 
The Somerset Alliance for the Future is a coalition of corporate representatives, municipal and state officials and nonprofit corporation executives who believe in the need for pooling resources and cooperative action to protect, enhance and develop portions of Somerset County. It is the product of a year of research. We have made a $1 million three-year commitment to deal with the key issues at the regional level.
As the impact of growth and business expansion in beautiful central New Jersey is monitored,I want people to know that one county is not standing by while both the physical and economic environment disintegrate from problems associated with growth and development. We believe that the kind of strong partnership that the alliance represents at both the daily working level and the public and private executive level is the key to planning and organizing for an ideal future.
While maintaining the quality of life style we enjoy in Somerset County, we plan to have a solid base of employment, attractive and profitable town centers, accessible open space and a large stock of affordable housing. We may even be able to expand and enhance family care environment and favorably affect traffic congestion. This is what we have to do for the future generations of Somerset County residents and employees.

HEADLINE: HOME CLINIC;
How to Repoint Brickwork

BYLINE: By JOHN WARDE

 BODY:
MORTAR joints in brickwork require yearly inspection. Cracked, loose and crumbling joints should be restored whenever discovered, else moisture can seep between bricks and cause damage.
The process of restoring mortar joints is called repointing or tuck pointing. It consists of chiseling away most of the old mortar from deteriorating joints and replacing it with new material. 
Because mortar is easiest to work with and cures best when the temperature is between 50 and 80, late spring or early summer is a good time for major repointing projects, especially those involving outdoor construction.
Repointing only a few joints usually can be done by using improvised tools: an ordinary cold chisel no wider than the joints, a heavy ball peen or small sledge hammer for striking the chisel, a gardener's trowel for mixing and applying fresh mortar and an old kitchen spoon for smoothing the restored joints.
For large jobs, use plugging and cape chisels instead of a cold chisel, plus proper masonry tools described herein. All are available at hardware and masonry supply stores.
Whether using improvised tools or not, wear goggles for protection against brick and mortar particles and heavy work gloves to ward off errant hammer blows. Never use a carpenter's claw hammer for striking a metal chisel; the head of the hammer may chip or shatter, sending out metal splinters.
Repoint areas of about three to five feet square at a time. Use the plugging chisel, which has a thin blade trimmed at an angle across the end, for loosening the mortar, and the cape chisel, which has a thicker blade that tapers to a point in the center, for digging the loosened mortar out of the joints.
Cut a square-sided groove (not V-shaped) about three-quarters of an inch deep between the bricks, and expose bare brick on at least one side of each joint. After chiseling, either brush the joints free of dust with a whisk broom or a wide, thin brush with coarse bristles, or wash the joints clean with hard spray from a garden hose.
Next, apply new mortar. Dry mortar that requires only adding water is available in bags ranging from 5 to 80 pounds; this is the easiest type to use. An 80-pound bag is sufficent for repointing more than 100 bricks.
For larger jobs, mixing your own mortar from separate ingredients is usually more economical. Conventional proportions for mortar are one part Portland cement, one part hydrated lime and six parts sand, or one part masonry cement and three parts sand. Specify clean masonry sand.
Before repointing brick that is more than 100 years old, consult an experienced mason. Modern mortar mixed in conventional proportions is often harder than old brick and can cause it to crack or flake.
To mix mortar, use a coffee can or marked bucket for measuring the ingredients. Mortar becomes too hard to use after two hours, and so mix only small batches at a time.
Place the dry ingredients in a wheelbarrow. Mix them thoroughly with a large mason's trowel, then add small amounts of clear water and continue mixing until the mortar forms peaks that hold their shape when the mortar is spread upward with the trowel.
Some masons advocate first adding only enough water to make a stiff ball of mortar, then waiting about 20 minutes before adding more. This process, called rehydration, may reduce the tendency of the existing mortar to draw moisture away from the new mortar, which weakens it.
To fill the joints, you sometimes will need a small mason's trowel called a pointing trowel. First, wet the joints with fine spray from a garden hose, dampening them thoroughly but not soaking them. Then scoop up mortar on the back of the large trowel and hold it against the wall as a palette and to catch excess mortar falling from the joints as they are filled.
Use the back of the pointing trowel to pick up mortar from the large trowel and press it tightly into the brickwork's vertical joints. After filling these, use the same technique to fill the horizontal joints.
However, because the horizontal joints are longer, it is often easier to repoint them by using a long, narrow tool called a margin trowel than by using the pointing trowel.
After about an hour, when the mortar has stiffened enough to retain a thumb print, scrape off excess amounts with a mason's trowel and finish the joints by smoothing and compressing them with a tool called a jointer.
Smooth the vertical joints first, then the horizontals. If possible, duplicate the shape of the surrounding joints. But keep in mind that joints with concave surfaces shed water best and are easiest to make. After smoothing, move on to the next section. Keep repointed joints damp by spraying them often until the mortar cures fully, usually in about four days. After 24 hours, excess mortar particles can be swept from the edges of the smoothed joints with a whisk broom. Large pieces should be left to harden completely, then knocked off by striking them with the edge of the large mason's trowel.
Stains left by mortar can sometimes be removed simply by scrubbing the brick with a stiff bristle brush after the mortar has hardened. If that does not work, wash the wall with a mild solution of muriatic acid, which is available at building supply stores and home centers.
Follow the printed precautions on the container for using the acid. Afterward, wash the brick thoroughly with clear water.

HEADLINE: Community Hospitals Adapt to Changes

BYLINE: By JUDY GLASS

 BODY:
ON a stroll through the corridors of any one of Long Island's community hospitals 30 years ago, a visitor might have seen heart attack victims in their third week of recuperation, a new mother taking her first halting steps days after her baby's birth and a few affluent members of the community on a kind of rest and rehabilitation program, compliments of good insurance coverage.
As for the most advanced technology, it might well have been the X-ray equipment.
Not so today. Heart-attack victims usually spend 8 to 10 days in a hospital, mothers and babies about three days, hospital beds have few ''exhausted'' patients and community hospitals own or have ready access to CAT scanners and nuclear-magnetic imaging machines and other advanced equipment.
The changes in Long Island's community hospitals reflect not only the growth and changes in the population, but also the demand for expensive technology and a shift to shorter stays, mandated by state regulations, medical advances and reimbursement policies. 
 
Two Major Impacts
Ambulatory care - one-day outpatient treatment - is often completed in less time than it takes to visit the local beauty salon. It is faster and easier for a wide variety of simple surgeries and outpatient procedures. Pre-admission workups, once done as part of the entire overnight admission, are now done on an outpatient basis as well.
However, hospitals lose the revenue from the ''hotel'' portion of the cost, the room and ancillary services that these patients would have needed in the past, and this puts a strain on the community hospital budgets.
Community hospitals, which years ago cared for almost everyone in the neighborhood, now compete for patients with free-standing clinics, clinics in doctors' offices and teaching hospitals with the most sophisticated care.
Emergency rooms, which are seeing far more gunshot wounds, drug overdoses and traumatic injuries from accidents and violence than a generation ago, often admit patients to beds that were scheduled for elective surgery.
Patients who do not have a physician of their own also use the emergency room for ailments like a virus, a stomach ache or a minor injury. And rather than put off a long-awaited elective procedure, doctors often have their insured patients admitted through the emergency room, one hospital administrator said.
Two other factors - an increase in the number of elderly people and the AIDS epidemic - have also had a major impact on how community hospitals provide care and handle priorities.
 
New Services Introduced
Long Island has the fastest-growing number of aged people in New York State and more people with AIDS than any other suburban area in the country, according to the Nassau-Suffolk Hospital Council, an advocacy and purchasing group for the island's 22 nonprofit hospitals.
On the other hand, to be economically viable and provide modern care, community hospitals have introduced a variety of new services. South Side Hospital now offers an out-patient procedure called Easy Street, a physical rehabilitation center; diet centers, pre-natal clinics and psychological counseling care.
Easy Street is a physical rehabilitation center that trains people to lift and carry properly, and helps people learn how to readjust to the physical demands of everyday living following surgery.
It contains simulated settings of a Waldbaum's supermarket, one of the sponsors, and a bank, as well as an automobile and a separate room of exercise equipment.
''A community hospital is a not-for-profit, voluntary hospital governed by a volunteer board of directors,'' said Ann Marie Brown, vice president of the Hospital Council.
Collectively, she said, Long Island's community hospitals serve 2.7 million people with 6,500 beds.
Community hospitals come in many sizes and architectural designs, and some operate nursing homes as part of their complexes. They include Good Samaritan Hospital in West Islip, Central Suffolk Hospital in Riverhead, Franklin Hospital Medical Center in Valley Stream, Long Beach Memorial in Long Beach and North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset.
''Demographics make a big difference in a hospital's ability to operate successfully,'' said Theodore A. Jospe, president of South Side Hospital in Bay Shore, which serves Bay Shore, Brentwood, Central Islip, Brightwaters, Sayville and Oakdale.
This is a catchment area of about 10 miles with some of the ''toughest problems facing hospitals,'' said Ms. Brown. These include an overburdened emergency room, a high number of uninsured patients, and competition from other institutions.
 
Payer Determines Price
''We're expected to operate a hospital like a business,'' Mr. Jospe said, ''but in no other business does the payer determine the price rather than the provider. Prices should reflect cost, just as they do in the automobile business.
''The difference is that if you can't afford increased prices, you can buy a used car, but you can't buy used health care. The cost of doing business in hospitals these days far outstrips revenues.''
He indicated that the hospital stays of the seriously ill, the comatose and premature babies can be prolonged with the use of new but often expensive technology. Hospitals have little control over the use of high-priced drugs and devices, if their doctors want them, he noted.
 
Nursing Home Beds Needed
The elderly often occupy hospital beds when the care they require is custodial, which can be provided in nursing homes. Long Island currently has a shortage of 3,000 nursing home beds, according to the Nassau-Suffolk Health Systems Agency Inc., which approves plans for the Island's hospitals, nursing homes, substance-abuse centers and other health-care facilities.
In years past, patients with insurance subsidized patients with no insurance, Ms. Brown said. Virtually all treatment was delivered to inpatients, and the length of the patient's stay was determined solely by the doctor in charge.
In 1986, largely to combat rising medical costs, the state began using the Diagnostic Related Group method to pay hospitals.
Payment is based on a complicated formula that takes into account the type of procedure, the expected time for recovery, the region in which the care is delivered and a hospital's past financial record.
 
Intent of the System
The system was designed to save money, but there are many costs other than patient care - like malpractice insurance - that community hospitals must meet whether beds are empty or full, Mr. Jospe said.
Eastern Long Island Hospital on the North Fork and Southampton Hospital on the South Fork, for example, may fill up in the summer months. But they accommodate far fewer patients in the winter, and remain costly to run, Ms. Brown said.
In general, Long Island hospitals are more in demand than hospitals in other parts of the state, running about 85 to 90 percent occupancy, with some units unable to handle the demand, said Marvin H. Burton, executive director of the Health Systems Agency.
Occupied beds, however, do not always produce revenue. More than 250,000 Long Islanders have no insurance or are under-insured and too poor to pay medical bills, Mr. Burton said.
There is a medical consensus that people lacking adequate medical insurance do not go to the doctor as frequently as they should; when they are first admitted to the hospital, usually through the emergency room, they are often sicker than they would have been had they received earlier care, Mr. Jospe said.
Paradoxically, the cost of services that a hospital bills an uninsured patient is higher than what it receives for the same service from third-party payers like Blue Cross, which pays according to the Diagnostic Related Group method, Mr. Jospe said.
It takes more employees to run a hospital today, said J. Ronald Gaudreault, president of Huntington Hospital, who has hired 189 people in the last two years. He is not filling positions that are vacated because his budget, which showed a surplus of close to $1 million in 1988, is $2.5 million in the red this year. He cited too many regulations and not enough reimbursements as the cause of the deficit.
As a community hospital, Huntington Hospital has been in the same residential neighborhood since it was established in 1914. It has deep ties to its community and its activities are watched closely by neighbors, some of whom have opposed the hospital's expansion in the past.
 
Volunteers' Group Has Decreased
The hospital relies on Auxilians, a volunteers' group and candy-stripers for assistance but the number of Auxilians has declined from more than 1,000 members a few years ago to 450, as women have opted for paid jobs. However, the Auxilians continue to provide thousands of hours of service and have donated $170,000 from its annual geranium sale and other fund-raisers.
Similar volunteer organizations exist in a number of community hospitals.
In recent years, however, larger, more-sophisticated public relations and fund-raising campaigns have become part of the agendas and budgets of most community hospitals.
For example, donations of $1 million to Huntington's capital campaign last year enabled the hospital to establish not only a 12-bed intensive-care unit but also a separate oncology unit so that cancer patients will not be scattered throughout the hospital.
The hospital, which had 300 beds and 1,000 employees when Mr. Gaudreault joined its administrative staff 25 years ago, now has 398 beds and 1,700 full-time employees.
In 1963, the hospital treated 32,000 patients, compared with 113,000, many of them ambulatory patients, out-patients or emergency room walk-ins, last year. ''But remember,'' Mr. Gaudreault said, ''the population of Huntington has increased from 160,000 to 210,000.''
To save money, hospitals like St. Charles and Mather Memorial, which are a mile apart in Port Jefferson, are sharing some services and keeping only one emergency room open, the one at Mather. Other hospitals have closed their pediatric units, which were once filled with children suffering from communicable diseases now controlled by antibiotics and immunization.
 
AIDS CASES INCREASING
''ALL of Long Island's community hospitals are going to have to become more involved with the AIDS epidemic if projections are correct,'' says Patricia Campagna, social services and housing coordinator for the Long Island Association for AIDS Care, which operates a hot line (516-AIDS) and offers the most-comprehensive agenda of services on the Island.
All of the Island's hospitals are currently handling some AIDS patients, but often with great reluctance, studies show. Whenever possible, some of the hospitals refer the patients to the three designated AIDS centers at Nassau County Medical Center in East Meadow, North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset and University Hospital in Stony Brook.
These centers have special sections for the care of AIDS patients, particularly those in the latter stages of the disease. So far, however, these centers have not been overwhelmed, Ms. Campagna said.
At present, there are believed to be 1,300 cases of fully identified AIDS cases on Long Island and at least 20,000 to 25,000 Long Islanders infected with the virus. It is projected that there will be at least 2,700 AIDS cases on the Island by next year.
According to the Federal Centers for Disease Control, Long Island not only has the largest number of AIDS patients of any suburban area in the country, but also the most people with the HIV infection. Nassau County is fifth in the nation in intravenous drug use, ''a prime way for people to get AIDS,'' Ms. Campagna said.
According to Carol Lindquist, a spokeswoman for the AIDS Care Association, ''Shooting steroids and sharing needles, a good-buddy, jock activity among body builders all over Long Island, can lead to AIDS among affluent young men and their female sex partners.''
Many AIDS cases may be unreported, specialists say, sometimes with the cooperation of a family physician, because of the stigma attached to the disease.
In some cases, patients who go to the hospital with AIDS-related illnesses are not aware that they are carrying the virus. In others, a doctor may treat the same patient a number of times without suspecting AIDS, and the patient is finally diagnosed elsewhere.
According to the AIDS Care Association, 70 percent of AIDS patients nationally are gay. On Long Island, it is 35 percent. Of the other 65 percent, 40 percent in each county are intravenous drug users and 2 percent in Nassau County and 4 percent in Suffolk County are children. Heterosexuals constitute 8 percent of the AIDS population in Nassau and 4 percent in Suffolk.
''The designated AIDS centers at present are better prepared to handle AIDS patients,'' Ms. Campagna said.
With extra reimbursement from the state, she said, they have been better able to train their staffs and equip their units.
With better medication and health management, Ms. Campagna said, AIDS patients are living longer and do not require as much hospitalization as they did in the early stages of the epidemic. However, the Nassau-Suffolk Health Systems Agency Inc. estimates that the average AIDS patient will spend 76 days in a hospital and will be admitted 3.4 times.
''Until our attitudes toward the disease become less prejudicial, community hospitals will probably set up separate units, as one has already done,'' Ms. Campagna said. ''But not every community hospital has enough AIDS patients to warrant a unit.''
The results of a study by the State Department of Health are expected to give Long Island hospitals and planners up-to-date information on how many AIDS patients are now in community hospitals.
''Community hospitals don't need special physicians or staffs, but there's a tremendous need to educate,'' said Renee Pekmezaris, Ph.D., Director of Health Care Research and Information Systems for the Nassau-Suffolk Health Systems Agency.
''Staff at the AIDS-designated centers were afraid until they were educated, but there's been a significant change.''

HEADLINE: If You're Thinking of Living in:;
Prospect Heights

BYLINE: By JERRY CHESLOW

 BODY:
Although it takes in less than a quarter of a square mile, Prospect Heights in Brooklyn is a microcosm of New York City's housing situation.
It is graced with richly crafted turn-of-the-century brownstones and elegant 1920's apartment buildings. Its population is a rich mixture of all races and income groups. And it is now recovering from the turbulent 70's, when many buildings were either abandoned by landlords or burned out. This is leading to tension between developers and community groups.
Prospect Heights lies between Park Slope and Crown Heights. It is also surrounded by the finest cultural and recreational institutions in Brooklyn - the Brooklyn Museum, the main branch of the Brooklyn Public Library, the Botanic Garden, the Brooklyn Academy of Music and Prospect Park. 
''It's an area where you a have a mix of everything,'' said Lynn R. Yellin, a realtor with the William B. May Company, a Manhattan realty company with offices in Brooklyn. ''But it is not so homogenized that we are losing the cream. Every group expresses itself and you get the best of everything.''
Lincoln Place best reflects what is happening to Prospect Heights. Boarded up, burned-out structures that are defaced with graffiti stand alongside newly renovated apartment complexes with glass elevators and rooftop gardens.
Stephen B. Jacobs, a Manhattan architect who bought three boarded-up buildings on Lincoln Place between Washington and Underhill Avenues for $1.4 million in 1986, has since acquired three more. So far, four of the buildings have been converted to new one-, two- and three-bedroom simplex and duplex co-ops, selling for $84,500 to $225,000.
''I saw in Prospect Heights a development resource unmatched anywhere else in Brooklyn,'' said Mr. Jacobs. ''It is a logical extension of Park Slope. But the properties could be acquired at a much more favorable price.''
His buildings are drawing professionals to the mostly blue-collar neighborhood, leading to resentment from local groups.
''They are pushing up the prices of all of the housing in the area,'' said Haddie Bowers, chairwoman of the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Corporation, formed in 1980 to restore buildings and provide low- and moderate-income housing. ''The new people coming in are yuppies and dinks'' - double income, no kids. ''They are not the people who get involved in the neighborhood.''
She said poorer young families are being forced to double up with parents and grandparents, while housing in their neighborhood is being sold to outsiders.
Using contributions from the Brooklyn Union Gas Company, Ms. Bowers's organization has renovated four city-owned buildings, sold to them for $1 each. One has gone co-op, with apartments selling for up to $5,000 for a three-bedroom unit. A second building is going co-op. The two others are among the last rent-stabilized buildings in the neighborhood, with a total of 16 units, renting for from $226 for a studio to $500 for a three-bedroom.
Alphonso Wright, district manager of Community Board 8, which includes Prospect Heights, said city, state and Federal programs contributed $10.3 million since 1985 toward the renovation of 488 low- and moderate-income co-op and rental units. Private contractors have restored a fourth to a half of the neighborhood's 9,500 housing units, converting most to co-ops.
The most expensive building in Prospect Heights is Turner Towers on Eastern Parkway, just across from the Brooklyn Museum, which earlier this month announced the first phase of a $100 million renovation project. In 1978, Turner Towers was rundown and the landlord in arrears on his mortgage.
A tenants' association bought the building from Lincoln Savings in 1980 and turned it into a co-op. Since then the tenants, 85 percent of whom bought their apartments, have put more than $1 million into the building's renovation and plan to spend four times as much over the next five years.
Ms. Yellin, one of the initial buyers, paid $7,200 for her 1,800-square-foot, three-bedroom apartment and sold it in 1986 for $170,000. Today, 3 1/2-bedroom apartments can go for over $300,000.
One of the most controversial buildings is the old Public School 9, known locally as ''old nine.'' The 1895 structure was renovated last year by the Forest City-Ratner Companies, who turned it into 22 apartments, selling for $92,000 for a small one-bedroom to $504,000 for a 2,300-square-foot, three-bedroom. Although the building needed repairs when the developers took it over, it had been a city-owned community center controlled by the Prospect Heights Neighborhood Corporation.
Ms. Bowers sees the sale as a betrayal. ''We have no place to have those programs we were providing for our children and senior citizens,'' she says.
Borough President Howard Golden acknowledges that some displacement has taken place but maintains that his administration has kept this to a minimum. He said redevelopment was inevitable because the building of several large office complexes nearby is creating new jobs.
Eastern Parkway is now in the throes of a $59 million renovation -including new sewers, repaving, new benches and landscaping - that should drive up the prices of apartments even more.
Records in the Brooklyn Public Library indicate that the name Prospect Heights was in use in 1892. Patrick Smith, spokesman for the Borough President, said the area was part of a Revolutionary War neighborhood known as Crow Hill, because it was inhabited by freed slaves. Most of it is now Crown Heights.
A relative newcomer, Nanette Rainone moved to Prospect Heights from the Upper West Side in 1983. She lives in a condominium apartment house on Grand Army Plaza.
Ms. Rainone, who heads the Fund for the Borough of Brooklyn, an organization operating out of Mr. Golden's office to promote cultural interests, maintains that the neighborhood will never be totally gentrified. ''There is just too much long-term ownership of the brownstones for anyone to ever think that the area could pass from one racial group or one economic group to another,'' she said.
The four commercial streets - Underhill, Flatbush, Vanderbilt and Washington avenues - have few restaurants and many residents shop in neighboring Park Slope. Among places to eat are the New Prospect Cafe and the Garden Cafe, which have American menus, and Tom's Restaurant, a luncheonette, open from 6 A.M. to 4 P.M. The owner, Constantine Vlahavas, dismisses the talk of friction between newcomers and longtime residents.
''Since many of the new people are moving into formerly abandoned buildings, how could this be bad,'' he said.
Many Prospect Heights children attend P.S. 9 on Underhill Avenue and Prospect Heights High School on Classon Avenue at Union Street, neither of which has a good reputation in the community.
Jerry J. Cioffi, the high school principal, noted that a study last year indicated that his school had one one of the the worst dropout rates and reputations for violence in the state.
''The school is receiving a bad rap,'' Mr. Cioffi said. ''Since 1987, the dropout rate has declined from 12.5 to 9.7 percent. We were rated as the fifth most violent, and now we are the 12th.''
He said the school, whose 2,000 students represents 43 different nationalities, has not been renovated since it was built in 1929. ''How can you expect the kids to achieve when they have plaster falling down on their heads?''
He maintains, however, that the school is effective because 75 percent of the entering students are unable to read. By the time they graduate, he noted, 55 percent have passed the Regents examinations.
For intermediate school, students attend I.S. 210, I.S. 390 or I.S. 61K, all in Crown Heights.
One program that is helping the academic situation is the Science Skill Center, a city-financed after-school math and science program, teaching 100 minority students between 7 to 15 years old. According to the program's director, Michael A. Johnson, last year the center produced the youngest group of students ever to take the state Regents examination in biology. All of the 16 9- to 12-year-olds who took the exam passed.

By 1928, one tower, which was to accommodate a theater and a recreation center, and the stairwell were completed. The sanctuary was to be added later. But the Depression intervened and the Jewish community never met growth projections and plans for the second tower were dropped. So the theater, with its orchestra pit, was converted permanently to a sanctuary.

HEADLINE: Summer Outlook: Fewer Jobs, Fewer Youths

BYLINE: By LINDA SASLOW

 BODY:
SEASONAL jobs as lifeguards, park attendants, beachcombers and camp counselors have traditionally been held by Long Island's high school and college students and filled by Memorial Day, the holiday weekend that marks the beginning of summer.
But changing economics and demographics on the Island in recent years have affected the summer job market.
A decade ago, an excess of students looking for summer jobs spurred the use of lotteries to decide how to assign them. In contrast, during the last few summers there was such a shortage of applicants to fill the available positions that many employers were offering bonuses to attract workers.
 
Booming Economy Has Slowed
The outlook for this summer is somewhere in between, said James A. Larocca, president of the Long Island Association. The booming economy of the last few years has slowed, he said, but there remains a declining pool of youngsters to fill the jobs. The gap between jobs and candidates has narrowed, and this should be the trend for the next few summers, Mr. Larocca said. 
The number of students graduating from the Island's high schools continues to decline, said Arthur Kunz, director of the Long Island Regional Planning Board. In Nassau County, the population peaked in the late 60's, and for Suffolk it was the early 70's, he said. But while there are fewer youngsters, there are also fewer jobs available, he said.
''The Island's economy is a little gloomier this summer,'' Mr. Kunz said. ''Constraints on county governments will diminish the number of jobs available.
''Last year, we saw a good economy with fewer kids to fill the jobs. This year, there are still fewer kids but an economy that is not as red hot.''
The largest number of seasonal jobs are at Long Island's beaches, parks and other recreational facilitiies.
Nassau County employs about 1,000 seasonal workers - 900 of them in county parks and the other 100 in clerical positions - said George Sinnott, a county spokesman. Budget cuts have caused job cutbacks of about 10 percent since last year, and salaries have remained the same for the last two years, he said.
 
No Problem in Filling Jobs
But in spite of frozen salaries, there has not been a problem filling the county jobs, Mr. Sinnott said, adding:
''Ironically, we had more difficulty recruiting last summer than this year, but we're not sure why.''
Nassau County's Job Development Center provides approximately 1,000 jobs for high school and college students from middle- and low-income families, said James Rice, executive director of the county's Commission of Human Rights.
About 400 are employed to work in various county departments, and another 500 or so are placed in positions in the private sector. Jobs may be available at United Parcel, at one of the New York airports or at a McDonald's or Burger King, Mr. Rice said.
The only significant difficulty in recruiting summer employees has been felt by the county parks on the North Shore, Mr. Sinnott said, explaining:
''They are more well-to-do areas, and there are not as many kids around for the summer because many students travel or are away for the summer.''
Summer positions at South Shore beaches and parks within the Town of Oyster Bay also fill faster than those on the North Shore, said Doris Kirby, a town spokeswoman.
The town hires between 750 and 800 seasonal employees for its Departments of Parks and Public Works.
Jobs within the Parks Department include recreation aides, lifeguards, maintenance workers and positions in children's programs. Openings in the Public Works Department offer higher salaries for highway and sanitation workers and are filled first, Ms. Kirby said.
Jobs at the town parks were not filled last summer, she said, but this year there has been an increase in the number of applicants.
The Suffolk County Parks Department recruits 250 seasonal employees and several hundred more in its Labor Department, most of whom are students, said County Executive Patrick G. Halpin.
 
Competition Enters Picture
But as the county's population has gotten older and fewer high school and college students are available for summer jobs, county positions have had to compete with private companies that also recruit young employees, and starting salaries at county beaches and parks are now $5.50 an hour, Mr. Halpin said.
Over the last three years, there has been a 30 percent cut in seasonal jobs in proportion with budget cuts, said Brad O'Hearn, a Suffolk County spokesman. But even with the reduction in jobs, there still do not seem to be enough students to fill those available, he said.
''Everybody's looking for kids,'' Mr. O'Hearn said. ''There's been a tremendous explosion in service industries - from fast food to health clubs - and many more businesses are chasing far fewer kids.''
To fill in the gaps over the last few years, Suffolk County has also been hiring the elderly to work in the parks during the summers, Mr. Halpin said.
''It's been working out great,'' he said. ''We are able to match people with nearby parks so that they don't have to travel far distances. For many senior citizens, it's an opportunity to get out of the house and keep busy, and the jobs are a labor of love.''
Island-wide, the summer job that is experiencing the most difficulty in recruiting candidates seems to be lifeguard.
 
Lifeguarding Losing Its Appeal
Lifeguarding is not the sought-after glamorous job that it used to be, Mr. Halpin said. There formerly were many more applicants for lifeguard than positions, he said, but demographics have changed. Last year, there were only 40 lifeguards to fill 50 Suffolk County positions; to keep all areas protected, the county had to pay overtime.
To attract more lifeguards, the starting salary for Suffolk County lifeguards is now $6.75 for freshwater areas and $7.25 for saltwater beaches, rising to $10 an hour for a senior lifeguard with five years of experience.
Starting salary for Nassau County lifeguards is $5.75 an hour; according to Mr. Sinnott, most county lifeguard positions for this summer are filled.
But a shortage of lifeguards has also been the complaint of other municipalities. In the Town of Hempstead, most of the 1,500 summer jobs are already filled, except for lifeguards, whose starting salary is $6.25 an hour, said Mike McConnell, a spokesman.
The Town of Southampton also needs lifeguards, said Edith Valentino, a spokeswoman. Starting salary for first-year lifeguards is $7 an hour, and salaries have gone up significantly over the last few years to remain competitive with private industry, she said.
Many seasonal employees return yearly, and the town tries to hire residents first, Ms. Valentino said.
Although the beaches on the East End are not experiencing difficulty filling jobs of attendants, beachcombers and park laborers, private hotels, restaurants and other businesses need summer employees, Mr. Larocca said. Growing numbers of businesses in the Hamptons are hiring Irish students who are spending their summers on Long Island, he said.
 
400 Jobs in Long Beach
In Long Beach are more than 400 summer positions, including lifeguards, beachcombers, cashiers, gate attendants, camp counelors and sports instructors. To induce more students to fill the summer positions, the city has raised the salary to $4.50 an hour, offered flexible hours and provided free breakfast as a bonus, said City Manager Edwin Eaton.
''It may sound minor to provide rolls and soda,'' he said, ''but last year it cost us $5,000.
''A few years ago, we had terrible trouble filling the summer jobs. Only 40 kids applied for more than 100 positions. This year, there are more applicants, but still not enough students to fill the jobs.''
Any student who wants a job can get one, said Pat McCormick, director of the Long Beach Department of Youth and Family Services.
One service of the department is to help place youngsters in jobs, he said, adding that it might be working for the city at the beach; at McDonald's, which pays $6 an hour; at the baggage claim counters at Kennedy International Airport, which pays $9 an hour, or at Jones Beach, cleaning the beaches for $5 to $6 an hour with free transportation provided.
A separate Summer Youth Employment Program, financed by Federal money, also places youngsters from economically disadvantaged families in different positions within the city and private sector, Mr. McCormick said. There are 40 available positions this summer, and the salary is $4 an hour.
''The jobs are available, but many kids are unskilled and don't like the jobs that are available to them,'' Mr. McCormick said. ''They're looking for the easy way out. I hear, 'I don't want to clean beaches' or 'I don't want to work with little kids.'
''If delivering mail is easier than painting yellow lines on streets, they opt for the easy jobs. If there's an opening in Oceanside, the next town over, they say, 'How am I going to get to Oceanside?'
''But if there was a rock concert in Oceanside, they wouldn't think twice about how to get there.''

HEADLINE: MANAGING;
NURTURING THE NEXT WORK FORCE

BYLINE: By SANDRA SALMANS; Sandra Salmans, a former New York Times reporter, writes about business and education from Washington.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
Frank Stoler said he is using ''crackerjack'' computer programs written by students at H. D. Woodson High School in Washington. But Mr. Stoler, senior vice president for mortgage operations at the Federal National Home Mortgage Association, said the mentor program at Woodson, sponsored by his employer, provides something even more valuable to him.
''I do a lot of management by walking around,'' among the young people who work for him, he said. Being a mentor has helped him understand them better. ''I'm pushing 40, and this is a way for me to stay in touch,'' he said. 
The $1 million program, which Fannie Mae, the nation's largest home mortgage investor, introduced in 1988, brings personal and financial support to students at Woodson, an inner-city school with many low-income students. It is one of many programs nationwide that industry has initiated in recent years to help improve public schools and their students. Companies say that if they want to draw on a well-educated, highly skilled pool of workers, they will have to create it.
''Every business in Washington is going to need skilled workers,'' said David O. Maxwell, Fannie Mae's chief executive. ''We have to help produce them, and this is one way.''
Although Fannie Mae's program is not the country's largest or best endowed, its focus on smart and ambitious inner-city teen-agers shows how one company is trying to make a difference - and how the program has made a difference to the mentors, too.
''I'm getting a sense of accomplishment,'' said Henry Cooper, who does account reconciliation in Fannie Mae's operations department. ''And I feel my employer cares about the community.'' The program focuses on the most promising of Woodson's 1,200 students. Anyone who earns all A's and B's in a single semester is enrolled in the Futures 500 Club, a membership that brings a mentor, $500 each semester - deposited in an account earmarked for education - and the possibility of getting one of the 20 summer jobs that Fannie Mae opens for Woodson students.
Since the program began, the number of Woodson students qualifying for membership in the Futures 500 club has doubled, to about 130. There may be some grade inflation by teachers eager to help students, Lonnie Edmonson, an educator who runs the program for Fannie Mae, conceded. But, he said, ''if a C-plus becomes a B-minus, so what? It's another student in the pipeline.''
Although the summer jobs offered by Fannie Mae are fairly mundane - filing, inputting computer data - mornings are devoted to training and development courses.
The mentors' involvement ranges from playing basketball with students on Saturday mornings to helping students apply to college, and they typically do it on their own time. For some students, the most surprising thing about the program is the relationship they develop with their mentors.
Doresa McCombs, an 18-year-old senior, said her circle of friends now includes Carolyn Fitzgerald, who manages Fannie Mae's mortgaged-backed securities back office. ''Before I met her, I thought she would be a snob,'' says Doresa. ''But she's just like me.''
Ms. Fitzgerald and Doresa have conversations by telephone two or three times a week, and do things together. Until last year Doresa had never seen a play or been farther from Washington than neighboring Maryland. But since she entered the program, she has seen the Dance Theater of Harlem and has gone to Boston to visit the campus of Northeastern University, where she will enroll this fall to study engineering. Fannie Mae finances trips allowing seniors to scout colleges.
Besides the relationships with their proteges, mentors also develop relationships with each other. At monthly meetings Mr. Edmonson holds for mentors, ''employees come together in a unique way,'' said Lynn Williams, a secretary and a mentor. ''It's not, 'I'm a secretary, he's a vice president.' You're all mentors.''
 
AN OFFICE THAT 'BUMPS'
These are excerpts from the journal of LaShawn Dennis, an 18-year-old Woodson senior who is a member of the Futures 500 Club:
PUB-DATE: June 26, 1989.
The interns went into this very cold training room with a big round table and nice, comfortable chairs. I thought to myself, ''This is heaven.'' Right then and there, I felt like a businessperson.
Later my supervisor . . . introduced me to all the employees who were working in this section. My first reaction was, they don't like me. I was wrong. The people in the office seemed to be more excited that I was there than I was. I started to become less scared and, by the time I left, I was relaxed.
My office is (excuse the English) bumping. I have a desk, supplies and my own telephone. To top it all off, I have my own personal computer. I (excuse the language) was psyched. No one could tell me that I didn't look like a businessperson, because I looked like one in that office and also felt like one.

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
GORBACHEV ISSUES APPEAL FOR CALM AMID PANIC BUYING

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 27

 BODY:
Faced with deep popular anxiety over a Government proposal to more than double food prices, President Mikhail S. Gorbachev made a nationally televised appeal to Soviet citizens tonight to stay calm during a ''tense, difficult and frankly speaking, dangerous'' period.
Delivered two days before he leaves for a trip to Canada and the United States, Mr. Gorbachev's somber, unscheduled 45-minute address came after a weekend of panic buying in Moscow and other cities, where consumers reacted with alarm and distrust to the Government's move to what it calls a ''regulated market economy'' that starts July 1 with a tripling of bread prices. Other price increases are due to follow on Jan. 1.
The economic crisis was not the only problem facing Mr. Gorbachev. New violence broke out today in Armenia on the eve of mass celebrations scheduled for Armenian independence day. Six people were killed in a clash between Soviet troops and a crowd at a railroad station in Yerevan, the capital of Armenia. [Page 7.] 'Don't Succumb to Panic' 
On the economic situation, Mr. Gorbachev said: ''I ask you, dear comrades, don't succumb to panic, don't succumb to panic. Let us look at all this realistically and soberly and we will solve the problem.''
The new economic program, still under discussion in the Supreme Soviet, or Parliament, has been under attack from all sides since it was announced on Thursday. Liberal economists have criticized it as timid, while some politicians, including Mr. Gorbachev's rival Boris N. Yeltsin, have attacked its reliance on the highly unpopular price increases. In the Ukraine, miners have reacted by threatening to strike in protest.
The Soviet President tonight cast doubts on plans, announced last week by top Government officials, to hold a referendum on the economic package, which combines price rises with a compensating increase in salaries. He said the program would be open for ''broad discussion at work collectives and in local soviets,'' or councils. The results of such discussion should filter back to the Kremlin, he said.
Mr. Gorbachev, appealing tonight for a ''joint effort and mutual trust,'' said those who tried to make political gains during the country's current difficulties should be ''put in their place.''
''Of course, all types of ultimatums, incitement and irresponsible calls are impermissible,'' he said. ''This could simply ruin everything and cause irreversible harm.''
As Mr. Gorbachev's political and economic problems continue to mount, the summit meeting in Washington, which starts on Thursday, has receded into the background. Mr. Gorbachev made no reference tonight to the meeting with President Bush in his speech, which was devoted entirely to a stern lecture on the need for economic reform.
Until tonight, Mr. Gorbachev had kept his distance from the economic plan, which was presented by Prime Minister Nikolai I. Ryzhkov. Now, the President has put his own authority behind the measures, which he described as inevitable after earlier attempts at economic change failed to produce results.
''Everyone on the Presidential Council agreed that we cannot afford to go slow,'' he said. ''Despite all the difficulties of today's circumstances, we must nevertheless act: in the next few months or year or so, the situation will become more tense, difficult and frankly speaking, dangerous.''
 
Gorbachev Appears Tense
Mr. Gorbachev, who tonight appeared tense and whose speech was at time halting, faces a list of other problems demanding his attention before his departure for North America on Tuesday. Today, Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, a member of the Presidential Council and the Communist Party Politburo, said today on the NBC News program ''Meet the Press'' that he would be staying in Moscow during the summit talks, a departure from past procedure and a sign of the Kremlin's concern about the internal situation.
Politically, the most pressing question facing Mr. Gorbachev is the election of the next President of the Russian republic - a post for which the leading candidate has been Boris N. Yeltsin, a populist backed by a loose liberal coalition who has become Mr. Gorbachev's most visible opponent.
Mr. Yeltsin's chances for election in a third round of voting this week even edged out the food crisis as the leading topic of discussion on street corners and around kitchen tables this weekend. Many Soviet citizens see the coming summit conference as a necessary and welcome event but largely irrevelent to the main issues of the day.
 
Critical Situation at Home
Some Moscow residents suggested today that Mr. Gorbachev should stay home to take charge of the critical situation in the country. ''It is always better when the master is at home,'' said Lydia Ostanin, a 56-year-old construction worker.
But, she added, ''it is also important that he go to the United States, to learn how they do business there.''
Mr. Gorbachev's international stature is now something many people here take for granted. The issue for many people now is his authority at home.
''He should be more presidential,'' said Vladimir, a 50-year-old who declined to give his last name. ''Somebody needs to enforce the laws - not with repression like Stalin, but just make sure they are obeyed.''
''Now, we have everything coming together at once, economic and political,'' he said. ''All the politicians are in their seats all around the place - the Supreme Soviet, the City Council, the Russian Congress - and there is nothing in the shops. That is not right.''
Today, with most stores closed, the sense of anxiety about the food supplies seemed to ebb somewhat in Moscow. In the farmers' market, where the prices are well above the average family budgets, strawberries and cherries, priced at 15 rubles - $2.40 at the tourist exchange rate - for 2 pounds, drew no more customers than usual. Par for the Course? For some people out strolling through the city on a bright, windy day, this week's political and economic tensions are now par for the course. ''The situation is pretty normal,'' said Rushan, a 28-year-old bureaucrat who did not give his last name. ''There are just some problems with the food supply.''
On Monday, the city of Moscow imposes a new rule limiting purchases in most stores to city residents, a measure that has been greeted with relief by Muscovites who hope it will whittle a few hours off the time they stand in line to do their shopping.
But the new rule produced an outcry from officials in outlying regions, who accused Moscow of abusing its privileged position as the capital and the city's newly elected liberal government of going too far.
This new tension, pitting the city against the provinces, was added to the list of bad feelings that broke to the surface this week at the Congress of Deputies of the Russian republic.
As Sergei B. Stankevich, deputy chairman of Moscow's City Council, tried to explain to a restive and hostile group of provincial representatives, the emptying of the stores in recent days was not the city's doing. ''It is not possible to call this an act of provocation,'' he said.
The city has taken emergency measures to provide for some out-of-towners: Stores near train stations and airports will sell goods to nonresidents, and special provisions will be made for the capital's growing population of refugees.
 
Curb on Residents' Purchases
City residents will also find their purchases further limited - to about 2 pounds of meat a person, 1 pound of sausages, 10 1/2 ounces of butter and just over a pound of coffee.
But some people say they sense a quickening crisis, now spreading from the periphery to the center. In a line queueing up at a cashier's counter in downtown store yesterday, Sasha Pavlov, a resident of the textile city of Ivanovo, complained that he had not been allowed to buy anything on a recent trip to the republic of Latvia, while a neighbor, Georgi Dugaryan, said there was little to buy in Armenia because of a disruption of supplies from the neighboring republic of Azerbaijan.
''And now,'' Mr. Pavlov said, ''we can't get anything in Moscow either.''

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
A Summit Without Maps

BYLINE: By R W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
This week's summit conference between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, the first such meeting of the post-cold war era, promises to be different from any other.
Different, first of all, because the shape of the new Europe, not arms control agreements or ideological argument, will be its principal focus. That difference flows from others: for the first time, a Soviet leader approaches the bargaining table from a position of real weakness at home, with some Western analysts doubting his ability to last another year and others, more confident of his survival, doubtful about his long-term ability to lead. For the first time as well, the two superpowers find their status in doubt. 
Though arms control details and discussions have dominated the preliminary negotiations for this second encounter between Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev, this is misleading. Broad agreement will no doubt be reached to reduce strategic arms, though by less than the 50 per cent originally sought, and on chemical weapons, two items from the old East-West agenda.
 
The New Realities
But the success of the meeting will better be measured by the degree to which the leaders come to grips with the new power realities forced on them by a year of constant change.
Both sides appear to understand this as they ponder the consequences of a moribund Warsaw Pact, a North Atlantic Treaty Organization that has lost its main mission, a united Germany and a disintegrating Soviet bloc. Making sense, and stability, of it all is a challenge worthy of Metternich.
''The fundamental issues at the summit are not going to be arms control,'' Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser, said today on the ABC News program ''This Week.'' ''The fundamental issues are remaking a political map of Germany and also secondarily what's going on in the Soviet Union.''
On the NBC News program ''Meet the Press,'' Aleksandr N. Yakovlev, a major adviser to Mr. Gorbachev, emphasized the same issues and added, ''We should expect this meeting will be much more significant than the previous ones.''
 
Staving Off Armageddon
Arms control, as a leading European diplomat put it the other day, matters most when there is no chance of basic political change. ''You nibble away at the edges, hoping to reduce the possibilities that the underlying hostilities will lead to Armageddon.'' But now there is basic political change aplenty, notably in the troubled Soviet Union and in Germany, which seems to be re-emerging as Europe's largest, richest and most powerful land, undoing the balance of power that once existed between NATO and the Warsaw Pact.
Indeed, political and economic imperatives may accomplish what arms control has not and perhaps will not. The 380,000 Soviet troops now in East Germany are highly unlikely to stay there very long; they may be bargained out, but if they are not, at least some of them will probably have to leave because the Soviet Union cannot maintain them or does not think the effort worthwhile. The process might already have begun, except that the Kremlin has no housing or jobs to give returning soldiers.
As they approach this week's discussions, Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Bush still control the bulk of the world's nuclear weapons - more than 95 per cent, by most calculations. But in their different ways, they have lost control over other matters. The Soviet leader will leave a capital gripped by panic buying, with political power dubious and fragmented, with a sullen almost rebellious populace, with part of an old bloc gone and other parts yearning to leave.
Except in the military sphere, the Soviet Union has lost its place at the head of the list of nations.
No such crises confront Mr. Bush, but he is struggling to redefine and to hold together the NATO alliance that has provided the United States its principal entree into Europe since World War II, at a time when Europe seems to stand on the verge of its greatest postwar strength and cohesion. Other longstanding American alliances, facing greatly lessened threats from the Communist world, are losing their muscle tone.
Mr. Bush must deal with economic challenges to American leadership from Japan and from a reinvigorated Europe, anchored by a Germany moving rapidly toward unification.
 
An Unprecedented Weakness
These fresh realities will shape the negotiating positions here. Mr. Gorbachev, who has achieved so much despite a position of weakness, is now trying to avoid allowing a unified Germany to become a full NATO member. From the Soviet viewpoint, that would in effect undo the results of World War II, because Moscow saw the partition of Germany as one of the chief benefits of its hard-won victory.
Mr. Bush, arguing from a much stronger position, must try to persuade the Soviets to accept German membership in NATO, the chosen American vehicle for ''the new architecture of Europe,'' because only NATO, not the European Community or the nascent Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, would allow the United States a significant role in European decision-making.
The President is not without weapons in this endeavor. His West German allies have already offered a wide range of economic inducements to the Soviets, largely involving the direct payment of marks.
If some compromise on Lithuania and the other Baltic states, a ticklish subject that Mr. Bush has promised to raise at the meeting, can be reached in coming weeks, the United States would be in a position to offer trade concessions, such as most favored nation status, and other economic assistance.
 
The President's Blueprint
In an interview last week with the BBC, Mr. Bush set his own agenda for this week. He said he was looking for answers to such questions as these: ''How does post-German-unification Europe look? Who will be calling the shots? What is the role of the United States in terms of stability?'' What he meant, of course, was not that Mr. Gorbachev could supply the answers at this meeting, but that Mr. Gorbachev's attitudes would be a major factor in the direction that American policy ultimately takes.
Much may turn on the answer to a pair of decisions. Mr. Gorbachev said this week that he would never let NATO, with Germany a member, play the leading role in building a new European security order, as Mr. Bush wants it to.
The President will therefore have to decide how deeply committed his counterpart is to that view, and, if he concludes that Mr. Gorbachev will not budge, he will have to decide how far the West, which holds most of the cards, should push the Soviets on the status of Germany at the risk of generating lasting resentment in Moscow that might undermine the Europe everyone is working so hard to construct.

HEADLINE: Divisive Abortion Politics Bring Iowa Democrats' Primary to a Boil

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DES MOINES, May 26

 BODY:
The rough new politics of abortion has descended on Iowa, straining old alliances, roiling the race for governor and mobilizing both sides of the issue for a battle being waged from church parking lots to the airwaves.
In the last week Iowa's abortion rights supporters have held 200 house parties, from Sioux City to Davenport, to help organize for the June 5 primary here. The National Abortion Rights Action League has jumped into the Iowa governor's race with a vengeance, vowing to defeat Attorney General Tom Miller, one of three major candidates for the Democratic nomination and the only one who opposes abortion.
 
A Battle of Copying Machines
Abortion opponents, long a powerful force in Iowa politics, say they are activating a well-tested network and are ready for any onslaught. Marlys Popma, the head of the Iowa Right to Life Committee, which is preparing a major mailing that describes the candidates' positions on abortion, said: ''We're working harder than we've ever worked. We can't keep our copying machine alive.'' 
But the abortion battle here, like many such struggles around the country in this year's elections, is not as clear-cut as the campaign speeches suggest. In elections for governor in Virginia and New Jersey in 1989, candidates who supported abortion rights defeated candidates who opposed them. Those elections were widely seen as primers for the new political era opened by last year's Supreme Court decision in the Webster case, which gave states new latitude to restrict abortion.
But the Iowa contest shows how complicated the politics of abortion can be. And the outcome of the primary, in which Democrats will choose a nominee to run against Gov. Terry E. Branstad, an abortion opponent, could add some intriguing new chapters to the abortion politics primer.
 
Concern About Dividing Votes
To begin with, there are two major candidates in the Democratic primary who support a woman's right to choose abortion: Don Avenson, the Speaker of the House, and John Chrystal, a banker who has long been active in politics.
As a result, some supporters of abortion rights are concerned that their votes will be divided and that they will unwittingly aid the nomination of Mr. Miller, meaning that Iowans would have a choice in November between two candidates who oppose abortion rights. So the state chapter of the Abortion Rights Action League endorsed Mr. Avenson on Friday, kicking off an advertising campaign that declares, ''If you want to protect the right to choose, Don Avenson is your choice for Governor.''
This prompted an angry statement from Mr. Chrystal blasting ''tin-horn, would-be kingmakers from Washington.'' The text of his statement was delivered to the abortion rights advocates by a worker for Mr. Chrystal who plopped it on the podium just as the abortion rights leaders were beginning their announcement of support for Mr. Avenson - not exactly emblematic of a new unity on the issue.
Kate Michelman, head of the national abortion rights league, acknowledged in a telephone interview that the decision to endorse one ally over another was unusual but added, ''These are unusual times, and the stakes are unusually high.''
While abortion rights supporters said they had prevailed on every abortion-related vote in the State Legislature this year, they are intent on replacing Mr. Branstad with a more sympathetic governor.
There are other crosscurrents here. Many Iowa Democrats pride themselves on civil and sophisticated politics, and some of them are troubled by what they see as a single-issue attack on Mr. Miller, a popular politician who has been Attorney General for 12 years.
 
'Good Man Is Getting Beat Up'
Tom Whitney, a former state Democratic chairman who is supporting Mr. Miller, watched his candidate campaign in an American Legion hall in south Des Moines the other night and described what was happening as nothing short of tragic.
''A very good man is getting beat up,'' Mr. Whitney said.
Bonnie Campbell, another former state Democratic chairman and a candidate for Attorney General, acknowledged that some Democrats feel torn. ''They remember when the same issue bit us and we begged the pro-life people not to be single-issue people,'' Ms. Campbell said. ''On the other hand, they do see this issue as very important in the larger social scheme.''
Mr. Miller was visibly pained as he talked about the issue in an interview. ''I've been a consistent proponent of no single-issue voting,'' he said. ''I've supported a number of pro-choice candidates in my career.''
Moreover, the Attorney General said, he has repeatedly promised that he ''would not advocate or propose any new restrictions with the exception of parental notification for minors with the appropriate safeguards.''
Many Democrats here say Mr. Miller has been clearly slowed by his opposition to abortion. He began the race as the frontrunner, and the most recent public opinion polls showed it to be a fairly close race with a large undecided vote.
The Des Moines Register's latest Iowa Poll, conducted April 16-18, showed Mr. Miller with 21 percent, Mr. Avenson with 18 percent, Mr. Chrystal with 14 percent, and 41 percent undecided. That poll was based on interviews with 431 people considered likely to vote in the Democratic primary, and has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4.7 percentage points.
 
Some Move to One Issue
On Sunday, The Register endorsed Mr. Chrystal for the nomination.
Mr. Miller and his aides argue that the real issues are crime, education, the environment and jobs. Mr. Chrystal's campaign emphasizes his international contacts and the way they can assist Iowa's farm economy. Mr. Chrystal has been a frequent visitor to the Soviet Union where he became acquainted with top officials, including Mikhail S. Gorbachev. He has been invited to lead a delegation of Iowans to meet with the Soviet President when he visits Minneapolis next month, just before the primary, aides said.
Mr. Avenson's campaign portrays him as a fighter who can make strides on issues like education and the environment.
Mr. Avenson said he was convinced the abortion issue would be an important factor in the primary balloting. ''It's the one that creates the most emotion among primary voters,'' he said.
Amy Maxey, a retired associate professor of sociology who held one of the abortion rights parties in her Sioux City home last week, said: ''I come awfully close to being willing to vote single issue, although generally I would deplore that. ''I think this is a critical time for us.''
Some Iowa Democrats said the issue may have waned in recent months, although they added that could change as the voting nears and advertising campaigns intensify.
Mrs. Popma of the Iowa Right to Life Committee said her organization was circulating a brochure that sets out the candidates' stands on abortion and ''shows Miller in a positive light in relation to the other two.'' But she said her group chose not to actually endorse Mr. Miller because he failed to return a questionnaire setting out his stands on various abortion-related issues.
Both sides of the abortion debate say the election in the fall will be an even greater test of the issue: the Senate race here pits Tom Harkin, the incumbent Democrat and a supporter of abortion rights, against Representative Tom Tauke, a Republican opponent of abortion.
And in the governor's race this fall, a spokesman for the Iowa Republicans said the party was confident Mr. Branstad could defeat whomever the Democrats nominate, although many Democrats here assert the two-term Republican is vulnerable.
In the meantime, Iowans are struggling to adjust to the new political landscape. ''It's a new world since Webster,'' said Lois Ichelson, an active supporter of abortion rights and family planning causes. ''It's like walking from one room to another.''

HEADLINE: To Call Consumption Taxes Regressive Is Just a Lame Excuse

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Robert S. McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice (''Are the Democrats Really So Stupid?'', Op-Ed, May 14) and the chairman of General Motors, Roger B. Smith (news article, Business Day, same issue) argue against increasing the gasoline tax because the burden of the tax falls disproportionately on the poor.
To dismiss gasoline and other taxes on consumption because they are regressive is a worn-out excuse since consumption taxes can be nested in an overall progressive tax package or they can be progressively structured. Mr. McIntyre's argument against consumption taxes is indicative of a lack of creativity among champions of the poor, and Mr. Smith's argument is a thin veil for a traditional concern of American car makers: higher gasoline taxes mean lower sales of big American cars.
A revenue-increasing tax package could be created with steep consumption taxes and highly progressive income-tax cuts. Tax on the first $7,700 of income (gross annual minimum-wage earnings) could be eliminated. The proposed capital gains tax cut and expanded Individual Retirement Accounts could be replaced by a tax on the first $4,000 of interest income. 
The alcohol tax could be made progressive by linking the tax per ounce of alcohol to the price of the beverage it is in (e.g., the alcohol in a $50 bottle of wine is taxed at a higher rate than the alcohol in a $5 bottle). Progressive sales taxes could also be designed for big-ticket items like automobiles. The first $10,000 of a car's price could be taxed at a standard national sales tax rate, say 5 percent; the next $10,000 at 10 percent; anything more than $20,000 at 20 percent. This principle could be applied to pleasure boats, big-screen televisions, fur coats, etc.
Shifting taxes from income to consumption while cutting the deficit encourages saving and minimizes disincentives to additional earning. Given that decreasing the deficit and increasing the savings rate is at the top of Japan's list of recommendations for the United States economy, levying consumption taxes reassures foreign investors on the economy's future health and could also be used in bargaining to open Japan's markets.
Should consumption taxes be rejected with the lame argument of regressiveness, it will be clear to all that Americans value consumption over thrift even if it drives us into the ground.

HEADLINE: Immigrants and Welfare

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Recent research refutes Julian L. Simon's claim in ''More Immigration Can Cut the Deficit'' (Op-Ed, May 10) that immigrants receive no more welfare than natives. The immigration studies of George Borjas, based on census data, show immigrants 15 percent more likely to be in poverty, 13.7 percent more likely to be welfare users, and 6 percent more likely to be unemployed. 
Mr. Simon's generalizations about the youth of immigrants don't hold up either. Mr. Borjas finds immigrants twice as likely to be over 65 and 23 percent more likely to be on Social Security than natives. Lief Jensen's 1988 study of census data revealed even higher levels of poverty and welfare use.
The seductive notion that more immigration can lighten the tax burden in general and the Social Security burden in particular collides with some hard actuarial facts: immigrant earnings are down and their social service costs are up; our earned income tax credit rebates much of the Social Security payments of low earners, and with their migratory life style and later entries into the work force, immigrants tend to qualify for benefits with smaller contributions.

HEADLINE: The Smiles and Chills In the Poetry Of Charles Simic

BYLINE: By D. J. R. BRUCKNER

 BODY:
Charles Simic, who won the Pulitzer Prize for poetry this year with a collection of prose poems, ''The World Doesn't End,'' credits the military police with having helped in the formation of his work. Mr. Simic had begun writing verse in his youth, only a couple of years after he acquired English when he came to this country from Yugoslavia. But his early work was largely imitative.
Then, he says, he was drafted and served as an M.P. briefly in West Germany and later in France between 1961 and 1964. ''The Army had a great impact on me,'' he recalled. ''I was far from everything, all by myself. I had my brother in Illinois send me all the poems I had written and I sat there in the barracks at night reading them and ripping them up, saying: 'This is Pound. This is Cummings. This is Eliot.' And when they were all gone, I thought: 'My God, what will I do now? I've got nothing.''
More than 25 years later, Mr. Simic still seems moved by this shredding of his youth. In a telephone interview from his home in Strafford, N.H., he said, ''I stopped doing all the things I had done before and really began anew.'' Perhaps it is natural that his early experience should still arouse powerful emotions; for him poetry is bound up with finding a new life and a new language. 
 
A Nine-Year Separation
He was born in Belgrade. His father, an electrical engineer who worked for a branch of the Western Electric Company during World War II, was in Italy when the war ended and did not return home, but went on to the United States. It took his wife and children almost nine years to get out of Yugoslavia and join him, with a year in France on the way. Charles Simic was 16 years old when he arrived here in 1954.
Mr. Simic gives much credit to the faculty of Oak Park High School in a suburb of Chicago, where he spent his senior year. ''They did remind you all the time this was the high school of Ernest Hemingway, and that made you wonder who you were,'' he recalled. ''But if they found you were interested in reading they just kept handing books to you.
''Then I found some of the students were writing poetry. They would show it to one another, and I started writing in reaction to what they had done. I didn't know English as well as Serbo-Croatian at the time, but a poem of maybe 10 lines was possible. It was a challenge: it was ambitious for me, but I could probably handle it better than I could have handled prose in English.''
 
'An Obsession With Economy'
In his first few years out of high school he toyed with becoming an artist, and attended the University of Chicago at night while working for The Chicago Sun-Times for several years, two of them as a proofreader of classified advertising, a job that could be seen as a natural apprenticeship for a poet who has, he admits, ''an obsession with economy, the effort to say less and less to mean more and more.''
His first two poems to appear in print were in The Chicago Review in the winter 1959 issue. He had moved a year earlier to New York City to get a degree from New York University and pursue a career in poetry, and eventually to do a dozen years of bookkeeping and accounting to support his literary habit (he was once business manager of Aperture magazine). But he dates his real formation as a poet from his return to New York from the Army.
During the subsequent few years, before his first book of poems was published in 1967, he says: ''I went through enormous changes. Before the Army I had become too literary, buttoned down, in tweeds, pipe-smoking, all that. After the Army I had a much humbler view of myself. I started thinking about a remark of the painter Paul Klee, that if a young man is to accomplish something he has to find something truly his own. Well, I had a kind of minimalist urge and so I started writing poems about the simplest things. Household objects: a knife, a fork, a spoon, my shoes.''
 
Profundity of Everyday Life
There is more than a little irony in his saying he was writing about his flatware; only a very foolhardy critic would say what any Simic poem is about. In rich detail they are all filled with ordinary objects, but they tend to leave the impression that the poet has poked a hole into everyday life to reveal a glimpse of something endless.
Often the vision is hilarious, but Mr. Simic can spring a chilling surprise. In a poem called ''Baby Pictures of Famous Dictators'' he creates a sepia-toned world of turn-of-the-century children, ''Lovable little mugs smiling faintly toward/The new century.'' At the very end, after an idyllic holiday, they are ''carried off to bed by their mothers and big sisters,/ While the dogs remained behind:/ Pedigreed bitches pregnant with bloodhounds.''
If he spent his youthful years imitating the Americans he was reading, his mature poetry is clearly more influenced by French writers. ''There was a time when I thought I had to read them all - Apollinaire, Rimbaud, Baudelaire, Robert Desnos, Max Jacob, all the Surrealists,'' Mr. Simic said. ''I adore the sheer sound of French verse. Indeed, he has translated so many of the French Surrealists by now that there may be readers of French verse in translation who mistake the Simic voice for some of the originals. He has also translated a number of modern Yugoslav poets.
Despite the fact that he came to English after Serbo-Croatian and French, he writes only in English. ''I have not even been tempted to try poetry in other languages,'' he said.
 
The Accidental Book
''The World Doesn't End'' (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich), the book that won the Pulitzer, is his most accidental book. ''The idea of getting a Pulitzer for this is so strange,'' he said, ''but everything about this book has been a surprise. Over the years I wrote down quick notations once in a while. I thought of them as maybe ideas for poems, you know, when maybe the impulses for prose and those for poetry collide.'' Among those that read very much like a Simic idea for a Simic poem is a strange meditation on a butterfly collection:
''A much dwindled, starker annotator sitting in a child's prison for butterflies. There's Phoebus. There's Painted Lady, Dog Face, White Admiral, Zebra, Mourning Cloak, Question Mark, Little Wood Satyr. Their colors are very pretty.
''Who told the little kid about sticking pins into us?''
A couple of hundred of these scraps had accumulated - ''I can't even date them'' - when Mr. Simic decided to enter them into his computer several years ago. He winnowed them down to 60 or 70 and began to toy with them.
''I spent more time on these things than I ever have on a poem,'' he said. ''You know, a sentence is difficult. Its rhythm is very different. When you have a line of a poem, you know you have a line. But with a sentence, you change a word and the whole thing changes and then everything around it.''
 
Elusive Connections
He says he is satisfied the little prose pieces in the book are poems: ''What makes them poems is that they are self-contained, and once you read one you have to go back and start reading it again. That's what a poem does.''
In his case one goes back because he is a specialist in elusive connections, as in the prose poem that begins ''Everything's foreseeable'' and sweeps through a brief catalogue of fateful accidents until he reaches a grandmother who ''says there's no god, only an eye here and there that sees clearly. The neighbors are too busy watching TV to burn her as a witch.'' In his enchantments Mr. Simic is like the family in another prose poem that sought its fortune ''manufacturing objects we had seen in dreams that night.''
His next book, the 14th, to be published later this year, is in verse. It is, he said, ''a kind of homage to New York.'' He and his wife left the city 20 years ago. He taught for several years in a California college; he has been teaching American literature at the University of New Hampshire for 17 years. He has won many awards for his writing, including the MacArthur Foundation fellowship in 1984. Still, he insists that New York ''won't relax its grip on me.'' He wants to celebrate the street life and street scenes of the city, especially of the 50's and 60's when he knew it best. The new work is called ''The Book of Gods and Devils.''
 
'Out in Another World'
''It's a kind of pagan book,'' the poet said. ''There are some strange figures in it, like out of Greek mythology.'' For instance? ''Well, in the late 50's, after a late-night poker party on West 45th Street, somewhere between Eighth and Ninth Avenues, I was walking along and suddenly there were two people stark naked on the street. This one guy was all covered with tattoos. They looked like something out of Ovid, some kind of Gorgons. They passed right by me without even noticing me. It left me very shaken, out in another world. There are things like that to be written about New York. I love it.''
As readers of Mr. Simic's other books know, Gorgons and gods and devils and many another creature one would expect to find only in the most extravagant mythology, turn up in many of his poems, sometimes with ordinary modern American names and outfits covering up their startling strangeness. ''But in New York they are natural,'' the poet said.
 
The bird who watches me
sleeping
from the branch of an apple tree
in bloom.
 
A black bird
for whom a strange man
gathers rocks
in the ruts of the road.
 
And among the willow trees:
water
before water made up its mind
to be water.
 
My sister says if I drink
of that water I will die . . .
That's why the heart beats:
to waken the water.
 
- ''Peaceful Kingdom,'' from ''Selected Poems, 1963-1983'' (1985)
 
When a tree falls in a forest
And there's no one around
To hear the sound, the poor owls
Have to do all the thinking.
 
They think so hard they fall off
Their perch and are eaten by ants,
Who, as you already know, all look like
Little Black Riding Hoods.
 
- ''Bedtime Story,'' from ''Selected Poems''
 
We were so poor I had to take the place of the bait in the mousetrap. All alone in the cellar, I could hear them pacing upstairs, tossing and turning in their beds. ''These are dark and evil days,'' the mouse told me as he nibbled my ear. Years passed. My mother wore a cat-fur collar which she stroked until its sparks lit up the cellar.
 
- ''We were so poor,'' from Part I of ''The World Doesn't End'' (1989)
He held the Beast of the Apocalypse by its tail, the stupid kid! Oh beards on fire, our doom appeared sealed. The buildings were tottering; the computer screens were as dark as our grandmother's cupboards. We were too frightened to plead. Another century gone to hell - and for what? Just because some people don't know how to bring their children up!
 
- ''He held the Beast,'' from Part I of ''The World Doesn't End''
The dog went to dancing school. The dog's owner sniffed vials of Viennese air. One day the two heard the new Master of the Universe pass their door with a heavy step. After that, the man exchanged clothes with his dog. It was a dog on two legs, wearing a tuxedo, that they led to the edge of the common grave. As for the man, blind and deaf as he came to be, he still wags his tail at the approach of a stranger.

HEADLINE: Political Memo;
Incumbents Fear That Incumbency May Become a Campaign Liability

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 27

 BODY:
Representative John P. Murtha is one of the most influential power brokers in Congress, but in a Democratic primary two weeks ago the voters of his Pennsylvania district nearly turned him out of office.
In Washington, Mr. Murtha, head of a House Appropriations subcommittee on defense, is an insider's insider. But back in Johnstown, the eight-term incumbent was pounded by an underfinanced opponent, and by the local newspaper, for supporting the Congressional pay increase and for accepting speaking fees and contributions from political action committees. When the votes were counted, Mr. Murtha had only 51 percent.
This brush with defeat has sent a shudder through Mr. Murtha's colleagues, reinforcing their feeling that voters are in a dark mood toward politicians this year, striking fear in the hearts of officeholders from the county commission to Capitol Hill. 
 
Evidence Mounts
There is not much doubt about the public's sour attitude toward politicians at all levels. And polling results, isolated election returns and reports from town meetings and shopping malls are suggesting to politicians and their consultants that this mood might be influencing elections.
Representative Mike Synar, who faces a primary in August against an opponent who accuses him of losing touch with his Oklahoma district, has been studying this developing mood on behalf of his Democratic colleagues in the House. ''There is a feeling out there that incumbency is not an advantage,'' he said.
That represents a shift in the conventional wisdom in a body where 98 percent of those who sought re-election in the last two elections won it. No one predicts a drastic change, but Charles Cook, who analyzes Congressional races in a monthly newsletter, says the re-election rate in the House seems likely to fall this year.
 
A Distinction Disappears
One reason is that fewer voters, when questioned by poll takers, no longer make the distinction between their disdain for Congress in general and their respect for their own representative.
It used to be that only one voter in ten thought his or her representative was involved in shenanigans on the Hill. Now, one voter in three thinks so, said Celinda Lake, a Democratic poll taker.
Mr. Synar says a number of poll takers are picking up another trend on a question close to a politician's heart: does an officeholder deserve re-election?
''They are saying the re-elect number is down 10 to 15 percent for incumbents,'' Mr. Synar said.
Nobody knows yet how this mood will affect elections this year. In addition to Mr. Murtha's close call, there is other evidence of an anti-incumbent mood. In a number of elections for local offices in recent weeks, in suburban Chicago, in Indiana and outside Los Angeles, members of school boards, city councils and other government bodies have been dumped.
A primary and a few local results do not prove a trend. But there is a suggestion that voters are beginning to express their frustration with officeholders who cannot seem to curb crime or unclog traffic or hold down taxes or generally get things done.
 
'Disappointed So Much'
''People have been disappointed so much,'' said Raymond Strother, a Democratic political consultant. ''Everything they see and hear about government is some sort of failure. They're just sort of fed up.'' Politicians say being an incumbent does not stir enough anger, by itself, to endanger re-election. It is a combination of factors, as in Mr. Murtha's case: hard times back home, combined with a record of supporting a Congressional pay increase or accepting speaking fees while constituents cannot find a job.
Mr. Murtha and his colleagues still have all the advantages that have made House incumbents difficult to unseat: Government-paid mailing privileges, access to the news media and extensive support from political action committees.
 
Incumbents Fear Change in '90
The fear on Capitol Hill is that 1990 could be a year in which these advantages of incumbency are counteracted by a shifting voter pyschology that makes being in office automatically suspect.
What is particularly interesting, says Mr. Cook, the Congressional analyst, is that the anti-politician feeling seems to be emerging without any great national crisis like Watergate, which brought down many Republicans in the mid-1970's, or roaring inflation, which hurt the Democrats in 1980. A number of consultants and poll takers say it may take until the 1992 elections before it can be seen whether the current discontent will bring another storm of vengeance against incumbents.
But the 1990 campaigns are already heavy with anti-politician themes. ''As I move around the state the one thing I hear more than anything else is 'kick butt,' '' said Lowell Weicker of Connecticut, a former Republican Senator who is now running as an independent candidate for governor. ''That's the mood.'' Candidates Adjust Mr. Weicker's effort is a vivid illustration of how the anti-politician mood has gathered strength and forced politicians to adjust. In 1988 he was turned out of the Senate because his Democratic opponent painted him as an out-of-touch politician who took speaking fees from special interests. Now he is running against both parties, saying the public is fed up with Democrats and Republicans alike.
''The public sees a budget summit not as an exercise in solving our budget problem but making sure not too much heat descends on either party at election time,'' Mr. Weicker said. ''The public's not stupid. They see these things for what they are.''
Thomas D'Amore, a former Republican state chairman and ally of Mr. Weicker, says he tried to stop the former Senator from breaking with the Republicans, but is amazed by the response to his outsider campaign.
Anti-politician sentiment is particularly strong toward Washington. When Baron Hill, an Indiana state legislator who is the Democratic candidate for the United States Senate, wanted to attack Daniel R. Coats, the Republican appointed to fill Vice President Dan Quayle's Senate seat, he settled on two words guaranteed to grate on voters.
 
A 'Washington Politician'
Mr. Hill called Mr. Coats a ''Washington politician'' in a radio ad, describing how Mr. Coats had used Government mailing privileges to send 13 million pieces of mail to Indianans.
''He's not a Washington politician,'' responded Mr. Coats's spokesman, Curt Smith, ''He's a Hoosier who's representing Hoosier values in Washington.''
In general, members of Congress are trying to distance themselves from Congress and identify more forcefully with their constituents.
Politicians and their consultants report that voters are angry not so much with government itself, but rather with the politicians who do not seem to be able, or willing, to make government do what the voters want.
Francis X. Bellotti, the former Attorney General of Massachusetts who is running for the Democratic nomination for governor, tried sympathy in a campaign advertisement.
 
'Sometimes They Forget'
''You take care of your family, you vote, you pay taxes and government treats you as though you were a number,'' he said. ''Sometimes they forget who built this state.''
''They'' has become a popular word on the stump and in commercials this year. Poll takers and consultants are intent on showing that their candidates are not part of ''them,'' but instead represent something ''new, different and better,'' a phrase that Squier-Eskew Communications is using in an ad to describe John Silber, the Boston University president, who is also seeking the Democratic nomination for governor. (The third candidate is Lieut. Gov. Evelyn Murphy.) The ad shows pictures of his opponents spinning on a merry-go-round; the announcer calls them the same old faces who have gone round and round in state government.

HEADLINE: Toward the Summit;
At Summit Talks, the Great Indoors Is the Only Setting Gorbachev Needs

BYLINE: By MAUREEN DOWD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: KENNEBUNKPORT, Me., May 27

 BODY:
The news was a bit of a blow to Mr. Bush, who has been trying eagerly to do a little casual bonding with his more reserved Soviet counterpart.
Soviet and American aides agree that chemistry will be an important factor in this week's summit meeting as the leaders jockey to develop a trusting relationship, one that can help them move East-West relations beyond the cold war.
While the Presidents share a belief that they can use their personalities to shape foreign policy, they have fundamental differences in outlook and style, differences that have so far given their encounters a tentative feeling.
Buoyed by his approval rating at home, Mr. Bush is approaching the summit meeting with a sense of optimism and at times playfulness, as he did before the Malta session in December. But Mr. Gorbachev, faced with the intricate task of saving his country from economic ruin, takes a more somber view. 
 
'A Serious Fellow'
''Gorbachev is a serious fellow and his country and view of history are hanging by a thread,'' said Richard N. Perle, an Assistant Secretary of Defense under President Reagan. ''There is an echo here of: 'You may want to tool around in speedboats off Kennebunkport. I'm trying to save my country.' ''
In past summit meetings and in interviews about the Washington session, which begins on Wednesday, Mr. Gorbachev tends to speak in impersonal terms about governments and matters of state. Mr. Bush tries to frame the matchup in a more personal way.
Mr. Bush, who spent the weekend before the summit talks at his family retreat here, said in an interview broadcast on the Soviet television today that he expected to talk frankly with the Soviet President. ''I've got grandchildren and he's got family and we can talk about it as human beings. 'Hey, what are we going to do to make things a little safer?' ''
He said he thought he had a good personal relationship with Mr. Gorbachev, but added: ''Wait until I see him. Then I'll be able to tell you, because he may be mad with me over some things.'' Sandals, Not Shoes?
Emphasizing that he will press Mr. Gorbachev on the fate of the Baltic republics, which are trying peacefully to secede from the Soviet realm, the President told the Soviet people: ''If we argue, we'll do that pleasantly. He's a tough guy. Listen, I've been around him enough to know that he drives his point home. Well, I can do the same.''
Mr. Bush has made friendly diplomacy in sporty settings a hallmark of his Presidency. He is exceedingly proud of the way he loosened up foreign leaders like President Francois Mitterrand of France, who meandered around Kennebunkport with Mr. Bush, and President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, who sat through a Baltimore Orioles baseball game with the President.
There is nothing that Mr. Bush likes better before meeting with a world leader in some relaxing spot than to have everyone change into sports clothes. He likes to take leaders around Kennebunkport's bays at demonic speeds in his motor boat.
He loves sports and martinis and getting away for ''boy's weekends'' of golf and fishing. He feels at his best in one-on-one settings, where he can turn on the charm and try to put himself in his counterpart's shoes. The ultimate challenge, and the leader most resistant to Mr. Bush's folksy, feet-up style, is Mr. Gorbachev.
 
Mind Before Matter
The Soviet President is more cerebral, with a taste for classical literature, philosophy and art. Mr. Gorbachev has a diabetic condition, and he takes only a glass of wine on holidays. He also almost never leaves home without his wife.
Mr. Gorbachev's tastes are in striking contrast to those of past Soviet leaders. In June 1973, Leonid I. Brezhnev insisted on staying at President Nixon's home in San Clemente, Calif., to show off their personal relationship. One chronicler wrote that Mr. Brezhnev's eyes filled with tears twice because he was so moved by Mr. Nixon's hospitality, including a ride in the President's golf cart and a poolside party with Hollywood stars and vodka toasts.
Mr. Gorbachev may want to be toasted by America, but he doesn't want to send images of frivolity back to a country in crisis.
''I think Gorbachev would be appalled at the notion of going out on Bush's boat,'' a senior Bush official said. ''Does he look like the type of guy who would wear a sweatshirt and sneakers and have his hair blowing 50 mile per hour as they pounded across the waves?''
 
Chemistry as Destiny
Some in and outside the Administration worry that Mr. Bush's craving for stability and his tendency to personalize his relationships with leaders can backfire.
''It's very easy to get caught up in personal relationships and fail thereby to analyze the situation accurately,'' said Mr. Perle, who said Americans tended to ''cater to Gorbachev like an anxious bride.''
Mr. Bush defended his proclivity for the personal in his Soviet television interview. ''Some of my critics in this country say, 'Hey, you're putting too much emphasis on Mr. Gorbachev.'
 
And I'm saying, 'I know him.' ''
Summit meetings have shown that chemistry may be destiny. After his Vienna meeting in June 1961 with John F. Kennedy, Nikita S. Khrushchev concluded that the American leader would not stand up to a challenge, a view that some Soviet and American historians think led Khrushchev to place Soviet missiles in Cuba. By contrast, Mr. Brezhnev found Mr. Nixon strong and felt he could work with him.
In meetings with President Reagan, Mr. Gorbachev often spoke sharply and slapped the edge of the table as Mr. Reagan listened quietly, preferring the overall symbolism of the summit meetings to the individual moves in the chess game.
 
'Ron' and 'Mikhail'
Although Mr. Reagan and Mr. Gorbachev are men with revolutionary visions and magnetic personalities, the Soviet leader maintained his air of reserve.
''Reagan kept calling Gorbachev 'Mikhail,' figuring that he would call him 'Ron' back, but it never worked,'' a former Reagan aide said.
Mr. Gorbachev also calls Mr. Bush ''Mr. President.'' And even though Mr. Bush loves to be on a first-name basis with world leaders, he takes the hint and calls Mr. Gorbachev ''Mr. President'' in return.
At their first exchange at the Malta meeting last December, Bush advisers recall, Mr. Bush was a little nervous, anxious about how the meeting would go and how Mr. Gorbachev would act. They said Mr. Bush made an extended presentation at the first meeting in Malta, outlining a 17-point plan to help the Soviet Union in part to show his mettle.
But by their second Malta meeting, the skittishness between them had dissipated a bit and they found some common ground.
''They're both practical and energetic,'' said Brent Scowcroft, Mr. Bush's national security adviser. ''They both want to do things and get at things.''
 
An Occasional Chuckle
Mr. Bush's aides said that in Malta the President saw his Soviet counterpart as a direct man who liked to speak his mind, and that the American President appreciated the Soviet leader's frankness.
Soviet officials said that Mr. Gorbachev liked the fact that Mr. Bush was in command of his facts and that the two could roam through various issues without opening their briefing books.
The Soviet President reportedly also found Mr. Bush discreet, and he began to feel that his words would not be distorted for political purposes.
''They have begun to develop the kind of relationship that allows them to discuss the most delicate problems,'' said Aleksandr A. Bessmertnykh, the new Soviet Ambassador in Washington.
The Americans in Malta noted with relief that Mr. Gorbachev could chuckle and tease on occasion, a verbal sparring that Mr. Bush enjoys as well.
When he ran into his spokesman, Gennadi I. Gerasimov, chatting with Mr. Bush's spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, on the cruise liner Maxim Gorky, Mr. Gorbachev observed: ''I see we have two spokesman together. What I'd do with spokesmen is put you in a bag and dump you over the side of the ship.''

Tiny Village Welcomes U.S.

BYLINE: By MICHAEL JANOFSKY, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAD RAGAZ, Switzerland, May 27

 BODY:
To say that it is quiet around here almost disturbs the calm. Church bells ring at the appropriate times. Horses pulling wagons of tourists neigh now and again. Somewhere off in the distance, a dog barks and a rooster crows.
But that's about it. A village of 4,500 doesn't make much noise, or anything else, for that matter. While the principal industry here is tourism, the majority of visitors, as many as 6,000 during the peak summer months, barely add to whatever commotion there is. 
The tourists come to Bad Ragaz for one reason only: to soak in thermal baths, reputed to work wonders for rheumatism, arthritis and other ailments common to older people.
Indeed, the average age of a tourist is around 60, according to Robert Staub, the 45-year-old Mayor. Younger faces are so rare they provoke staring. ''Sometimes I think I'm working in an old-age home,'' said a woman behind the reception desk of a local hotel. ''When I see a couple in their 50's, I think, 'Oh, young people.' ''
The demographics hardly bother the Mayor, inasmuch as the 105-degree waters, piped down from springs in the nearby central Alps, have been warming villagers and visitors for almost 150 years.
 
Well-Known Soakers
 In his office, the Mayor keeps a book that lists some of the well-known people who have soaked there. They include Victor Hugo, Hans Christian Andersen, James Fenimore Cooper, Freidrich Nietzche, Thomas Mann, Hermann Hesse and Johanna Spyri, whose story, Heidi, was written here and based on the life of a girl who lived in the next village, Maienfeld.
For all the visitors to Bad Ragaz over the years, famous and otherwise, none would seem so unlikely as the group of Americans who arrived today. For one thing, the members of the United States national soccer team have an average age of 23. For another, they may have little time for therapeutic baths, however badly they might need them.
Bound for the World Cup finals next month in Italy, the team has arranged to stay here for a week to take advantage of the quiet setting and first-rate training facilities offered free by the Bad Ragaz Football Club, which has, among its 300 members, a handful of players good enough to hold down third place in a third division league.
The Americans will train daily and play two games, one Wednesday night in Eschen, Liechtenstein, against Liechtenstein's national team; the other Saturday in St. Gallen, against the Swiss national team.
 
To the Mayor's Delight
 Then, the United States team plans to leave by bus for Tirrenia, a small town on Italy's west coast, which will serve as its base for the three games of the first round of the World Cup finals. It would be somewhat redundant to say that Staub is delighted to have the Americans in his midst, even if he had nothing to do with getting them here.
Before he was first elected in 1981, he served as the director of tourism for the canton, or state, in which Bad Ragaz is situated. Before that, he was a banker in London. With the village immersed for some time in a campaign to attract more younger people, he recognizes the public relations value of the team training here.
''We are now trying to make people know that we have more than the baths,'' he said in an interview. ''This is why it is very good to have the soccer team here. We can say that we are not just for old people.''
The idea to bring a World Cup team, any World Cup team, to Bad Ragaz originated with neither the Mayor nor any of the village leaders. In fact, they credit the chef at the Quenellehof Hotel, a five-star establishment adjacent to the famous baths. He had suggested to a friend at the Swiss national soccer federation that the tranquillity of the area and its proximity to Italy would make it ideally suited for a team bound for the World Cup.
Several other Swiss cities had the same idea, including Lausanne, Lugano and Locarno, so the Swiss soccer federation let it be known to World Cup participants that training sites were available. In February, American team officials toured some of them and chose Bad Ragaz over Locarno for its facilities and convenience. The training center is little more than a walk from the four-star Bristol Hotel, which agreed to exclude all other guests during the team's stay.
 
Five Police Officers
 Staub admitted he had no idea what economic benefits, if any, his village might derive from the American team. Little seems to matter but the baths, which cost 11 francs, about $8, for 20 minutes, the recommended soaking time. In the last 10 years, the village population has grown by just 500; three municipal buses and a police department of five is more than adequate.
Yet some villages wonder if more could not be done to improve business. Manfred Bereiter, the manager of the Bristol, used Heidi as the perfect example. While the book brought some attention to the area after it was published in the 19th century, as have several film versions of the novel, nothing has been done since.
''No one has taken advantage of it,'' he said, sitting with the Mayor at an outdoor table at the hotel. ''If this were America, there would already be a Heidiland.''

Luyendyk Wins in Fastest Indianapolis 500 Ever

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, May 27

 BODY:
What was fine weather for Arie Luyendyk and about 350,000 fans who watched him win the Indianapolis 500 today turned out to be miserable conditions for Emerson Fittipaldi, Al Unser Jr. and a bunch of Goodyear tires.
Luyendyk, a 36-year-old racer from the Netherlands, beat Bobby Rahal to the finish line by 10.7 seconds for his first Indy-car victory after more than 6 years and 76 starts.
And despite winning the race at the fastest average speed ever, 185.984 miles per hour, Luyendyk's victory was partly a result of the literally blistering pace set by Fittipaldi and Unser. Luyendyk finished the race 14 minutes sooner and with an average speed more than 15 miles per hour faster than the previous record-holder, Rahal, who won in 1986. 
The weather today, 64 degrees at the start with a high of 75 under mostly sunny skies, was a sharp change from the generally cool, cloudy conditions that had kept the track surface cool, fast and easy on tires throughout the month.
 
Right Rear Tire Suffers
Because the weather was so much hotter today, Fittipaldi, who led 128 of the first 135 laps of the 200-lap race, wound up putting too much strain on his right rear tire, which caused the tire to overheat and blister.
The blistering, which also afflicted Unser as soon as he tried to run hard enough to catch Fittipaldi, made the tires vibrate dangerously and forced both drivers to make extra pit stops to change tires, dropping them to third and fourth at the end.
Back in the team's garage after the race, Doug Shierson, Luyendyk's car owner, was asked what his team had done to avoid the blistering.
''I won't comment on that at all,'' Shierson said with a trace of a grin as he accepted congratulations.
''I don't know what we did,'' Luyendyk said when asked the same question.
The answer might be found in understanding what Fittipaldi, who finished third, did wrong.
''I was very disappointed,'' said Fittipaldi, who won the race last year and started from the pole today. ''The car was handling beautifully.''
It may have handled too beautifully.
Teddy Mayer, the chief engineer for Fittipaldi's Penske-Chevy, said the tires provided by Goodyear, the exclusive supplier here, weren't faulty but were just too soft for today's weather.
''If we'd've had this kind of weather early in the month, we'd've been on the backup compound,'' Mayer said.
He was alluding to a slightly harder tire that Goodyear had available if teams wanted to use it. A harder tire is less likely to blister on a warm day, but it also provides less traction than softer, stickier tires.
Fittipaldi's fast pace put more of a strain on the right rear tire because as it took the four left-hand turns on the two-and-a-half-mile oval, the back end of the car wanted to go out.
 
A Speed/Stress Trade-off
When a car handles like this, it's said to be ''loose.'' It's a faster way to go, but puts more strain on the right rear tire.
Mayer said the problem didn't appear earlier in the race because the first two sets of tires the team used were broken in for 15 to 20 laps each earlier this month. This had cured the rubber, hardening it slightly.
''The later sets had only five or six laps in them,'' Mayer said. ''We didn't expect the tires to be that marginal.''
Leo Mehl, Goodyear's director of worldwide racing, said the faster teams outsmarted themselves.
''Many of the teams used higher air pressure in the right rear tire than we recommend,'' Mehl said.
A tire that's inflated harder has less rolling resistance, and thus more speed. Mehl said that when the teams lowered the air pressure, the problem disappeared.
 
'Push' Factor for Rahal
''We have a backup compound,'' Mehl said, in response to Mayer. ''But racers will not use a backup compound if they fear they will lose too much speed.''
Rahal, who also avoided the tire blisters, said his team had followed Goodyear's inflation recommendations. Also, he said, his car had ''push'' all day, meaning the front end, not the back, was leaning more heavily to the right.
Rahal said another kind of bad tire choice had allowed Luyendyk to pass him on lap 168 and pull away.
''On the last pit stop, we put some old tires on and we lost grip,'' he said.
Rahal and Luyendyk also conserved their tires early in the race by running a slightly slower pace than Fittipaldi did. Luyendyk was usually several seconds behind the leaders while running in the top five. Rahal, who ran second to Fittipaldi most of the time, never really challenged him.
 
Landed the Right Engine
Both Luyendyk and Shierson, who hired him after last season, were helped immeasurably by finally being able to buy the dominant Chevrolet engine this year.
Ilmor Engineering, the British company that builds the turbocharged Chevy racing engine, limits the number of teams it supplies, to be sure it can properly service the dozen or so motors each car needs per season.
When Ilmor decided to add a team last year, it picked Shierson's team.
''I wanted it and felt we deserved it,'' Shierson said. ''We proved we could win.'' And why did he hire Luyendyk? ''Because I thought he was a winner,'' Shierson said. ''And he is.''
Luyendyk said: ''Sometimes you've got to be patient and wait until you get your hands on the right equipment.''
Luyendyk, who now lives in Brookfield, Wis., didn't know that Shierson would get the Chevy when he joined the team, but when he found out, he knew the pressure would be on to finally win a race.
''I thought, 'If you're not going to win races this way, you better look to something else,' '' he said.
Luyendyk's prize money, which should exceed $1 million, will be announced at the victory dinner Monday night.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
A LEANER MACMILLAN PROFITS IN BEST SELLERS

BYLINE: By EDWIN McDOWELL

 BODY:
For almost two months, the best-selling hardcover nonfiction book in America has been ''Men At Work,'' a baseball book by George Will.
If that is a surprising topic for a political analyst, some book industry officials are even more surprised that it was published by Macmillan.
''They have a tremendous backlist,'' said Steven West, manager of Chassman & Bem bookstore in Burlington, Vt., ''but I don't think of them as a major force in book publishing.''
Mr. West's assessment is shared by many publishers and editors - and with apparent good reason. A few years ago Macmillan said it was abandoning big-money auctions, in which too often it won the bidding but lost money after publishing the book. 
 
Takeover by Maxwell
 Then, Macmillan's management fought an expensive, unsuccessful war in 1988 to prevent a takeover by Robert Maxwell, the British media entrepreneur. His company, Maxwell Communication, ultimately bought Macmillan for almost $2.6 billion.
At the time, industry executives speculated that Mr. Maxwell would sell Macmillan's most valuable parts, including its reference and children's books, and abandon its small and risky business in trade, or general-interest, books.
Mr. Maxwell could still do so, of course. But he has vowed to be a leading publisher of trade books, and Macmillan's adult trade division has responded with five best sellers over the last nine months: ''Joshua and the Children'' by Joseph F. Girzone, ''Kaffir Boy In America'' by Mark Mathabane, ''Pete Rose: My Story'' with Roger Kahn, ''The Tempting of America'' by Robert Bork and the book by Mr. Will.
''It's the first time in our history we can remember having five best sellers in a row,'' said David Shaffer, president and chief operating officer of Macmillan Inc. He added that the general publishing group, which includes trade books, college texts and computer books, ''had its best year ever in 1989 for sales and profits.''
Sales of the general publishing group totaled $256 million last year, up from $56 million in 1980, and the company is said to have a 16 to 17 percent profit margin. Within the group, trade book profits are running about 9 percent, or about double the industry average. Trade publishing was led by the Free Press, the imprint headed by Erwin A. Glikes that published the Bork book; its profits are thought to have been close to 30 percent.
 
Largely Psychological Influence
 Given the lead time necessary to publish a book, Macmillan's recent best sellers cannot be credited to Mr. Maxwell, who has made few managerial changes at Macmillan.
Rather, the Maxwell influence has been largely psychological. On the day he acquired the company, he told senior staff members that he was committed to publishing good books.
''It was the first time some of them had heard this kind of talk, and it had a tremendous effect on morale,'' said Barry Lippman, president and publisher of Macmillan adult trade division.
For a short while after the takeover, Kevin Maxwell, a managing director of Maxwell Communication and a son of the owner, oversaw Macmillan from its offices in Manhattan. He has since returned to Britain, leaving Mr. Shaffer in command.
But Robert Maxwell's Macmillan is a different company from the one he bought. Burdened by debt, Mr. Maxwell has sold Macmillan's magazine group, the direct-marketing operation, the Michie Company Law Publishing, the Gump's department store chain and the Katherine Gibbs Schools. He will soon put the P. F. Collier Encyclopedia unit on the block. And he merged Macmillan's school publishing division with that of McGraw-Hill, while selling 48 percent of Berlitz in a public offering.
''Yes, some sales were made to pay down the debt,'' Mr. Shaffer acknowleged. ''But we chose to sell businesses that didn't fit what we want to be, or businesses where we could not realize economies of scale.''
The assets that Macmillan retained, he said, are ''the most valuable, the most profitable and the ones we want - basically general publishing, information services, technology and data-base publishing.''
Ivan Obolensky, a publishing analyst with the investment firm Josephthal & Company, said the Maxwell strategy appears to be well thought out. ''Before it was a mishmash of businesses,'' he said. ''Now they're much more focused.''
Macmillan still does not chase expensive books, but it will pay six or seven figures in some cases. It paid $2 million for former Secretary of State George P. Shultz's memoirs and $300,000 for the Pete Rose story.
Even before the Maxwell acquisition, Macmillan's strength was in its children's, reference and computer books, as well as in cookbooks and books about gardening and baseball. These are generally acquired at relatively low cost and have few returns from the stores.
 
Criticism of Macmillan
 Some authors and industry executives, however, are critical of Macmillan's approach, which they say puts profits ahead of editorial vision.
One literary agent notes that while the company makes plenty of money from its backlist of titles by such authors as Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald and Edith Wharton -books originally published by Charles Scribner's Sons, which Macmillan bought in 1985 when it also acquired Atheneum Publishers - it has virtually transformed both imprints into outlets for nonfiction.
''Why don't they use their profits to publish literature or nurture new novelists?'' he asked.
''That's a legitimate criticism,'' responded Harry McQuillen, president of Macmillan Publishing. ''But we're starting to change.''
He said both imprints were re-directing their focus toward fiction.
''We've had to overcome a very, very difficult reputation from a few years ago,'' Mr. McQuillen sad. ''Now that we've done that, it's time to move forward again.''

HEADLINE: Demand in U.S. Lifts Machine Tool Orders

BYLINE: By JONATHAN P. HICKS

 BODY:
Orders for American-made machine tools increased 8.9 percent in April from March, rising to their highest level since September, according to a trade association.
Analysts said that the results reflected slight increases in capital spending by domestic manufacturers, especially aircraft companies.
Machine-tool orders climbed to $289.4 million in April, the Association for Manufacturing Technology said in its monthly report, scheduled for release today. That followed a 36.6 percent increase in March, when new orders soared to $265.8 million. 
New orders from domestic manufacturers climbed 39.8 percent in April from the March level. But orders from foreign customers plunged by more than two-thirds.
Officials of the machine-tool companies attributed the rise in domestic orders to more robust demand from aircraft makers and slightly increased demand from auto makers.
Compared with the levels of April 1989, new orders were up 19.3 percent.
Despite the overall increase in machine-tool orders, some economists said the figures reflected the economy's sluggishness, as well as a reluctance by manufacturers to spend more heavily to upgrade plants and equipment.
''The economy has not been generating much profit for companies,'' said Neal M. Soss, the chief economist at the First Boston Corporation. ''And that is not the environment in which you expect buoyant capital spending to occur.''
The strength of tool orders generally reflects the strength of industrial production. Economists consider patterns in machine tool sales to be important indicators of capital spending by manufacturers.
Machine tools are power-driven devices that cut or shape metal parts used in products like appliances, vehicles, aircraft and construction materials.
 
Optimism About Detroit
 In recent months, auto makers sharply curtailed their machine-tool orders because of slumping sales. The auto industry accounts for about a third of domestic machine-tool sales.
But Richard Priebe, a spokesman for the Cross & Trecker Corporation, a Bloomfield Hills, Mich., machine-tool maker, said that Detroit was slightly increasing capital spending and that orders from auto companies should grow the rest of this year.
''Domestic auto companies are looking at the new generation of engines,'' he said. ''And changes in emissions standards mean that there will be considerable expenditures that will affect machine-tool companies.''
Analysts said the sharp decline in foreign orders did not reflect declining interest in American-made machine tools. Rather, they said, the demand in March was unusually high because of a $63 million order to Cross & Trecker from Soviet auto makers.
Indeed, new orders from foreign customers were up 47.6 percent for the first four months of this year, compared with the similar 1989 period. For this year's January-April period, overall new orders declined by 9.1 percent from the 1989 level, and domestic orders were off 16.5 percent.
Since April of last year, new orders from domestic manufacturers have risen 23.3 percent, while orders from foreign customers have fallen 11.2 percent.
Shipments of machine tools declined 10.6 percent in April, to $258.2 million, from $288.9 million in March. The level of shipments was up 3.5 percent from the April 1989 level, however. Also, shipments increased 11.1 percent in the first four months of the year, compared with a year earlier.
 
Cutting Tools
 New orders for metal-cutting tools, which include boring mills and lathes, were up 4.4 percent in April from the previous month and were 35.4 percent higher than in April 1989.
But new orders for metal-cutting tools dropped 12.3 percent for the first four months of this year, compared with the similar period of 1989. Metal-cutting tools typically account for about three-fourths of orders.
Orders for metal-forming tools increased 22.1 percent in April from the March level. But orders for new metal-forming machine tools decreased 8 percent in April, compared with April 1989. For the first four months, new orders for metal-forming tools dropped six-tenths of 1 percent, compared with the similar period of 1989.
The machine-tool order backlog for April was $1.71 billion, up from $1.68 billion in March. The backlog in April 1989 was $2.29 billion.

HEADLINE: Homeless Get New Start In Westchester Program

BYLINE: By LISA W. FODERARO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOUNT VERNON, N.Y.

 BODY:
After eight years of shuffling in and out of welfare motels, Valerie Covel and her three children, ages 11, 13 and 15, are ready to rejoin society. Their launch pad is a transitional housing program designed to help homeless families find the skills, the courage and ultimately the permanent housing to end the cycle of despair.
''I'm never going to be homeless again after this, I can tell you that,'' said Ms. Covel, 38, sitting on a bench in a sun-drenched courtyard here. ''There's nothing like having your own home.'' 
The housing complex on Franklin Street, known as Westhelp and conceived by Andrew Cuomo, the Governor's son, is called transitional because it takes homeless families stuck in Westchester County's network of roadside motels and eases them into apartments.
In contrast to the motels, where families feel more like characters in Sartre's ''No Exit'' than like guests, the complex prepares the families for apartment living by turning them into remedial students of life - it offers a combination of self-help classes and house rules reminiscent of a fairly restrictive college dorm.
 
Fierce Opposition
While Mr. Cuomo already oversees complexes in Albany and Brooklyn, this is the first to open in Westchester, where he has met fierce opposition from residents fearful of drugs, crime and falling home values. The antagonism he had to overcome in Mount Vernon was minor, however, compared with that in nearby Greenburgh, where neighbors have threatened to secede from the town to block a proposed project.
In Mount Vernon, the program seems to be working. Since opening last December, the 46-unit complex has placed 15 families in permanent housing. That is only a dent in the county's homeless population of more than 4,000, but county officials and social-service workers see in the program the glimmer of a solution to the crisis.
The police say they have not received a single complaint from the neighbors, and the brick-clad structure blends in so well with the community that people unaware of its purpose often stop there, hoping to rent an apartment.
''So far, it's a shining star,'' said Norman Shaw, a spokesman for the county's Social Services Department.
''This is not a hotel or motel where visitors are free to come and go,'' said Mount Vernon's Mayor, Ronald A. Blackwood. ''This is a place that is designed to bring order to your life and reschedule your priorities. That's why it's better than any other program I have seen or heard about.''
 
A Full-Time Staff
Westhelp does this several ways. Each arriving family is given a medical examination and a furnished apartment. A full-time staff, including two social workers, two housing specialists and a recreation director, run day care, high school equivalency classes, seminars on finding and keeping a home, weekly discussion groups and other activities.
There are rules, too. Residents must be home by midnight. They are not allowed to bring visitors into their apartments. They can meet with visitors only in the lobby, where a staff member is always on duty. And they must give their destinations on a sign-out sheet when they leave.
By contrast, the motels, many of them far outside the county in rural areas, offer no such support or restrictions. Drugs and fights have been common, and homeless parents there have to concentrate on getting through each day, equipped with only an illegal hot plate, thin walls and cheap door locks.
''This is a sanctuary where the world cannot intrude,'' said Norman Lipton, the director of the Westhelp complex here. ''We're not just giving them a safe complex and letting them fend for themselves, but we're saying, 'We're going to help you get back on your feet.' ''
 
Rankled by Rules
Of course, the rules rankle some of the residents, most of whom are single mothers from Mount Vernon. ''A lot of the other women don't like the fact they can't have visitors, but if everybody has their boyfriend or man coming here, it would be trouble,'' Ms. Covel said. ''I tell them that if your man really cared about you, you wouldn't be here.''
A third of the homeless in the county originate from Mount Vernon, an economically depressed city bordered by the Bronx and Yonkers. Those families get preference at the complex here.
When it comes to finding housing, Westhelp's staff cannot work miracles. They are up against a shortage of affordable housing throughout the county, with a quarter of all rental apartments lost to co-op and condominium conversions in the 1980's. Many landlords will not accept tenants on public assistance. Many homeless mothers will not accept apartments in the city's drug-plagued neighborhoods.
But the housing workers methodically match apartments and families. Janet Robinson teaches a five-session course on the ABC's of housing, covering tenant rights and responsibilities, signing leases and challenging evictions. She also asks the residents to draft ''bare-bones'' budgets for their first year and to distinguish, in writing, between their needs and wants.
After securing the necessary housing subsidies and shelter allowances, Dolores Mitchell gives the residents lists of vacant apartments in their price ranges. When an apartment is too expensive, she will negotiate with the landlord to lower the rent.
 
'Much Easier'
In a course evaluation, one homeless woman in her early 20's wrote that ''finding permanent housing and keeping it is harder than I thought, but with the help of this program it's much easier.'' She and her 3-year-old son have since moved into a one-bedroom apartment in Yonkers.
The program's graduates are to be visited in their apartments every three months during their first year by either Ms. Robinson or Ms. Mitchell and twice during their second year. ''We help you help yourself,'' Ms. Robinson said. ''I will not take anybody by the hand. We are dealing with adults.''
What is perhaps most gratifying to Mr. Cuomo is how cost effective Westhelp has proved.
The county, state and Federal governments together spend from $36,000 to $39,000 a year to house one family in a motel room. But the cost to governments of an annual stay in the Mount Vernon complex, with all its benefits, is only $30,000 a year. That money also helps pay off the mortgage on the building, which after 10 years will be turned over to Mount Vernon for housing for its elderly residents or civil servants.
''It's a better service for the homeless at less cost to the taxpayer, and it doesn't burden the community,'' Mr. Cuomo said.
''We have a real bargain here,'' said John J. Allen, the Commissioner of the County Social Services Department. ''The difference is that the motels are profit-making, and this is not.''

Sacrificial Lambs Are Hard to Find. Wonder Why?

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:

Now, as the night
 began to fall
 a hungry lion
 paid a call.
 He looked Pierre
 right in the eye
 and asked him
 if he'd like to die.
 Pierre said,
 ''I don't care!''*
Like the little boy in Maurice Sendak's cautionary tale, Pierre Rinfret must figure he has nothing much to lose by challenging the king of New York's political jungle, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo.
Mr. Sendak's character was eaten alive without a fight. Mr. Rinfret (pronounced Rin-FRAY), an articulate 66-year-old economist, is a director of a newsprint company, among other businesses, but as a candidate may be only a paper tiger. 
Given New York's fiscal state after nearly 16 years of Democratic governors and voters' disinclination to anoint an officeholder for life, no candidate should be judged invincible.
Five months before the election, though, this two-term Governor appears to be about as close to political invulnerability as most mortals get.
Like the blustery month, Mr. Rinfret may come in emulating a lion, but seems destined to go out as a sacrificial lamb.
Even so, the Republican Party convention that opens in Westchester tomorrow and which is tentatively planning to designate Mr. Rinfret caps an embarrassing search for a challenger to Mr. Cuomo.
In contrast, every time Democrats faced the last elected Republican governor, Nelson A. Rockefeller, no shortage of seemingly respectable candidates fought for the opportunity.
''Sure, I thought it was worth a shot,'' says Robert M. Morgenthau, now the Manhattan District Attorney, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr. Rockefeller in 1962.
''When I went, I think Rockefeller was ready to be taken,'' says Frank O'Connor, who was the Democratic nominee and loser in 1966. ''He was taken by me,'' Mr. O'Connor said, adding that his efforts were damaged by Franklin D. Roosevelt Jr.'s spoiler candidacy on the Liberal Party line.
In 1970, Mr. Rockefeller handily dispatched Arthur J. Goldberg, who in his first and last hurrah boasted great credentials but seemed to be under the misapprehension that he was running for the United States Supreme Court.
Yes, public opinion polls suggested that Mr. Rockefeller was more vulnerable than Mr. Cuomo appears to be. But Mr. Rockefeller's singular commingling of financial and political power made him formidible under any circumstances. Why aren't credible Republicans as eager to challenge this governor?
The party's over. Political discipline has declined. The governorship is the glue that holds a state party together; the Republicans last held it in 1974. The only incumbent Republicans elected statewide - Comptroller Edward V. Regan and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato -are largely party poopers out for themselves. Liberal Republicans no longer dominate the party.
The Republican candidate pool is shallow. Democrats, typically more diverse, already controlled most municipal offices in New York City, Albany and Buffalo. Since the 1970's, they have scored inroads in Assembly and county executive races elsewhere. Some might-be Republican candidates for governor, meanwhile, may have stayed out in hopes that Mr. D'Amato can be taken next year.
Mr. Cuomo is flush. His $7 million campaign account seems to be earning nearly as much in annual interest as Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, spent on his Republican race for governor in 1986. (By some estimates, what Mr. Rockefeller spent in 1970 would be the equivalent of $30 million today). Incumbency is tough to overcome.
Mr. Cuomo will win anyway. So, this argument goes, bloody the Governor. But don't give him a credible opponent whose defeat would project Mr. Cuomo as a giant killer whose next target might be President Bush in 1992.
With access to enough money to run a respectable campaign, Mr. Rinfret fits the bill -particularly if Mr. Cuomo agrees to debate.

HEADLINE: IN THE NATION;
What Kind of Policy?

BYLINE: By TOM WICKER

 BODY:
In a Harvard lecture on what he called ''the American Romance,'' Richard Darman recently declared that America ''was founded by risk-takers, expanded by risk-takers and led to the highest standard of living on earth by risk-takers.''
Now, the Bush Admnistration's powerful budget director said, ''we must renew the risk-taking capacities that historically have expanded so many frontiers . . . We must counter the tendency to become a risk-o-phobic society.''
Romance and rosk-o-phobia aside, Mr. Darman's lecture did not mention that the risk-takers who built the American railroads, which made possible vast U.S. economic and geographical expansion in the 19th century, were underwritten by Federal subsidies and lucrative government land grants.
He did not point out that the interstate highway system, a major boon to 20th-century prosperity, was built by the Federal Government, or that the commercial and private traffic on those highways has been subsidized by a low Federal gasoline tax. He did not refer to the nation's airports, largely paid for with Federal funds, or to its commercial aircraft, developed with the aid of Federal research investments. Nor did he recall that much of today's high-tech industry was spun off from federally financed military and space research. 
In sum, Mr. Darman gave no credit at all to the unromantic industrial policy - Federal aid and encouragement to vital enterprises - that at most stages of American economic development has taken some of the risk out of risk-taking. He did not explin that a nation having no positive industrial policy nevertheless follows a negative industrial policy; it's not so much whether it has such a policy, but what kind.
Some economic analysts and members of Congress assert that Mr. Darman, aided and abetted by John Sununu, the White House chief of staff, and Michael Boskin, the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has led the Bush Administration into opposition to an industrial policy that would aid U.S. industrial and commercial competitiveness. They believe that as Mr. Darman's Harvard remarks suggest, he and the others consider such a policy to be unwise interference in the free market.
Thus, a letter signed by Republican Senator John Heinz and Democratic Senator Al Gore, among other members of Congress, criticized the recent ''firing and silincing'' of Dr. Craig Fields from the Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency (Darpa) as ''at best short-sighted, at worst a major breach of our future economic security.''
Dr. Field's ''innovative'' use of Federal research funds to support ''cutting-edge technologies'' had made hime, the letter said, ''a symbol of the kind of industry-government cooperation that will be crucial to revitalizing the U.S. industrial base.''
Darpa, over the years, has directed such funds into seminal research in computer science, the design of fast microprocessro chips, ceramics and date transmission, all of which had civilian as well as military payoffs. As director of Darpa, Dr. Fields supported Sematech, a semiconductor-manufacturing research center, and allocated $30 million to high-definition television research, which is touted as having dual potential.
The Administration diverted to other uses $20 million of the HDTV allocation. In April, Dr. Fields was transferred out of Darpa after investing $4 million in a company developing a radiation-resistant gallium arsenide chip as a substitute for silicon. Because of reduced Administration support, moreover, Michael Sekora, who headed a Pentagon project to accumulate data on competitive foreign technologies as a research tool for U.S. technological development, has returned in frustration to the private sector.
''By any measure, the Japanese system works much better than our [in] building and maintaining national economic strength,'' Dr. William Schreiber, an M.I.T. engineering professor and a member of the Pentagon's High-Resolution Systems Task Force, said in a letter to me. ''The belief that the market always gives the right answer is a kind of economic religion based on faith and not on reason.'' Others argue that sensible industrial policy would measure national security properly, in terms of economic stability and industrial wealth as well as military prowess.
As even Richard Darman conceded at Harvard, ''The challenge . . . is to manage risks more rationally, and to select the appropriate risks.'' That's risky, of course, but sound industrial policy.

September 1959: President Eisenhower and Nikita S. Khrushchev meet at Camp David, Md. The talks result in the ''spirit of Camp David,'' an effort to press for scientific and cultural exchanges and disarmament.
 
June 1961: Khrushchev and President Kennedy have heated exchanges in Vienna. There are no formal agreements. A year later, the Soviets send nuclear missiles to Cuba; the United States forces their removal. 
 
June 1967: President Johnson meets in Glassboro, N.J., with Aleksei N. Kosygin to discuss the Middle East, the Vietnam War and nuclear arms. They come to no agreement.
 
May 1972: President Nixon and Leonid I. Brezhbnev, in Moscow, sign the first treaties setting limits on strategic nuclear arms, known as SALT I, and on curbing antiballistic missile systems. They agree to keep negotiating arms, but regional issues divide them.
 
June 1973: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Washington. They agree ot try to complete a new arms treaty by 1974.
 
June-July 1974: Nixon and Brezhnev meet in Moscow and Yalta. They agree to a treaty banning underground nuclear-arms tests with yields exceeding 150 kilotons, and they arrange a 10-year economic accord.
 
November 1974: President Ford and Brezhnev, in Vladivostok, reach a tentative deal limiting missile launchers and bombers and lay a base for a second strategic arms treaty. The treaty is not completed before President Carter takes office.
 
June 1979: President Carter and Brezhnev, in Vienna, sign the second treaty limiting strtegic arms, or SALT II. Although the Senate never approves the treaty because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in December of 1979, both sides agree informally to observe its limits.
 
November 1985: President Reagan and Mikhail S. Gorbachev meet in Geneva for wide-ranging talks on arms control and other subjects. They agree to revive cultural exchanges and to enhance air safety, but no arms-control agreements are achieved.
 
October 1986: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Reykjavik, Iceland, to provide momentum to arms-control talks. The two sides speak of vast cuts in strategic arms and medium-range missiles, but the accord falls through because of disagreements over the American plan for a space-based missile defense system, or ''Star Wars,'' and over Moscow's insistence on putting all arms issues in one package.
 
December 1987: Reagan and Gorbachev meet in Washington. They sign a treaty to destroy intermediate-range nuclear forces, known as I.N.F., and agree to seek a treaty cugging long-range nuclear arsenals. But ''Star Wars'' remains a sticking point.

HEADLINE: MANY STATES CUT FOOD ALLOTMENTS FOR POOR FAMILIES

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Because of unexpected increases in food prices in the last eight months, at least half the states have moved to cut government food allotments for poor women and children or to stop the aid altogether for thousands of these people.
The Federal Government, through the states, provides this aid under the Special Supplemental Food Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC. Under the welfare program, one of the Government's most successful, vouchers to buy food are given to 4.5 million expectant and new mothers and young children who are at high risk of malnutrition. The program serves nearly one-third of all babies born in the United States. 
Many assessments of the program, including several studies financed by the Federal Government, have concluded that it saves lives and improves the health of women and children, reducing infants' mortality and increasing their birth weight. By preventing illnesses, it saves money for Medicaid, the Government's health care program for the poor. So Congress spared WIC when other welfare programs were cut back in the Reagan Administration.
 
Cost-Cutting Choices
But this year the $2.1 billion the Federal Government gives the states has not been enough to cover the increased cost of milk, orange juice, cereal and infant formula, the main items in the WIC food package.
The Federal Food and Nutrition Service had estimated that food prices would rise 4 percent in the current fiscal year, which began Oct. 1, 1989. But states' officials say the cost of items in the basic food package increased 8 percent in just the first half of this fiscal year. In interviews, they said some of the increases were seasonal and would probably level off, but added that they had little hope that prices would decline any time soon.
About a dozen states, including New York, contribute their own money to the program, but they are not obligated to do so and many are under severe fiscal pressures of their own. ''We face two alternatives,'' said Betsy R. Clarke, director of the program in Oregon: ''either cutting the food package or reducing the number of participants.''
Some states are doing both. In a typical cost-saving move, Texas has cut the cereal allowance for year-olds and 2-year-olds to 24 ounces a month, from 36 ounces. It will also drop 27,000 people from the food program. Early this year, it was serving 357,200 women and children.
On June 1, California will halve the monthly juice allowance for children 3 to 5 years old. The state expects to save $1.2 million by providing a monthly allotment of 144 ounces of juice for such children, who have been getting 288 ounces. In addition, California expects to save $6 million by eliminating vouchers for cheese, a major source of calcium.
''At least half the states in the country are cutting back caseloads,'' said Dennis H. Bach of Iowa, president of the National Association of WIC Directors, an organization of state and local officials. ''And many are also putting restrictions on the food package in order to contain costs.''
 
Just Staying Even
At a time when Congress and President Bush are looking for ways to cut Federal spending, it will not be easy to find more money for the WIC program. Tony P. Hall, the Ohio Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Hunger, and other members of Congress have proposed a $150 million increase for next year. ''Originally, we hoped to reach more mothers and children, but now we find the extra money will be needed just to stay even,'' Mr. Hall said.
Federal officials said they did not know how many people had been removed from the program's rolls by the states' cutbacks. F. Philip Shanholtzer, a spokesman for the Food and Nutrition Service, said inflation in food prices had ''outstripped everyone's predictions,'' adding that he hoped the states would minimize the reductions in benefits by making changes in the food package to save money.
States that are trimming their rolls are focusing on lower-risk cases. Missouri is terminating benefits in April through September for 14,000 children who show no clinical signs of malnutrition despite inadequate diets.
But C. Richard Blount, director of food and nutrition services for the Missouri Health Department, said some of those children would probably qualify for benefits again after a few months when they have symptoms of anemia and malnutrition. If that happens, he said, the state will have to take other steps to save money by restricting eligibility.
Debra C. Stabeno, food program director in the Texas Health Department, said, ''We are reducing our rolls through attrition and we are not enrolling new people'' in certain categories. Among those excluded are pregnant women, breast-feeding women and infants whose diet has been diagnosed as inadequate, but who show no clinical signs of malnutrition.
Lynne McElroy, chief of nutrition service for the Oklahoma Health Department, said, ''We have to reduce our caseload by about 15,000 people, to 40,000.''
Iowa intends to remove 4,000 people from its program, which now serves 49,000 people, Mr. Bach said.
 
Savings Were Eaten Away
New York State, which had an average of 380,000 people on its rolls in the first half of the current fiscal year, is trying to get down to 360,000. New Jersey has curtailed eligibility for people in certain ''low priority'' categories.
Connecticut no longer allows the use of Federal funds to buy orange juice, the most popular source of vitamin C, suggesting instead pineapple, apple or grapefruit juice because they cost less.
The WIC program accounts for one-third of the nation's infant formula sales. In the last two years, many states exploited their market share, demanded competitive bids and won substantial volume discounts from formula makers. States used the savings to provide services to more people, as the Federal Government told them to do.
But food price increases have eaten up the savings. From April 1989 to April 1990, retail prices rose 13.3 percent for fruit juices, 11.1 percent for fresh whole milk and 5.9 percent for cereals. Over all, food prices rose 6.2 percent while the Consumer Price Index for all items increased 4.7 percent.
Ralph L. Parlett, an economist at the Department of Agriculture, said orange juice prices soared because of the freeze that ravaged the Florida citrus crop in December. Dairy prices increased sharply because of a decline in milk production, he added; there was ''less milk per cow'' because the animals were eating poor-quality forage in pastures devastated by the 1988 drought. He noted that Federal policy encourages farmers to slaughter cows to eliminate a longstanding surplus of dairy products.
Harry H. Harp, another economist at the Agriculture Department, said cereal prices had risen in part because of higher grain prices resulting from the 1988 drought. Another factor, he said, was increased consumer demand for cereals, spurred by reports that a high-fiber diet helps to prevent cancer.
Federal officials sometimes defend cuts in the monthly food package by saying that beneficiaries can still get the recommended daily allowance of nutrients like calcium, iron, protein, vitamin A and vitamin C. But Mrs. Stabeno of Texas said, ''You can get 100 percent of the R.D.A. and still be hungry.''

HEADLINE: EVOLUTION IN EUROPE;
IN MOSCOW SHOPS, STOICISM APLENTY

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 28

 BODY:
Moscow stores featured fresh supplies of stoicism today, with shoppers forced to brandish their domestic passports and face a ration list rapidly growing to include everything from light bulbs to socks.
Today, the City Council promulgated limits on dozens of basic items of food, clothing and household needs to combat hoarding and to give Moscow residents priority over the daily caravans of shoppers from the provinces who come here looking for the nation's increasingly scarce goods.
In long lines all over the city, Muscovites obediently held up their internal passports to cashiers to prove their right to buy from the limited range of goods.
''I'm a pessimist and I am afraid of all this,'' said Yelena Averenov, who waited in a sausage line at the crowded Yeliseyev state store. 
''I have only a pensioner's income, and I do not like the way Gorbachev is doing this,'' she said, reflecting confusion and aggravation among shoppers even as they obeyed the rationing. The restriction took effect the day before President Gorbachev was to depart Moscow on his way to meet President Bush in Washington.
Mrs. Averenov clutched her passport and anticipated a deepening of the Soviet shoppers' rut on July 1, when the Gorbachev government has said it will raise bread prices in an opening move to repair the failed, oversubsidized national economy.
Lyudmila Kremlikov, one of the many Muscovites expressing relief that they may now have priority over out-of-towners, said: 'Personally, I do not mind. I hope it improves the situation.''
Her husband, Vladimir, expressing general skepticism that the looming emergency measures would prove effective, said, ''But we still need a true market economy.'' .
 
A Wave of Panic Buying
A wave of panic shopping swept the city and much of the nation last week within minutes of the Kremlin's initial word that prices of bread - the single most symbolically important consumer item - would be tripled July 1, with other food prices to rise six months later.
''Let us not be mistaken and think this is the beginning of a free market,'' said Givi Nebiyeridze, proprietor of the Lavash Cooperative Bakery, where prices are already higher than in state stores. Mr. Nebiyeridze pays more for his ingredients and his customers are willing to pay more for the 800 loaves of flat, round Georgian bread he makes daily.
''All the price rise amounts to is an attempt to cut back the state budget deficit,'' he said, stressing the hesitancy Mr. Gorbachev was showing as he attempted to craft what he calls a ''regulated market economy'' as a centrally planned halfway measure toward a true free market.
 
Halfway Measures Futile
Mr. Nebiyeridze said that halfway measures were futile under Kemlin dictates that neglect such market factors as shoppers' demand for a better product like the more toothsome, traditionally baked bread that attracts people to his shop.
They pay 70 kopecks a loaf, about 11 cents at the current exchange rate for tourists, instead of the 45 kopecks or about 7 cents charged for inferior bread in state stores. But on the other hand they are not required to show a passport, as they now must in state stores.
''Passports?'' he laughed. ''We are interested in making and selling bread, not regulating customers.''
His state ''competitor,'' Vasily V. Molodykh, manager of Bread Factory No. 5 down the block, tended to agree.
''So far, I do not sense the economic essence of a free market,'' he said after noting that many Muscovites agreed that bread has been traditionally so underpriced - as a symbol of the revolution -that the price increase ''should have been done five years ago.''
''Bread is the result of hard work, and a nation's attitude toward bread shows its attitude toward labor itself,'' he said, repeating tales that bread is so cheap it is thrown into the streets or fed to farm animals.
 
'I Think It's Terrible'
Faina Dombkovemaya, a customer lined up outside bread window, put four loaves in her shopping bag and saw little hope in the price rise. ''I think it's terrible,'' she said. ''It's not that I cannot afford to pay more for bread and milk. It's that this will have a negative effect on a situation that is already bad enough. It will deprive us of our future.''
The passport order was issued by the Moscow City Council soon after the bread panic left stores swamped with shoppers. Sales of flour, pasta, cooking oil and other staples increased eightfold and supplies were quickly running out. The city government followed up today with a long list of prescribed purchase limits on specific consumer goods.
Beyond such limits as three pairs of socks and five light bulbs per customer, the ration list ranged from wallpaper (eight rolls) to musical instruments (one) and pencils (five), cigarettes (10 packs) and umbrellas (one).
''How could we be the first with perestroika and now we are lagging behind all the other East European countries?'' Mrs. Kremlikov asked as she waited in the sausage line. ''They had a shorter period of totalitarian government. Our roots go deeper,'' she said, her passport at the ready.

HEADLINE: As Hong Kong Elite Are Leaving, Japanese Investors Are Moving In

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: HONG KONG, May 26

 BODY:
At a time when thousands of Hong Kong's elite are vying for Canadian passports and its oldest companies are registering in the Bahamas, something unexpected is happening. The Japanese, usually among the world's most cautious investors, are moving into town.
As the countdown continues to 1997, when Britain will return Hong Kong to China, money is rapidly flowing out of the colony. Economic growth this year, the Government said last week, has slowed to just above zero.
But this does not seem to bother the Japanese, who - though they acknowledge a glimmer of self-doubt - see a giant buying opportunity, a chance to build a bigger base camp for doing business in China a decade from now. 
 
Filling a Vacuum
Though exact statistics are not available, by most estimates Japan invested about $2 billion here last year, a record. That brings its total investment to roughly $8 billion, more than that of the United States for the first time.
The result is that Japan now has, at least for the time being, power and prestige in Hong Kong on a scale not seen in 45 years. As native businesses and even a few remnants of British colonial power decamp, sped by memories of the Chinese Government's crackdown on the democracy movement in Tiananmen Square last June, Japan is filling the vacuum, a vacuum of both money and power.
Hong Kong's richest and most influential executives are still the Hong Kong Chinese. But today Japanese investors are courted and dined, primarily because their presence is seen as another insurance policy against China's intervention in the city's freewheeling and largely unregulated ways.
The British, by contrast, are viewed as lame ducks, powerless to enforce the guarantees they received from China when they agreed to cede control of the colony.
''Japan is China's biggest provider of foreign aid,'' one prominent Hong Kong executive said the other day. ''We have to hope that China will see that it is not in its interest to anger the Japanese here.'' The Japanese, in turn, tend to view Western nations, particularly the United States, as hopelessly romantic about China, overly enthralled about the country in the 1980's and too quick to flee when the crackdown came.
Traditionally, Japanese and American businesses have regarded Hong Kong as not only a convenient regional trading center but also a steppingstone to China. From Hong Kong, they could commission manufacturing work on the mainland and test Beijing's hospitality to investment. When things turned sour on the mainland, they could retreat to Hong Kong. Now, with each passing month, the colony seems increasingly like an abundantly rich corner of an otherwise poor nation.
So, Japan's approach has been to build up steadily, assuming that liberals and hardliners will come and go but that all will discover the lure of Japanese capital. There are more than 50 Japanese banks here now, with effective veto power over big projects like the $16 billion airport the Hong Kong government is trying to build, and more than 30 Japanese securities firms.
''I think Japan has big confidence that after 1997, Beijing will understand that Hong Kong is special,'' said Hiroshi Zaizen, the chairman of the Mitsubishi Corporation's subsidiary here and one of the city's most influential Japanese executives.
 
Big Money to Be Made
While China is the main reason that Japanese companies come to Hong Kong, there is still big money to be made in the colony itself.
Most Japanese department stores have opened in the tourist centers here to serve Japanese tourists -usually selling them products at lower prices than they could find at the same department stores in Tokyo. But Japan's Yaohan Department Store Company has opened a giant store in a boom town in the New Territories - part of the colony that is near the mainland border - hoping to tap the market for the half-million Hong Kong workers who live in giant new apartment buildings in the area.
The Japanese confidence in Hong Kong's future is hardly ironclad. Japanese companies have for the most part avoided big real estate purchases, preferring more liquid investments. If disaster should strike, much of the money can be pulled out -much the same strategy Japan has pursued on the mainland. ''On June 29, 1997, we can always press a button, I guess,'' Mr. Zaizen said.
Meanwhile, evidence mounts that Hong Kong's natives are already pressing that button. A recent study by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation showed that the transfer of capital abroad last year increased 10-fold, though no one knows what that figure means because Hong Kong does not measure capital inflows. Putting the best face on things, the Government said the figure was a measure of the health of the economy because it showed Hong Kong companies were investing abroad. The more common explanation is that people are leaving the country and taking their bank accounts with them.
 
Japan's 'Sky High' Investor
But then there are exceptions like Kazuo Wada, the owner of Yaohan. Mr. Wada surprised both Tokyo and Hong Kong when he decided last year to move his corporate empire here.
Earlier this month, in another symbol of the shifting power structurehere, Mr. Wada became the new owner of ''Sky High'' - a palace of turrets, a half acre of floor space and views of the South China Sea from all windows - perched atop ''the Peak,'' the striking hill that dominates Hong Kong Island. The sprawling villa had been built, at exorbitant cost, by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking, one of this city's oldest and richest institutions, as the official residence of its chairman.
But these are more conservative days for Hong Kong institutions, and so the bank company, after three unsuccessful tries, persuaded a reluctant Mr. Wada to buy the house for $11 million. His company said the purchase was mostly intended to cement good relations; Mr. Wada himself plans to live in modest accommodations.
''Perhaps it would make a nice guest house,'' said Yuji Sakuma, the managing director of Yaohan's Hong Kong operations.
 
The Social Whirl
The wedding of Mr. Wada's daughter a few months ago was viewed as an enormous social event in Hong Kong, and it was one example of how mightily Japan has risen in the social pecking order in Hong Kong.
Another was the creation of the Dynasty Club, an exclusive club intended to rival Hong Kong's legendary Jockey Club, a bastion of the British establishment. The wealthy Hong Kong Chinese who started the club asked three people to act as initial ''patrons'' to draw Hong Kong's rich and powerful. The three were the head of the New China News Agency - China's unofficial diplomatic representative - and the senior American and Japanese diplomats here.
The American official declined, but few here missed the symbolism of the fact that the British were not asked.
 
Some Deep Resentments
But if many people in Hong Kong are reassured by Japanese investment, not everyone is pleased. Resentments of World War II run deep, and the city still holds a ceremony each August to mark its liberation from the Japanese forces at the end of World War II, though attendance grows sparser every year.
''The businessmen need Japan, so it is convenient for most of the city to forget,'' said Jack Edwards, who heads a group of former prisoners of war who have mounted a campaign here to recall Japanese war crimes. Older Chinese often refer to the Japanese in derogatory terms, he said, ''and my generation doesn't like their arrival at all.'' He added, ''I guess it was inevitable.''
Today the Peninsula Hotel, once Japan's military headquarters here, swarms with Japanese tourists. Executives in the growing Japanese population here, estimated at 16,000, often leave their families in Hong Kong and spend the week across the Chinese border in Guangdong province, where companies like Sanyo have large factories.
 
Japanese View of the Risk
The risk of investing in Hong Kong is viewed by Japan as no worse than the risk of investing in China itself. And Japanese businesses say they are eager to do more, as soon as World Bank lending resumes and the Japanese Government releases $500 million in economic development assistance that has been withheld since Tiananmen Square.
The World Bank has put forward two loans to China for its board to approve on Tuesday. The United States has said it can support one of the loans - $300 million for tree planting to combat deforestation - because its meets basic human needs. But the United States is opposed to the other loan, $150 million to upgrade roads and inland waterways in Jiangsu province.
''We are still nervous,'' said Fumio Hashimoto, who heads the Bank of Tokyo office here. ''No one would say that we have 100 percent confidence in the future of Hong Kong. But in the medium to long term, we know it is important.''
 
Plans for New Airport
Still, Japan is carefully picking and choosing in its investments. And it is in those choices that Japan's presence is likely to be felt most strikingly in coming years.
Plans for the new airport illustrate the tensions in the relationship. No one questions the need for a far larger airport. Hong Kong's enormous volume of air traffic is currently funneled through a single, short runway. The runway approach comes perilously close to one of Kowloon's densely packed neighborhoods - so close that passengers about to land can see families preparing dinner in nearby apartments.
So last year the Hong Kong government planned a giant airport to be built on an outer island and connected to Hong Kong by a long bridge. Roughly half the $16 billion cost is expected to be picked up by private investors. Japanese engineering and cement companies are eager for a piece of the action; so are companies like the Bechtel Group in the United States, which has been chosen to coordinate the project.
 
Need for China's Blessing
The problem is that the Hong Kong government barely consulted China before laying out details of the plan. The Chinese are suspicious that Hong Kong will use the airport to empty the colony's coffers before 1997. They have signaled general approval of the project, but not enthusiastically.
As a result, the Japanese banks -already burned by lending to hotels on the mainland that today have few guests and little way to pay back debt - say they will be very cautious. Recently, a senior Hong Kong government official went to Tokyo - the first such visit - to drum up support. He got smiles but few commitments. ''We need the Chinese blessing,'' said Mr. Hashimoto of the Bank of Tokyo. ''We still have no detailed studies, and the time is short.''

HEADLINE: Company-Financed Pensions Are Failing to Fulfill Promise

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The company-financed pension, once envisioned as a principal source of retirement income for millions of Americans, is instead an ever-shrinking portion of the money they receive in later years. The trend could force today's generation of wage earners to rely heavily on Social Security and savings.
Among the roughly six million people getting pension checks from former employers, only 7 percent depend on them for half their income, Government surveys show. In fact, a growing number of these people have told the Government that their company pensions have shrunk to less than a fifth of their retirement income.
 
Low-Wage Jobs a Factor
''The hope was that Social Security for the baby-boom generation would be more of a supplement to retirement income and less of the mainstay that it is today,'' said Prof. Olivia Mitchell, a pension specialist at Cornell University. ''Now that hope is fading.'' 
Many changes help to explain the stagnation in company pension benefits, among them a decline in the number of manufacturing jobs and a rise in low-wage, service-sector employment. Manufacturing remains a stronghold of prosperous company pension plans, and many small service companies consider them too costly to provide.
Another problem has been adjustment for inflation. While every Social Security check is increased annually to offset inflation, only one in four company pension checks was so adjusted in the late 1980's, the Labor Department says. Even the American Telephone and Telegraph Company, which finances one of the nation's most lucrative pension plans, has increased pensions only twice since 1985 - by 4.3 percent that year and 4.1 percent in 1988. The Consumer Price Index went up 18.3 percent from 1985 to 1989.
A third reason is that many compa-nies are making much greater use of a new type of pension plan, which departs from the old practice in which a company guarantees a monthly retirement check pegged to a worker's wages. The new pension plans provide various ways for workers and employers to save money jointly, without paying taxes until the money is spent.
 
New Plans Paying Less
The companies prefer the new plans because the traditional plans are almost always financed entirely by the employer. In addition, the new plans are not so heavily regulated by the Federal Government.
Companies have been able to adopt these new pension plans in part because of the decline in the power of unions, which are strong advocates of company-financed pensions.
But the pensions that come from these new ''defined contribution'' plans are almost always smaller than those that flow from the traditional, or ''defined benefit,'' plans, according to a survey of 763 corporations by the Wyatt Company, a consulting firm. Under the new plans, the annual pension for a retiree who had been earning $15,000 a year averaged 19 percent of this income, or $2,850. Under a traditional plan, the average pension for the same retiree would have been $4,200 a year, or 28 percent of the old salary.
The Wyatt survey found that similar differences existed elsewhere along the salary scale, up to $100,000.
 
Growth After World War II
Company pension plans grew spectacularly in the years after World War II. By the late 1970's, nearly half of the nation's wage earners were enrolled, double the coverage in 1950. Many were war veterans, and as the first of them retired in the 1960's, company pension payments became an ever large share of the total income going to the over-65 population - reaching 7 percent in 1976, from only 3 percent in 1962.
And then growth stopped. More than a decade later, enrollment in pension plans is still about 46 percent of the nation's wage earners, and the pensions themselves still provide only 7 percent of total income received by people over 65, Government data indicate.
What is more, alone among the principal sources of income for people over 65, company pensions failed to keep up with inflation in the 1980's.
Social Security, pensions paid to retired government employees, interest and dividends on savings, and wages from jobs held by people over 65 all kept pace with or exceeded the inflation rate, the Labor Department says.
These other sources of income did so well that the median income of the nation's over-65 population rose to $20,520 in 1986 for married couples, from $5,358 in 1976 - an increase that exceeded the inflation rate even though the portion from company pension plans fell behind.
 
Counter to Bush Goals
''What we are finding is that the company pension plan is not going to become an integral part of employment in the United States,'' said Joseph Piacentini, a pension specialist at the Employee Benefit Research Institute.
The unfulfilled promise of company pensions runs counter to the Bush Administration's goals, which seek relief from the annual cost-of-living increases in Social Security benefits. ''Our goal is that private pensions should provide a significant share of retirement income, and for many more people,'' said Ann Combs, the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Labor for pension and welfare benefits.
Right now, Social Security payments are far and away the prime source of income among the more than 22 million Americans over age 65. Sixty-two percent of these people receive at least half their income from Social Security.
 
Lack of Current Data
Ms. Combs said the Administration had not taken a ''hard look'' at what is happening to company pensions. One obstacle is outdated Government retirement data. Some information is four years old, and that gathered in 1988 is just now being published by the Census Bureau, the Labor Department and the Social Security Administration. None of that data offer a detailed look at the other income sources for company pensioners.
But the available data and interviews with more than a dozen Government and industry officials lead to the conclusion that in the 1980's, corporate America held back on company-financed pensions. Ms. Combs did not challenge this conclusion, although in the absence of a fresh round of data, she hesitated to accept it. ''It is very difficult to get a handle on corporate pensions,'' she said.
Whatever the shortcomings, the data flash a warning to the generation born between 1946 and 1964, whose members are likely to retire between 2010 and 2030.
 
An Alternative: Keep Working
''If Social Security ceases to provide the same real benefits that it is providing today, then one alternative will be to ask the aging baby-boomers to keep on working,'' said Professor Mitchell of Cornell. That would reverse a current trend. Many corporations encouraged early retirement to shrink staff and cut costs.
What is more, if company pensions provide a smaller share of retirement income, then Congress might re-examine whether they are worth the huge tax deductions that go to corporations and workers channeling income into pension funds. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimates that in the next fiscal year, starting Oct. 1, these deductions will cost the Treasury $52.2 billion in tax revenue. No other category is so costly. The runners-up are deductions for health care, with $33.3 billion in lost taxes, and for home mortgages, $31.9 billion.
''Congress has been tinkering for 15 years with tax incentives to get corporations to improve their pension plans, and we still have not gotten it right,'' said Phyllis Borzi, counsel for employee benefits on the House Subcommittee on Labor-Management Relations. But Ms. Borzi added that Congress is unlikely to ''go after the tax incentives for pension funds in a major way, unless the budget deficit gets really unbearable.''
 
Defined-Contribution Plans
Perhaps the biggest impact on pensions has come from the increasing use of the defined-contribution pension. Most such plans are savings funds built up through profit-sharing or employer and employee contributions to savings accounts, including 401(k) plans, that allow workers to reduce their taxable income by the amount of their contributions.
As of 1988, about 15 percent of the nation's 92 million wage earners were covered by such plans, compared with only 6 percent in 1975. Over the same period, the more standard defined-benefit plan has faded slowly, to 31 percent of all wage earners in 1988, from 39 percent in 1975, the Labor Department reports. These plans are almost always financed by employers, and they typically guarantee that retirees will continue to receive 25 percent or more of their average salary.
Company officials say Federal regulations forced them to promote defined-contribution plans. These plans are far less regulated than defined-benefit plans, largely because they promise to pay only the principal, which a retiree can collect on leaving a job, plus whatever interest is earned on accumulated savings.
 
Defined-Benefit Plans Costlier
Because defined-benefit plans promise a specific monthly payment, the Government requires employers to have pension insurance to guarantee their ability to make payments.
The insurance costs come to $16 to $18 a year for each employee, said Barry Podob, a vice president at the Interpublic Group of Companies, an advertising agency with 4,000 employees enrolled in its pension plans. Many companies say these costs, if passed on as higher prices for their goods or services, can put them at a competitive disadvantage.
The defined-contribution plans are not only less costly for employers, but also tempt workers. Over enough years, these savings pools can grow big enough to provide handsome retirement incomes, and younger workers can watch their savings grow.
 
More Alternatives for Employees
Under Federal rules, when these workers resign from a job they are allowed to cash in the pension savings and either roll it into a retirement fund at a new company or pay the tax on the accumulated savings and spend the money.
''For the younger worker not yet thinking about old age, this is attractive; this is now the 'me' generation,'' said Mr. Podob of Interpublic, whose work force averages 37 years of age.
But there is a danger. A Labor Department survey found that 34 percent of workers with this choice cash in their accumulated savings and use the money for consumer purchases. Eleven percent roll the money into a tax-deferred retirement account, and more than 50 percent invest it in a home, pay off a mortgage or make some other investment.
The upshot is that many workers risk being left short of retirement income. The spending of accumulated pension savings early in life has become enough of a problem that Elizabeth H. Dole, the Secretary of Labor, has asked Congress to strengthen the incentives for rolling over pensions into retirement accounts.
''The single largest source of losses appears to be the simple fact that people are spending their pensions before retirement,'' she said.

HEADLINE: UNEQUAL BURDEN: NEW YORK CITY PROPERTY TAXES - A SPECIAL REPORT:
Some of the Rich Pay Less Tax Than the Other Homeowners

BYLINE: By ALAN FINDER with RICHARD LEVINE

 BODY:
New York City's property-tax system, which has been criticized for a decade for placing a heavier burden on less-affluent homeowners than on wealthier ones, appears to have grown more inequitable.
And the latest and most ambitious attempt at reform missed many of the poorer neighborhoods that have suffered the longest, a computer-assisted study by The New York Times has found.
The disparities are so glaring that owners of expensive houses sometimes pay lower property taxes than owners of much cheaper homes. Owners of houses of similar value often pay wildly different taxes.
A brownstone worth $506,000 at 380 Clinton Street in the Carroll Gardens section of South Brooklyn has a lower tax bill than a small ranch house worth $175,000 at 148-63 Edgewood Street in the working-class neighborhood of Rosedale, Queens. 
A house worth $185,000 at 129-01 Ninth Avenue in College Point, Queens, carries a lower tax than a house worth $157,000 at 191-22 109th Road in St. Albans, Queens.
In general, according to a report in January by State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, the victims of the system own homes in poor and working-class sections like Eastchester and Wakefield in the Bronx, East Flatbush and Bedford-Stuyvesant in Brooklyn and Rosedale and South Jamaica, Queens.
Those homeowners, most of them black and Hispanic, are taxed more in proportion to the value of their houses than homeowners in wealthier areas.
City officials acknowledge that the system has produced inequities; they have made large-scale efforts to cut excessive tax bills at least three times in the last decade. Most recently, in January, the Finance Department reduced the assessments - the fraction of a property's estimated value, on which real-estate taxes are based -for 70,000 houses. The reductions mean the city will forgo a record total of about $30 million in property taxes.
The Times computer study of the 70,000 reductions found that half went to houses in one borough, Staten Island. Just 15 percent of the one-, two- and three-family houses in the city are on Staten Island. Yet the owners of two of every five houses in the relatively well-to-do borough were awarded reductions. Citywide, taxes were cut for 11 percent of all houses. The disparities Mr. Regan found involved houses, not co-ops, condominiums and rental apartments, which are taxed differently.
The Times analysis, which was based on assessment data provided by the Finance Department, also showed that half the tax cuts went to houses worth at least $200,000.
 
Overtaxed, Before and After
Although the reductions relieved some overburdened areas and some types of overtaxed housing, particularly newer units on Staten Island, they failed to lower taxes for houses in many of the very neighborhoods that have been overtaxed for decades.
The findings of study raise fresh concerns about the fairness of the $7 billion-a-year property tax, the largest source of revenue in the city's $28 billion budget, at a time when New York faces huge budget deficits and will almost certainly be forced to raise property-tax rates.
City and state officials blame history and politics for the inequities. As the value of houses rose over many decades, the city seldom revised its assessments. As a result, the tax on more expensive houses was based on a lower and lower percentage of their actual worth.
In response to a court decision that would have forced the city to raise taxes on underassessed properties, the Legislature decided to protect homeowners. It approved a bill in 1981 that prohibits the city from raising assessments on one-, two- and three-family houses more than 6 percent a year and more than 20 percent over five years.
City officials now say that the law, which the Koch administration supported, severely limited them in doing what was needed to correct inequities: raising assessments on houses that grew rapidly in value in the unprecedented real-estate surge of the 80's.
But the Comptroller and others, including the head of a city commission that studied the tax structure, say the city, too, is responsible for inconsistent assessment practices and for failing to use all the tools available under the state law to make the system fairer.
Finance Commissioner Carol O'Cleireacain said she was determined to address what she called ''the blatant inequalities'' in the property tax. She promised to overhaul the system, but she did not say how.
 
Those Who Benefit Vote
A wholesale revision of the property tax would need the approval of the City Council and the Legislature. But the Dinkins administration is not likely to find much support in either chamber. Both have repeatedly acted in the last 10 years to retain the status quo, in part because the beneficiaries of the system - many of whom would face steep increases if it were made more equitable - are determined to preserve it, and they constitute a large vocal voting bloc.
''Revising the whole system would be a good thing to do, but it is a very long-term venture,'' said Assemblyman George Friedman, Democrat of the Bronx and chairman of the Committee on Real Property Taxation.
Edward L. Sadowsky, former chairman of the Council Finance Committee and the head of the city's Tax Study Commission, said political realities had made the property tax difficult to change.
''My house is exhibit 1,'' said Mr. Sadowsky, who lives in Beechhurst, Queens. ''It has gone up eight-fold in value since I bought it in 1969, while the taxes on the house have maybe gone up 20 or 25 percent. It's a great deal.'' Flaws in the System A Pricier House But a Smaller Tax Every year assessors estimate the market value of each of the nearly 609,000 one-, two- and three-family houses in the city. The assessment is a fraction of that projection, with the fraction set annually by the city.
An examination by The Times of sales of houses in Brooklyn, Queens and the Bronx in 1989 showed that assessments and tax bills can have little relation to the actual values of the houses.
A four-story brownstone at 380 Clinton Street in Carroll Gardens was sold in November for $506,000. It is assessed at $12,080.
In the less-affluent neighborhood of Rosedale, a small one-story ranch house at 148-63 Edgewood Street was sold in October for $175,000. Its assessment is $12,720, or $640 higher than the Brooklyn house that is worth nearly three times as much.
At the 1990 tax rate for single-family homes - $9.452 for each $100 of assessed value - the tax on the $175,000 house would be $1,202. The tax on the $506,000 house would be $1,141.
Not all the disparities were between well-to-do primarily white neighborhoods and less-wealthy parts, where minorities live. Two houses in similar middle-class areas of Brooklyn with virtually the same assessment were sold last year. One, at 7724 10th Avenue in the Bay Ridge area, was bought for $395,000 and is assessed at $17,040. The other, at 1780 East Ninth Street near Kings Highway sold for $900,000 and is assessed at $17,670. Mapping the Failures Inequities Know No Boundaries If such cases seem extreme, the Comptroller's study indicates that disparities are the rule rather than the exception. The report, based on a review of three years of house sales, found ''a distressing lack of uniformity within every property class and within almost every neighborhood in the city.''
In general, it noted, ''the less valuable the property, the more it is taxed in relation to its market value.'' In 1988, the report found, owners of an average one-family house worth less than $100,000 paid almost twice the property tax per dollar of market value than owners of an average house worth more than $200,000.
Mr. Regan, echoing city officials, placed some of the blame on the law limiting assessment increases. That constrained the city from increasing assessments and taxes as fast as real-estate prices were rising in many desirable neighborhoods like Park Slope and Cobble Hill in Brooklyn and Forest Hills, Queens. That factor gave these areas a relative advantage over stable or declining areas.
Owners of one-family houses in the Fort Greene section, for example, pay twice as much tax in proportion to the values of their houses than nearby homeowners in Brooklyn's most expensive neighborhood, Brooklyn Heights.
 
The Rich May Suffer, Too
The system is so inconsistent that great disparities show up even between affluent communities. Houses in Cobble Hill and the Riverdale section of the Bronx sold for an average of $400,000 in 1984, 1988 and 1989, the years studied by the Comptroller. But Riverdale homeowners paid nearly three times more property tax than those in Cobble Hill.
Assessing is not an exact science. Each one-, two- and three-family house, a total of 608,843 in January, is evaluated every year by assessors. They examine the properties, analyze sale prices and use sophisticated computer programs to determine assessments. The State Board of Equalization, which monitors the property-tax system, says a residential property is properly assessed if the ratio of its assessment to its market value is within 10 percent of the average ratio for such properties citywide.
The Comptroller's study found, however, that in 1988 and 1989 the average assessment error in the city was 43 percent for one-family houses. On a house valued at $200,000, the owner should have paid $1,153 in property tax. But with a 43 percent assessment error, there was an equal chance that the owner paid taxes as high as $1,648 or as low as $658.
The average error was even worse for other properties, the study concluded. In 1988 and 1989, the annual tax on a walk-up apartment building worth $300,000 could have been as little as $982 or as much as $6,100.
Mr. Regan's office documented similar, though less extreme, disparities in a report released in 1981. Still, the new findings surprised the Comptroller's staff, because the city had followed all its major recommendations, including hiring additional assessors and using computers more sophisticatedly.
In another report in 1981, the New York Public Interest Research Group said that two of every three houses that it surveyed were incorrectly assessed and that ''individuals owning less-expensive homes are generally discriminated against.''
The Equalization and Assessment Board has found similar patterns.
The city commissioned researchers from New York University to study the tax. Their report in 1980 stated, ''The present system discriminates substantially in favor of better-off households.''
The report recommended that the city assess all property at full market value. Proponents say that that would let a homeowner judge the accuracy of an assessment and compare it easily with others. The Koch administration never released the report. A 'Remedy' Tried Assessments Cut, But Bias Remained Even within the current system the city can make taxes fairer by lowering assessments on properties that have been overvalued. It tried to do that in January, with the reductions for 70,000 houses.
The Times analysis found that 34,727 of the reductions, or about half, went to Staten Island. That meant that nearly 40 percent of 89,712 one-, two- and three-family houses in the borough received tax cuts. An additional 20,662 reductions went in Queens, or 8 percent of the borough's houses.
Half the reductions citywide went to houses worth at least $200,000, the computer study showed, and 40 percent went to houses built in the last 20 years.
Less expensive houses, particularly in working-class areas of Brooklyn and the Bronx, have historically been among the most overassessed. But the study found that the reductions in January hardly benefited the owners of those homes at all. Just 13,640 houses of all types were awarded reductions in those two boroughs.
 
Some Corrections Made
Finance Department officials said their strategy had been based purely on mathematical calculations. They tried to identify and redress overassessments by lowering the assessment ratio, to 8 percent of market value this year from 8.9 percent last year.
The Times study showed that the strategy apparently succeeded in correcting the tax bills of newer houses. Because of court rulings, newer houses tend to be assessed at higher rates than those for older houses. But the reductions did not succeed in eliminating the other, more longstanding, bias noted by the series of reports on the tax.
''To the extent that it did not address all the inequities, it was a partial solution,'' Jeffrey Schanback, a Deputy Finance Commissioner, said of the city's corrections.
Of course, as the property values soared in the 1980's, the city also increased the assessments on hundreds of thousands of houses each year. Last year, the assessments on 526,800 houses were raised, and in January 537,500 homeowners saw their assessments increase.
A preliminary survey by the Finance Department in 1986 suggested that assessments were going up more than 5 percent a year, close to the legal limit, in many desirable neighborhoods. But neither the department nor outside monitors determined whether the city had increased the assessments on all applicable properties to the full extent allowed by state law. Faulting the City Some of those who have studied the property tax said the city could have done more this year to eliminate inequities. They said the city should have gone further by reducing assessments on more houses or, as a matter of social policy, by concentrating on helping poorer homeowners saddled with unfairly high tax bills.
''It's just as arbitrary as the rest of the system, just as back room and roll of the dice as everything else they do,'' said Gene Russianoff of the New York Public Interest Research Group. ''They should be targeting the low- and moderate-value homes.''
Finance Department officials said they had corrected the assessments that were most out of line.
But others questioned the reliability of the formulas, particularly because they are based on the city's estimates of market values. The Comptroller's study indicated that actual sale prices were often much higher than the city's estimates of market values.
Among the properties examined by The Times, there were sometimes vast discrepancies between sale prices and the city's market-value estimates. The house in the Kings Highway area of Brooklyn that sold for $900,000 was valued by the city at $349,000. Two other houses in Brooklyn sold for $650,000; one was valued by the city at $720,000 and the other at $281,000.
Another two houses were estimated by the city to have the same value, $225,000. One sold for $165,000 and the other for $368,000.
Perhaps the most egregious example was a house in Manhattan that sold last year for $8.3 million. The city subsequently estimated its market value at $4.7 million and, following its formulas, awarded the property a $27,000 cut in its assessment. The new owner will save $2,550 in taxes. A 'Remedy' Avoided When Politics Enters the Equation When Ms. O'Cleireacain, then an economist for District Council 37, the municipal employees' union, testified 10 years ago in Albany on full-market assessment, she said she was in favor of it - and she was spat upon by a spectator.
Now that she is Finance Commissioner, Ms. O'Cleireacain hedges on the issue. But she added in an interview, ''Blatant inequalities are simply, at some point, unacceptable.''
The consensus among outside experts is that the city should move to full-market assessments. Buffalo and Rochester have done so, and Syracuse is shifting to it. But it seems unlikely that New York will follow soon. ''From a practical point of view, you couldn't do it,'' said Assemblyman Friedman.
It is not that lawmakers are unaware of the inequities. Mr. Friedman tells the story of two legislators, one from Staten Island and one from Brooklyn. The Brooklynite's house is more expensive, Mr. Friedman said, but the Staten Islander's house has a higher assessment and tax bill.
 
A Break? Not at All
In a sense, the current system seems almost calculated to perpetuate itself. Its beneficiaries would pay more if the system were made more equitable, and so they fight to retain it. Victims often do not even know they are overtaxed. When they receive a notice of an assessment increase, they see that their home is assessed at a fraction of what it is worth and may think they are getting a break, unaware that others are assessed at far lower rates.
''The tax notices are designed to hoodwink the taxpayers,'' Mr. Russianoff said. ''People are led to believe that somehow they are getting away with something.''
But if some of them are overassessed, as a group owners of houses have received preferential treatment compared with owners of other properties. State law permits the city to assess commercial property at much higher percentages of market values. The law also allows the city to raise assessments on rental apartment buildings, as well as on co-operatives and condominiums, much more quickly than on houses. Impact on Office Buildings In addition, the City Council has been able to raise or lower the share of property-tax revenue borne by the various types of properties by as much as 5 percent a year. In large part because of the Council's actions, the share paid by one-, two- and three-family houses was reduced, from 14.1 percent of the total in 1983 to 11.6 percent last year.
At the same time, the burden on office buildings and factories grew, from 41.6 to 47.8 percent, city records show. Yet the values of one-, two- and three-family houses rose faster than commercial properties.
''It's pure politics, in terms of who votes in this city, and one-, two- and three-family homeowners vote,'' said Steven Spinola, president of the Real Estate Board of New York.
 
Comparing The Houses
To study patterns of real-estate tax-assessment reductions in New York City, The New York Times obtained computer records of the 70,000 reductions on one- two- and three-family homes from the Finance Department.
The records were used to create a computer database that permitted analysis of the number and extent of reductions by characteristics like location, age and market value.
To allow comparisons to earlier studies by the State Comptroller's office, the records were matched by block and lot number to the Comptroller's definitions of neighborhoods.
 
To Request A Reduction
Homeowners who think their property is overassessed can seek reductions from the New York City Tax Commission. Commission members, who have wide discretion to grant or deny assessment reductions, hold hearings early each spring.
Applicants have to show their assessments are unreasonably high by comparison with houses of similar worth. This year, the city set assessments for one-,> two- and three-family houses at 8 percent of market value.

HEADLINE: Iraqi Takes Harsh Line at Meeting

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 28

 BODY:
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq set a bellicose and anti-American tone for the Arab summit meeting here today, despite efforts by Egypt and Saudi Arabia to mute inflammatory oratory.
As Arab leaders opened the meeting, Mr. Hussein took a hard line against Israel and the United States, apparently in an effort to carve out a new role as a leader among the Arabs.
Mr. Hussein warned again that he would respond to any Israeli use of weapons of mass destruction against his country by using comparable weapons against Israel.
The comments reflect what officials here call Iraq's profound suspicion that Israel is preparing a pre-emptive strike against Baghdad's growing military strength. 
The summit meeting, called by President Hussein and Yasir Arafat, chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization, is intended to focus on growing Soviet Jewish immigration to Israel, and also Iraq's attempt to gain support against what Baghdad sees as a Western campaign to thwart its acquisition of advanced weaponry. #5 Leaders Are Absent But its impact has been diluted by the absence of five Arab leaders, particularly President Hafez al-Assad of Syria, one the strongest Arab nations long hostile to President Hussein's Iraqi leadership.
President Hussein identified the United States as the sponsor of Israeli policies. Referring to Israel as ''the Zionist entity'' - a usage abandoned by many Arab countries in recent years - he said it ''would not be able to implement its expansionist policies at the expense of the Arabs were it for the economic and military assistance of the United States.''
''The United States cannot maintain such a policy while professing friendship towards the Arabs,'' he said. Egypt and Saudi Arabia, Arab and Western diplomats said, have sought to avoid an open rift with the United States so as to avert new obstacles in Washington's stalled effort to promote a Palestinian-Israeli discussion.
 
U.S. Responsibility Charged
''The United States,'' the Iraqi leader went on, ''bears major responsibility, even the primary responsibility, for the Israeli aggression directed against the Palestinian people.''
He was apparently alluding to Israeli efforts to crush a Palestinian uprising that has been under way in the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip since December 1988.
The impact of the Arab gathering has been diluted, however, by the absence of leaders from Algeria, Lebanon, Morocco, Oman and Syria, among the 21 members of the Arab League, which include the P.L.O.
Of those countries, the most prominent in Arab diplomacy is Syria since it is the strongest Arab military power sharing a border with Israel. Syria has long cast itself as the custodian of militant Arab politics.
However, Syria and Iraq are estranged by long-standing disputes and President Assad declined an invitation to attend the Baghdad meeting.
 
Qaddafi Flew to Syria
The Libyan leader, Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi, flew to Damascus yesterday to try to persuade President Assad to attend, but did not succeed. His stay in the Syrian capital before he flew to Baghdad forced a delay in the opening of the summit.
The meeting is widely regarded by Western and Arab diplomats as part of an effort by President Hussein to carve out a new role as a leader among Arabs following what Iraq depicts as victory in its war with Iran, stilled by a cease-fire in August 1988.
The gathering thus offers the Iraqi leader a platform to appeal directly to many Arabs frustrated by the slow pace of peace efforts, over the heads of their leaders. By promoting himself as a champion of Arab valor, the Iraqi leader is hoping to obtain a broad Arab constituency, diplomats in the region said.
''If attacked and hit, we will strike back forcefully,'' President Hussein declared today. Referring to Israel, he said: ''If it uses weapons of mass destruction, we will use our own.''
 
Iraqis Perceive a Plot
Last month the Iraqi leader announced that his country had developed a binary chemical weapons capability and would use it to ''burn half of Israel'' if Israel attacked with nuclear weapons. The warning drew widespread Arab support, but diplomats here said it did not imply an Iraqi threat to strike first.
Rather, diplomats said, Iraqi leaders have become certain that a Western and Israeli conspiracy is afoot to prepare for an Israeli strike against Baghdad's chemical warfare and missile capability. The suspicions run deep because Israeli planes launched a long-range strike against an Iraqi nuclear reactor in 1981.

The Road Lies Unpaved, in Spite of All Intentions

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SANTA MARTA, El Salvador

 BODY:
When the army came to this isolated town last month and declared an early Christmas, the residents asked for a better road.
The round black stones that stud the twin tracks into town make driving a bit like riding a jackhammer. During the seven-month rainy season, which begins in April, the road is virtually impassable.
Lieut. Col. Juan Carlos Azcunaga, the deputy commander of the district, agreed to cooperate. He struck a deal with the villagers, 3,500 former refugees who returned after tiring of living in camps in Honduras. Under the arrangement, the army would provide engineers and earth-moving equipment; the residents would provide the labor. 
Both sides billed it as a breakthrough; the first step toward cooperation between the army and the refugees, most of whom were driven from their land here by Government bombing and repression in the early 1980's. Three years ago, bearing little more than a few pigs and a heart-rending longing for their homes, they insisted on returning to rebuild.
 
A Dream That Fades
Now, the bulldozers are parked and the refugees are refusing to work with the army. The breakthrough looks more and more like a mirage, one of the countless pipe dreams that for a few moments disguise the harsh realities of life in El Salvador, only to fade away.
The collapse of the road project provides a glimpse into the suspicions and pressures that have fueled a decade of civil war. And it shows how the country's divisions doom many efforts to improve daily life.
''The terrorists are pressing the residents not to work,'' said Col. Rene Arnoldo Majano, the commander of the district, which is one of the most wartorn in the country. By terrorists he meant the left-wing rebels who are fighting the rightist Government.
''We're ready to be helped,'' said a member of the town council, who asked not to be identified. ''But we don't want to be used.''
The dispute is a symptom of the problems that have undermined United States policy here, a policy that has sent $4 billion to San Salvador in the last decade, much of it in military aid. Attempts to build up the army have often clashed with efforts to help the people, fortify the civilian government and establish a democracy.
 
Guns Before Butter
The Reagan Administration gave the army priority, increasing military aid at three times the rate of economic support. The result has been a strengthening of the armed forces and a plunge in the average standard of living.
Civilian government has been especially ineffective in Santa Marta, which is about 70 miles northeast of the capital and 25 miles northwest of the last segment of paved road. When the first refugees arrived here three years ago, the town was little more than a dot on the map.
The refugees did most of the work, with little help from the Government. They opened a school with their own teachers. They planted corn and beans. Each year, more refugees returned. Temporary shacks were turned into homes. Residents began viewing Santa Marta, originally rebuilt as a refugee staging area, as the area's premier municipality.
But the army remained deeply suspicious, fearing that Santa Marta was an effort to rebuild the rebel civilian network, which sustains the guerrillas in the field. The military soon stopped all relief groups from entering the area. Often, the armed forces cordoned off the town, questioning residents as they came and went.
 
Soldiers and Candy
Two months ago, a delegation from the town went to the regional capital, Sensuntepeque, to discuss their problems with Colonel Majano. Despite the qualms of some residents opposed to cooperation with the army, the town council agreed to allow a civic-action program, under which troops distribute candy, food and medicine.
A few hours after the program began, nearby rebels opened fire, military officials say. Residents scattered and program workers scrambled for safety.
The army, accompanied by United States military advisers, decided to return earlier this month. But the day before the program, the patrol in Santa Marta found a one-page letter apparently written by the guerrillas. It blamed the Government for the war and appealed to residents for help oppose the army.
The army retaliated. It distributed fliers accusing the townspeople of working with the guerrillas of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front. ''Militia of the F.M.L.N.,'' the leaflet said. ''By destroying your homeland, you're generating poverty, mourning and pain to your Salvadoran brothers. Reflect. Incorporate yourselves in the process.''
 
'Broken the Barrier'
The residents were furious. The army apologized and once again handed out beans and cooking oil. In a meeting with the town council, Colonel Azcunaga and the residents agreed to work together to rebuild the road. ''We've broken the barrier,'' Colonel Azcunaga said. The next day the radio announced that Santa Marta had rejected the guerrillas and embraced the military. Local news organizations gave prominent display to the civic-action program, giving residents the feeling that they were being used by creating the impression that the community and the military were collaborating.
The road-improvement project collapsed six days later. Last week, one soldier was killed and one was wounded in combat around the town.

HEADLINE: TOWARD THE SUMMIT;
Negotiations Concluded Over U.S.-Soviet Trade

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
American and Soviet negotiators have concluded the remaining details of a trade agreement under which enterprises of the two countries would establish deeper footholds in each other's markets.
Among the harder-won provisions obtained by Washington are better copyright protection for American computer software in the Soviet Union, an accelerated process for obtaining commercial representation in Moscow and a start on repayment of 1940's Lend-Lease and other Soviet debts to the United States.
For their part, the Soviets would get the lowest available tariffs in the United States, which would make more furs, vodka, textiles and other Soviet-produced products available here, and eligibility for American Government credit and guarantee programs of Federal agencies like the Export-Import Bank and the Overseas Private Investment Corporation. On the Table, or Off? It is uncertain whether the agreement, concluded by the negotiators in the last few weeks, will be signed during the meetings between President Bush and President Mikhail S. Gorbachev. In comments to reporters at Kennebunkport, Me., today, Mr. Bush said the trade agreement was ''not on the table,'' because the Soviets had yet to approve a free emigration law. 
But on Sunday, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d said on the CBS News program ''Face the Nation'' that the agreement was ''not off the table. I see where some are suggesting that it's off the table.''
Some of the apparent confusion may reflect political pressures. A resolution adopted by two-thirds of the Senate urges the President not to move forward with a trade agreement while Moscow maintains economic sanctions against Lithuania to compel it to rescind its declaration of independence.
The agreement, which has not yet been published, contains a number of provisions that would ease trade. Each side could open offices to advertise, meet with potential purchasers and otherwise promote commerce. The Soviets could take no longer than 60 days to approve or disapprove commercial accreditation. At first, Moscow had objected to imposing procedural deadlines on its bureaucracy.
Each country's laws and regulations would be made readily available to the other. Such information is already available in the United States, but it is often hard to get in the Soviet Union.
 
Copyright Protection for Software
Specific provision has been made for computer software programs, and the overall protection of copyrights, trademarks, patents and other intellectual property would be greater than now exists. Both sides would be obliged to abide by international conventions in this area.
There is also a so-called safeguard provision, under which each country would have the right to halt imports that flooded its markets.
The two countries last year traded about $5 billion worth of goods and services. Largely because of Soviet grain buying, the United States had a $3.5 billion surplus. The Soviet Union is one of the few countries with which the United States enjoys such a surplus.
Most analysts say opportunities for greatly expanded business are limited, at least in the short term. The Soviets do not make much that the United States wants or needs, and payments as well as political difficulties compound risks for American business.
 
Separate Accord on Debts
An agreement on Soviet debts to the United States was negotiated separately but is to be signed at the same time as the trade agreement. After making small payments in the 1970's, the Soviets still owe the United States $674 million from the Lend-Lease program of World War II.
This represents about half the total Soviet debt to this country, estimated at $1.5 billion. This amount includes $192.6 million that the United States lent to the Government of Alexander Kerensky, who was overthrown by the Bolsheviks in November 1917.
American officials said that United States and Soviet negotiators spent long hours arguing over a new payments schedule, details of which were unavailable. Settlement of the debt issue, by meeting requirements of the 1934 Johnson Debt Default Act, would permit the Soviet Union to borrow money in the American bond market for the first time.
The trade pact would be the first between the two countries since their military alliance ended in 1945. The two Governments negotiated a similar accord during the 1972-74 period of detente, but it was never signed.

Armenia Fighting Levels Off; Toll Is 23

BYLINE: By ESTHER B. FEIN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 28

 BODY:
The death toll from the savage clashes Sunday in the Armenian capital, Yerevan, rose to 23 today, as people in the city reported that a few sporadic clashes between Government troops and civilian bands continued.
The new deaths reported today were all from fighting on Sunday, and there were no reports of deaths or serious injuries from today's clashes. Most of the city and the suburbs, which a day earlier had been the scenes of heavy crossfire, were calm today, residents of Armenia said by telephone, with people stunned by the sudden outbreak and wondering what had provoked it.
Coming as President Mikhail S. Gorbachev prepares to leave for visits to Canada and the United States, the new fighting in the troubled Caucasus region underscores the precarious domestic situation - from ethnic tensions to separatist movements and economic crisis - that the Soviet leader leaves behind. 
 
An Unending Woe for Moscow
Unrest in Armenia has been a problem for Mr. Gorbachev for more than two years, as Armenians continue to press Moscow for control of Nagorno-Karabakh, a mountainous enclave populated mostly by Christian Armenians living on territory isolated within and ruled by Muslim Azerbaijan.
Hundreds of people have died in the disputed territory and in clashes in Azerbaijan and Armenia, and the Kremlin has seemed powerless to bring the seething conflict under control.
The Soviet press agency Tass reported that the fighting Sunday began when a group of about 15 armed militants attacked Soviet troops escorting a train into the Yerevan station just before 9 A.M.
The troops returned fire, killing six of the civilian attackers and wounding dozens of people, Tass said. The Government newspaper Izvestia reported that a number of soldiers and officers were also wounded and that two died.
Later that afternoon, 14 more nationalists and a lieutenant colonel from the Soviet Interior Ministry were killed in a gunfight on the outskirts of the capital, Tass reported.
 
Fighting Around City
The agency's reports were confirmed in telephone interviews with journalists and members of nationalist organizations in Armenia. These people also said a number of clashes had taken place today in pockets around the city.
Leaders of the Karabakh Committee, the most influential nationalist group in Armenia, denied responsibility for the incidents and said they were at a loss to explain what had happened.
They said that reinforcements for Interior Ministry troops had been brought to the area in advance of the republic's independence day, a commemoration of Armenia's two years of independent statehood from 1918 to 1920, that was to have been celebrated today.
Instead of an independence march, more than 100,000 people met on the city's main theater square today to try to sort out the weekend events.
''There are many different versions,'' Rafael Popoyan, a Yerevan resident, said in a telephone interview. ''Who confronted whom and why is just not known.''
 
Graphic Film
Film of some of the fighting that reached Moscow today offered gruesome evidence of heavy fighting and high tension. Footage obtained by CBS News in Moscow showed areas of the Yerevan train station soaked in blood, riddled with bullet holes and showered with broken glass.
The film also pictured dozens of tanks, armored personnel carriers and jeeps riding through the city, and battles with the government troops both in the capital and in nearby suburbs.
The civilian fighters were heavily armed with automatic rifles, bandoliers of ammunition strapped across their chests, pistols and gasoline bombs.
It is not known how the Armenian nationalists got such heavy arms. Officials have accused nationalist groups in the past of stealing from government arsenals and receiving shipments from sympathizers living abroad.
 
Soviet General Assails Leaders
In a report carried by Tass, the commander of the Soviet Interior Ministry troops, Col. Gen. Yuri Shatalin, today called the nationalist fighters ''terrorists,'' and he said that the ''bloodshed in Yerevan'' was brought about by ''open connivance of the republic leadership and law enforcement agencies with illegal armed groups.''
He accused local leaders of ignoring signs that nationalists in the capital were acquiring stolen vehicles and weapons.
General Shatalin, who flew to Yerevan over the weekend, said he had met with ''leaders of illegal armed formations,'' but that they had rejected his request that they voluntarily surrender their arms.
Consequently, he said, ''resolute measures'' were needed to disarm the groups, and he warned that if local law enforcement agencies failed to do this, the task would be carried out by Interior Ministry troops.

Taxes: Pitfall or a Leg Up for Bush?

BYLINE: By R. W. APPLE Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 28

 BODY:
Is President Bush, who built an imposing victory in 1988 and imposing poll ratings in 1989 and 1990 at least partly on his ''no new taxes'' pledge, starting to fade politically because he has softened that pledge?
Not at all, said a top White House strategist, and added: ''Either there will be a major deal, trading tax increases for real reform in the budget process, with the President coming off as 'Mr. Competence,' or there won't be any deal. Period.''
The President's senior advisers say much of the public resistance to new taxes, which continues strong, is linked to the conviction that a lot of the money collected from current taxes is wasted.
Hence the White House emphasis on ''reforming the process'' - drastically changing the slapdash way budgets and appropriations are written. 
Even if there were some residual blame accruing to the President, the strategist argues, it would provoke no more than a blip on the political radar, which would soon disappear.
But other Republicans, like Jack F. Kemp, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, and Edward J. Rollins, the man responsible for trying to elect Republican Congressional candidates this fall, think the party is in danger of losing the main issue differentiating it from the Democrats, now that Communism is fading as a vote-generating specter.
Support for that view is found in a New York Times/CBS News poll, taken last week.
It shows that about as many people think the Republicans are likely to raise taxes as think Democrats are. For a decade, the Republicans benefited from a public perception that their opponents were the tax-and-spenders.
It may be that Mr. Bush, through his repeated, seemingly unqualified pledges not to raise taxes, has raised the stakes, and if he now agrees to an increase, voters will decide his party is no different from the other one.
Bob Beckel, a Democratic campaign specialist, said he thought that Mr. Bush was already suffering with the voters from his decision to join the Democratic leadership on Capitol Hill in the search for a deficit-cutting formula.
''But these guys are smarter than we are,'' Mr. Beckel said of the Republicans. ''They're willing to accept whatever pain and suffering they get out of this, short term, if it helps make victory more likely for the President. Recession in '90, not '92 - that's their motto.''
Two tax changes that have been widely discussed could affect Mr. Bush's strong standing in the polls, in the view of many politicians.
Reducing the rates on capital gains, an idea much cherished by the President, worries some Republicans with populist views, who fear it could help revive the old image of the rich man's party.
And a higher gasoline tax could lead to a rebellion at pumps and polls by the blue-collar voters whom Ronald Reagan attracted to the party. The Times/CBS poll indicates that 57 percent of the public objects to the idea.
But Peter Hart, a Democratic poll taker, thinks the situation is a good deal more complex than that, though not without problems for Mr. Bush. In his view, the President is vulnerable not on the abrogation of his no-new-taxes pledge but on the general question of economic leadership, and he said Mr. Bush needed ''to signal more strongly what his prescription is.''
Clearly Mr. Bush and Richard G. Darman, the budget director, agree that stormy economic weather may lie ahead.
But Mr. Bush is still not willing to sound a public alarm, saying he fears that he might panic the markets. Nor is he ready to put forward a plan for negotiation with the Democrats, preferring to play for time.
In that sense, this week's summit conference with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union comes at exactly the right time for Mr. Bush, focusing attention on foreign policy, the area where he and his party evoke the greatest public confidence, and away from the troubling topic of taxes.

HEADLINE: The Biggest Scandal Ever

 BODY:
No less an authority than the Federal Reserve chairman, Alan Greenspan, says the eventual cost of the savings and loan bailout could exceed a half- trillion dollars. A half-trillion. And Treasury Secretary Nicholas Brady admits that taxpayers will bear most of that burden. 
It is scandalous, all agree, but unlike any earlier scandal. By any measure, it is the largest by far. Forget the relatively puny bailouts of Chrysler, Lockheed and New York City. (Even the Marshall Plan, which bailed out Western Europe 40 years ago, cost a mere $65 billion in today's dollars.) A greater outrage is that most of the perpetrators will escape. For that, the responsible parties are members of Congress who legislated the thrifts' license to splurge and steal, Reagan Administration officials who ignored the storm warnings and hundreds of incompetent and corrupt S & L owners and managers who dallied with their depositors' trust.
A few politicians have paid, and more may pay as inquiries proceed. Former Representative Fernand St Germain of Rhode Island, co-author of the law that turned the S & L's loose, was defeated for re-election. Speaker Jim Wright's downfall was due partly to his badgering of Federal regulators. Five senators' reputations, if not their seats, are at risk because they intervened with regulators on behalf of a big campaign donor, Charles Keating, and his now-bankrupt Lincoln Savings and Loan.
Some industry high-fliers have paid, too. Close to 50 thrift officials, developers, accountants and others have been convicted, and F.B.I. Director William Sessions says his agents have found fraud ''pervasive'' industrywide. But even if Government prosecutors were more vigorous, most of the funds are gone.
So who really pays? Mostly the taxpayer; to a lesser extent the surviving thrifts, which now pay higher fees for Federal deposit insurance.
Estimates of the damage vary widely because the experts still don't agree on how to measure it. Secretary Brady says the cost might reach $130 billion; the General Accounting Office says $325 billion, and Mr. Greenspan says a half-trillion.
Why the huge differences? Mr. Brady doesn't count most of the huge interest payments for 30 or 40 years on the billions he must borrow to finance the bailout; and no one knows what the interest rates will be. He also omits billions laid out for failed thrifts before last year, when the bailout package was enacted.
Another unknown is what the Government will recoup from selling the immensely varied assets of the thrifts it takes over - real estate, junk bonds, amusement parks. Finally, there is no way to know just how many thrifts will be taken over.
One thing is clear. In 1987, when the Reagan Administration first acknowledged a problem - the deposit insurance fund was running low - it asked Congress for $15 billion. The savings and loan industry, wanting desperately to avoid scrutiny, insisted that $5 billion would be enough. Congress finally voted $11 billion.
Those figures show how easily a lax Administration, an irresponsible Congress and a recklessly deregulated industry played with other people's money. That's why the taxpayer will now pay. Perhaps a half-trillion.

HEADLINE: The Real Red Squirrel Peril

 BODY:
The Sierra Club and several other environmental groups have got themselves on the wrong side of a silly debate. They oppose putting telescopes on Mount Graham in Arizona, contending that the observatory will endanger a population of red squirrels. The greater risk is to the health of the Endangered Species Act. 
Arizona is a center of world astronomy because of its high mountains and fine viewing conditions. But streetlights from expanding cities limit existing observatories. The University of Arizona determined that Mount Graham, in the Coronado National Forest, was the best possible site for a new one and plans advanced and innovative telescopes.
Until the university's decision, no one cared much about the red squirrels on Mount Graham. Much of their habitat had been destroyed by extensive logging. Hunting licenses to shoot them were available from the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. For better sport, the service in fact introduced another squirrel, the Abert squirrel, which competes for food with the red squirrel.
Though the red squirrel is not an endangered species, it is surely threatened on Mount Graham. The university therefore scaled down its plans so that the telescopes and access road will occupy a mere 9 acres, expanding to 24 if all goes well. The red squirrels' present habitat is at least 1,700 acres and more probably 10,000. Also, the university will do reforesting and close off a logging road. The squirrels could be further protected by feeding or by removing the rival Abert squirrel.
Yet instead of working for the coexistence of squirrels and astronomers, the Sierra Club and its allies have chosen confrontation. They have sued to block the observatory, a misguided effort in which the more level-headed Environmental Defense Fund has declined to join.
There is an unattractive absolutism in the environmentalists' arguments. The Endangered Species Act, which protects isolated populations even of unthreatened species, often attracts intense opposition from those whose economic interests are imperiled, as in the cases of the snail darter and the spotted owl. To invoke this helpful act in frivolous causes is to invite its demise.

HEADLINE: Root of Liberia's Crisis Stems From Its President

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I agree with J. Brian Atwood that active diplomacy on the part of the United States is desperately needed to resolve the conflict in the West African nation of Liberia (''Liberian Bloodshed, U.S. Diplomacy,'' Op-Ed, May 11). I also agree that credible, internationally monitored elections should be an important part of our diplomatic effort.
But the root cause of the Liberian crisis is not the absence of elections. The real problem is President Samuel K. Doe himself. His repressive policies over the last 10 years have fueled the rebel insurgency and robbed his government of legitimacy and credibility. 
The Doe Government's response to the recent outbreak of violence in northeastern Liberia is a case in point. When a small group of rebel insurgents entered Nimba County last December, President Doe's troops went on a brutal rampage through the affected region, killing hundreds of unarmed civilians. Many of the victims appear to have been targeted by Government troops merely because of their ethnic ties to the insurgent forces. This small insurgency has now developed into a major uprising that threatens the capital, Monrovia.
The Liberian Government's actions in Nimba County are part of a larger pattern of human rights abuses, economic mismanagement and increasingly oppressive policies. Many forms of legitimate political opposition are not tolerated; press freedoms are denied, and arbitrary arrests are well documented. Only when these abuses have ceased can we assess President Doe's credibility and good faith concerning a free and fair election.
The Congress has taken a keen interest in United States policy toward Liberia. On April 24, the House of Representatives approved legislation, which I introduced, that condemns the Doe Government's brutal human rights abuses. In the Senate, a similar bill has been introduced by Senator Edward Kennedy. Although these bills call on President Doe to honor his commitment to hold elections as scheduled, they place primary attention on the root causes of the crisis - the actions of President Doe himself.

HEADLINE: ABROAD AT HOME;
Vision at the Summit

BYLINE: By Anthony Lewis

 BODY:
George Bush comes to this week's summit meeting with every political advantage over a Mikhail Gorbachev beset by internal conflict. But in a sense it will be as much of a test for Mr. Bush. It will show whether he can develop a long-term view of policy for a crucial part of the world - and explain his vision to the American people.
Pragmatism has been the hallmark of this President's foreign policy: a day at a time, a problem at a time. On the whole that has worked. Mr. Bush has responded prudently to such delicate issues as Baltic independence, avoiding rigidity, not crying havoc. He takes a close interest in all that is happening in the world: a nice change in the White House. 
But pragmatism has its limits. Without a vision, and public understanding of it, policy cannot meet long-range needs - least of all at a time of fundamental change. Every once in a while the country needs to set a course. This is such a time.
Consider the desperate current state of the Soviet economy. What role does President Bush envisage for The United States in helping to reform that economic system and liberate Soviet public psychology from its deadening legacy?
The idea that America can help the process of change in a Marxist economy is hardly alien to Mr. Bush. He relied on it in justifying his decision to continue most-favored-nation trading status for China despite the cruelties of its tyrannical Government. He extolled the function of U.S. trade in encouraging not only economic reform but ''justice and reason'' in China.
''Economic contacts are the best way to keep the economic reforms going forward,'' he said.
The same argument should apply to the Soviet Union, only more so. This is a moment of economic choice for the Soviet Government and people. Fears of inflation or unemployment are slowing change, perhaps crippling the chance of success. Nothing could do more to ease those fears than growing economic relationships with the United States: trade, investment, training.
Moreover, Soviet citizens can freely debate their economic future, as the Chinese cannot. A McDonald's in Moscow can influence that debate.
The United States has a powerful national interest in the growth of economic hope in the Soviet Union. Hope is the secret of stability. However the current turmoil reshapes the Soviet state, we have to want eventual stability in a country with thousands of nuclear weapons.
Of course there are obstacles to economic cooperation with the U.S.S.R. One is the fact that its liberalized emigration policy has not yet been formalized in law. Another is the Lithuanian independence conflict.
But President Bush could take those into account and still set the objective - the urgent objective - of forging new economic relationships. It is not enough to say, as he did the other day, that Congress would object. He has to tell us where he wants to go, and show us why it is in the American interest to go there as we can. He has to lead.
The advertised agenda of this summit meeting focuses on arms control. But it is more important that the two Presidents at least open up the subject of economics. And that they begin to talk about future political-military arrangements in Europe that could ease understandable Soviet concerns about a united Germany.
President Bush obviously respects Mikhail Gorbachev and understands how far he has gone on a very difficult road. Who could have imagined, a year ago, that a Soviet leader would quietly allow the countries of Eastern Europe to go free? Who could have foreseen the crumbling of the Warsaw Pact as a military threat, or the end of NATO concern about a possible Soviet invasion of Western Europe?
What the President has not done is work those changes into a new concept of Soviet-American relations, less hostile, more cooperative. He has not given us a picture of a post-cold war world. Indeed, he still seems blinkered by such cold war ideas as the notion that we should help an authoritarian China because it is an anti-Soviet force.
George Bush cannot, we cannot, know what the Soviet Union will become. But if we want Mr. Gorbachev to stay on the course of internal freedom and withdrawal from external empire - and we do - we need a policy that will encourage him and his people.
There are Americans on the extreme right who will not be content unless Moscow is ruled by a Romanov restoration or turned into a salt plain. But most of Mr. Bush's public is open-minded about the possibilities for a new relationship with the Soviet Union. It is looking for leadership.

HEADLINE: Conservatives Balk as G.O.P. Prepares to Back Rinfret

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN

DATELINE: RYE, N.Y., May 28

 BODY:
The New York State Republican Party suffered a serious setback today when a traditional ally, the Conservative Party, prepared to field its own candidate for governor rather than endorse the Republican leaders' choice.
Conservative leaders said today that they would not support the Republican favorite, Pierre A. Rinfret, because of his stand on abortion and because they questioned his ability to make an issue of the tax and spending policies of the Democratic Governor, Mario M. Cuomo. The Conservatives instead plan to nominate Herbert London, a 51-year-old dean at New York University.
The announcement came after Mr. London met with Republican leaders and Mr. Rinfret, who offered him the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor. Mr. London declined the offer, saying Mr. Rinfret would not be able to make an issue of taxes because Republican state senators were at least partly responsible for the state's fiscal problems. The Republicans also lack a candidate for attorney general. 
Mr. Rinfret, a wealthy Manhattan economics consultant with little political experience, agreed only last week to run for governor after the party had failed to persuade any better-known Republican to take up the challenge of Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Rinfret is expected to receive the nomination when the party's convention begins here Tuesday.
The Republicans, with severe fund-raising problems and scant prospects of help from Washington, saw at least 16 prominent party members rule themselves out as potential candidates before they settled on Mr. Rinfret (pronounced rin-FRAY). Mr. Cuomo has a campaign war chest of at least $8 million and had a 65 percent approval rating in several polls taken last March.
J. Patrick Barrett, the Republican state chairman, had offered Mr. London the lieutenant-governor nomination in a meeting Friday evening in an effort to head off a split with the Conservatives.
Last week, Mr. London, who briefly ran for mayor of New York City last year, was brushed off by Mr. Barrett and State Senator Roy M. Goodman, the Manhattan Republican leader, as a possible gubernatorial candidate because of his opposition to abortion and his lack of funds.
Mr. Rinfret, who is 66 years old, supports a woman's right to an abortion and has told party leaders that he will spend at least $500,000 of his own money on the campaign.
The move by Mr. London and the Conservatives marked Mr. Rinfret's first failure as a potential candidate and could spark a floor fight at the convention at the Hilton Hotel here. Mr. Barrett acknowledged in a telephone interview Sunday from Syracuse that there had been some protests when it became apparent Mr. Rinfret would be nominated. But he said he was fully supporting Mr. Rinfret, who was first suggested by Mr. Goodman. Mr. Barrett and Mr. Goodman have been largely responsible for putting together the state party ticket.
Mr. Rinfret met with Mr. London for two hours today in Mr. Rinfret's apartment in Manhattan to try to convince Mr. London to be his running mate as the candidate for lieutenant governor.
 
Embarrassing Position
When Mr. London turned him down, the Republicans were left in the embarrassing position of having to offer the nomination to an obvious second choice just before the start of their convention. That choice may be Toni Rettaliata, a former assemblywoman defeated for re-election as town supervisor in Huntington, L.I., last November. Another Long Islander, Robert R. McMillan, earlier rejected an offer to be the party's nominee for attorney general.
The split on the political right meant that the Republicans and the Conservatives would waste their ability to jointly criticize Mr. Cuomo on taxes, state spending and crime and be put in the position of sniping at each other on abortion, an issue that is highly emotional but does not seem to have been crucial to New York voters picking state officials in recent years.
Differences over abortion could surface Tuesday in the Republican platform. The state Republican Party, like President Bush and his predecessor, Ronald Reagan, has officially opposed abortion, but at least one group, the New York State Republican Family Committee, has urged that the party support women's abortion rights. Mr. Goodman has also taken this view.
 
Fiscal Policies
The Conservatives' state chairman, Michael R. Long, said supporting Mr. Rinfret would ''jeopardize my party'' because of the candidate's position on abortion and because it would be more difficult for a Republican to make an issue of Mr. Cuomo's fiscal policies. The State Senate Republican majority, like the Assembly Democratic majority, has approved the state budget calling for a record amount in new taxes.
Mr. Long said Mr. Rinfret ''doesn't have an agenda nor ideas to reshape New York State'' and implied that Mr. Rinfret was treating the race too lightly. ''What I picked up very clearly in my conversations with him,'' Mr. Long said, ''was that he liked the idea of running for governor and was going to have a lot of fun.''
In a year in which the governor's race would be close, Mr. Long said, the Conservatives might swallow some of their differences with the Republicans. But he does not expect a close race this year. ''This is a good year to talk about fundamental issues,'' he said.
At a news conference tonight, Mr. Barrett said he had not yet given up on Mr. London and the Conservatives. He added that Mr. Rinfret was ''a conservative on practically every issue except abortion.''
Mr. Rinfret, who operates a Manhattan economic consulting and trading firm, has been unavailable for comment since he first surfaced as a candidate last week. He has never before run for public office and has not been active in the New York Republican Party. He has not even been enrolled in any political party since 1976.
 
New Political Consultant
Mr. London said Mr. Rinfret ''wasn't prepared to discuss issues in depth'' in their lengthy face-to-face conversation today. In another room in the Rinfret apartment was Mr. Rinfret's new political consultant, Eddie Mahe of Washington, who had briefly advised Mr. London in the mayoral campaign last year. Mr. Rinfret's son, Peter, also worked in the London mayoral effort.
That mayoral campaign marked the first signs of the coming apart of the longtime Republican-Conversative alliance as the Conservatives supported Ronald S. Lauder while the Republicans backed Rudolph W. Giuliani. Abortion, which Mr. Lauder opposed, was also a critical issue in that split.
Mr. London said he would make an issue of ''taxes and spending and crime and punishment.'' He said he favored the death penalty, which Republicans have signaled will be a major issue against Mr. Cuomo, who opposes it.

HEADLINE: Shipper of Food for A.I.D. Investigated Over Unfit Milk

BYLINE: By DEAN BAQUET

 BODY:
The affidavit portrays AMG as having a history of fraud. It cited a Federal Maritime Commission ruling in 1987 that accused AMG of defrauding the Government and commercial shippers by mislabeling cargo to obtain a cheaper rate. The document said AMG was embroiled in more than 60 suits in New York with shippers. 
In an interview, Mr. Merritt denied trying to cheat the Sudan. He said that a subcontractor, a supplier in Sri Lanka, had substituted the powder and that he had alerted American officials about the substitution months ago, but had been ignored.
''I didn't want this stuff to get sent out and have people get sick from it,'' said Mr. Merritt, who the Government said was the majority stockholder in AMG. ''But we didn't do anything wrong. We just got caught in the middle.''
By Mr. Merritt's account, most of the money paid to AMG was distributed to subcontractors, including the Sri Lankans. Mr. Merritt said he did not know why the Government had settled on AMG as a subject of the inquiry.
Mr. Merritt's lawyer, Erwin Shustak, said he believed the Government was investigating AMG because of a dispute Mr. Merritt had with an investigator years ago. ''The Government is acting with vindictiveness,'' Mr. Shustak said. ''I'm sure they think he is in international espionage or a wheeler-dealer. But he is just a struggling businessman.''
Prosecutors would not comment. The 15-page affidavit, sworn by an investigator for the Agency for International Development, Mellberth Bowling, portrays AMG as a willing participant that used fake documents to collect money from the Government.
The aid program is intended to provide food for the Sudan while creating economic development in the country. A Government-controlled Sudanese company orders the food and places money for it in a bank account jointly controlled by A.I.D. and the Sudanese Government.
 
Written Assurance
The United States Government then pays for the food, and the money in the account is spent on roads and other improvements. That way, the affidavit said, the United States tries to assure that the Sudan is spending the aid money on development.
The affidavit said that early last year AMG told the Sudanese company that the powder had been loaded on a Dutch ship, the Tonya, and was ready to leave Sri Lanka. After receiving written assurance, the Sudanese company asked the United States to pay for the cargo. AMG received the money.
When the Tonya failed to arrive in the Sudan, the Sudanese company investigated, the affidavit said, reportedly finding that the Tonya had never been loaded with the milk. Even if the milk had been loaded, the ship was so small she would have sunk, the Government asserted.
In its investigation, the Sudanese company also learned that AMG still intended to fulfill the contract, but with a poor-quality powder, the Government contended. The Sudan rejected the shipment after having tested the powder before shipment. The affidavit did not specify the problem.
In the affidavit, Mr. Bowling said his account was based on interviews with former AMG employees and others who knew about the transaction.
Mr. Merritt said that AMG was just supposed to arrange the shipment and that another American company, which he identified as Laura Exports, was to find a supplier for the milk. He said documents subpoenaed by prosecutors would support his contention.

HEADLINE: Racial Unity and Dissent in Brooklyn

BYLINE: By ARI L. GOLDMAN

DATELINE: NEW YORK, May 28

 BODY:
Demonstrating for racial harmony, a small group wended its way through Prospect Park in Brooklyn today, handing out ''unity'' buttons and tying blue ribbons to lampposts and trees.
''Unity means love,'' a black leader of the march, Fred McCray, said as he pinned a button to the T-shirt of a Korean-American boy.
But less than a mile away on Church Avenue, the bitter boycott by a small group of blacks against two Korean greengrocers continued, with both sides trading angry charges.
''Nothing's changed,'' said Capt. Vincent Kennedy of the 70th Police Precinct as he stood between protesters and the Family Red Apple Market. 
The Prospect Park march took place amid a holiday crowd that was breaking out new barbecue grills. The air was filled with Frisbees, volleyballs, the click of camera shutters and the smell of sizzling hot dogs. Holiday revelers, enjoying a pleasant turn in the weather, warmly welcomed the dozen unity marchers.
The march, sponsored by the Brooklyn Women's Political Caucus, was led by Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn District Attorney, and Mr. McCray, an economics teacher at Erasmus Hall High School, who two weeks ago led 30 students into the Family Red Apple store in defiance of the boycott.
 
Harmony and Haranguing
''We all must get along,'' said Cynthia Moore of East New York, whose family was spread out on five blankets. Adjacent to her black family were whites from the Park Slope section and Hispanic people from the Williamsburg area.
''We have no race problems here,'' said Donna Kelly of Park Slope.
On Church Avenue, however, one protester tapped incessantly with a spoon on a tin can and chanted, ''Boycott! Boycott!'' When, from time to time, a customer entered the Family Red Apple Market, a cry rose from the crowd of about 20 and the chanting increased.
None of the protesters were willing to give their name or say where they were from. One older woman in a brown dress, who seemed to be in charge, shouted: ''We are stronger than ever. We will never give up.''
Inside the store, the owner, Bong Jae Jang, said that none of the good will exhibited in Prospect Park had spilled over to Church Avenue. He said that business was terrible yesterday and that the warm weather was hastening the rotting of his fruits and vegetables, which he continues to buy - and throw out - with the aid of the Korean Produce Association.
The merchants' group has committed itself to keeping open the Red Apple and a second store, Church Fruits, as a sign that Korean shopkeepers cannot be intimidated. Each store receives about $8,000 a month from the association.
Mr. Jang complained that Mayor David N. Dinkins's office, which had set up a negotiating session with a Haitian woman whose assertion that she was assaulted in the store had sparked the protest, canceled the session abruptly last week. The storekeeper, who has said the incident was a misunderstanding, not an assault, said he was angry that the session had not been rescheduled.
''The Mayor only spoke with his mouth to impress people,'' Mr. Jang said.
The Mayor's press officers did not return telephone calls seeking comment.
The Prospect Park unity march was one of several organized in response to the call last week by Mayor Dinkins at a rally in the Cathedral of St. John the Divine in Manhattan to foster better relations in every neighborhood.
It was Schools Chancellor Joseph A. Fernandez who promoted the use of the blue ribbons as a sign of racial harmony in the schools, an idea the Mayor readily embraced on a citywide basis.
In his remarks, District Attorney Hynes said the marchers were hoping to work as ''a counterbalance to those forces in the city that seek to divide us.''
Mr. McCray said he was there to ''plant seeds of unity for this summer'' among young people, in the hope of stopping racial incidents. Mr. McCray, who is black, has requested a transfer from Erasmus Hall High School because of threats against him and his family since he defied the boycott. He said, however, that he would continue to speak out against racism.

HEADLINE: Little Icons of Texas' Past Are Auctioned Off

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: NEW ULM, Tex., May 28

 BODY:
An auctioneer spent the weekend selling off half of this town. The residents are delighted.
''It couldn't have gone any better, really,'' the auctioneer, A. L. (Buck) Buchanan, said today. The sale included about six and a half acres, 100-year-old log cabins and antique farm equipment and furnishings. 
The auction Saturday, ordered by the Texas Historical Foundation, drew 1,800 people. The properties sold once belonged to Jeanne Blocker, a Houston investor, and her husband, John, who was once an oilman.
Mrs. Blocker had a vision: to create a historic village within New Ulm, which is about 60 miles west of Houston. To carry it out, she acquired nearly every rundown log structure in the area.
The Blockers also bought about half the town's acreage and several old buildings. They even brought in other buildings and furnishings from as far as 50 miles away.
Mrs. Blocker cleared some land, dug a pond and created a small waterfall and restored a handful of buildings. But the collapse of oil prices stalled her big plans in 1984.
After she died in 1988, her husband donated everything except three pieces of land to the Texas Historical Foundation.
''Mrs. Blocker worked very hard on all of this,'' Mr. Buchanan said. ''She did an awful lot of research and planning.''
But for this town of about 100 people, most of them retired, what once promised an economic boom has become a financial drain. Most of the Blockers' half of town is tax-exempt, since they bought it as a nonprofit foundation. But the steep prices paid by the Blockers drove up property values and taxes for everyone else in town.
 
Creamery, Saloon and Shop
The auction's proceeds were still not fully tallied today. Mr. Buchanan said the MacKinsky dogtrot log house, built in the late 18th or early 19th century, fetched the top price: more than $6,000.
Also snatched up were a creamery, a saloon and a Ford Model T repair shop. Mr. Buchanan said some structures would be moved and others would be reopened or renovated.
The historical foundation said it would use the proceeds for an unspecified project elsewhere.

HEADLINE: As Bias Crime Seems to Rise, Scientists Study Roots of Racism

BYLINE: By DANIEL GOLEMAN

 BODY:
AS racial and ethnic violence erupts throughout the world, psychologists are striving to understand what impels people to acts of hatred, particularly when they act in groups.
Researchers are focusing on who commits such crimes, what motivates them and exactly why people who would not commit violent acts on their own express their hatred so freely in groups.
Scientists studying hate crimes have made these findings:
* They are far more lethal than other kinds of attacks, resulting in the hospitalization of their victims four times more often than is true for other assaults.
* They are crimes of youth: most of those who perpetrate them are in their teens or 20's. But they are not crimes of youthful rebellion: those who carry them out are venting feelings shared by their families, friends and community, researchers say. 
* The large majority are committed by people in groups of four or more. And the more people in the group, the more vicious the crime.
* They reflect the primal emotions aroused by the love of one's own group; these deep feelings of group identity are particularly vivid in times of economic and political uncertainty and among people who suffered emotional neglect as children.
These factors are at play, experts say, as racial, religious and ethnic incidents erupt around the world, in riots between Azerbaijanis and Armenians, anti-Semitism in Russia, the racial killing in Bensonhurst, Brooklyn, and the tensions in the borough between blacks and Koreans.
''Everyone who collects data reports a steady increase in hate crimes in the last year or two,'' said Howard Ehrlich, director of the National Institute Against Prejudice and Violence in Baltimore.
The Federal Bureau of Investigation, for instance, reported that last year its civil rights unit had a record number of cases. ''These crimes are certainly on the increase,'' said Mike Kortan, a bureau spokesman.
Although the figures may reflect increased reporting rather than an actual increase in crime, rates for what the police call ''bias crimes'' - acts of violence inspired by racism and other prejudice - are also rising. The Boston Police Department, which had recorded about 150 bias crimes each year from 1986 to 1988, had 202 cases in 1989.
In New York City, such crimes were up 14 percent for the first four months of 1990 compared with the same time last year, said Inspector Paul Sanderson of the Bias Incident Investigation Unit.
For 1989 the Anti-Defamation League of B'nai B'rith monitored a 12 percent increase in anti-Semitic incidents from the previous year, including harassment, assaults, desecration and vandalism. ''It's the highest number we've recorded in 11 years,'' said Gail Gans, who works in the league's research office.
Particularly troubling to Ms. Gans and others who track such statistics is the activity on college campuses. In 1989 racial or ethnic incidents were reported on 115 American campuses.
''What's most distressing is that it's spreading,'' said Dr. Erlich. ''Of the 115 campuses, 52 were places where there hadn't been such trouble before.''
 
The Patterns
Whos and Whys Of Bias
Bias crimes vary widely, from a swastika daubed on a synagogue to the beating of a white youth waiting for a bus in a black neighborhood. Certain patterns are particularly common. ''Most hate crimes are matters of turf; the most frequent is an attack on someone who is just passing through a neighborhood where he's seen as out of place,'' said Jack McDevitt, a sociologist at Northeastern Unviversity.
Dr. McDevitt has analyzed 452 cases of bias crime that occurred in Boston from 1983 to 1987. He reported his findings last year at a conference of the American Society of Criminology in Reno, Nev.
Of all bias crimes, Dr. McDevitt found, 57 percent involved issues of turf; they were attacks on someone walking, driving through or working in a neighborhood, or on a family moving into the area or not wanted there.
Typical of those, he said, was what happened to an Asian family that moved into an all-white neighborhood in Boston. On the first night someone broke several windows with rocks; on the second night the walls were spray-painted with racist slurs. On the third night the family moved back to its old neighborhood, leaving an older son to guard its possessions. A mob of 20 youths taunted the son until he came out, then beat him.
Another common pattern is an attack on someone who has wandered into a neighborhood not realizing he or she is ''out of place.'' In one such incident, Dr. McDevitt said, a 12-year-old black girl took a shortcut from her school to a new convenience store nearby. As she was walking there, a group of white youths drove alongside and asked what she was doing in ''their'' neighborhood. They started taunting her, got out, pushed her down and kicked her, breaking a rib.
In Dr. McDevitt's study, most of the perpetrators of racist incidents were young white men, just under two-thirds; one-third were black. Of the total sample, two-thirds were 29 or younger. Virtually none of the perpetrators were women, but women accounted for 29 percent of the victims.
And while most of the crimes by blacks were against whites, Dr. McDevitt said that ''whites attack everybody: blacks, Hispanics, gays, Asians.'' He added that in Boston bias crimes by Asian-Americans and Hispanic Americans were rare, though Vietnamese were the third most frequently victimized group.
Patterns vary, of course, in other cities. In Miami, for instance, tensions are greatest between Hispanic residents and blacks, said Dr. McDevitt.
 
The Ugly Crowd
Viciousness In Numbers
The viciousness of bias incidents is among Dr. McDevitt's most startling findings. Half involved assaults. Of these, the victims were injured in 74 percent of the cases; the national average for injury to an assault victim is 29 percent.
More telling, at least one victim required hospitalization in 30 percent of the prejudice-based assaults, while for other assaults the average rate of injuries that severe is 7 percent.
The usual number of perpetrators in such crimes, Dr. McDevitt found, is four or more. The most common number of victims is one.
''It's a coward's crime,'' said Detective Brian Flynn, who investigates such incidents for the Boston police. ''It takes just 10 seconds to break a window in the dead of night, but they have to get together in numbers to get their guts up.''
Sheer numbers encourage viciousness, new research shows. For instance, Brian Mullen, a psychologist at Syracuse University has analyzed newspaper accounts of 60 lynchings in the United States earlier in this century.
''The larger the mob, the more atrocious and savage the lynching, and the more likely to include burning or mutilating the victim,'' said Dr. Mullen.
One reason crowds draw out a viciousness that the individuals would not display on their own, psychologists say, is that there is a diffusion of responsibility. Being one among many means that no one person need take the blame for what happens.
Anonymity is also a force in unleashing the crowd's viciousness. The hoods and night meetings of the Ku Klux Klan have long taken advantage of this, said Dr. Steven Salmony, a psychologist at the University of North Carolina who has studied the dynamics of Klan violence by observing Klan rallies and by interviewing members, including one who shared secret documents.
But most bias crimes are anonymous in a larger sense: the crowd itself offers anonymity and, in most cases, its members do not know their victim. More than 85 percent of the crimes he analyzed were committed by strangers, Dr. McDevitt found.
Dr. Mullen said, ''The tragedy is that when people in the mob look back afterward, they almost always say they can't believe they did those things. It's like it was someone else doing it.''
That fact is telling, according to Dr. Mullen. ''In the moment that people get carried away by a crowd, they literally forget themselves,'' he said. ''They forget their own sense of what's right and wrong, of the normal limits to what they will do.'' In many cases, those who commit bias crimes have been primed for racist actions by the values expressed by family members. ''When they're sitting around the dinner table at home they hear this racist garbage from their mom and dad,'' said Detective Flynn. ''It makes them feel they have their family's approval.''
 
The Emotional Roots
Primal Feelings Turned Loose
Psychoanalysts see primal feelings at play when prejudice leads to acts of hatred. ''The excitement of a group encourages people to regress to the psychological level of early childhood,'' said Dr. Salmony.
Early childhood, Dr. Salmony said, is a time when the emotional world is split into sharp dichotomies of good and bad, love and hate. ''In adulthood, for some people that becomes an emotional split with intense love for your own group and an intense hatred for another group,'' he said.
That emotional dynamic means that the underside of pride in one's own group is dislike of another.
Most people harbor such feelings lightly, if at all, and can keep the impulse to act on them under control. While these attitudes are revealed, for instance, in ethnic jokes and slurs, they rarely lead to overt acts of bias in most people, Dr. Salmony said.
In fact, psychologists say, ethnic jokes can offer a kind of safety valve for hostilities.
''The racist remarks of stand-up comedians just reflect the fact that ethnic and racial mistrust always exists in the folk culture, and shows up in humor,'' said Dr. Vamik Volkan, a psychiatrist at the University of Virginia. ''But it's not bad: if you can laugh about it, you're not likely to act on it.''
Such humor can even form a positive bond to the ridiculed group. ''If you make the same kind of degrading remarks about yourself, your family and your own group, as many comedians do, then it forms an emotional link to the groups you attack,'' Dr. Volkan said.
But, he said, ''when a comedian's humor is only derisive of the other group, and the comedian is hate-filled, then it adds to the hatred,'' said Dr. Volkan.
Such hostility carries the most emotional intensity, Dr. Salmony said, in people whose parents ignored their basic emotional needs as children.
For such people, said Dr. Salmony, ''being in a crowd where hostile feelings toward a group are being expressed triggers a regression to a primitive level of mental activity. They fall prey to an emotional contagion where they see their own group as they source of all that is good, and those in an opposing group as equally bad. It intensifies their hatred toward those seen as outsiders.''
At that moment, striking out against the hated group has a paradoxical effect: it makes the one who hates feel good about himself. ''The aggression enhances their own sense of identity with a group they love,'' said Dr. Salmony. ''It's a malignant kind of narcissism that fills them with a heightened feeling of their own value.''
 
Economic Factors
Shifting Blame In Troubled Times
The ethnic tensions that are shattering Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union have a similar basis, said Ervin Staub, a psychologist at the University of Massachusetts who is the author of ''The Roots of Evil'' (Cambridge University Press). Of course, the removal of political repression has allowed long-smoldering ethnic resentments to surface. But they have erupted with such intensity for other reasons, Dr. Staub said.
''In times of great economic insecurity and political turmoil, people need to affirm a sense of their own value,'' he said. ''These things shake your identity. You need to recreate a positive view of yourself and the group you are rooted in. But the very definition of yourself as a member of one group includes enmity towards another group.''
Dr. Volkan said: ''Who you are implies, at an emotional level, who you are not, and stress makes you cling all the more stubbornly to your ethnic identity.''
Dr. Staub, who is from Hungary, added, ''In Romania it was the Romanians against the Hungarians, in Czechoslovakia it was the Czechs against the Slovaks, and everyone was against the Jews.''
''These enmities are ancient, but they surface whenever life is in turmoil,'' Dr. Staub said. ''Devaluing the other elevates the self: this feeling that I am good is all the more important when you feel your world is out of control.''
Hatred of another group ''shifts responsibility for your problems to someone else and gives the appearance that life can be controlled if you just can do away with this enemy,'' Dr. Staub said. ''A shared enemy strengthens the group.''
That is why the protection of territory, whether a neighborhood or a province, is so common in ethnic tensions, said Dr. Volkan, who has studied ethnic tensions between Greeks and Turks on his native Cyprus, as well as similar friction in other parts of the world.
''The group's boundaries make each person inside the group feel closer,'' said Dr. Volkan. ''An outsider who pierces that boundary attacks the identity it defines.''
The recent increase in bias incidents in America, social scientists say, is spurred by economic worries. The last such increase, according to many of those interviewed, was during the recession of the late 1970's. However no one has precise figures from that period; widespread tracking of bias crimes began only the mid-1980's.
Nevertheless, those who study hate crimes say shaky economic periods heighten intergroup tensions. ''The last rise in hate crimes in America was during the last economic recession,'' said Ivan Light, a sociologist at University of California at Los Angeles. ''The roots of intergroup conflict are as much in economic competition as it is in negative stereotypes.''
Dr. Salmony said: ''Economic and political uncertainties lead to personal insecurities. For the most vulnerable people, it's a short step to ethnic violence.''
A case in point is the tension between blacks and Koreans, currently so prominent in New York City. According to Dr. Light, who has been studying relations between blacks and Koreans in Los Angeles since 1980, there is an economic undertone to the friction.
''Many blacks see non-black merchants in their communities in a way that heightens tensions,'' said Dr. Light. ''Their theory is that if you spend money with a Korean grocer on the corner, then your money leaves the black community. And that merchant's store blocks the upward mobility of some black who might have had a store of his own there.''
The same economic worries are fueling other intergroup tensions, said Detective Flynn of the Boston police. As part of his duties with the unit that investigates bias crimes, he lectures to high school students. Most of those who commit the crimes are from working-class backgrounds.
''You talk to white kids who feel they can't get any jobs because there's a quota that favors minorities,'' said Detective Flynn. ''You find it just fuels their prejudice and resentment. Then you talk to black kids who feel they're left out of the job market because of their race and you find they have the same animosity toward whites.''
Dr. Light added, ''People get along fine when they have money in their pocket and can pay the rent.''

Supercollider's Rising Cost Provokes Opposition

BYLINE: By MALCOLM W. BROWNE

 BODY:
IF America eventually decides it can spare the $8 billion or so needed to build the Superconducting Supercollider, the county-size machine might turn out to be a key to the meaning of physical reality, or it might be a dud. But either way, the project is raising intense debate among scientists and politicians as to whether the new knowledge it generates will be commensurate with the enormous cost.
The huge particle accelerator, to be housed in a 54-mile-long tunnel near Waxahachie, Tex., would hurl counter-rotating beams of protons around a racetrack-shaped course, forcing these subatomic particles to collide head on at combined energies of up to 40 trillion electron-volts. This staggering energy would be some 20 times greater than the energy of particle collisions at any existing accelerator.
Proponents expect the machine to produce a deeper understanding of the fundamental forces and particles that are the building blocks of all matter and believe it will bring mankind a little closer to understanding how the universe began and evolved to its present-day complexity. 
But as the time nears to begin the costly construction phase, some seven years after the collider was first proposed to the Energy Department by leading physicists, critics are raising new questions about the project. The huge accelerator has never been popular with those scientists who view it as a budget-buster destined to starve Federal funds for smaller scientific projects, and the voices of critics have grown louder than ever.
Two years ago, Sigma Xi, the scientific honor society, conducted a national poll that found that only 2 percent of the 3,332 scientists who responded favored construction of the Superconducting Supercollider. Even the widely unpopular Strategic Defense Initiative program scored higher, with 4 percent approval.
The Central Design Group for the collider completed its preliminary plans in 1986, estimating the overall cost of the machine at $5.9 billion. But rancorous disagreements have been heightened by a series of increases in the estimated cost. Builders of the machine learned that larger margins of engineering error were essential to bring the machine up to its intended energy, and this would mean enlarging the diameter of the beam line, redesigning the magnets that confine the beam, and adding a mile or so to the machine's length. The estimated cost now stands at nearly $8 billion.
The accelerator's staff of scientists, engineers, technicians and administrators already numbers some 500, and its leaders hope that an environmental impact survey will be completed in the next few months. Some time thereafter initial site preparation will begin, and the project will begin acquiring land.
But Congress might still close down the project or string out construction to reduce annual payments. Supporters of the project say this might amount to killing it because such delays would increase the long-term cost to an unacceptable level. Delay might also render the current design obsolescent as new approaches to accelerator design and new materials are developed by rival teams of scientists. Many physicists believe that the Superconducting Supercollider represents the highest energy that can be economically produced in a circular accelerator, and that the future of high energy physics lies with linear accelerators. Some opponents argue that even the supercollider will be relatively inefficient, and that builders should abandon it and devote their efforts to developing a new type.
Critics, including many physicists, argue that the fruits of high-energy research, intellectually satisfying though they may be, have become too expensive for a nation fighting for economic position against such technologically powerful competitors as Japan. Moreover, even if the new accelerator works flawlessly, they say, its energy might still be insufficient to meet the main discovery goals set for it.
Two years ago disagreements between high-energy physicists supporting construction of the the project and other physicists not involved in accelerator research led to a schism within the American Physical Society, the nation's preeminent professional association of physicists. Bitter exchanges of letters by supporters and opponents of the collider are published monthly by the society's magazine, Physics Today. At one point, members who said they believed their economic and professional interests were threatened by a small but influential bloc of high-energy physicists considered forming an independent association. The society's officers have smoothed over the rift, but opposing opinions about the project remain strong.
Such leaders of the project as its director, Dr. Roy F. Schwitters, are seeking to convince members of Congress and key Administration officials that the Superconducting Supercollider is essential to maintaining a credible program of high-energy research in the United States. Supporters of the accelerator have sometimes sought to sell the project to members of Congress on the ground that it may lead to important innovations in practical technology and would enhance scientific education at all levels. But most scientists agree that the real object in building the project is essentially intellectual and philosophical (some even say theological) rather than practical. The goal is to recreate primordial forms of matter that have not existed elsewhere in the universe (except perhaps in black holes) since the first ten-quadrillionth of a second after the Big Bang creation event.
According to the prevailing theory, only one fundamental force existed during the first instant after the creation of the universe. But as the universe swiftly expanded and cooled, the supposed original unity split into the puzzling multiplicity of forces and particles we know today. By smashing particles together at stupendous energies and briefly recreating conditions (on a microscopic scale) that existed just after the Big Bang, scientists hope to glimpse parts of the original pristine unity of nature, thereby gaining insights into how and why our complex universe took the form it did, a form that made life itself possible.
Dr. Leon M. Lederman, a Nobel laureate, a former director of Fermilab and the president-elect of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, speaks of giant accelerators as ''telescopes that look backward in time.'' In fact, the rise of accelerators has brought about a merger of high-energy particle physics with astronomy, and astrophysicists now regard large particle accelerators and conventional telescopes as complementary tools for deciphering the workings of stars and galaxies.
In particular, physicists would like to discover why the different types of subnuclear particles have the particular masses they do, why they interact only in certain ways, and why certain numbers governing fundamental relationships in nature (for example, the speed of light, 186,000 miles per second) have the values that they do.
As Dr. Lederman and Dr. Sheldon Glashow, another Nobel laureate who supports the Superconducting Suppercollider, wrote in the March 1985 issue of Physics Today: ''Surely the Creator did not twiddle 17 dials on his black box before initiating the Big Bang and its glorious sequela, mankind.'' The great aspiration of science, they say, is to discover how the seemingly arbitrary ''dial'' settings actually are the logical consequences of an underlying universal principle.
But critics argue that the accelerator has been sold to Congress not for its intellectual appeal but because of the supposed technological and economic spin-offs it might generate. At one time the Defense Department even believed the collider would produce military benefits.
Under the Freedom of Information Act, Dr. Charles Schwartz, a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley, recently obtained a copy of a memorandum sent on Jan. 12, 1987, by Robert B. Barker, assistant to the Secretary of Defense, to the White House Domestic Policy Council. The memorandum, which recommended Defense Department endorsement of the supercollider, said:
''The S.S.C. project will have many spinoffs for the Department of Defense, especially in technologies required by the Strategic Defense Initiative, including particle beams, information processing, computer control, pulse power sources and high-energy accelerators. The nuclear weapons community will benefit from the fundamental research on the building blocks of atomic matter.''
Particle physicists backing the accelerator vehemently deny any association of this project or any other high-energy research accelerator with weapons programs. Dr. Robert Wilson, Fermilab's first director, was asked by members of Congress in 1970 whether the new accelerator laboratory would contribute to the development of military technology. He replied: ''It has nothing to do directly with defending our country except to make it worth defending.'' In fact, most physicists see little practical use for the technology in the project, except in high-energy research.
 
The Critics
Losses Feared For Small Projects
Dr. Paul A. Fleury, an officer of the American Physical Society who works as a research director in condensed-matter physics, said he believed that neither Congress nor the public understood what the S.S.C. was intended to do.
''If what the American people really expect of the S.S.C. is an investigation of the ultimate basis of reality, that's fine,'' he said. ''But I'm not sure people realize that what they'll be paying for is nothing more than pure science. Neither the public nor the Congress should deceive themselves by imagining that the S.S.C. will lead to important technological spinoffs. Building the S.S.C., moreover, may exact a heavy economic price, including increasing national neglect of education and a reduction of basic research in fields essential to our competitive position.''
Although overall government support for scientific research is increasing somewhat, he said, the lion's share is going to such ''big science'' projects as the accelerator and on projects with little apparent scientific value, ''such as the projected space station.''
Dr. Fleury added: ''We simply cannot fund these big projects without starving the tens of thousands of smaller research programs conducted by single scientists or small groups. These projects are doing the work that keeps the nation competitive in semiconductors, superconductors and other cutting-edge technology.
''Science and technology in America are in deadly danger. A frog suddenly dropped into a beaker of boiling water jumps out and saves itself, but if the water is heated slowly, the frog fails to notice the heat until it is too late. That's what's happening to most basic research in America,'' Dr. Fleury said, ''and one of the reasons we don't notice it is that we're spending so many research dollars on big-science projects like the S.S.C..''
In a complaint published by Physics Today in July 1988, Dr. John F. Waymouth, retired research director for GTE Electrical Products, asserted that the benefits of the collider were far from certain, and that ''a research director who wants to keep his job will not commit half his budget to the high-risk project while starving the ones that pay the bills.''
Another outspoken critic of ''big science'' who has doubts about the accelerator is Dr. Arno Penzias. He and Dr. Robert Wilson shared in the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1978 for their discovery of a faint microwave signal pervading the entire universe, a discovery accepted by most physicists as confirmation of the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe.
''I'm no expert on the S.S.C.,'' Dr. Penzias said. ''But if we end up beggaring our universities to build this thing, I think we're on the wrong track. One of the big arguments for the S.S.C. is that it will inspire public interest in science and attract young people to the field. But if we can't educate them properly because we've spent our money on big machines instead of universities, where's the point? As a nation we must take a new look at our scientific priorities and ask ourselves what we really want.''
Some of history's most significant physics experiments actually cost very little, he said, and scientific imagination and creativity are still more important than an expensive apparatus. For example, he cited the famous 1887 light-beam experiment conducted by the American scientists Albert A. Michelson and Edward W. Morley, which paved the way for Einstein's special theory of relativity.
But other scientists note that as any science matures, its hurdles become higher and its research costs greater. The only way to make further advances, they say, is to pay the high costs of the needed machines.
 
The Achievements
The Big Machines: Their Findings
Even high-energy physics was originally cheap, but it has come a long way in 60 years, both in its achievements and its price.
Although several systems for accelerating atomic nuclei and electrons were devised early in the 20th century, serious accelerator experiments began with the invention of the cyclotron in 1929 by Ernest O. Lawrence, an American physicist. Dr. Lawrence, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1939 for his invention, built his first cyclotron from cheap magnets borrowed from another laboratory along with some sheet brass, glass and wire, all held together with solder and sealing wax. Only four inches in diameter, the device spun hydrogen nuclei around a circular path, boosting them to an energy of 80,000 electron-volts.
Dr. Lawrence's first cyclotron is now a museum piece at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in California, one of two major laboratories named after him. According to the Lynn Yarris of the laboratory, records show that the four-inch cyclotron cost less than $10. But the price of subsequent accelerators rapidly increased. Dr. Lawrence's 1940 model, the 184-inch cyclotron (parts of which are still used in research) cost $1.5 million. Besides advancing scientific knowledge, that instrument played a key research role in making the uranium-235 used in the atomic bomb that destroyed Hiroshima.
The methods for accelerating particles have changed since Lawrence's time. Today bunches of subatomic particles surf along on radio waves, confined to pencil-thin beams by ultrapowerful (and in some cases, superconducting) magnets. The most powerful existing proton accelerator, the Tevatron at Fermilab, is four miles in circumference and boosts protons and their antimatter counterparts to a collision energy of two trillion electron-volts.
The largest accelerator in the world, completed last year under the frontier between France and Switzerland, is the Large Electron-Positron collider, some 17 miles in circumference. Built by a consortium of European nations for a cost of $1 billion, the device raises electrons and their antimatter counterparts to a colliding energy of 90 billion electron-volts.
Each increase in accelerator energy has deepened human understanding of the nature of matter. Accelerators of the 1950's and 1960's revealed the existence of hundreds of different types of subatomic particles previously unknown to science. From this bewildering profusion, theorists began to notice patterns in the types and behavior of particles and to realize that different combinations of a small number of fundamental building blocks could account for the entire ''particle zoo.''
Dr. Lederman likens this realization to the discovery by chemists that all the elements can be arranged on a chart called a periodic table that reveals their interrelated properties.
Supplied with data from ever more energetic accelerators, theorists thus arrived at the idea that all matter is ultimately made up of ''quarks,'' ''leptons'' and interacting forces. The ''Standard Model,'' a theory that physicists regard as the most successful attempt ever made to describe the fundamental nature of matter, was the result.
But the Standard Model has some conspicuous gaps and troubling inconsistencies. It predicts the existence of six quarks, of which only five have been found. The sixth, the ''top'' quark, has foiled every effort to find it, even those conducted at the world's largest accelerators. This quark must therefore either be much more massive than anyone had guessed, or it does not exist and the Standard Model is wrong.
 
The Prospects
Riddles Remain For the Collider
The search for the top quark illustrates one of the major uncertainties of high-energy physics: it is impossible to predict the energy range required to make a discovery. In 1977, when the ''bottom'' quark was discovered, physicists calculated that the top quark would have a mass of 13.5 billion electron-volts, a mass that could easily be created by the energy planned for Fermilab's Tevatron. After more than a decade of searching at ever higher energies, however, it is now known that the top quark, if it exists at all, must have a mass greater than 89 billion electron-volts, and no one knows how much greater.
Still more troubling to physicists is the riddle of ''broken symmetry,'' a phenomenon in which some unknown force spontaneously breaks the original symmetrical relationship known to have existed between the electromagnetic force (which gives us visible light, among other things) and the weak nuclear force (which causes certain types of radioactivity). Exploring the nature of this mysterious symmetry-breaking force or mechanism has been rated by planners of the Superconducting Supercollider as the machine's highest research priority.
A closely related project will be the quest for a hidden mechanism by which nature endows particles of matter with mass. An all-encompassing force field (sometimes called the ''Higgs Field'') is believed to be the factor that gives matter mass, and this field might be associated with a hypothetical particle called a Higgs boson. The discovery of a real Higgs boson would be a landmark in science, even opponents of the collider agree.
There is a sporting chance that the accelerator could do this, Dr. Schwitters and his associates believe, but even if no Higgs boson is found, ''something equally exciting is certain to turn up,'' he said.
But to reach the energy required to probe the phenomenon of symmetry-breaking, Dr. Schwitters and his staff assert, some changes in the original design of the machine were needed: a more powerful injector to give protons their initial energy boost, a wider hole through which the beams can circulate, about 200 more huge magnets than the 8,600 originally planned, and an additional mile of length.
All this has increased the estimated cost and fed the flames of debate, leading some analysts to suggest a compromise in the form of a somewhat scaled-down version of the collider. But to reduce the project's energy, said Tsung-dao Lee, a Nobel laureate in physics, ''would be like designing a lunar mission that would fly only a third of the way to the moon.''
Debate over the accelerator seems destined for a long run.

HEADLINE: Wolves at Park's DoorSet a Test for Wildlife

BYLINE: By ROBERTO SURO

DATELINE: YELLOWSTONE NATIONAL PARK, Wyo., May 25

 BODY:
Just as the wolf's extermination was among the last violent acts marking the taming of the American West, the predator's return marks a new stage in the often harsh debate over how to manage America's wildlife.
A small population of gray wolves from Canada has fully established itself in northwestern Montana and there are persistent reports of wolves living elsewhere in that state and in central Idaho. The arrival of these wolves from Canada in the last few years has added a sense of immediacy to a long controversy over whether the wolf can coexist with ranchers who have lived happily since it was eliminated it from the West some 60 years ago. The arrival has also focused new attention on proposals to reintroduce the wolf to Yellowstone.
''This is a real test case because it is the wolf and it is Yellowstone, and both are very potent symbols,'' said Hank Fisher, the Northern Rockies representative of Defenders of Wildlife. ''If we succeed here, it will have a major impact on endangered species programs across the country by showing that compromises are possible which make the protection of wildlife fair and acceptable to the public.'' 
Senator James A. McClure, Republican of Idaho, introduced on Tuesday legislation mandating the wolf's return to the park, one day after Congress received a 600-page study concluding that wolf would do no major harm if it were returned to Yellowstone National Park, where it is the only animal species native to the park in modern times that is not represented.
Mr. McClure's proposal was the first action by a major political figure in the northern Rockies in favor of returning the wolf, but some colleagues said they would consider the plan if safeguards were included.
Senator Alan K. Simpson, Republican of Wyoming, said, ''If you can do it in a way which does not decimate the wildlife of Wyoming and a great part of the economy of Wyoming and part of the uniqueness of Wyoming, do it in a way where if the wolf gets outside the park it can be taken, i.e., shot and killed and then have a compensation fund for livestock owners who can prove depredation by that, then I'm ready to continue to talk.''
 
'A Less Than Pure Position'
In the meantime most of the nation's major conservation groups have accepted aggressive proposals for control of the predator if it leaves designated areas, meaning that ranchers would be allowed to kill wolves that threaten their livestock. It is the first time the groups have agreed to substantial limits to protecting an endangered species to strike a deal that could assure its recovery.
''We've realized that we have to settle for a less than pure position in terms of animal rights so we can achieve a greater good,'' said Renee Askins, who founded The Wolf Fund to gather support for the wolf.
In another concession the Defenders of Wildlife created a fund last year that has already compensated five Montana ranchers for their losses from wolves. Such compensation is already in place in northern Minnesota, the only part of the lower 48 states where the wolf has survived.
But Teddy Thompson, who ranches in Montana just north of Yellowstone, said: ''A compensation system will never work in country this rugged. You can loose livestock and not find the carcasses for months, and by then there isn't enough left to prove whether it was a wolf or something else that killed them.''
Whatever happens, any action is likely to involve new applications of the Endangered Species Act that could potentially affect a variety of other controversies including those involving the spotted owl in the Pacific Northwest and the sea turtle in the Gulf of Mexico.
Mr. McClure's bill would create protected recovery areas for the wolves in the Glacier National Park region of northern Montana where they already roam as well as in Yellowstone and in wilderness areas of central Idaho where they would be reintroduced in limited numbers.
 
Opposition to Bill Expected
But outside of these three zones, the wolf would be immediately removed from the endangered species list, and the states of Idaho, Montana and Wyoming would be free to treat the animals as pests or game animals.
By removing the wolf from Federal protection before its recovery is assured the McClure bill ''will probably meet very strong opposition from the conservation community,'' said Michael Bean, a lawyer with the Environmental Defense Fund.
In the House, Representative Wayne Owens, Democrat of Utah, introduced a bill last year that would keep the wolf under the protection of the Endangered Species Act.
The alternative favored by many conservationists is to work with provisions of the Endangered Species Act which allow for the reintroduction of animals designated as a nonessential experimental population.
In such cases, some of the most stringent provisions of the act are not applied and special regulations are written. The killing of rogue wolves by ranchers could be permitted, and protection of the wolf would not automatically take precedence over other activities on Federal lands like logging in national forests.
If no agreement is reached to reintroduce the wolf into specific park or wilderness areas either through the Endangered Species Act or by sidestepping it, the wolves arriving from Canada may force the issue.
 
Wolves Expected to Keep Coming
Wildlife biologists say the wolves will continue their southerly trek but cannot predict their numbers or the speed at which they will travel.
''The worst thing that could happen is for the wolf to come in on its own and be protected as king of all the animals,'' said Brad Little, vice president of the Idaho Woolgrowers. ''It will be an economic disaster with all the restrictions they can put on the use of public land to protect an endangered species. In comparison, introducing them to core areas and managing them outside is semi-acceptable, and if there is the right kind of education process, people around here may decide it is the best deal they are going to get.''
The challenge of handling a wide-ranging wolf population has sharpened debate on broader questions about the ways that the Federal Government manages its vast lands in the West.
Mr. Little, who raises some 11,000 head of sheep near Emmett, Idaho, said, ''It's not the wolf we're scared of, but the wolf managers and all the rules and regulations they'll bring with them.''
While ranchers complain of red tape and bureaucrats, conservationists argue that artificial jurisdictional boundaries hamper responses to natural phenomena like forest fires and migrating animals.
 
'Nothing to Do With Straight Lines'
''Wolves and their prey live in an ecosystem that has nothing to do with straight lines drawn across a mountain range,'' said Ed Lewis, executive director of the Greater Yellowstone Coalition, a group that advocates the management of the entire Yellowstone region as a single natural entity. Currently the region, covering nearly 13 million acres, is administered by two national parks and seven national forests that are all contiguous.
Mr. McClure's bill would limit protection of the wolf in the region to the 2.2 million acres of Yellowstone Parkitself, and much of that is mountain and high plateau which is abandoned in winter by large numbers of animals, including many of those the wolf is supposed to live on.
''If we are looking at the biological reality rather than the political problems,'' Mr. Lewis said, ''the wolves are going to have to be able to follow their other prey all over the public lands. If we arbitrarily decide there is one appropriate place for them and outside they are vermin, then the recovery will fail biologically and politically it will send people exactly the wrong message.''
Ms. Askins, of The Wolf Fund, said: ''Restoring wolves to Yellowstone would be like planting the flag at Iwo Jima. It would be a tangible victory for a country that is demoralized about its environmental problems.''
But Franklin Rigler, a rancher and hunting guide who lives in Corwin Springs, Mont. on the banks of the Yellowstone River, complained, ''Wolves, wilderness and welfare, that's all there's going to be in this state if this thing goes through.''
A burly man who is proud his land was first settled by his grandfather, Mr. Rigler said: ''The wolf is just the opening wedge for those folks who only see mountains and animals out here and don't care about human beings who need to make a living. As soon as they get the wolf, they'll want something else.''

HEADLINE: As Oil Bounty Drains, Alaska Becomes Uneasy

BYLINE: By MICHAEL LEV, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANCHORAGE

 BODY:
Alaskans are used to coping with the cycles of boom and bust inherent in the state's oil-based economy. But now, companies and politicians here are coming to terms with a much more uncertain and unsettling future.
After decades of living off the oil bounty, Alaskans are recognizing that current supplies are draining away and that not enough large new oil fields are being developed or explored to replace the dwindling supplies.
For the first time, oil production began to fall last year at Prudhoe Bay, Alaska's largest field. It generates 75 percent of the state's annual $2.3 billion in revenues from a per-barrel tax and also fuels a good portion of the state's economy through jobs tied directly or indirectly to oil. 
Alaskans had hoped the vast Arctic National Wildlife Refuge would replace at least some of the losses. But since the Exxon Valdez oil spill in the Prince William Sound in March 1989, Congress, under pressure from environmentalists, has put off approving exploration and drilling in the area. And the Government estimates that the chances are slim that enough oil would even be found there to make recovery economical.
To offset the Prudhoe declines, oil industry executives say, the state needs to move more quickly to diversify the economy, to cut state spending and to offer tax incentives to keep oil drillers at work on marginally profitable wells.
The alternative, they say, will be fewer jobs, higher taxes and less prosperity.
''It could take a cold hard splash in the face in the form of dramatic increases in unemployment and a need for a huge tax increase and people voting with their feet before the state says that this has gone beyond a problem to where we are in a crisis and must act,'' said Scott Jones, an oil industry consultant.
William F. Webb, general manager of the Alaska Support Industry Alliance, an oil industry trade group here, said that unless revenue replacements were found, many oil-related companies would begin to suffer within three to five years.
''If something doesn't happen, you will slowly see companies wither away,'' he said.
So far, some state officials acknowledge, the state has done little to forestall or prepare for the economic changes that seem sure to come. They say the oil industry has, at least for now, received enough incentives to work harder to get more oil from marginal wells. Cuts in state spending, always a volatile political issue, have been avoided, partly because the economy appears to be holding up well for now.
But many officials, including Gov. Steve Cowper, agree that Alaska must strengthen its non-oil industries. Unpopular measures like a state income tax must also be considered, they say.
The urgency centers on Prudhoe Bay, which has about 5 billion barrels of oil left in the ground out of an original recoverable reserve of about 11 billion, according to Chuck Logsdon, Alaska's chief oil economist.
 
Projection of Oil Output
With each passing year, as the oil field is further depleted and underground pressure diminishes, less oil can be coaxed to the surface. By the year 2000, Prudhoe Bay production is expected to have fallen below a third of its current level.
Mr. Jones, president of AUS Consultants in Philadelphia, an energy industry consulting firm, estimates that this year's production decline of about 9 percent translates into a 1 percent to 2 percent annual drop in Alaska's economy, mostly from lost wages and reduced taxes.
Perhaps even more threatening, the oil production slowdown is cutting state revenues by 4 percent to 9 percent a year, according to some estimates. This could have a disproportionate effect in Alaska because 30 percent of the population is on the state, local or Federal payroll, higher than in any other state.
Even if annual state spending were held to its current level, a gap of several hundred million dollars a year between spending and revenue could develop in the mid-1990's, according to a study by the Institute of Social and Economic Research at the University of Alaska in Anchorage. By the turn of the century, that gap could grow to more than $1 billion a year.
 
Caution at the Bank
Some Alaskan business executives are already responding to the threat.
At the First National Bank of Anchorage, the lending department has moved to protect itself against a downturn in the economy by cutting the length of some real estate loans it offers to 10 years, down from Alaska's usual 15 years.
''That's to be cautious,'' said David W. Cuddy, senior vice president at the First National Bank of Anchorage. ''We could be looking at a pretty weak start of the next century.''
The threat of a budget deficit and the questions surrounding the future of the oil supply have prompted some Alaskan executives and politicians to call for a search to find for new ways to stimulate the Alaskan economy.
On May 22, Governor Cowper attended an American-Soviet trade conference in Moscow to seek more foreign trade. So far, a spokeswoman for the Democratic Governor said, only a few small deals between Alaska and the Soviets have been struck.
While the Energy Department says the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, a desolate strip of Government-owned land in Alaska's northeast corner, has one of the largest potential oil reserves in the United States, the industry will not know if oil exists there until exploration begins.
The chances that Congress will grant permission for exploration and drilling at the refuge were severely hurt by the Exxon Valdez accident. Under mounting pressure from enivronmental groups, legislators have put off discussing the issue.
There are other promising oil fields on the North Slope of Alaska, including a field discovered by ARCO at Point McIntyre that may hold 300 million barrels of oil.
''That's a big field by any standard, but when you compare it to Prudhoe Bay, it's a real small number in terms of impact,'' said Edward L. Phillips, a petroleum economist with Alaska's Department of Natural Resources.
So far the drive to find new sources of revenues has failed to gain widespread support in Alaska because, for the first time in since an oil-induced depression a few years ago, the economy seems healthy.
''Without a doubt, the decline in Prudhoe Bay is a prospect that is going to result in change of some kind,'' said Mr. Logsdon, the oil economist. ''But people tend to be somewhat myopic. If oil revenues are up and everybody is working and everything looks pretty rosy, you don't want to spend a lot of time thinking about death.''
Last year, the Exxon Valdez cleanup contributed millions of dollars to the state's economy, sparking a recovery that is expected to continue for two more years. Oil prices are higher and real estate values have stabilized. For the next two years, the Alaska Department of Labor forecasts statewide job growth of about 1.5 percent to 2.5 percent.
The state's March unemployment rate of 7.9 percent is the lowest March rate since 1976 when construction on the oil pipeline was at its peak. And Alaskans can expect to receive their annual $1,000 dividends from a $10 billion permanent state oil fund as they have for the last eight years.
''The last 12 months have been pretty good and the next 24 to 36 months will be pretty good, too,'' said Mr. Cuddy of the First National Bank.
While it seems a daunting task to replace a large amount of the oil industry, Governor Cowper said he was optimistic that the economy could diversify. And what expansion cannot provide, he said, tax changes can.
Mr. Cowper, who leaves office in December, said exports of timber, seafood and other non-oil products to the Pacific Rim have rapidly increased since more companies have discovered Anchorage's strategic location between North America and Asia. Last year, the Federal Express Corporation opened an $11 million package-sorting plant, making the city one of its principal hubs.
''I think the Alaskan economy is clearly developing in ways that are not related to oil,'' the Governor said.
Two proposals to build natural gas pipelines from Prudhoe Bay could employ 10,000 to 25,000 people. But Alaskans are skeptical about the plans because the price of the gas in the United States is too low and the supply too plentiful to justify spending many billions in construction costs.
Many economists are wary of such large-scale plans and note that even if all of Alaska's non-oil economy were to double in size, it would still increase the non-oil share of state revenue to only 30 percent.
''There can be replacements for jobs,'' said Holly Stinson, an economist at the Alaska Department of Labor. ''You can find other industries to boost employment by 8,000, But to find industries to bring in what oil brings in, as far as state revenue is concerned, is pretty hard to do.''
That is why the talk sometmes turns to budget cuts, an income tax and a rise in taxes on industry. Much of that talk alarms oil executives, who fear the state will try to make up for the decline in Prudhoe Bay revenues by raising or imposing taxes that will discourage future investment in the state.
''So the future will not be as relatively healthy,'' said Mr. Phillips, the petroleum economist. ''But I'm not worried that Alaska will have a future. It may be smaller, but it will be more diversified and more viable.''

HEADLINE: Japan's Big Banks Shift Strategies

BYLINE: By MICHAEL QUINT

 BODY:
Japanese banks, which earned a reputation for price-cutting as they become the colossuses of the financial world in the 1980's, are adjusting their strategies to improve profits, an area in which they lag behind American and European banks.
The decline earlier this year in the Tokyo stock market, which coincided with other adverse developments for Japanese banks, was a reminder to Japanese bankers that their huge size and soaring stock prices could be an illusory sign of financial well-being.
The largest Japanese banks continue to have have topnotch credit ratings, but their capital strength has been eroded by the drop in stock prices, and they are changing their business plans.
 
'A Fundamental Shift'
''Japanese banks should undergo a fundamental shift in their management style, toward a more profit-oriented management as opposed to a market share-oriented one,'' said Isamu Koike, general manager of the Industrial Bank of Japan's branch in New York. 
Toyoo Gyohten, a special adviser to Japan's Ministry of Finance, said at a recent Columbia University conference on international competitiveness that a spate of problems for Japanese banks would cause a widespread shift toward ''consolidating their businesses and improving profitability rather than continuing to increase market share.''
Japanese banks announced yesterday their earnings for the fiscal year ended March 31, and as expected most reported lower profits and lower profit margins. [Page D16.] Rise in Rates and Reserves The declining profits make clear why the banks feel they must shift strategies. Rising interest rates in Japan, an increase in reserves for losses on loans to third world countries - to 25 percent of such loans from 15 percent - and the fall in the Tokyo stock market hurt profits.
A chronic problem for the banks has been the narrow profit margins in their domestic market. Recognizing the profit limits on lending to large businesses that can raise money in securities markets, Kyoita Ohmori, deputy general manager at the Mitsubishi Bank, the sixth-largest in Japan and the world, recently told analysts that he was aiming at rapid growth in the consumer banking sector, which he said was underexploited and had profit margins ''significantly better than many existing lines of the banking business in Japan.''
By increasing profits and at the same time reining in growth, Japanese banks can increase their financial strength. Many fall short of the standards agreed to in 1988 by regulators around the world, who said banks should have capital equal to 8 percent of assets, after adjusting for the risk of the assets.
In terms of profit earned as a percentage of assets, Japanese banks have long lagged behind American banks. The return on assets for large banks is commonly less than three-tenths of a percentage point in Japan, or 3 yen per 1,000 yen of assets. In the United States, large banks expect a return on assets of more than six-tenths of a percentage point, or $6 per $1,000, and many earn more than $10 per $1,000.
In the American market, where Japanese banks grew rapidly in the 1980's and now account for an estimated one-eighth of all bank lending to busineses, the emphasis on profits will bring cutbacks in low-margin lending to large companies, Japanese bankers said. Prices for letters of credit and commitments to back the sales of commercial paper by corporations are also expected to rise.
 
No Retreat by Planners
But planners at the American offices of several of Japan's largest banks said they would not retreat from activities with high profit margins, like real estate financing, loans to middle-market companies with sales of $50 million to $250 million, and the financing of leveraged buyouts. In those businesses profit margins are wide enough that Japanese banks could cut prices slightly but still earn handsome returns.
Prices of Japanese bank branch loans to Japanese corporations in overseas markets are expected to rise from rates that have been as low as a sixteenth of a percentage point above the banks' cost of funds.
''The Japanese corporations are shocked to learn they cannot rely on cooperation from the branches, especially for short-term loans,'' said one Japanese banker who asked not to be identified. He added that ''this is a very delicate matter with the home office'' because it has often forced branches to make low-profit loans in the interest of preserving the customer relationship.
Issuing letters of credit as backing for bond issues of American municipalities - a business that Japanese banks came to dominate by the late 1980's - is another activity where Japanese banks say they are raising prices.
 
Rises on Letters of Credit
J. Chester Johnson, president of Government Finance Associates, an adviser to local governments that is based in Princeton, N.J., noted that one-year letters of credit once offered by Japanese banks for 12-hundredths of a percentage point are now offered at 25- or 37-hundredths.
The strategy shift at Japanese banks comes at a time when they face changes on several fronts. In the domestic market they are learning to cope with the elimination of Government controls on deposit rates, which began in 1988, plus a sharp rise in the general level of rates after several years of declines.
While the banks' costs of deposits has risen sharply, interest rates on loans have not. Corporate treasurers are resisting loans pegged to a new prime rate that adjusts according to the banks' costs of money.
There also remains an assumption by corporations that Japanese banks should provide without charge certain advisory services for which American banks charge a fee.
 
Drop in Yen a Factor
The decline in the yen relative to the dollar since early 1989 has hurt the capital adequacy of Japanese banks because they hold many assets denominated in dollars but their capital is denominated in yen.
The decline of more than 20 percent between the end of 1989 and the end of March put a dent in the banks' ''hidden reserves'' - their holdings of stock in Japan's premier industrial companies. Those holdings remain huge, at about $300 billion, for the 23 largest banks, but are down from more than $400 billion a year ago.
 
Unwilling to Sell Stock
After raising more than $16 billion of capital by selling stock when prices were higher in 1989, Japanese bankers say they are unwilling to raise more capital quickly by selling additional stock.
Robin Monroe-Davies, president of IBCA, a London-based bank rating firm, calls the drop in Tokyo stocks and changes in Japanese banking practices ''a blessing in disguise'' for Japanese banks and a welcome development for other large banks.
So long as Japanese banks could take comfort in their ability to profit from securities trading and the steady rise in their hidden reserves, they could afford to be complacent about slack profits in their banking business. Chastened by the drop in the stock market, he added, Japanese banks might restrain their growth and price-cutting.
''If the Japanese stock market had not fallen, it is hard to see how the world's financial community was going to deal with the excessive financial power of the Japanese banks,'' Mr. Monroe-Davies said.

HEADLINE: Farm Subsidies and Textiles Top Trade Meeting Agenda

BYLINE: By STEVEN GREENHOUSE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PARIS, May 28

 BODY:
Concerned about slow progress in world trade talks, the finance ministers of the industrial world are expected to try to provide some momentum when they gather here on Wednesday.
At the annual meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the ministers of 24 member nations will focus on current snags in trade talks, notably the simmering dispute between the United States and the European Community over agricultural subsidies.
''It's important to show that things are moving forward on trade,'' said a senior official at the O.E.C.D., an association of industrial nations that seeks to spur economic growth through cooperation. 
The world trade talks are known as the Uruguay Round, because their first meeting was held in Uruguay. Their goal is to remove barriers to international trade.
One important point of contention is Washington's demand that all subsidies of farm goods be eliminated within 10 years. European Community officials have resisted the proposal, asserting that it would drive millions of small farmers out of business.
The secretariat of the O.E.C.D., which is based in Paris, estimates that the industrialized nations spend $270 billion a year to subsidize farm products.
The European Community has proposed a compromise in which subsidies would be balanced, with reductions for many products and increases for others. Washington has rejected this idea.
United States officials assert that phasing out subsidies would be a boon to agricultural exports because American farms are so efficient.
American officials say they will not accept a new agreement that includes only minor changes in agricultural policy. At a news conference earlier this month in Paris, the United States Secretary of Agriculture, Clayton K. Yeutter, said, ''We have far too much in the way of blood, sweat and tears in this exercise to settle for modest reforms in agriculture.''
The next set of negotiations in the Uruguay Round is scheduled to begin on July 23 in Geneva. Trade officials say they hope to reach broad agreement on 15 topics at that meeting to allow trade ministers to sign a new agreement when the four-year round of talks ends this December with a meeting in Brussels.
 
A Call to Ease Textile Restrictions
At this week's two-day meeting of the O.E.C.D., finance ministers are expected to debate how to respond to demands from developing nations concerning textile products.
Textiles are not covered by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and industrialized nations have been able to put far greater restrictions on textile imports than on most other industrial goods.
Some third-world officials are threatening to block the success of the 105-nation G.A.T.T. talks if they conclude that little is being done to remove the trade barriers facing their textiles. Textile exports, they say, are crucial to the economic growth of their countries.
One proposal is for the industrialized nations to agree to a timetable under which textiles would gradually fall under regular trade rules.
 
Group of Seven Meeting
The O.E.C.D. ministers' meeting usually serves as an occasion to help frame the agenda for the annual Group of Seven economic summit meeting, which will be held this year in Houston in July. O.E.C.D. officials said the ministers would discuss how to help the deteriorating environment and how to assist Eastern European countries in their transition to market economies.
On Tuesday, many of the O.E.C.D. ministers will sign an agreement to establish the 42-nation European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which is being created to help Eastern Europe.

HEADLINE: Talking Business; with Morton of Hewlett-Packard;
Looking Ahead At Computers

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Dean O. Morton is executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Hewlett-Packard Company. His main responsibility is the company's computer business, which generated roughly $8 billion in revenues last year. That ranked Hewlett, which is based in Palo Alto, Calif., third among American computer makers after the International Business Machines Corporation and the Digital Equipment Corporation. The company's computer lines include minicomputers, work stations and personal computers. It is a leading maker of printers and also produces calculators, test equipment and medical systems.
Q. How is the computer business? 
A. Not bad. It's strong in our newer systems. Over all, the computer business was up 25 percent last year. So far, it's up 18 percent this year, although that overstates a bit because it includes the acquisition of Apollo Computer. Clearly, mainframes are a slow-growth part of the market. So is the mini. Ninety percent of computer power today is delivered in the form of personal computers.
Q. How has the Apollo acquisition gone? Given that Sun Microsystems has taken the work station market lead, did you pay too much?
A. It is difficult. Trying to converge different computer architectures and designs is a real challenge. But we went into it with our eyes open. As these things go, it was a real bargain. We got a large installed customer base. We got excellent people. We got technology that's going to be quite important to us in the future. I like our situation today much better with Apollo than where we would have been without it.
Q. What's going to be commonplace in computers 10 years from now that is currently experimental?
A. It used to be that you'd get 30 percent more for your dollar each year as computers improved. That was known as Moore's Law, after Gordon Moore at Intel. But today, it's up to 50 percent or more because new designs are so much more efficient. More advanced semiconductor technology is a factor. It's just unbelievable how much can be put on a very small piece of semiconductor real estate today.
The question is how will we use all this power. Less than five years ago, a one-million-instructions-per-second desktop device was a very advanced product. Today, people are talking about desktop machines with 100 million instructions per second at a price of $200 to $500 per million instructions. You may see voice recognition. You are already seeing some handwriting recognition. Artificial intelligence will become more of a factor. You'll see more use of color; you will see 3-D; you'll see smaller size.
Q. Some economists and public officials have Suggested that the United States may have strong companies but not a strong country if businesses continue to move operations overseas. As a company with broad overseas operations, what's your response?
A. I don't see how the U.S. will do well, ultimately, if companies don't do well. Over half of our business is overseas, but we still have two-thirds of our employees here. Over 80 percent of our product development is done here, and we are the 12th-leading exporter. You have to take advantage of the world as a single source of people, a single source of capital. We have to operate in the markets as they exist. Technology crosses borders. Skills move around easily. We develop software in India, China - we just signed contracts to do some in Hungary. We do some of our most creative manufacturing in Malaysia. In our market, you could not survive by being just U.S.-focused.
Q. Do you think it would have been a national setback if Nikon or some other Japanese company had bought the Perkin-Elmer Corporation?
A. No. At some point, you've got to let the market work its will. Staying competitive is a big concern, but the answer is not to pull back within our borders and trade with ourselves. That isn't going to happen.
Q. What has been your experience in Japan?
A. Quite good. We have a $1 billion business there. We have had some problems of access, including some of our own making. We haven't had full kanji character capability throughout the computer business. It's complicated. We are by far the leading supplier of work stations there. That's a business where everything is in Japanese.
Q. Do you see opportunity in Eastern Europe?
A. It will be small for a while, but it's an important opportunity. We did $30 million of business in the Soviet Union last year. Not bad. We did almost another $30 million in Poland, Czechoslovakia, East Germany and Hungary. There could be some flow backward. They have some real software skills.

HEADLINE: California Car Sales Report

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, May 28

 BODY:
Sales of imported cars in California have rebounded after several months of declines and now account for 56 percent of new-car sales in the state, according to the California Report on Automotive Marketing.
A year ago, imports accounted for 48 percent of the California market, based on new-car registration figures. 
''This is a significant turnaround,'' said John Rettie, the editor of the monthly automotive newsletter, which is published by the automotive market research firm J. D. Power & Associates in Westlake Village, Calif.
California is regarded by many industry analysts and auto executives as a bellwether automotive market. Last year, Californians purchased 1.16 million cars, accounting for nearly 12 percent of the nation's car sales.
''The upsurge in domestic penetration during 1989 had raised some hopes among domestic makes that they had turned the tide of constantly increasing import share of the market,'' Mr. Rettie said. ''The latest registration figures appear to dash those hopes.''
The United States auto makers' market share of the California market reached 51 percent for the eight months that ended in August 1989.

HEADLINE: CREDIT MARKETS;
Forecasting Without the Weather

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
In coming weeks, the bond market is likely to get a clearer view of whether the economy is deteriorating, analysts say, as the Government releases economic data that have not been distorted by abnormal weather.
Indeed, weather factors have confused even the Federal Reserve Board. Alan Greenspan, the Fed's chairman, told Congress in February that the central bank would not have a good reading on the economy until early summer.
The unusually cold weather in December caused heating oil prices to rise sharply. And the abnormally warm weather in January and February led to a rise in spring clothing prices and sharply increased construction activity and employment in the early spring. 
''I still think the consumer price numbers may have a bit more noise in them, because the big winter increases in apparel prices have not completely worked their way through,'' said Donald J. Fine, the chief market analyst at the Chase Manhattan Bank.
''But the problems that hit the producer price, construction and employment figures earlier in the year are pretty much over,'' he said.
 
Job Figures This Week
The first important test will come on Friday, when employment statistics for May are scheduled to be announced.
After two straight months of generally weak job growth, analysts said, the May figures could resolve a lot of doubts if the numbers are low again.
''An abrupt rebound from recent months' minimal job gains may not clarify the uncertain state of the economy and keep the 30-year Treasury yield trapped in its recent range above 8.5 percent,'' Susan M. Hering, an economist at Salomon Brothers, noted in the firm's weekly Comments on Credit.
Late Friday, the Treasury's 8 3/4 percent issue was offered at a price to yield 8.66 percent.
''However, a third consecutive weak report may begin to galvanize opinion in favor of modest growth, providing a stiffer test of the bond market's current resistance to lower rates.''
Weather patterns probably did not have much of an effect on job creation last month, but the Government did. Ms. Hering and other analysts estimate that as many as 150,000 people were taken on as census workers in May. Excluding that temporary army, the consensus estimate among analysts is that nonfarm payroll employment rose by about 150,000 jobs.
''The economy is probably growing at a 1.5 percent pace in the second quarter, almost exactly where the Fed wants it,'' Mr. Fine said.
 
Trouble in the Public Sector
Although certain sectors of the economy, most notably exports and capital spending, are expected to produce sufficient growth to ward off a recession, the worsening fiscal condition of state and local governments is beginning to drag down the economy. And the situation is likely to get worse.
The slowdown in corporate profits and sluggish retail sales, among other factors, have cut into tax revenues. As a consequence, budget surpluses, which became the norm during the mid- to late-1980's, have been sharply pared.
''It is probably the worst picture we have seen with the exception of the 1981-82 recession period,'' said Raymond C. Sheppach, executive director of the National Governors' Association. ''Balances are getting razor thin.''
Although a number of states, including New York, New Jersey and Massachusetts, have proposed tax increases along with budget cuts to close deficits, Mr. Sheppach said, few others are likely to follow.
''You aren't going to see a lot of tax increases in an election year,'' he said. ''But you will see a lot of budget cuts unless we go into a fairly serious nose dive.''
In response to the lower tax revenues, debt-ratings agencies have cut their ratings for a number of state and local government securities. But thus far, the decline in credit quality has not pushed up borrowing costs in the tax-exempt municipal bond market.
''If the deterioration in budgets continues on a nationwide basis, I would expect things to change somewhat,'' said George D. Friedlander, a managing director in charge of municipal bond research at Smith Barney, Harris Upham & Company. ''But right now, the yield differential between AAA-rated credits and Baa's is the narrowest in history.''
The differential between the AAA-rated credits and those rated Baa, the lowest realistic rating for a state government, is currently only about 55 to 60 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, Mr. Friedlander said. In 1983, after a deep recession, the differential was about 200 basis points.
 
Steady Demand
Borrowing costs have not escalated for states experiencing severe budget problems because demand for tax-exempt issues has outstripped the supply of new bonds, Mr. Friedlander said. And beleagured states are shoring up otherwise poor ratings by purchasing guarantees from municipal bond insurance companies. Bonds backed by insurance are almost always rated AAA.
''There is lots of insured paper out there, and that is a factor, '' said Hyman Grossman, the managing director of the municipal bond department at the Standard & Poor's Corporation. ''But we are going to see a lot riskier paper in the next two years. If managers in certain states and cities aren't careful, they could fall off the cliff.''
Mr. Grossman declined to specify which states and localities might be in particularly precarious shape.
In addition to New York, New Jersey, Connecticut and Massachusetts, S.& P. said California, Florida and North Carolina may soon face serious problems.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Balancing Teaching and Research

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
GRADUATE business schools are wrestling with the dilemma of how faculty members should divide their time between research and teaching.
Years ago, when business schools were scorned by liberal arts professors as being overly vocational, research was viewed as a way of gaining academic respect. Today, teaching is taking on greater importance as corporate executives and recruiters demand that students be better equipped to handle the challenges of the marketplace.
''Thirty years ago we looked inward, stressing the importance of more research by professors,'' said William K. Laidlaw Jr., the executive vice president of the American Assembly of Collegiate Schools of Business in St. Louis, in an interview last week.
''Now we are moving in the opposite direction toward better teaching,'' he continued, ''and we need to look outward at today's problems - the making of public policy, environmental issues, ethical issues, the internationalizing of courses.'' 
Mr. Laidlaw, whose organization is the governing body for business schools in the United States, said better teaching involved more than having professors spend more time in the classroom. Course content must also be examined. He is of the opinion that business schools should take steps to assure that students have a broader background in liberal arts.
''We want students to know at least one foreign language or to have taken area courses,'' he said. Area courses teach students about a country's culture. Dartmouth College's Tuck School of Business Administration plans to offer intensive language training starting late this fall.
But not every business school is rushing to add language courses. Dr. Scott S. Cowen, dean of the Weatherhead School of Management at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland, called language requirements ''misguided wisdom.''
Knowing a language does not make an M.B.A. more successful as a manager, or give the manager a more global outlook, he said. But he added that students who had spent a semester abroad or worked for the Peace Corps ''would offer a nice extra dimension'' in terms of admission to business school.
He likens the trend of business schools adding new courses ''to adding more bumpers to a car when maybe we should consider a basic design change.''
''There have been no serious innovations in business school education since 1950,'' he said, adding that his school, after five years of planning, is making a radical change this fall. About 25 percent of the school's required courses have been dropped and four new courses have been added, he said.
Deleted were one of two required finance courses, an organizational behavior course, and one of two management policy courses. Separate labor and human resources courses have been combined.
If the deletions sound humdrum, the replacements do not.
First, there is an unusual course that helps students assess their weaknesses. Students who find they are weak in mathematics, for example, can then take an elective in that area to improve their skills.
Even more unusual are the ''perspective'' courses. Students are required to take two of the three courses offered and strongly urged to take all three. The courses are new technology, managing in a global economy, and history of industrial development. They are intended to answer the criticism that M.B.A.'s have little or no historical perspective to relate to current events, since such courses are not required, or even offered, at many business schools, Like Mr. Laidlaw, Dr. Cowen said he ''favors more stress on teaching.'' But he added, ''It is unclear to me how much research is needed.'' He said research should tackle big problems and faculty members should ''communicate findings to students and executives, not just do writing for 10 people to read in esoteric publications.''
He noted that there was a good deal of international research at the school, including a study contrasting career paths of Japanese and American engineers.
And cooperating with Belgium's University of Louvain, faculty members at the school are studying differences in labor and management relations in the United States and in Europe. With some Dutch professors, there is a new project researching information systems in a global economy, he said Recently Twente University, in Enschede, the Netherlands, sent its entire business school class of 23, all engineers, plus a journalist, to Case Western Reserve for 10 days of classes in technical management. Case Western Reserve might send students to Twente next year, Dr. Cowen said.
There have also been reciprocal visits by professors in the Soviet Union and at Case Western, he said.

HEADLINE: The Right Engine, A Touch Of Luck

BYLINE: By JOSEPH SIANO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: INDIANAPOLIS, May 28

 BODY:
It is arguable that once Arie Luyendyk got the right engine, he didn't need much luck to win the Indianapolis 500. Nonetheless, he had the benefit of a couple of factors any oracle would read the right way.
This morning, the day after Luyendyk won the Indy 500 for his first Indy-car victory ever, a track staff member told of finding a coin from the Netherlands, Luyendyk's native country, while walking along pit lane the day the track opened this month.
Luyendyk's wife, Mieke, wore a pair of earrings on race day that closely resembled the good-luck earrings worn by Emerson Fittipaldi's wife, Teresa, when he won this race last year. 
Mieke said she wasn't aware of any such significance when she got the earrings from Luyendyk on Mother's Day, but she allowed that they may just hold some power.
 
Engine Power
Even if they don't, the Chevrolet engine behind her husband's head has enough for the job.
Before joining Doug Shierson Racing this season, Luyendyk's five-year Indy-car career was spent with a series of noncompetitive teams. He had entered the top rank of American racing with good credentials: several victories in the highly competitive Super Vee class in Europe and the United States. His father, Jaap, had also driven Super Vees.
Aat Groenvelt, who owned an Indy-car team, was attracted by Luyendyk's Dutch background and offered him a full-time Indy-car ride in 1985. He was named rookie of the year on the Indy-car circuit and at the Indy 500. He joined Dick Simon's team, another struggling outfit, in 1988.
''I had some good years with Dick Simon,'' Luyendyk said in the post-race news conference, ''but I didn't have the right equipment. It did give me the opportunity to drive Indy cars and get some experience.''
Luyendyk is not hesitant to put his Dutch heritage to work for him. He acquired one sponsor, Dutch Boy Paints, after Simon realized the close resemblance between the company symbol and Luyendyk's 8-year-old son, Arie Jr. Thoughts on Country ''I think the country will be really excited,'' Luyendyk said of his native land. ''They're aware of my racing at Indy. The race was on cable there, and my parents were watching it live.''
Luyendyk, 36, and his family now live in Scottsdale, Ariz.
For Shierson, the team owner, it was a long-awaited return to glory. In the mid-1980's, before the Chevrolet racing engine took control of Indy-car racing, Shierson's team won a total of six races with Danny Sullivan and Al Unser Jr. as drivers.
Before this season, Shierson's team was the leader among the underclass of Indy-car racing: the teams without the Chevy engine that wanted to buy it. ''As I said yesterday, Chevrolet is the heartbeat of Shierson Racing,'' the car owner said.
''It was discouraging,'' he said standing outside his garage at the Speedway today. ''But they wanted to go slow and make sure the program develops along the lines they want it to,'' he said, alluding to the original decision by the engine's builder to supply only four teams. ''I don't begrudge them that.''
When Chevrolet decided to expand its Indy engine program, however, Shierson's team was the first on its list. ''Probably the foremost thing is he fit most of the criteria we have,'' said Bob Applegate, the program director for the Indy V-8. ''They had the commitment, professionalism, the driver.''
Immediately after the race, Shierson refused to comment on how his team managed to avoid the tire-blistering problems that ruined Emerson Fittipaldi's strong chance to win.
Goodyear said the blistering was caused by overinflating the tires for more speed. Shierson was asked if he had used a different inflation.
''What term did you use?'' he coyly asked the questioner. ''Equation?'' No, inflation. ''Oh, that!'' Shierson said. ''I think we had the proper equation.''
 
Awards Announced
Luyendyk won $1,090,940 in cash and prizes. Eddie Cheever, who finished eighth in the official standing, was named rookie of the year. Stan Fox, who ran 10 laps at an average speed just over 54 miles an hour and finished last, was awarded $108,021.

YELTSIN IS ELECTED RUSSIAN PRESIDENT ON 3D-ROUND VOTE

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 29

 BODY:
Boris N. Yeltsin, the maverick politician who has spent three years fighting the Communist Party establishment, today became President of the Russian republic, overcoming a last-ditch effort by President Mikhail S. Gorbachev to block his election before departing for visits to Canada and the United States.
Mr. Yeltsin, whose popular following makes him a clear threat to Mr. Gorbachev's authority as leader of the Soviet Union, won the presidency of the nation's largest republic on a third round of balloting in the republic's Parliament with a final tally of 535 votes, 4 more than the required majority. His opponent, Aleksandr V. Vlasov, the choice of the party and Mr. Gorbachev, trailed with 467 votes.
 
Standing Ovation in Parliament
When the final count was announced this afternoon to the tense and excited gathering at the Grand Kremlin Palace, deputies rose to their feet to give a standing ovation to Mr. Yeltsin, the former Moscow Communist Party chief who was thrown out of the leadership after a disagreement with Mr. Gorbachev over the pace of change.
Outside the Kremlin gates, hundreds of Yeltsin supporters, waving red-white-and-blue prerevolutionary Russian flags and carrying pictures of the new President, gathered to wait for a glimpse of the tall, 59-year-old Siberian, a popular hero who has become a symbol of the promise of real change. 
Speaking to reporters after his election, Mr. Yeltsin said he wanted to build relations with Mr. Gorbachev ''not on confrontation, but on a businesslike basis, dialogue and talks, on a principled basis, not to the prejudice of Russia's sovereignty and interests.''
 
Gorbachev to 'Wait and See'
Mr. Gorbachev, on his arrival in Ottawa for a stop en route to Washington, was asked about the election. The Soviet President said he applauded reports that Mr. Yeltsin had said he was willing to ''work fruitfully with the President of the Soviet Union,'' and then added: ''If, however, he is indeed playing a political game, then we may be in for a difficult time. So we will wait and see. Life is richer than any teacher.'' [Page A8.] Mr. Yeltsin, asked if he expected to receive a message of congratulation today from his longtime foe, said after a dramatic pause, ''Yesterday I could not imagine it, but today it would be the politically correct step.''
In a brief acceptance speech, Mr. Yeltsin offered to put together a government drawn from different political groups in Parliament, including the conservative Communists who fought so hard to keep him from power.
Members of the Russian Parliament and several journalists in Moscow said that on Monday night, a group of several hundred members of the Communist Party hierarchy were summoned to a meeting with Mr. Gorbachev and other members of the Politburo for final instructions on maintaining party discipline in the face of Mr. Yeltsin's candidacy. The failure of this final appeal, delivered on the eve of Mr. Gorbachev's departure for North America, served to underscore the party's loss of authority and the rise of Mr. Yeltsin as an alternative force.
Mr. Yeltsin's open challenge to Mr. Gorbachev marks the first time that differences have been aired in public by political leaders in the Soviet Union since the 1920's, in the aftermath of the death of Lenin in 1924. Until Stalin consolidated his power in the late 1920's, there were frequent clashes between factions in the party.
 
Personal Attack Last Week
Mr. Gorbachev made a surprise appearance last week before the Russian Parliament and delivered a forceful, personal attack on Mr. Yeltsin, whom he accused of attempting to break up the Soviet Union.
The depth of the obvious antagonism between Mr. Gorbachev and Mr. Yeltsin, dating back to Mr. Yeltsin's break with the party hierarchy in October 1987, could lead to a dangerous political stalemate, some Soviets and foreign observers said today.
One battleground is the Soviet Government's latest program of economic change, which relies heavily on drastic and unpopular price increases. Mr. Yeltsin has criticized the plan, and today he referred to the ''unpopular proposals by the Soviet Government to step up economic reform.''
Mr. Yeltsin's own economic program is not well defined, although many of his supporters are banking on the competence of new Russian President's advisers, a group that includes prominent market economists and liberal intellectuals.
His politics, however, continue to worry some members of the Russian intelligentsia. ''The fact that Yeltsin reduces everything to social-political issues is very alarming to me,'' said Dmitri S. Likhachev, the unofficial dean of Russian literary historians and head of the Russian Cultural Foundation, in an interview in Washington.
Mr. Yeltsin's victory, which three days ago seemed a long shot given the strength and resources of his opposition, was attributed by many deputies today to the surge of popular support that came pouring in over the weekend.
 
Force of Popular Opinion Cited
''The deputies had to take popular opinion into account,'' said Nikolai Vorontsov, a member of Parliament and the Soviet Minister of Environmental Protection. ''There could be no doubt that Yeltsin was supported by a majority of the people.''
Outside the main hall, in the ornate czarist chambers of the Grand Kremlin Palace, members of Democratic Russia, the liberal group that led the lobbying for Mr. Yeltsin, greeted each other with giddy jubilation. ''We won,'' said a delighted delegate from the western Siberian oil capital of Tyumen.
Some Yeltsin supporters also attributed his final success to their candidate's public efforts at conciliation. ''Boris Nikolayevich showed he is ready to move towards a compromise, to take other points of view into account,'' said Anatoly Medvedev, a deputy from Moscow, referring to Mr. Yeltsin by his name and patronymic, in the Russian style.
Others said the Communist Party's misguided tactics had granted Mr. Yeltsin success. The party first put up a hard-liner, Ivan K. Polozkov, a party boss from the region of Krasnodar in southern Russia, in the first round of voting, then switched to Mr. Vlasov, the current Prime Minister of the Russian republic, on the final ballot.
Mr. Vlasov had withdrawn in the first round because of a poor performance in delivering a report on the situation in Russia, politically the most significant of the Soviet republics.
''Mr. Vlasov showed in his report that he is not material to be even Prime Minister,'' said Mr. Medvedev, ''while Mr. Polozkov is, I am sorry to say, a demogogue, more of the Russophile type.''
 
Besieged by Supporters
As Mr. Yeltsin left the Kremlin today, he was besieged by hundreds of supporters, who had kept up a vigil outside the nearby Rossiya Hotel, where many deputies have been staying. Chanting, ''Victory! Victory!'' the crowd swarmed around the new President, who pledged to press forward for ''the renewal of Russia.''
''If he hadn't won, the results would been unpredictable,'' said Alla Podlesnova, a 51-year-old doctor from Moscow. ''Yeltsin is the pride and honor of Russia.''
But many in the crowd disputed the notion that Mr. Yeltsin is a rival to Mr. Gorbachev's power. Instead, they said he would provide a needed counterweight to the Soviet leader, a prod toward more rapid change.
''This is not a defeat for Gorbachev,'' said Sergei Shiskin, a 37-year old translator from Siberia. ''It is a lesson.''

Soviet Stage: Is 2 a Crowd?

BYLINE: By FRANCIS X. CLINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, May 29

 BODY:
Mikhail S. Gorbachev may not yet face a full-fledged political opposition in this deeply troubled land, but he now certainly has a personal nemesis to haunt his days of power.
Boris N. Yeltsin, the bluff, resilient politician purged from the Gorbachev Government in 1987 for daring to complain about the slow pace of national renewal, has sensationally resurrected himself in the bruising game of Soviet politics.
He has won the chief office in the nation's heart, the Russian republic, and has gained a showcase to establish himself as a kind of president-in-waiting, a choice of the people more than the party and one of the few politicians to rattle Mr. Gorbachev in public.
 
Talent for Self-Promotion
With his booming public statements, tight grin of self-confidence and sometimes bizarre talent for self-promotion, Mr. Yeltsin prevailed by risking himself in the electoral arena so carefully avoided by Mr. Gorbachev. 
Even sweeter for the one-time Gorbachev protege, Mr. Yeltsin won the votes he needed by withstanding Mr. Gorbachev's long and bitter opposition, and probably by benefiting from it too.
Mr. Yeltsin's fresh hurrah could not have come at a worse moment for Mr. Gorbachev. The Soviet leader's failure to enact a program of effective economic renewal these last five years has become the chief anxiety of a Soviet public jaded by overpromise, a fact that Mr. Yeltsin rarely fails to mention in his now global rounds of celebrity.
Mr. Gorbachev must contend with the distracting shadow that the Yeltsin victory now casts over his summit appearance in Washington this week. And the Soviet leader will find the fledgling political insurgency at home newly emboldened by Mr. Yeltsin's success just as the public begins to focus on the important Communist Party congress scheduled for July. Mr. Yeltsin has already called for pluralistic democratic reforms that go beyond anything that Mr. Gorbachev has endorsed.
For all the contrasts of agenda presented by Mr. Yeltsin, it is his style that most wins him public support, support that is unusually fervid for Soviet politics.
 
Playing to the Gallery
From his earliest days as an engineer and party loyalist, the tall, husky politician has shown a taste for playing to the public's enjoyment at seeing an occasional nest of party bureaucrats purged or some profiteering shopkeeper dramatically denounced by Mr. Yeltsin as he walks the streets and chats with the public.
Such flesh-pressing politics are less common to Mr. Gorbachev, who prefers more awkward tableaux in which the public serves as a backdrop for his long, self-assured monologues.
Mr. Yeltsin seems to have a knack for bringing out displays of pettiness in Mr. Gorbachev, like the long and rather sniping critique of Mr. Yeltsin's victory that Mr. Gorbachev gave today in Canada, a performance devoid of any warmth for a man whose political capital has considerably grown.
''My perpetual opponent, the lover of half-measures and half-steps,'' Mr. Yeltsin fairly sneers in describing the Soviet leader, less than three years after Mr. Yeltsin was purged from the Politburo for offering an unscheduled critique of the shortcomings of Mr. Gorbachev's beloved program of economic and political restructuring.
''I didn't last long among them,'' Mr. Yeltsin wrote proudly in his autobiography, ''Against the Grain.''
''I bolted like a caged animal when I could stand it no longer.'' Ballast or Bombast? His critics, including some doubters among his colleagues in the insurgent movement, discount such statements as vintage Yeltsin bombast. But Mr. Yeltsin's public has stuck with him and grown more convinced of his superiority, even through a steady stream of odd personal incidents and endless aspersions from the Kremlin about the depth of his convictions.
The odd incidents include a mysterious river dunking that Mr. Yeltsin first described as a plot on his life, but later waved off as part of his private affairs. There was also his visit last year to the United States, which was followed by newspaper articles quoting critics who attributed a slurred, playful speech to excessive alcohol.
Mr. Yeltsin described it as a plot to discredit him. Such a suggestion of intrigue is one that ordinary citizens remain quite willing to attribute to Kremlin operatives.
 
'Unholy Hullabaloo'
Those odd tangents only make Mr. Yeltsin more of a focus for public delight at his iconoclastic capering through the generally dull, untrustworthy world of party politics. He seems to feed on the public's disbelief in the Government.
He is the reigning master among the growing circle of Communist politicians now running against Communism. As of today he can call himself President of Russia, smiling at the ''unholy hullabaloo'' that the Gorbachev Government has created around him by attempting to end his career.
''I am undergoing personal perestroika,'' he says of his resurrection.

HEADLINE: New York State G.O.P. Supports Abortion Rights for First Time

BYLINE: By FRANK LYNN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RYE, N.Y., May 29

 BODY:
The New York Republican Party, for the first time in its history, approved an abortion platform today that supports ''reproductive rights for women.''
The action, approved unanimously by delegates who gathered here to pick a candidate for governor, follows a national trend in the party, whose leaders have sought to portray the G.O.P. as an umbrella that could encompass various positions on abortion.
The state party acted in part to make sure that it was in step with Pierre A. Rinfret, an economist who is scheduled to be nominated for governor on Wednesday. Mr. Rinfret supports a woman's right to an abortion, according to Republican leaders.
 
Greater Flexibility
In addition, some state party leaders have had a tradition of displaying a liberal posture on abortion dating to 1970, when the Republican-led Legislature and the Republican Governor, Nelson A. Rockefeller, enacted one of the first state laws legalizing abortion. That was three years before the Roe v. Wade decision by the United States Supreme Court permitted abortion. 
The Republican national party platform opposes abortion in most instances, as do some of its leading officeholders, including President Bush and Senator Alfonse M. D'Amato of New York.
But top Republican strategists, like Lee Atwater, the party's national chairman, have sought to project greater flexibility on the issue since a Supreme Court decision last year gave states more authority to regulate abortion. Since the ruling, abortion-rights groups have become increasingly active politically. In New York, the party has been pressured to take a more liberal position by some of its public officials and female contributors.
In 1982 and 1986, the New York State party did not take a position on the issue, and both gubernatorial candidates, Lewis E. Lehrman and Andrew P. O'Rourke, the Westchester County Executive, opposed abortion. The Republicans' move today is almost certain to widen a schism with their traditional ally, the New York Conservative Party, which opposes abortion. But it also provides them with defense against Gov. Mario M. Cuomo and Democratic legislative candidates, who plan to make an issue of abortion this year.
''Mario Cuomo would like nothing better than to talk about abortion and avoid talking about taxes and spending,'' said Assemblyman George Pataki of Westchester County, who is the chairman of the Republican Platform Committee.
 
Approved Without Debate
The usual passions and emotions surrounding the issue were absent as about 100 Republican State Committee members, about one-third of the total at the party's nominating convention here, approved the plank without debate or dissent.
''State government must not become a 'big brother' regulating people in their personal affairs and lives, and the New York State Republican Party reaffirms its historic commitment to the right of privacy and reproductive rights,'' the platform plank declared.
The word abortion is mentioned only once in the three-paragraph plank in an effort to defuse any anger among anti-abortion Republicans.
Assemblyman Pataki said the New Yorkers were essentially adopting Mr. Atwater's position, providing a ''tent'' for those on both sides of the issue. He said that ''pro-choice people are delighted'' about the abortion plank and that anti-abortion Republicans ''accept that there is diversity in the party.''
But the state's two leading Republicans, Senator D'Amato and State Comptroller Edward V. Regan, reflected the split among Republican officials who depend on a conservative constituency that often opposes abortion.
Mr. D'Amato said at a news conference here that he would have preferred that the party remain neutral on the issue, while Mr. Regan, acknowledging that he was a practicing Catholic, said he favored ''a woman's right to choice.''
 
Hailed as Victory
Tanya Melich, executive director of the New York State Republican Family Life Committee, a leading proponent of abortion rights, hailed the plank as a victory.
Opposition to the party's position on abortion began developing quickly. The Nassau County Comptroller, Peter T. King, who was the party's candidate for attorney general in 1986, said, ''It's bad enough to lose but it's worse to surrender your principles even before the first shot is fired.''
The Republican platform came on the first day of the party's state convention here as top Republican leaders, including Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Regan, met Mr. Rinfret for the first time.
But no one else did as Mr. Rinfret avoided public appearances. He literally sneaked into a Republican leaders' meeting by coming from the rain outside through sliding doors directly into the closed-door meeting at the Hilton Hotel.
 
A Two-Page Biography
The only other sign of Mr. Rinfret was a two-page biography that suddenly appeared in a convention pressroom.
Party leaders were still searching for candidates for lieutenant governor and state attorney general to run with Mr. Rinfret. But they managed to nominate one member of the state ticket, their only incumbent, Mr. Regan, the Comptroller, who will be seeking a fourth term as the state's chief fiscal officer.
Republicans who met Mr. Rinfret for the first time today praised him as articulate and committed to a serious effort to be elected despite admittedly great odds.
Adding to those odds was the position of Mr. D'Amato and Mr. Regan, who steadfastly have refused to criticize Governor Cuomo directly at separate news conferences. Both are known for often distancing themselves from their party and its candidates.
Senator D'Amato, who emphasized the crime issue without mentioning the Governor in a brief speech to a ballroom that was two-thirds empty, said at the news conference that ''it's no secret that the Governor and I work together.''
He added: ''You want me to go out and hit him with a hammer. I'm not going to do that.''
 
'Enough Blame'
Mr. Regan declined to even place blame for the state's fiscal crisis on Governor Cuomo, saying repeatedly that ''there's enough blame to go around.'' He denied that he was already running away from Mr. Rinfret.
The White House has also distanced itself from the New York Republicans' problems in picking a state ticket. One sign of the cool relationship was the New Yorkers' failure to have a national Republican figure make the keynote address as they had hoped.
They had sought to have Jack F. Kemp, a former New York Congressman who is now Housing and Urban Development Secretary, speak, but had to settle for the state's newest Congresswoman, Susan Molinari of Staten Island.
 
Both From Manhattan
As they scrambled to fill their ticket, Republican leaders were conscious that the two candidates already effectively chosen, Mr. Rinfret and Mr. Regan, are both residents of Manhattan, one of the weakest Republican voting areas in the state.
J. Patrick Barrett, the state Republican Party chairman, said he had now ruled out another Manhattan resident, Herbert London, a New York University dean, as a potential lieutenant-governor candidate. Mr. London has already said he would accept the Conservative Party nomination for governor.
The two leading candidates for lieutenant governor are apparently Toni Rettaliata, a former Suffolk County assemblywoman, and the Oneida County Executive, Jack Plumley.

HEADLINE: In Managua, New Rulers and Never-Ending Battles

BYLINE: By MARK A. UHLIG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANAGUA, Nicaragua, May 26

 BODY:
When striking Sandinista workers chained themselves inside state buildings this month and set barricades on fire, forcing the new Government to a halt, Yolanda Navarro Castro came to a bitter conclusion about her country.
''I could see that this was never going to end,'' said Mrs. Navarro, who spent long hours getting to work each day after the strikes paralyzed Managua's bus system. ''The conflicts, the fighting, it won't ever stop.''
Like hundreds of thousands of other weary Nicaraguans, Mrs. Navarro, a 39-year-old food vendor, voted in national elections in February in the hope that whatever side won the balloting would mark a clear break with a decade of turmoil and civil war. 
But in dozens of recent interviews, Nicaraguans indicated that their optimism has begun to unravel as political confrontation and economic crisis continue. A month after taking office, the Government of President Violeta Barrios de Chamorro faces almost daily protests from the still-powerful Sandinista Front. The economy, despite the prospect of new American aid, has been battered by drastic currency devaluations and inflation. And deadlines for disbanding the contra army have dissolved in a game of perpetual negotiation.
''We voted so that things would change, but nothing has changed,'' Mrs. Navarro said, watching black marketeers on the street waving stacks of devalued local currency to sell for American dollars. ''We had hope. Everyone had hope. But look what has become of it. Every day, our lives get worse.''
Like Mrs. Navarro, many Nicaraguans blame the Sandinista Front for their unhappiness. ''It's like a plot,'' said Eberto Tapia Tapia, a 40-year-old carpenter, referring to the Sandinistas' aggressive tactics of pressure and protest against Mrs. Chamorro's Government. ''They had it planned so that she would never be able to govern. Everyone sees what they're doing.''
 
Government Viewed as Weak
Although Mrs. Chamorro is usually spared direct criticism, Nicaraguans on all sides are voicing deep pessimism about her Government, calling it weak and without clear direction. Sandinista supporters portray the new Government as a tool of right-wing interests while Mrs. Chamorro's own sympathizers accuse it of failing to hold the line against Sandinista demands.
Government officials say that their compromises are in the spirit of national reconciliation and that criticisms of their performance are premature, that they need time to put their program in place. But few in the diverse ruling coalition agree on what the new program should be.
Nicaraguans from the two political camps appear to agree on the one thing that they believe still offers hope of improvement in their lives: $300 million in American aid that was recently approved by Congress after repeated delays.
''The last devaluations have been too hard on the people,'' said William Antonio Castano Hernandez, a 19-year-old Sandinista supporter who works as a bricklayer in Managua. ''Violeta has promised a lot of things she couldn't fulfill. Maybe if she had the money she could keep her promises.''
 
Sandinistas' New Role
But most Nicaraguans interviewed appear to harbor little hope that even the greatest foreign windfall can overcome the effects of a political conflict that cuts across the heart of Nicaraguan society.
Since their election loss on Feb. 25, Sandinista leaders have repeatedly stated their commitment to act as a constructive opposition in rebuilding the country. But in a remark that is now famous, former President Daniel Ortega Saavedra has also declared that the Sandinistas intend to ''rule from below'' despite their defeat.
The strength of that threat was demonstrated this month when the strike by Sandinista-led Civil Service unions forced Mrs. Chamorro's Government to grant broad concessions on wages and job guarantees.
Sandinista leaders have sharply criticized currency devaluations and inflation under the Chamorro Government, but the Sandinistas' own record in the waning days of their rule has fed a belief that the current crisis was deliberately planned to discredit the new Government.
 
A Stop to Devaluations
Sandinista economists have insisted that no important changes were made in the Government's monetary policy between the February elections and Mrs. Chamorro's inauguration on April 25. But central bank records show that official currency devaluations, which had occurred regularly for years, virtually ceased in that period. At the same time, the amount of currency placed in circulation sharply increased, in what Mrs. Chamorro's advisers have charged was a deliberate move to cause a surge of inflation.
In the same lame-duck period, the Sandinista-controlled National Assembly approved a series of sweeping new laws on the ground of protecting the ''conquests of the revolution.''
One such law, which grants permanent ownership rights to Nicaraguans who had been renting or squatting on Government property, is widely supported. But other measures, like those protecting the jobs of Sandinista bureaucrats or insuring the autonomy of university administrators, have drawn denunciations from many Nicaraguans.
University autonomy, they note, was largely respected even under the former dictator, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, but in the last decade it was revoked by the Sandinistas themselves as they extended close control over higher education.
 
Strikes Are Criticized
Nicaraguans interviewed also appeared overwhelmingly to criticize the Sandinistas' decision to press their demands against the new Government by means of strikes, a form of protest that was rarely tolerated by the Sandinistas.
''The Sandinistas would never have allowed the kind of strikes that they're using now,'' said Rolando Montiel Castillo, an auto mechanic, who noted that the Sandinista Government had used riot policemen and tear gas to break up strikes as recently as last June. ''They're fighting for turf, not for principle. Do they think we can't remember?''
Sandinista leaders have made clear their determination to fight on each issue as it comes up. They accuse the Government of trying to dismantle 10 years of change and of reinstituting the right-wing policies of the Somozas.
In the resulting atmosphere of conflict, the process of demobilizing some 10,000 contra guerrillas now inside Nicaragua had been one of the few signs of concrete progress. But it too has stalled as contra leaders have stopped handing over their weapons and have demanded new concessions from the Chamorro Government.
In interviews, a striking number of Mrs. Chamorro's supporters said they did not believe the contras should disarm if the political situation was not stabilized. Some went even further.
''If they tell me, I'll go to the mountains in a minute,'' a 34-year-old man said, referring to the contra army with which he fought before accepting amnesty last year. ''This can't go on.''
But most Nicaraguans remain clearly anxious to see the demobilization completed. And to most of those interviewed, the very suggestion of new fighting has only reinforced doubts that their country will ever find its way to lasting stability.
''Nobody should be talking about force,'' said Ricardo Hernandez Aleman, a 46-year-old construction worker. ''That will just put us back into the same trap all over again.''

HEADLINE: Bok to Step Aside at Harvard, Ending 20 Years as President

BYLINE: By FOX BUTTERFIELD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: CAMBRIDGE, Mass., May 29

 BODY:
Derek C. Bok announced today that he would step down next spring as president of Harvard University, ending his 20-year tenure in perhaps the most prestigious post in American higher education.
The resignation of Mr. Bok has been rumored for some time. In an interview today, Mr. Bok, who is 60 years old, said he was leaving partly because ''I've always thought 20 years was a good round number,'' and partly because Harvard is about to begin a $2 billion multi-year fund-raising campaign that he said ''calls for continuity.''
His announcement comes when Harvard is also without a dean of the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, the school's second-most important post. Henry Rosovsky, a popular and highly respected former dean whom Mr. Bok has named to be acting dean next year, had been widely considered a leading candidate to succeed Mr. Bok as president. But Mr. Rosovsky is 62, and he said today that he would not seek the job. 
A search committee will be formed shortly, Harvard officials said today.
 
Two Eventful Decades
Mr. Bok, a graduate of Stanford University and the Harvard Law School, is only the second president since Harvard was founded in 1636 who did not graduate from Harvard College, the undergraduate school. The other was the university's first president, Henry Dunster.
Mr. Bok's years at Harvard have been marked by the creation of the John F. Kennedy School of Government; the effective merger of Harvard with Radcliffe; the development of a new curriculum for undergraduates, and a record of strong financial management.
Mr. Bok oversaw the establishment of the Harvard Management Company, which helped Harvard's endowment grow from $1 billion when he assumed the presidency in 1971 to $5 billion today.
Mr. Bok has come under criticism from some students and alumni for refusing to divest all of Harvard's holdings in companies doing business in South Africa, and he lost a nasty battle with the school's clerical workers in 1988, when they won an election that permitted them to unionize.
 
'What a Wonderful Tour'
But Mr. Bok was widely praised today by faculty members and other university presidents for his advocacy of liberal education, his eloquence in articulating the troubles facing American universities and his decency as a colleague.
''He's just been extraordinary -what a wonderful tour Derek had,'' said Donald Kennedy, the president of Stanford. ''I've found him terrific to talk to about issues in higher education or when I just had a practical problem.''
William G. Bowen, the president of Princeton University from 1972 to 1988 and now the head of the Mellon Foundation in New York, said of Mr. Bok: ''He has been and continues to be a simply extraordinary leader in higher education. He served Harvard's interests very well.''
 
'No Cult of Personality'
It was natural for Mr. Bok to assume a leading national role, Mr. Bowen said, given Harvard's status as the oldest university in the country and its reputation as one of the pre-eminent institutions of higher learning. But Mr. Bowen added that with Mr. Bok, ''There was no cult of personality, no overwhelming ego involved.''
John Kenneth Galbraith, a Harvard professor emeritus in economics, said Mr. Bok ''sets a model for all college presidents in his amiable response to intrusive and even obnoxious professors.'' Professor Galbraith said that whenever he wrote a note of suggestion or complaint, Mr. Bok always wrote back by hand. ''No one in the computer age was so addicted to the pen,'' Professor Galbraith said.
Mr. Kennedy of Stanford, a graduate of Harvard College who also received his Ph.D. in biology from Harvard, said he sees three major challenges for Mr. Bok's successor. The first is insuring Harvard's financial stability, even though it has the largest endowment of any private university in the country, because of rapidly rising costs.
The other problems are reconsidering the unique relationships among Harvard's different schools, including the Medical School, the Law School, the Business School and the Faculty of Arts and Sciences, which are run independently, and improving the quality of undergraduate education.
 
Next Decade's Challenge
James O. Freedman, the president of Dartmouth College and also a graduate of Harvard, said the biggest challenge would be improving teaching for undergraduates, a perpetual student complaint at Harvard. ''It is very hard in a large research institution to place adequate emphasis on undergraduate teaching,'' Mr. Freedman said. ''That's the challenge of Harvard's next decade.''
But Mr. Freedman, who is chairman of the Ivy League Group of Presidents, said Mr. Bok's greatest achievement was his role in revising Harvard's undergraduate curriculum after the student upheavals of the late 1960's. In the late 1970's, Harvard began to return to a ''core curriculum'' of required liberal arts courses, including some newly created classes in what was termed ''moral reasoning,'' or ethics.
Mr. Bok was chosen Harvard's 25th president shortly after anti-Vietnam War demonstrations had disrupted the campus. There were widespread hopes that his expertise as a labor lawyer and his experience as dean of the Harvard Law School would help him calm the university.
After the United States withdrew from Vietnam and the student protests subsided, Mr. Bok was able to preside over a period of sustained growth at Harvard.
 
Turmoil in Law School
Paradoxically, the one Harvard school that has remained beset by unrest is Mr. Bok's own original unit, the law school. It has been embroiled in a controversy over hiring more minority faculty members and divided by a dispute on the proper way of teaching the law.
Mr. Bok's most obvious achievement has been the creation of the Kennedy School of Government. Just as earlier Harvard presidents had founded the medical school and the business school, Mr. Bok had a vision of helping stimulate the growth of a new class of professionally trained experts in government to improve American politics and public service.
Under Mr. Bok's guidance and with a large infusion of funds, the Kennedy School has emerged as one of the most dynamic parts of the university, with popular public lectures by visiting dignitaries, new case studies in public-policy problems and a growing faculty roster that has included a number of senior members of the Reagan and Bush administrations, such as Richard G. Darman, the director of the Office of Management and Budget.
But some professors in other departments have charged that, unlike the law or medical schools, the Kennedy School does not teach any real discipline, and has diverted funds from other parts of the university.
 
Another Leading Candidate
The Kennedy School's dean, Robert D. Putnam, a professor of government, is another leading candidate to succeed Mr. Bok.
Among Mr. Bok's other accomplishments was his reorganization of the university's administration to install a series of powerful vice presidents, a move some professors have criticized as infringing on the faculty's powers. Mr. Bok also set up Harvard's own in-house legal team.
Mr. Rosovsky, who will become acting dean of the faculty this summer, said one of Mr. Bok's real achievements was simply his longevity, at a time when most college presidents burn out after a decade or less because of the demands of fund-raising and faculty disputes.
Moreover, Mr. Rosovsky said, Mr. Bok had been ''very accessible, very pastoral,'' in his contact with professors, and he had taken enormous pleasure in his authority to make all tenured appointments to Harvard's faculty.
''He always said that was the part of the job he enjoyed most,'' Mr. Rosovsky commented. ''It was what kept him intellectually curious.''
The only current presidents of major universities who have served longer than Mr. Bok, according to the Association of American Universities, are Chancellor Charles E. Young of the University of California at Los Angeles, who took office in 1968, and Wesley W. Posvar of the University of Pittsburgh, who assumed his job in 1967. Mr. Posvar has announced he will retire next year.
In the interview today, Mr. Bok insisted he had been too busy to think about what he would do after leaving. The Harvard Corporation, which governs Harvard, has offered him the prestigious job of university professor, the best teaching position at Harvard. But Mr. Bok said, ''I'm not sure if this is what I will do.''

CORRECTION-DATE: May 31, 1990, Thursday, Late Edition - Final

 CORRECTION:
An article yesterday about Derek Bok's plan to leave the presidency of Harvard misstated the number of the university's presidents who were not graduates of Harvard College. Mr. Bok was the third; the others were Harvard's first two presidents, Henry Dunster and Charles Chauncy.

HEADLINE: Toward the Summit;
U.S. Aides See Shackles On Their Soviet Guest

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
The Bush Administration believes that President Mikhail S. Gorbachev's domestic problems will not prevent him from completing pending arms control treaties, but it is increasingly concerned that they might become an obstacle on broader issues like the future of Germany, Administration officials said today.
The United States is most anxious to resolve the question of unifying Germany and to persuade Mr. Gorbachev to soften his opposition to allowing Germany to stay in NATO. A senior Administration official said Mr. Bush recognizes that Mr. Gorbachev has ''deep problems'' on this score, stemming from Soviet scars from World War II and strong opposition at home to allowing Germany to remain in the Western alliance.
The official said the United States is considering some gestures to strengthen the role of the 35-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe if Mr. Bush believes that might help persuade Mr. Gorbachev to budge on Germany. The official would not say what these gestures might be, but stressed that Mr. Bush will not ease his refusal to grant any military functions for the conference, which is favored by the Soviet Union as the organization to oversee a pan-European security system. 
Administration officials also said they have been sensing an increasing desire by the Soviet leader to attract Western investment. Soviet officials have said they hope the summit meeting will produce economic agreements that Mr. Gorbachev can use to ''demonstrate that he has solidified the relationship with the United States,'' one official said.
 
Strong Figure, Strong Challenges
On the eve of Mr. Gorbachev's arrival in Washington, senior Administration officials said that the Soviet leader seems in firm control of the levers of state, but that there are more challenges to his authority than any superpower leader has faced going into a summit meeting since Richard M. Nixon went to Moscow in 1974 in the middle of the Watergate crisis.
The officials said the upheaval in the Baltics, economic turmoil and political developments like the election of Boris N. Yeltsin as president of the Russian republic have cast a shadow over the summit meeting.
''It doesn't play directly into the talks,'' a senior official said. ''But I think it is part of this image of a man coming here besieged and beleaguered.''
The official said that ''doesn't necessarily mean he will be weak and therefore will roll over to any proposal.''
''It could have the opposite impact,'' the official said. ''He may feel that he can't give an inch.''
Mr. Gorbachev's political troubles have created a turbulent political picture that American analysts are struggling to sort out. ''In terms of Kremlin politics, I think Gorbachev may be as strong as anybody's been in recent memory,'' a senior official said. ''What is different in the Soviet internal political equation is what's going on out there in the society.''
 
Attempts to 'Inoculate' Progress
Another official said, ''Gorbachev has more legal power than any other Soviet leader but his authority seems to be steadily eroding.''
Fearing that Mr. Gorbachev will be tied up by domestic turmoil, Administration officials are talking about trying to ''lock in'' as many specific agreements as possible. A senior official said the United States has ''done the best we can to try to inoculate'' arms control treaties now being negotiated against any future political reversals. But the official said, ''Obviously, Gorbachev is an important part of the equation.''
What concerns the Administration, officials said, is the lingering uncertainty over how much Mr. Gorbachev will be able, or willing, to accomplish, beyond what one called ''last year's treaties and agreements.''
''No one is writing off Gorbachev,'' the official said. ''The question really is whether he's going to be able to deal at this time, or whether his domestic problems and the preoccupation with Germany and the World War II legacy will make this just an important discussion or a breakthrough. Our inclination is to think that it won't be a breakthrough and to hope it might lead to something later this year.''
 
Last-Minute Schedule Changes
On the day before Mr. Gorbachev's arrival, officials were still trying to sort out the details of his schedule.
After 10 days of fevered preparation, officials at the Hoover Institution of War, Revolution and Peace at Stanford University were informed late Monday that Gorbachev will not visit the research institution Monday when he travels to the university campus south of San Francisco.
The official explanation, delivered by Valentin Kamenev, the Soviet Consul General in San Francisco, was that Mr. Gorbachev's schedule was ''too tight.'' But there was speculation in San Francisco that the institute had been removed from the schedule because of its reputation as a bastion of anti-Communism.
Mr. Gorbachev is scheduled to have breakfast on Monday with former President Ronald Reagan at Mr. Kamenev's official residence. The Soviet President and his wife, Raisa, are to visit the Stanford University art gallery and its business school.

HEADLINE: Toward the Summit;
American Fear of Soviets Declines, Survey Finds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL ORESKES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, May 29

 BODY:
As President Bush prepares for his summit meeting with President Mikhail S. Gorbachev of the Soviet Union, Americans no longer worry very much about the Soviet Union as a military threat.
While the strategic relationship between the superpowers used to be the prime concern at summit meetings, the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll of 1,140 Americans found that the expectation of a nuclear war has fallen far below levels of a decade ago. Fewer than one American in five says a nuclear war is likely in the next 10 years, compared with nearly half when the question was asked almost 10 years ago.
Moreover, one American in five surveyed by phone in the poll from May 22 to 24 now views the United States as superior in military strength to the Soviet Union, the highest number since the Times and CBS News began asking this question in 1978. Another two in five said the superpowers are equal in strength. 
Domestic public opinion forms an important backdrop to summit meetings. Much has been made about how Mr. Gorbachev, more than any of his predecessors, must take such opinion into account, particularly because of rising complaints at home about the Soviet economy. While Mr. Bush's economic troubles are hardly as severe, polling by The Times and CBS News shows that in other ways Mr. Bush is also dealing in a domestic political world drastically different from that of his predecessors.
 
Question of Dominance
This can best be seen by looking at the dramatic long-term change in attitudes among Americans on the question of whether the Soviet Union is trying to dominate the world. In 1950, 81 percent of America said the Soviet Union was trying to do so, when asked their opinion by the Gallup Organization. But when The New York Times and CBS News asked a similiar question in a survey in early April this year, only 33 percent expressed that view.
There are substantial differences among Americans in their attitudes toward East-West relations, but these differences are not based to any large degree on partisan leanings or ideology. Rather, the most important factors appear to be education and how much attention the person pays to the news about the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe.
The least educated and least informed are twice as likely to say they expect a nuclear war, are the least enthusiastic about Mr. Gorbachev and are the least likely to trust the Soviets to honor an arms deal.
Both Mr. Bush and Mr. Gorbachev remain popular in the latest survey, although Mr. Bush's standing has slipped slightly from the historically high level he achieved right after the invasion of Panama in December.
Asked if they approve of the job Mr. Bush is doing, 69 percent say yes, down from 76 percent approval in January, but statistically indistinguishable from the 72 percent in April. Approval of Mr. Bush's handling of foreign policy has also slipped since the Panama invasion, with 57 percent expressing approval. That is down from 73 percent in January. The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 3 percentage points in each of the polls.
 
View of Gorbachev Little Changed
In the United States, opinion toward Mr. Gorbachev has not changed much, even though news from the Soviet Union of late has been dominated by the difficulties of the Soviet economy and his opposition to the Baltic independence movement, as well as other ethnic problems. Forty-five percent of Americans say they have a favorable opinion of Mr. Gorbachev and 9 percent say they have an unfavorable opinon. Those number are statistically unchanged from surveys earlier this year and last year.
Six out of ten Americans say it is very important to the interests of the United States for Mr. Gorbachev to remain in power. That may help explain why four out of ten also say it is more important to maintain good relations with Mr. Gorbachev than to support Lithuania's efforts to break away from the Soviet Union.
Attitudes toward Lithuania remain essentially unchanged from earlier polls, with one-third saying it is more important to support the independence movement in the republic, which declared independence from Moscow on March 11 and has since suffered the effects of a partial Soviet economic blockade.
 
Strength of the Powers
On the question of American versus Soviet strength there has been a dramatic shift since 1978, when the Times and CBS News started asking this question. In the latest survey 44 percent of Americans say the two superpowers are about equal, and 26 percent think America is not so strong. In 1978, when 42 percent said America was not as strong, 32 percent said the two powers were about egual in strength and 12 percent said the United States was superior.
In the latest Times CBS News poll, a minority of Americans said they were paying a lot of attention to the changes in Eastern Europe and The Soviet Union.
Asked how much they had read or heard about these changes, 42 percent said a lot, 35 percent said some and 21 percent said not much. The views on relations with the Soviets of the group that has not paid much attention were markedly different from those who have been paying attention.
For example, of those who say they have heard or read a lot about the changes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, 74 percent say it is very important to the United States that Mr. Gorbachev stay in power. But among those who say they have not heard or read much, only 38 percent say American interest are tied to Mr. Gorbachev's fate.
 
No Party Differences
By contrast, the poll found no difference between Democrats and Republicans on this question, or between those who call themselves liberal, moderate or conservatives.
Similiarly, education dramatically affects views toward the Soviets. College graduates, who are much more likely to be following the news, have a much better opinion of Mr. Gorbachev, with nearly 7 out of 10 saying they view him favorably. Of those who never finished high school, one out of four said they had a favorable opinion of Gorbachev.
Despite all the changes in the world, a plurality of Americans, 45 percent, say the summit meeting starting Wednesday in Washington still means as much as other summit meetings did before. Thirty percent said they think this summit meeting means less than before, and 18 percent volunteered that they think the summit meeting means more.

HEADLINE: Arab Leaders, Seeking One Voice, Extend Talks

BYLINE: By ALAN COWELL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BAGHDAD, Iraq, May 29

 BODY:
Arab leaders seeking a common response to Soviet Jewish migration to Israel and other issues extended a two-day summit meeting here today as Egypt and other nations looked for a consensus of moderation in the face of increasing anti-American sentiment.
The gathering of 16 of the Arab League's 21 members is supposed to unify Arab positions in advance of the United States-Soviet summit meeting in Washington this week. But a dispute has surfaced over the extent to which the meeting's public declarations identify the United States as a sponsor of hostile Israeli policies and actions.
Both Iraq, the host, and the Palestine Liberation Organization, which sought the emergency gathering, want to attack the United States for its financial and military support of Israel and for its perceived encouragement of Soviet Jewish immigration. Many Palestinians and some Arab countries, notably Jordan, say the projected arrival of hundreds of thousands of Soviet Jews in Israel will ultimately displace Palestinians from the occupied West Bank. 
''What we see in the immigration issue is that it undercuts the two most crucial elements of the Palestinian question,'' a senior Jordanian said. ''One, the land, and two, the people.'' Additionally, Jordan wants the meeting here to renew a pledge of financial and other support because a large displacement of West Bank Palestinians could seriously destabilize the monarchy of King Hussein, whose population is already more than half Palestinian.
''We have reached a point where we might not continue without your cooperation,'' King Hussein told fellow Arab leaders when the meeting opened on Sunday. ''We have drained all our financial resources. Our national commitment should not be a source of punishment to my country.'' Jordan, viewed as pro-Western and seized by economic crisis, is said by Arab diplomats to support an accusatory line toward the United States. Jordanian officials argue that if the United States had not imposed a quota on Soviet Jewish migration to America last year, many Soviet Jews would have headed there rather than to Israel.
Jordan has protested for months that it is the most vulnerable Arab country to the repercussions of Soviet Jewish migration to Israel. Few Arab commentators accept Israeli assurances that the new arrivals will not be settled among the Palestinians of the occupied West Bank. So far, very few of the immigrants have been resetled in the West Bank, where a Palestinian revolt has been under way, as well as in the Gaza Strip, since December 1987. The principal advocate of a less strident line toward Washington is Egypt, the United States' closest Arab ally in Middle East diplomacy and the recipient of $2.3 billion a year in American economic and military aid. Egypt is supported in its efforts by Saudi Arabia and conservative Persian Gulf sheikdoms.
When the meeting opened on Sunday, President Hosni Mubarak urged his fellow Arab leaders to display less alarmism about the Soviet Jewish influx. Arab diplomats said Egypt wanted to avoid a surge of overt anti-Israeli and anti-American sentiment that would further stiffen Israel's resistance to American proposals for a Palestinian-Israeli dialogue.
Since 1979, when Egypt signed the Arab world's only peace treaty with Israel, Cairo has sought to broaden the peace. In recent years that effort has formed the central thrust of its diplomacy. In pressing for less hostile language in the gathering's resolutions, Arab diplomats said, Egypt was also seeking to defend the position it revived in the last two years as the fulcrum of Arab diplomacy.
President Saddam Hussein of Iraq, by contrast, is seeking to build a constituency for its advocacy of a more militant Arab readiness to confront both Israel and the United States.
Although the Baghdad meeting was supposed to wind up today, Arab foreign ministers met tonight to try to overcome differences over the phrasing of their resolutions before a late-night session among those leaders who attended. The most prominent of the Arab leaders who did not attend was President Hafez al-Assad of Syria.

HEADLINE: Evolution in Europe;
Poland to Let Soviet Jews Fly to Israel From Warsaw

BYLINE: By STEPHEN ENGELBERG, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WARSAW, May 27

 BODY:
Charter flights carrying 500 Soviet Jews a week to Israel will begin moving through Poland next month, marking a new chapter in the complex relationship between Warsaw and Jerusalem.
Maj. Andrzej Dziewulski, the chief of security at the airport here, said the flights were the first step in making Warsaw a major transit point through which thousands of Soviet Jews could travel each week to Israel.
Major Dziewulski said the Soviet airline Aeroflot would be flying one IL-86 charter a week to Warsaw, with passengers then transferred to a waiting El Al jumbo jet. The other flight, from Moscow to Warsaw and then to Tel Aviv, would be handled solely by Lot, the Polish state airline, he said. 
Poland, which only recently resumed full relations with Israel after breaking them as a result of the 1967 Arab-Israeli war, has great hopes for closer ties to Jerusalem, including cooperation in agriculture and science.
 
Poland's Search for Help
Warsaw is also eager for entrepreneurs in Israel, many of whom are of Polish origin and speak the language, to invest in a country that had Europe's largest Jewish population before World War II. Only about 4,000 Jews remain in Poland; there were more than 3 million here before the war.
Martin Wenick, executive director of the National Conference on Soviet Jewry, said Poland's role in the exodus of Soviet Jews was significant because it would open the door for more immigration than now possible. Mr. Wenick said that Bucharest, Romania, and Budapest, the main transit points for the approximately 10,000 Jews who leave the Soviet Union each month, are increasingly overburdened by the flow.
The issue has become sensitive in Eastern Europe since Arab terrorist groups announced that they would retaliate against countries participating in the pipeline. Hungary's state-owned airline, Malev, said soon after that it was dropping out, and although Israel has continued to fly Jews out of Hungary on El Al, it has also been pressing Hungary to resume the Malev flights.
It was against this backdrop that Poland's Prime Minister, Tadeusz Mazowiecki, announced in New York on March 26 that Poland was willing to ease the movement of Soviet Jews. Immediately afterward, two employees of a Polish trade mission in Beirut were shot, and a previously unknown group, the Organization of Revolutionary Action, claimed responsibility while another group in Lebanon, the Islamic Military Front, said it would plan new attacks against Poles.
 
Relations With Israelis
The terrorist threat has prompted Poland to begin new intelligence cooperation with countries that were its adversary only a few months ago. While he was in Washington, Mr. Mazowiecki discussed possible efforts on the issue with William H. Webster, the head of the Central Intelligence Agency, and Mr. Dziewulski said he had developed a close working relationship with his Israeli counterparts.
Mr. Dziewulski said his anti-terrorist unit at the airport had been strengthened. He said Polish authorities had been hit with a barrage of bomb threats and other anonymous phone calls since the announcement of the plans to assist the Soviet Jews. He said that because the airport and Lot facilities were well protected, the main concern of security officials was that terrorists would strike other Polish targets.
 
'A Technical Problem'
Waldyslaw Klaczynski, chief spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said Poland had taken steps to improve security for its diplomats since the attack in Beirut. Mr. Klaczynski said he had no estimate of how many Soviet Jews would come through Warsaw, but said the Solidarity-led Government had set no limits. ''This is strictly a technical problem for Lot and the airlines,'' he said.
Mr. Klaczynski believes that the new Government here can built strong ties with Israel. ''Jews had a historical role in Poland for centuries,'' he said, ''and the relationship was a good one. Now, we want to built a relationship of economic, scientific, cultural cooperation.''
Mordecai Palzur, the Israeli Ambassador here, declined to discuss the plans for Soviet Jewish immigration. But he said new opportunities were emerging for Israel. Mr. Palzur predicted that trade between the countries would total $100 million this year and said Poland offered Israeli businesses both a chance for investment and a market for their products.

HEADLINE: Stirring a Debate on Breaking Racism's Shackles

BYLINE: By PETER APPLEBOME, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: SAN JOSE, Calif.

 BODY:
Among those who have read or heard his views on race, it is very hard to find anyone, black or white, with a neutral reaction to Shelby Steele.
To many whites and conservative blacks, Mr. Steele has given eloquent voice to painful truths that are almost always left unspoken in the nation's circumscribed public discourse on race. To many black politicians and civil rights figures, he is a turncoat, a privileged black man whose visibility and success stem from his ability to say precisely what white America most wants to hear.
No matter what the reaction, it is clear that Mr. Steele, whose criticism of affirmative action and much of what is usually thought to be the black agenda has gained increasing visibility over the past year, now finds himself at the heart of the nation's increasing anguish over race and the traditional approaches to dealing with the issue.
''The interest is there for one reason that's obvious to everybody,'' said Mr. Steele, whose closely cropped hair, blue blazer, olive slacks, burgundy pin-striped shirt and black tie reflect the button-down cool of his essays. ''As we have come to experience more opportunity in American life, we have fallen further behind. It's one of the biggest sociological contradictions of late 20th century life. It's clear that whatever we're doing isn't working, and I think the audience is there because people on both sides of the racial divide understand what I'm saying.'' 
 
Bursting From Obscurity
Over the past year, Mr. Steele has gone from being an obscure English professor at San Jose State University to an almost ubiquitous commentator on race. He shows up on television news programs like ''Nightline,'' has produced a public-television documentary on the Yusuf K. Hawkins killing in the Bensonhurt section of Brooklyn and has been published in Harper's, The American Scholar, The Washington Post, The New York Times Magazine and Commentary. A collection of his essays on race is to be published later this year.
Mr. Steele's arguments, which in some ways mirror those made for a decade by black conservatives, is more complicated than the point-counterpoint to which it is often reduced on television. It boils down to the assertion that while racism still exists, it is not what is holding back America's black people. Instead, Mr. Steele asserts, the specter of racism has become a crippling fixation of blacks, a way not just to excuse failures but to avoid dealing with real problems.
He says this sense of victimization has led blacks to rely on programs like affirmative action that both stem from and perpetuate their sense of being victims. And he says the insistence on black victimization and white guilt sets in motion a never-ending, and ultimately futile, interracial battle in which attaining a moral high ground counts for more than achieving results.
''This leaves us with an identity that is at war with our best interests, that magnifies our oppression and diminishes our sense of possiblity,'' he wrote in the May issue of Harper's, Expressions of Bitterness Many blacks react angrily to Mr. Steele and his visibility in the mainstream news media. A review of his documentary on Bensonhurst in The Village Voice lambasted what it termed his ''enfeebled and handwringing apologias for the state of American racial discourse.'' Julian Bond, the civil rights figure and former Georgia State Senator, responded to one of Mr. Steele's essays in Harper's by saying it could have been written 30 years ago by Bull Connor or George Wallace.
Critics say he shows no grasp of the problems of the inner city poor and instead shines a harsh light on elements of the psyches of American blacks without offering solutions other than a vague call for self-help.
''I just think the guy's off the wall, really,'' said Representative John Lewis, a black Democrat from Georgia who is a longtime civil rights leader. ''There are these people, Steele in particular, sitting in their ivory towers far removed from the problems of poor, downtrodden black Americans. He's one of those who feels very comfortable articulating the position that the victim is responsible for his own situation.''
 
'A Superb Scholar'
But not all Mr. Steele's approval comes from whites. Although it is hard to find evidence of conservative political strength among blacks, Mr. Steele is only one of a number of black writers and thinkers who in different ways break sharply with the view of race found in the traditional civil rights movement. These include the economists Glenn Loury of Harvard University, Thomas Sowell of the Hoover Institution and Walter Williams of George Mason University; the writer Stanley Crouch, and other academics like Julius Lester of the University of Massachusetts and Anne Wortham of Washington and Lee University.
''I think he's a superb scholar, he's thoughtful, he writes well, he's honest, he's a breath of fresh air,'' said Robert Woodson, the director of the National Center for Neighborhood Enterprise in Washington who is black. ''Some of us have been saying the same things for years, and we're just pleased that someone who challenges the traditional wisdom can get a hearing.''
Mr. Steele, who is 44 years old, grew up in the working-class Chicago suburb of Phoenix. His father, a truck driver, and his mother, a social worker, were devoted to the civil rights movement. He attended Coe College in Iowa, where his heroes included Malcolm X. He headed the black student organization at the height of the black power movement.
But after teaching Afro-American literature at an experimental program for poor blacks in East St. Louis, Ill., he pursued a conventional academic career, eventually getting a Ph.D. in English from the University of Utah and going on to teach at San Jose State.
 
Dislikes Affirmative Action
As Mr. Steele tells it, he began writing on race after he was annoyed by a 1986 radio broadcast on the holiday for the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. in which a black leader was espousing what Mr. Steele considered the cliches of the civil rights movement.
Mr. Steele says he had not read any of the black conservatives when he began writing on race, and he clearly has both similarities and differences with them. He does not hew to a doctrinaire hostility to government programs. He says many of the programs, particularly those that derive from racial preferences, do not work. He says affirmative action, for example, diminishes the achievements of blacks, whose gains are tainted by the appearance of favoritism, and creates resentment among whites.
Mr. Steele's writing ventures onto perhaps its most emotionally charged turf when he deals with what he sees as a widespread sense of inadequacy among blacks when they enter the economic and social mainstream. He says that feeling plays out in a number of ways:self-enforced separatism by black students on white campuses; an avoidance of many forms of intellectual and academic competition by blacks who fear it is more dangerous to try and fail than not to try at all.
He said this is a bitter legacy of 350 years of oppression that whites as well as blacks have a responsibility to change. But he said it did blacks no good to ignore their real fears and blame racism for all their failings.
''Blacks have tremendous possibilities if they know what they're up against'' he said. ''But if you think you're just up against white racism and you're just a total victim of it, then you can't do anything except be mad.'' Too Far Removed? To his critics, Mr. Steele's message is at best hopelessly oversimplified and at worst deeply harmful. They say it gives whites more reasons not to finance social programs at a time of already scarce resources. Many say Mr. Steele, as a college professor whose wife, Rita, a psychologist, is white, is simply too far removed from the problems faced by most blacks.
Adolph Reed, a black political science professor at Yale University, said Mr. Steele's criticism of affirmative action, for example, made much less sense when applied to programs for working-class blacks.
Eddie N. Williams, president of the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, a black research organization, said Mr. Steele's apparent indifference to most government programs seemed to deny blacks the government assistance every other group in America has been able to use. He added that the problems of the black poor reflected not the failure of government intervention, but an insufficient moral or financial commitment to make the programs work.
Between the two poles are some blacks who say Mr. Steele has some valid viewpoints that are diminished by a racial naivete.
 
Points of Agreement
''He's big on personal responsibility; he's right,'' said Cornel West, a religion professor and head of the Afro-American studies program at Princeton University. ''He's big on struggling with the badge of inferiority; he's right. He's big on the impact of the quest for white validation and recognition and the difficulty of achieving that by means of affirmative action; he's right. But he trivializes these very valuable insights when he overlooks the degree to which so much of the responsibility also falls on the side on the white, skewed, limited and usually racist perceptions that dictate the quest for black acceptance.''
Still, some critics as well as friends agree that Mr. Steele may contribute something positive if he helps foster a more honest debate on racial issues.
''There's a shrouded quality to our public discourse on racial subjects,'' said Mr. Loury. ''A lot of stuff doesn't get said that people are really thinking. Whites don't want to get called racists. Blacks don't want to be called disloyal. As a result, a genuine critical discourse where a lot of different ideas get put on the table and bandied about never really happens.''
Mr. Steele says he is aware of both the pain his writing evokes and the questions it leaves unanswered.
''James Baldwin used to talk about that a great deal, that one of the real pitfalls of black writers is that they feel they have to speak for all of black America and have all the answers to enormous problems,'' he said.
''I try to avoid that trap. I know I don't have all the answers, but I try to write what I know. Some people say I shine a harsh light on difficult problems. But I never shine a light on anything I haven't experienced or write about fears I don't see in myself first. I'm my own first target. I spill my own blood first.''

HEADLINE: Let's Stop Messing With Social Security

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The Older Women's League urges change in Social Security for women (news article, May 10), thus seeking to derail the Social Security system by adding more claimants. Women's work in caring for families, the group argues, should entitle them to pension benefits. 
For the 55 years since Social Security legislation was enacted, ''work'' has been defined as ''covered employment,'' meaning the earning of wages that entailed a contribution to financing the system. Work alone has never created an entitlement, and the exertions of millions of men and women have always been excluded.
If work in the home is to be recognized, separate legislation is appropriate. Otherwise, employed workers in covered employment must finance new benefits by paying higher payroll taxes or accepting reduced benefits.
There is an enormous subsidy from men to women in the pension system because women, with greater life expectancy than men, receive the same pension if based on the same wage history, even though they will draw their pensions for a longer period. To the argument that women typically earn less than men, the answer is that there is a further subsidy from higher-paid to lower-paid workers. A worker at age 65 who has contributed the maximum amount will receive a pension equal to about one-fourth of this annual earning before retirement. A low-paid worker will receive more than half.
Congress has made the payroll tax an excessively regressive income tax and should not be encouraged to warp the system more.

HEADLINE: Dinkins Shifts And Restores Broom Squad

BYLINE: By LEONARD BUDER

 BODY:
Five days after saying that the city could not afford it, Mayor David N. Dinkins moved yesterday to restore money in his proposed budget to maintain the Sanitation Department Clean Team, a group responsible for manually sweeping streets and emptying trash cans.
Mr. Dinkins acted after receiving pressure from some advisers and stiff criticism from some civic groups. They had voiced concern that eliminating the remaining 300 jobs in the nine-year-old operation would result in dirtier streets and overflowing litter baskets as the city is trying to attract visitors and business, as well as the 1992 Democratic National Convention. At its height in 1987, the Clean Team had 1,382 workers. 
Although shifting or adding money is usual in drawing up the budget, it is unusual for such a reversal within days of submitting a budget, especially after the Mayor declared flatly on Thursday that the team ''is out of business.''
 
'Awful Lot to Do With Morale'
In making the quick reversal, Mr. Dinkins risked seeming to bow to presssure to restore a program whose elimination he and his aides had staunchly defended. On the other hand, after being put in a difficult situation by the delay in the state budget and his resulting wariness, Mr. Dinkins may have hoped to make the best of a potentially damaging situation by demonstrating flexibility in restoring a popular program.
Mr. Dinkins said he had decided to keep the team because ''it has an awful lot to do with morale of people in our town'' and had an ''impact on visitors.'' He also said the cutback could have hurt the efforts to attract the convention.
The reversal was seen, in part, as an attempt to take credit for preserving the team. City Council leaders had said they would keep the teams when they approved the budget.
Mr. Dinkins said the additional money became available when the amount of state aid became clearer. The city would use $6.2 million of a $90 million reserve fund.
Mr. Dinkins added that he was persuaded by arguments at a meeting with his council of economic advisers, which includes Felix G. Rohatyn and David Rockefeller, last Wednesday, the day before he announced the proposed budget.
''At that meeting,'' the Mayor said in a letter to the Council, ''I became convinced by their perspective that the elimination of this service would impair our effort to foster a positive business climate and to encourage our tourism industry. I became particularly concerned that the decline in service could hurt our efforts to bring the Democratic National Convention to our city.''
An associate of Mr. Rockefeller, Peter Johnson, when informed of the Mayor's reversal, said of Mr. Rockefeller, ''I know he would be extremely pleased by that development.''
First Deputy Mayor Norman Steisel, a former Sanitation Commissioner, said the administration did not determine until the weekend that money would available for the cleanup group. Eliminating the force, Mr. Steisel said, had been the very last budget cut that Mr. Dinkins agreed to.
When asked whether the switch gave the appearance of an administration in disarray, Mr. Dinkins said, ''I recognize that there might be some that might make that observation, but it is an inaccurate one.''
He later said, ''What is important in the final analysis is to do the right and correct thing, and that's what we have done.'' $90 Million Contingency Fund Mr. Dinkins said it would cost $7.4 million to keep the Clean Team. Part of that, $1.2 million, would will come from eliminating the mobile Neighborhood Intensive Cleanup Squads. Those squads, Mr. Dinkins said, ''were intended to be a ''stopgap emergency response'' after the Clean Team had been eliminated. The squads have a total of 39 sweepers and 4 supervisors who will be assigned to other duties.
The rest of the money for the Clean Team, $6.2 million, as well as $22 million to reduce some planned cuts for the schools, would come from a $90 million contingency fund set aside because of the uncertain state budget.
''After the state budget was released and we were able to analyze it fully,'' the Mayor said in his letter, ''we found that the cost to the city in 1991 was approximately $53 million, or $37 million less than we had assumed in our Expense Budget.''
Even with the added money - for sanitation and education - there is still money in the special reserve. Mr. Dinkins said the possibility that the state may disallow some city reimbursement claims could further raise city costs.
