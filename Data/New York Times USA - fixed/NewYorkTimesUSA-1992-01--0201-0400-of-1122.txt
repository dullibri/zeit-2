HEADLINE: Taiwan Voted for Status Quo, not One China;
A Stinging Defeat

 BODY:
To the Editor:
 Contrary to your Dec. 24 editorial on the Dec. 21 Taiwan election, the ruling Kuomintang Party "victory" was not "a vote for one China." How could it be? The Kuomintang-dominated Government banned the opposition party's platform of an independent "Republic of Taiwan" even from election posters. The Government arrested a score of pro-independence leaders on election eve. 
The Kuomintang spent millions of dollars buying votes throughout the island, as many election observers attested. The Government subdivided Taiwan into myriad tiny districts tailored for Kuomintang candidates.
 The Kuomintang also controls the electronic media. The triumph of its propaganda can be seen in your acceptance of the Kuomintang line on the election outcome.
 The election was a stinging defeat for the Kuomintang's policy of reunification with the mainland. In 1990, using the same districting tactics, the ruling party was able to garner more than 90 percent of the vote in elections for local officials. This time, despite control of the airwaves, vote buying, gerrymandering, crackdowns and propaganda, it came up with only 70 percent of the vote.
 The 24 percent of the population that voted for the Democratic Progressive Party also gave the lie to the Government claim that only 6 percent of the people support independence. The figure is far higher. On an island where advocating "one China, one Taiwan" can bring charges of sedition and a stiff jail sentence, pollsters are unlikely to get the truth to questions about independence.
 The "One China" policy is a fantasy the Kuomintang uses to justify its a grip on Taiwan maintained by a vast security network and the ever-present threat of detention and imprisonment. It is also the policy of the totalitarian government on the mainland, whose claim to Taiwan is dubious at best.
 Forty-five years after the Nationalist Party massacred 20,000 people and a generation of the island's leaders in a 1947 revolt, the Taiwanese still hunger for compensation and justice. The delight with which the Taiwanese evade taxes and regulations, and the enormous underground economy are expressions of the contempt in which the Kuomintang is held across the island.
 With a Government that permits the islanders little say in their national affairs, and the electoral cheating the Kuomintang uses to stay in power, it is only a matter of time until the ruling party itself brings about the result it is trying to forestall: Taiwan independence.

HEADLINE: New York Needs Three Heroes, Not One

BYLINE: Charles Brecher and Raymond D. Horton; Charles Brecher and Raymond D. Horton are, respectively, director of research and president of the Citizens Budget Commission.

 BODY:
Mayor David Dinkins, Gov. Mario Cuomo and Felix Rohatyn, chairman of the Municipal Assistance Corporation, are likely to strike a deal soon that will shape the health of New York City's economy and the fiscal viability of its government. Its elements may be outlined by Jan. 16, when the Mayor submits his four-year financial plan to the State Financial Control Board. This plan should be examined to determine whether it addresses the city's underlying problems or merely papers over them.
The crux of the problem is that in the 1980's the government grew too large to be sustained by the economic base that remained after the Wall Street crash of October 1987 and the 1991 recession. The first fiscal adjustment to this harsh problem was the budget adopted last June. To close a $2.3 billion gap projected for the current fiscal year, the city adopted a "tax and slash" program. 
 To avoid a repeat performance, new arrangements for delivering and financing municipal services must be devised.
Mayor Dinkins must commit himself to change the way the city does business. This means pruning nonessential activities and revising work rules that determine how basic services are delivered. For example, the city could sell its AM and FM radio stations and its television station; they might fetch as much as $40 million. It might consider a Charter referendum on eliminating the five borough presidents, who are served by more than 500 political appointees. And it may have to oblige sanitation workers to collect trash on extended routes that require more than four or five hours' work per day, and may have to redeploy police officers from desk to patrol duties.
Through such reforms, which protect services by improving productivity, a minimum of 25,000 jobs should be eliminated over the next four years by attrition without layoffs.
Mayor Dinkins voiced a commitment to such changes in a speech in the summer, but the modification of his financial plan presented in November did not fulfill the promise: it proposed to cut only 11,100 positions over four years, with most of the reduction postponed until fiscal years 1995 and 1996. The January plan should schedule more productivity savings sooner and begin to specify the means of achieving them.
Governor Cuomo must commit himself to change the way the state finances welfare and Medicaid programs. The state requires the city and counties to pay nearly half the non-Federal portion of these programs -- a greater local share than in any other state. The result is high local taxes in New York City and Erie County, which have relatively large numbers of poor residents. Wealthier areas with fewer poor residents, such as Nassau and Westchester counties, do not pay a fair share of the costs of helping the state's impoverished.
The long-run solution is for the state to assume the non-Federal share of welfare and Medicaid costs. Using its broader tax base to finance welfare and Medicaid would permit local governments to reduce their levies. This would permit New York City local taxes to be reduced by about $2.4 billion.
In September, Governor Cuomo endorsed this policy for Medicaid. But the details of his subsequent plan didn't match his rhetoric. His plan for state assumption of Medicaid is inadequate because it is stretched over eight years, with little financial impact in the near future. It requires the city to earmark personal income tax revenues for Medicaid, and other counties to do so with sales tax revenues. The plan is predicated on the success of unspecified cost-control measures.
The Governor says this plan is the best he can hope to get through the Legislature, especially the Republican-dominated Senate. Both can do better. The January financial plan should contemplate significant fiscal relief from state assumption of Medicaid in the fiscal 1993-96 period.
The Mayor's and Governor's desire to gain relief from the Municipal Assistance Corporation puts Mr. Rohatyn in a difficult position. The agency can refinance about $1 billion of bonds that will mature in 1992, 1993, 1994 and 1995. This would save the city an equal sum in that period because the bonds would not have to be repaid until later. But by providing short-run fiscal relief, Mr. Rohatyn would reduce the pressure on Mr. Dinkins and Mr. Cuomo to produce the needed changes. Without these changes, Municipal Assistance Corporation help transfers today's cost to tomorrow's New Yorkers.
Mr. Rohatyn should protect the city's future. Before mortgaging it, he should insist that Mayor Dinkins agree to seek a smaller, more productive municipal government and that Governor Cuomo commit himself to meaningful Medicaid reform.

HEADLINE: Trade Discord Persists as Bush Arrives in Japan

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Tuesday, Jan. 7

 BODY:
President Bush began his visit to Japan today in an atmosphere of contention and confusion, with negotiators for the United States and Japan in sharp disagreement over an American demand for Japan to buy more American automobiles and parts.
At issue are both the amount of cars and parts that Japanese auto makers and dealers would purchase and how the commitment would be described in light of Tokyo's insistence that purchases should be left up to Japanese businesses and not to the Government, officials on both sides said. 
"There is no agreement, and we're still skirmishing," a Japanese official said, speaking with some exasperation. He said the disputes could not be resolved until after negotiations with Mr. Bush, his top advisers and 18 corporate leaders on the final and most important leg of his four-nation Asia trip.
Nevertheless, the White House has expressed confidence that in four days of trade talks the President will be successful in achieving his goal of winning concessions from Tokyo that will appear, at least, to prop up America's slumping economy. Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa is said to be eager to give Mr. Bush some of what he seeks. [Page A8.]
Mr. Bush came to Japan, the final country in his Asian tour, from Seoul, South Korea. The Government there canceled annual military maneuvers it was due to hold with United States forces, after receiving indications that North Korea was ready to allow inspections of secret nuclear installations. The President said during his Korean visit that the end of the 40-year-old division of the Korean peninsula was finally within reach. [Page A8.]
A principal area of disagreement with Japan concerned earlier announcements by Japanese auto manufacturers that they would raise American purchases to about $17 billion by 1994 from the current $9 billion.
A Japanese official said on Monday that the United States was demanding that this target be doubled or tripled. An American official denied that American demands were so sweeping, but he added, "We're shooting for Japan to up the ante a little bit more."
There was considerable confusion about whether Japan would agree to any kind of target or quota on automobile parts. Early in the day, the Minister of International Trade and Industry, Kozo Watanabe, said Japan would set specific targets for imports of American-made autos and auto parts.
But later, the deputy minister, Yuji Tanahashi, contradicted him, saying the Government was not asking the automobile industry for targets, but only to consider "various forms of cooperation." He added, "I guess the minister's remarks are a sort of wishful thinking."
The Japanese were said to be especially resistant to demands that targets be set for the purchase of American cars, since they would ultimately have to be purchased by consumers, who are free to buy what they want. American models now account for less than one-half of 1 percent of the 5.1 million cars sold annually in Japan.
Japan was, however, reportedly preparing some incentives to get dealers to handle American cars, although there was widespread skepticism that this would ease consumer distaste for American cars.
American cars are widely perceived here as being inferior in quality, too big and with too few concessions to Japan's narrow roads and to the fact that the Japanese drive on the left side of the road. European cars are much more popular in Japan than American cars.
 
Resentment and Concern
 Japan's accessions in part to the American demands are being carried out in an atmosphere of some resentment, coupled with concern that something be done for Mr. Bush to head off even worse trade pressures or threats of sanctions from Congress or the President's Democratic rivals.
"This is crazy," a Japanese official said. "If consumers don't buy the final products, are all these cars and parts going to end up being dumped in the gutter? But we just have to do something."
In a separate development reflecting the deepening sense of urgency over Mr. Bush's trip, it was announced that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady would fly to Japan to be with the President. That fueled speculation that broader financial issues and policies would be discussed.
All the American demands are viewed in Japan as resulting from political pressures in the United States, prompting a desire in Japan to help President Bush, who is seen here as basically opposed to protectionism and to the anti-Japanese retaliation advocated by many Democrats.
Intense talks have taken place behind the scenes in recent days between the Government and auto industry leaders in particular, since automobiles and parts account for three-quarters of the $41 billion American trade deficit with Japan.
On Monday Prime Minister Miyazawa again called on Japanese auto manufacturers to show some flexibility and, in effect, to help bail out the American car industry -- and also President Bush -- at a time of deepening economic woes in the United States.
"Japanese auto manufacturers may have some difficulties in meeting the request of the Government to do more than they have been doing," he told a group of American reporters. "But I think they are understanding to the need to contribute to the solution of the American problems.
"I think I can persuade them that it is in their own interest in the longer term to do so," he added.
Sounding a familiar theme, Mr. Miyazawa said that the Japanese must act, not to open markets that are closed, but out of a sense of obligation for past American generosity to the nation it defeated in World War II.
"It's over 40 years that Japan has benefited from the friendship of the United States, and it's about time we reciprocate," he said. "We'd like to be a friend in need."
Mr. Miyazawa's comments, couching Japanese actions as acts of generosity or compassion, have left a bitter taste for some Americans and some Japanese. A commentator recently said it was as if Japan were being asked to make reparations payments 45 years after its war defeat.
 
Some Implicit Criticism
 While sounding a basically conciliatory note, Mr. Miyazawa also rejected recent comments by President Bush and others that Japanese trade practices had contributed to the American recession.
"External trade is contributing positively, not negatively, to your growth," he said, explaining that Japanese imports of American products had grown by 70 percent since 1987, a far higher growth rate than exports to the United States.
The Prime Minister, who is a former finance minister, also implicitly criticized American economic policies, saying that the recession was attributable to indebtedness by consumers and businesses, weakness of banks and high interest rates resulting from the American budget deficit.
Spokesmen for the Japanese automobile manufacturers and dealers said that they were ready to cooperate with Mr. Miyazawa and other Government leaders, but they criticized the United States, saying it had not done its part to sell its cars in Japan or cater to Japanese consumer tastes.
"Japanese auto dealers are ready to sell U.S.-made cars if they meet Japanese consumers' preferences and if dealers are guaranteed appropriate profits," said Kenichiro Ueno, president of the Japan Automobile Dealers Association.

HEADLINE: Schools Vie in a Marketplace: More 'Choice' Can Mean Less

SERIES: Lessons From Britain: First of two articles.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
More than three years after Britain applied a free-market cure to its ailing schools, using the same ideas President Bush endorses for American education, its schools relish their growing authority but parents find they still do not have enough good schools to choose from.
The measures that President Bush prescribes for American educational ills are now the law in Britain: national curriculum standards, national tests and "choice," a voucher-like system in which money goes not to parents but to schools, based on the number of students they attract. 
 The British system aims at forcing schools to compete for students. Bad schools will go under, the theory runs, and good schools will thrive. Giving individual schools control over their own budgets and decisions, the Government reasons, will also give schools the tools to compete.
Although results are still being debated and there are no data yet on whether students are learning more, some conclusions are being drawn. School officials say they manage far better with less bureaucracy. But parents find they have less of a choice than they want, because good schools fill up quickly and bad schools sink slowly.
There is no proof that choice actually improves bad schools. And some schools are trying to insure good results by screening out less desirable students, whether they are handicapped, troubled or slow learners, a form of discrimination that American critics fear would occur if choice were adopted in the United States.
 
Impacts Appear to Be Muted
 Schools across Britain are feeling the changes. "We're using words like 'market forces' and 'consumer-oriented,' words I've never heard in all my years of teaching," said Jane Traies, the head teacher, or principal, of Swakeleys School, a girls' high school in West London.
In the county of Warwickshire, in central England, one school even offered a discount on shower units as an incentive for parents to enroll their children.
Over all, however, choice appears to have had neither the catastrophic effects its critics feared nor the rejuvenating impact its advocates predicted. The debate now is whether this means that choice has gone too far or not far enough.
What no one disputes is that Britain's Education Reform Act, passed in June 1988, ushered in the most sweeping changes since World War II.
The act was a response to longstanding dissatisfaction with British education: for years, students had scored lower than those in other countries, employers had complained of their workers' poor skills, and bloated educational bureaucracies seemed impervious to pressures for change.
 
National Curriculum
 For the first time in modern British history the law required a national curriculum and national examinations based on that curriculum. In Britain, the national Government pays 80 percent of all education costs, as against 6 percent in the United States. The new law used this leverage to enact choice, declaring that most of the money schools receive would be based on how many students they attracted.
And, to allow competition, students can choose any publicly supported school, even one outside the normal geographic boundaries. Unlike President Bush's proposals to extend choice to private and religious schools, in Britain choice applies only to publicly financed schools.
Local education authorities, the equivalent of American school districts, must now hand over to individual schools 85 percent of their budgets, rather than deducting central administrative costs first, so that schools themselves can decide when to repair windows or how many teachers to hire. Schools that want complete autonomy can even "opt out" of the district altogether, receiving money and guidance only from the national Government. The law applies to England and Wales.
 
Selling Schools
Traditions Meet New Pressures
 The law has made schools across Britain newly market-conscious, for good and ill. Many schools now produce brochures describing their philosophies, extracurricular activities, and any rules, such as requiring uniforms -- a big draw for parents fond of tradition. Many have actually hired market consultants. Most districts issue pamphlets for parents listing all the schools in their area and explaining procedures for appeals if children do not get into the school they want. Such appeals more than doubled in the first year after the law went into effect.
"There is enormous pressure on schools to market themselves," Ms. Traies said.
Indeed, some schools, like the one offering shower units, have gone to extremes. But such pressures can be constructive, said David Hart, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, which offered marketing advice to its 32,000 members.
"Schools have got to produce something that sells their school to prospective parents," he said. "They must start writing down what's their ethos, their approach. That has forced schools to think more deeply about what they are trying to achieve."
It is less clear, however, whether choice is actually improving schools.
The Government has not conducted any national studies of the results of choice. But several scholars and school district officials say that for the most part, good schools fill up quickly and bad schools wither slowly. Sue Clark, press officer for the Department of Education and Science, said that very few schools had actually closed.
Instead, said Margaret Maden, director of education for Warwickshire, "the signs are of a slow, lingering death, damaging to children in that school and to teachers, whose morale and skill deteriorates."
 
Argument of Critics
 The problem, according to Ms. Maden and scholars studying the changes, is that choice is not explicitly linked to measures that would improve failing schools -- an argument also made by American critics. Instead, bad schools are stripped of the money they might need to turn themselves around.
"School improvement doesn't operate in a simple market way," said Peter Mortimore, deputy director of the University of London's Institute of Education and an authority on what traits make schools effective. "It operates by skilled help being provided to the failing school, by changing the principal, by giving special resources."
In Warwickshire, for example, Ms. Maden said, she had worked quietly to ease out 13 principals in the last few years and to help troubled schools draw up plans to improve. "If for a variety of reasons your child does go to the nearest school, you should know that the nearest school is good enough," she said. "We must act for those children not able to exercise their exit right, possibly because their parents are too busy instead trying to keep body and soul together."
Some failing schools have managed to turn themselves around, although it is not clear whether choice made the difference. The Kingsdale School in South London was on the verge of being closed down. Stephen Williams, who became principal just as choice was introduced, told The London Evening Standard that school test scores and enrollment had risen dramatically after he held students and teachers to higher standards and heeded parents' wishes to bring back school uniforms.
In the Wandsworth borough of London, the man known as former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher's favorite educator is trying to create a model of what choice can achieve. Donald Naismith, Wandsworth's director of education, has begun to set up a wide range of schools offering different types of programs tailored to students with different levels of ability.
Yet even in Wandsworth, parents complain that their choices are limited. One parent who moved to Wandsworth, Carla Milner-Barry, said the best local elementary school had a long waiting list. The other school within walking distance is slated to be closed next year, and other local schools had bad reputations. Ms. Milner-Barry ended up enrolling her daughter in a private school, and said several other private schools had opened in Wandsworth in the last few years.
 
More Choice, Not Less
 Mr. Naismith acknowledges the problem, but says the answer is more choice, not less. He argues that to allow parents wider choices and to force schools to improve, the Government should remove bureaucratic obstacles so that bad schools would be forced to close quickly and new schools could spring up to meet demand. But because declining school enrollment has meant that many schools have empty places, the Government usually denies permission to open new ones.
There is also some evidence that competition has increased pressure on schools to screen potentially troublesome students, raising questions of equal opportunity.
Ms. Maden said that at least one school in Warwickshire had balked at the national policy of placing children with special educational needs in regular classrooms. "The school said, 'You must be joking,' " she said. " 'You'll make us into a dunces school.' "
Several school officials said they feared these tendencies would accelerate if a Government plan to publish nationwide school rankings based on examination scores passes Parliament, as expected. Many said a fairer measure would be how much progress children made on test scores.
Some scholars and politicians also worry that poor children may lose out because their parents do not have the money, time, or energy to get them into the best school.
"The evidence of all other markets is where there is limited supply, those who have the economic and cultural resources to get the most desirable products will get them," said Geoff J. Whittey, a professor of education policy and management at the University of London's Goldsmiths' College.
So far, no studies have examined which parents are the most aggressive and successful in choosing schools for their children. Tim Eggar, England's second-ranking education official, said the Government is considering measures aimed particularly at poor families. "But this isn't an argument for depriving everyone else of the benefits these reforms bring," he said.
 
'Opting Out'
A Few Schools Go It Alone
 Small Heath, a high school in a desolate section of Birmingham, was the first inner-city school in the country to "opt out" of any control by its district, after a bruising political battle with the Labor Party-controlled district.
These "grant-maintained" schools receive money directly from the national Government. They are freed from any regulation by the district, but must send financial reports, examination results, attendence and employment data to the government.
Grant-maintained schools are a potent form of competition for regular schools because they are freer to chart their own course, are very attractive to parents, and have received generous Government grants that have allowed most to buy equipment or fix buildings. The closest parallel in the United States is an experiment in Minnesota, where the legislature this year allowed the creation of schools run independently of the local school district.
Of the 26,000 schools in England and Wales, there are now about 150 grant-maintained schools, with another 150 waiting to be approved.
Of all the changes the education law has brought, grant-maintained schools have aroused the most opposition.
Since opting out in September 1989, Small Heath, which serves poor, predominantly Indian and Pakistani families, has been transformed, with the help of government grants for computers, color copiers, laboratories and maintenance. The school, which used to have four computers for more than 800 students, now has 150. In all, over the last few years, Small Heath has received about $395,000 in such grants, Mr. Knight said.
His teachers, many of whom were wary, are converts. "For so many years, we existed on a shoestring," said Noel O'Kane, the head of Small Heath's mathematics department. "Suddenly, all this money starts to flow. It made it possible to do our jobs."
Schools maintained by grants are given the same budgets they would have received from their school district, but are eligible for additional special grants. Opponents say the initial influx of cash has helped give the schools an edge on the competition and a certain cachet among parents.
"Grant-maintained schools were clearly designed to structure an education system to have elite schools and other schools," said Derek Fatchett, the deputy education spokesman for the Labor Party. "They have the dice loaded in their favor."
The borough of Hillingdon provides a vivid case study of the impact of choice. Hillingdon is the first school district in England where more than half the high schools have opted out, taking a big slice of the local district's budget with them. Kathleen Higgins, Hillingdon's director of education and community services, stands to lose $4 million from a $164 million budget next year. She has already cut one-third of her staff. Local school districts in the United States also stand to lose money under choice plans if students choose schools in other districts.
Swakeleys, however, does not plan to join the exodus. On balance, Ms. Traies believes her school, which is popular enough to have a long waiting list, gains more than it loses from remaining part of the school district. "Yes, there are bureaucratic nonsenses, but at the end of the day, there is also the support," she said.
 
Taking Charge
U.S. Educators Watch Closely
 Of all the changes, the move to place decision-making and budgetary power in the hands of local schools has been the most successful and most popular. The experience is particularly relevant to the United States because several studies of American schools have found that bureaucracies absorb a great deal of money before it reaches individual schools, and some scholars have suggested adopting English-style changes in the United States.
Local management of schools, as it is called in Britain, requires that a district hand over 85 percent of a school's budget to be spent by the school itself. All of Britain's high schools, and a growing number of its elementary schools, are now locally managed.
By 1994, all schools will manage their own finances, school meals, maintenance, and the hiring and recruiting of teachers and other staff. The districts are responsible for insurance, special programs for handicapped or learning-disabled children, libraries, and school psychologists and social workers.
If the experience of Bishopshalt School in Hillingdon is any guide, public schools can do without a great deal of bureaucracy. At Bishopshalt, which has opted out, two people -- Roland Parry, the deputy head, and one other teacher -- supervise a huge variety of activities once performed by the school district. These include cleaning, grounds maintenance, school meals, insurance, managaing and investing the school's $4 million budget, and deciding how many teachers to hire. They buy from the school district services that would be too expensive for an individual school to maintain, like teacher training or career programs.
Although the new responsibilities are considerable and at times overwhelming, most principals say they would never go back. "You have control over your own destiny," said Ms. Traies of Swakeleys. "You can make decisions, like let's paint the canteen, which the borough didn't paint for 15 years."
School districts have also felt the sting of competition. In Hillingdon, for example, Ms. Higgins told her staff to draw up a brochure of services, and set out selling them to many of the grant-maintained schools in the district. She is planning to hire a marketing expert, who will be expected to earn a salary through the revenue from extra sales.
Next: A national curriculum, with national tests.

HEADLINE: On Japan Leg of Journey, Bush's Stakes Are High

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: OSAKA, Japan, Tuesday, Jan. 7

 BODY:
President Bush arrived in Japan today for four days of politically freighted trade talks, hoping to cap a four-nation sweep of the Western Pacific with concessions from Tokyo that will appear, at least, to prop up America's slumping economy.
Mr. Bush brings his top advisers on the region, his commerce secretary and a platoon of 18 American corporate leaders with him to Osaka and Tokyo. 
 The Japanese Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, was said to be eager to give Mr. Bush some of what he seeks. The White House expressed confidence that the public will judge the visit a success.
"I think we feel pretty good that they're going to be responsive," the White House spokesman, Marlin Fitzwater, said of the Japanese.
 
Jobs, Jobs, Politics

 
 But the real stakes in Mr. Bush's visit are not the financial benefits to American companies, which appear comparatively small, but the political and public-relations gains or losses, which are potentially huge.
For weeks before he began his Western Pacific swing, the President cast his journey as a "relentless" personal quest to boost exports, and thus create more jobs for American companies mired in recession. Success would presumably help counter charges by Democratic rivals in the coming election that the White House has no domestic economic policy and no feel for the fiscal problems of the average person.
A good end to the Tokyo visit would also help defuse a challenge to Mr. Bush from the political right, where Patrick Buchanan, a Republican presidential candidate, has advocated an "America first" foreign policy that would retaliate against restrictive Japanese trade policies.
Mr. Bush has singled out Japanese trade barriers as his target, asserting that each $1 billion in American exports creates 20,000 new jobs at home.
Since Mr. Buchanan began his campaign, both he and Commerce Secretary Robert Mosbacher have broadly hinted that Japanese trade barriers are at least partly to blame for the American recession, which has erased nearly 2 million jobs since July 1990.
By the Administration's reckoning, the nation could add more than 800,000 jobs if it wiped out the trade deficit solely by selling more to Japan, rather than by cutting American purchase of Japanese imports.
The President has refused to say how many jobs he hopes to create or to set any explicit goals for the visit to Japan. "I can guarantee you political opponents, no matter what is achieved, will be saying, 'Hey, you didn't jump quite high enough; you need to get over the bar; we just raised it another foot,' " he said at a news conference on Monday. "What is important is that we handle this relationship with a broad global sense, that we make progress on the economic front."
 
Hopes Exceed Expectations
 Perhaps sensing that it had raised hopes too high, Mr. Bush's aides have sought to play down public expectations. In interviews, they have stressed that the United States' economic problems cannot be remedied in a single meeting and that the answer to the trade deficit lies not just in persuading Tokyo to buy American goods, but in improving American quality and productivity.
After landing this morning, Mr. Bush flew by helicopter to nearby Kyoto, Japan's former capital, to tour the old Imperial Palace and to lunch with an old friend, former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who was ousted by his own party in the fall.
Mr. Bush also engaged several men at the palace in a round of kemari, a 1,000-year-old game in which a stuffed ball is kicked from player to player.
The President's major activity today is a visit to a Toys "R" Us store near Osaka. The Administration is highlighting the store's success in entering the Japanese market under an agreement that lifted restrictions that favored "mom and pop" stores and prevented larger American chains from gaining a foothold in Japan.
Mr. Bush plans three meetings with his business delegation and Japanese business leaders during his stay.
Mr. Bush enjoys widespread support in his mission to Tokyo from allies in the Western Pacific, including all three nations he has visited in the last eight days. Leaders of those nations, some of whom recall Japan's sometimes brutal occupation of their homelands during World War II, now are openly fearful that they will soon be dominated not militarily, but by Japanese investment in their economies.
South Korea's president, Roh Tae Woo, was said to have discussed Japan with Mr. Bush at a private dinner on Sunday, a South Korean official said. South Korea runs an annual trade deficit with Japan totaling $8 billion.
That official, who refused to be named, said that Japan's refusal to apologize for its aggressive acts in World War II, as the Germans did, have denied it "moral strength" in the Pacific. Without another significant military and economic presence in the area, Mr. Roh is said to have told Mr. Bush, "it is bad news for all of us."

HEADLINE: Auto Sales Fell 11.2% Last Year

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DETROIT, Jan. 6

 BODY:
United States auto sales ended 1991 on a positive note, but the upturn capped the weakest year since 1983 and one in which the industry performed far worse than many experts had predicted. In addition, the Big Three auto makers relinquished a larger share of the American market to the Japanese.
Retail sales of domestically made cars and trucks rose 7.7 percent in the Dec. 21-31 period, largely because of strong pickup truck sales by Ford and Chevrolet, a year-end surge stimulated by incentives for buyers and anticipated by analysts. That closed out a year in which sales of all vehicles sold in the United States dropped 11.2 percent from the year before. For all of December, car and truck sales, domestic and foreign, declined 2.5 percent. 
 The seasonally adjusted annual selling rate for cars in the 10-day period was 7.1 million.
 
 
Pickups Sell the Best
 For the year, sales of all imported and domestic vehicles reached 12,326,772 -- 8,231,991 cars and 4,094,781 light trucks. That compared with a 1990 total of 13,877,259 -- 9,356,883 cars and 4,520,376 trucks. The top-selling vehicles in 1991 were Ford F-Series pickup trucks, followed by the Chevrolet C/K pickups, the Honda Accord and the Ford Taurus.
"It was a disappointing year," said Tom Webb, chief economist of the National Automobile Dealers Associaton. Mr. Webb had predicted in October 1990 that 1991 sales would run close to 13.5 million. But poor sales early this year, in part because of a drop in consumer confidence during the Persian Gulf crisis, prompted him to revise his expectations downward. A surge in late summer aroused analysts' optimism, but sales have slid steadily since.
For the coming year, analysts have estimated that the market will rise roughly 10 percent, to sales of 13.5 million vehicles. Mr. Webb said the market should turn up for a number of reasons, including the most recent cut in the prime lending rate by the Federal Reserve, which is expected to lower the costs of auto and other consumer loans.
The aging stock of cars on the road today also suggests pent-up demand for new vehicles; the average age of automobiles is now 7.6 years, with 42 percent of cars older than 8 years. In 1980, the average age of cars was 6.6 years, Mr. Webb said.
 
 
Dealers See More Interest
 Some dealers said their business had improved markedly since Christmas. Louis J. Fusz Jr., owner of the Lou Fusz Automotive Network in St. Louis, said his 14 foreign and domestic franchises sold 100 cars on Saturday. It was the first time his dealerships recorded a 100-sales Saturday in more than a year and a half. He attributed the improvement to the Dec. 20 drop in the prime rate, the strength of the stock market and President Bush's expressions of interest in redirecting the economy.
"Consumer confidence seems to be on the upswing," Mr. Fusz said.
Anthony P. Tremonte, general sales manager of Ekblade Oldsmobile-Cadillac-Pontiac in Hamden, Conn., also noted more people in the showroom in the days just after Christmas and New Year's Day. Some shoppers said they were encouraged by the drop in interest rates. Other industry watchers, however, are less optimistic about 1992. The WEFA Group, a financial consulting firm in Bala-Cynwyd, Pa., still expects sales to rise this year, but it recently reduced its 1992 estimate to 13.1 million, from 13.5 million. Edward J. Sullivan, vice president of automotive consulting, said that consistently low consumer confidence would result in flat or negative sales in the first quarter, rather than the gain he had predicted just weeks ago. He now thinks sales will not rebound until midway through the second quarter.
 Analysts estimated that the European car and truck market outperformed the American market in 1991 for the first time in recent memory. Although final European sales have not been tabulated, DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass., estimated them at 13.5 million cars, up roughly 1.7 percent from 1990.
The General Motors Corporation, the industry leader, posted a 1.2 percent rise in domestic vehicle sales in late December. G.M.'s United States sales dropped 12.6 percent in 1991, to 4.34 million cars and trucks, including imports sold by G.M. Of all the G.M. divisions, only Buick scored a sales gain last year, of 1.4 percent.
The Ford Motor Company's domestic car and truck sales jumped 35.6 percent in late December, a gain achieved mostly by stronger sales of pickup trucks. G.M. posted a similar gain. Analysts had expected the higher truck sales in the period because of strong incentives on the trucks and reporting schedules of those sales. For 1991, Ford's total vehicle sales were 2.89 million, a 13.8 percent drop from the previous year.
The Chrysler Corporation's car and truck sales fell 13.6 percent in late December. For the year, Chrysler vehicle sales dropped 11.2 percent. Chrysler's best-selling vehicle for the year was the Dodge Caravan, of which 207,919 were sold.
 The sluggish year also took its toll on the two best-selling Japanese brands in the United States. The Toyota Motor Corporation's sales dropped 4.5 percent for the year, including the line of Lexus luxury cars, and the Honda Motor Company's sales dipped 6 percent, including the company's Acura models. But sales of the three luxury brands of Japanese car makers -- which also include Nissan's Infiniti -- rose during the year. By contrast, Cadillac's sales were down 17.4 percent.
Particularly hard hit in 1991 were United States sales of several European auto makers, including Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, Porsche, BMW and Jaguar. The share of the United States market of all non-Japanese imports dropped to 5.9 percent, from 6.6 percent in 1990.
The Big Three's share of the total American vehicle market declined to 68.4 percent in 1991, from 69.4 percent in 1990. The share of Japanese auto makers, including those with American operations, increased to 25.7 percent, from 24 percent last year.
Vehicles made in North America by Japanese car companies also increased their percentage of market share last year, to 10.6 percent, from 8.8 percent.

HEADLINE: Power Failure Darkens Much of Washington

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Much of the capital was plunged into darkness early this evening when a power cable failed, turning out most of the lights at the State Department and the Federal Reserve Board, and producing a flickering at the White House before emergency generators took over.
People were trapped in elevators, and rush-hour traffic was snarled when the power failure occurred about 5:15 P.M. Some power, including that on parts of Connecticut Avenue in the downtown area, began returning at 7 P.M. 
 A spokesman for the Potomac Electric Power Company said the blackout began with a failure in a 230,000-volt line running under the Potomac River from a generating atation in Alexandria, Va. The reason for the failure was not immediately clear, said the spokesman, Kevin Kase.
 
Power Out at 3 Station
 About 18,000 customers were out of service, another spokeswoman said, noting that one customer could be an entire office building.
An area from Georgetown east through the business district went dark. In addition, said Mr. Kase, there were reports of three stations on the Washington subway system losing power: Foggy Bottom, Smithsonian and National Archives.
Mr. Kase said the company's headquarters, at 1900 Pennsylvania Avenue, three blocks from the White House, had "phone service and flashlights," but no electricity.
The Potomac River power plant has a capacity of 480 megawatts, which is medium-sized, and runs on oil or natural gas.
The power failure did not appear to result in any loss of life or serious injures, a District of Columbia Fire Department official said. Some utility transformers shorted out underground in Washington's Chinatown district, but they were dealt with by the utility because they did not result in any fire above ground, the official said.
 
Thousands in Dark Streets
 Today's power failure sent thousands of Federal officials out of their offices into darkened streets lit by few lights and snarled by traffic signals that did not work.
Emergency generators kept the lights on at the State Department's operations center, but electricity failed in the rest of the building. The fax machines stopped working, forcing foreign embassies to communicate with American diplomats by phone, said Krassimir Kostov, a spokesman for the Bulgarian Embassy.
Joseph R. Coyne, an assistant to the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said he was working by the light of a candle on his desk. A back-up power supply would prevent the loss of any computer data on the nation's economy, he said.
Congress, which has its own power plant, was unaffected by the power failure, as was the Pentagon across the Potomac River in Virginia.
Emergency generators took over almost immediately at the White House, keeping offices lighted as well as computers running. "The lights flickered off and then they were on again; it's not like we were sitting here in the dark or anything," said a White House employee who insisted on anonymity.
John Cook, the shift supervisor at the Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland Interconnection, an organization that coordinates power transfers among several large utilities, said the power failure did not spread outside the District of Columbia.
Office workers emptied into the streets when the lights went out, while some people were temporarily trapped in elevators.
"It reminds me of the war, when we had complete blackouts and I was a junior air raid warden," said Arthur I. Ross, owner of La Salle Liquors on Connecticut Avenue.

MAYOR WORRIED OVER STEIN PARTY
City Council President Andrew J. Stein, gearing up to run for Mayor, is hosting a glittering political dinner with Frank Sinatra, Liza Minnelli and Shirley MacLaine to raise more than $2 million. David N. Dinkins, not on the list, was worried enough to call friends listed as committee members to ask if they were abandoning him. That put some of them where they least like to be -- in the spotlight in a public feud. B3. 

ROBBED JEWELER RETURNS TO STORE
A 71-year-old jewelry store owner said it was not easy to return to his Chinatown store one day after killing a 40-year-old man who had tried to rob him. The store owner, Herman Moser, said he found that he could not concentrate on his work and that his eyes kept flickering to the door to size up anyone who entered his store on Canal Street. B3.

NEW YORK CREDIT IS DOWNGRADED
In a stinging censure of New York State's fiscal condition and the political paralysis in Albany, a major Wall Street credit agency downgraded the rating on most of the state's debt, leaving New York with the second lowest rating of all states. The new rating, which affects only the portion of the state's debt backed by annual legislative appropriations, is the lowest in the state's history and could mean that New York would have to pay higher interest rates on future borrowing. Moody's Investors Service, which set the rating, was worried about the state budget deficit. A1.
 
PCB CONTAMINATION DELAYS CLASSES
Officials at State University of New York at New Paltz announced they would delay the spring semester two weeks and move 1,000 students out of dormitories where electrical transformers exploded or overheated last week, contaminating the buildings with PCB's. The dormitories, along with two academic buildings, were contaminated after a car struck a utility pole on Dec. 29, causing a power surge that damaged the transformers. A1.
 
A QUORUM, FINALLY. LESS TAXES, MAYBE.
After weeks of a Republican boycott that brought the legislative process to a halt in the New Jersey State Assembly, Democratic members finally managed a quorum and introduced two sets of bills that would repeal the $2.8-billion tax increase they rammed through the Legislature 18 months ago. But Republicans continued their stalling tactics. B6.
 
A TAX REVIEW FOR CONNECTICUT TOWNS
The Wilson place, a rambling array of gables and porches in genteel Fenwick, Conn., has become the unlikely centerpiece of a court battle that could force most Connecticut towns to review the way they assess property for real-estate taxes. It was there that John C. Wilson 3d declared war against the tax assessor for the town of Old Saybrook, of which Fenwick is a borough, after his tax bill rose to $14,000 a year, from $4,000. B6.

HEADLINE: Utilities Want Rates to Cover Health Costs

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Public utility companies across the country are applying for substantial rate increases to finance the expensive medical benefits they have promised to their current and future retirees. The increases, if granted universally, would add more than $4 billion each year to the nation's electric, gas and telephone bills, according to Government economists.
The requested increases have drawn strong opposition from state officials and consumer groups, in part because utility employees and retirees typically receive far more generous medical benefits than most Americans. 
 The utilities contend that since active employees are earning their retirement benefits now, part of the cost should be added to current rates. Medical costs for current retirees are already included in the rates.
Southern New England Telephone and Public Service Electric and Gas of New Jersey are among the several large utilities that have requested these increases, and Consolidated Edison of New York plans to.
Consumer advocates are urging state regulators to reject such requests. They accuse the utilities of opportunism, arguing that ratepayers will receive little or no advantage in paying now for largely unpredictable obligations that are decades away.
"Obviously, 20 years from now there will be different ratepayers," said James Pretti, deputy director of the division of ratepayer advocates at the California Public Utility Commission. "It is cheaper for ratepayers to keep the money now, rather than put it up front."
Utilities' health plans have been generous in part because regulators allow the companies to pass along these costs to customers. According to a recent report by the A. Foster Higgins consulting firm, 53 percent of 66 utilites surveyed said they paid 100 percent of the medical costs for retirees and their dependents. But of the 1,189 employers of all types questioned in the same survey only 25 percent said they paid the entire bills.
The utility companies' efforts to add higher medical costs to their bills are fueling the broader political debate about rapid rises in these costs and the inequities between the insured and the uninsured.
Higher utility rates to cover retirees' future medical benefits would raise the cost of a broad variety of goods and services, affecting living standards and the international competitiveness of American factories.
The General Accounting Office recently estimated that as of 1993 all companies would face a total liability of $309 billion for health benefits for retirees, including $193 billion for active employees and $116 billion for those already retired.
Donald C. Snyder, assistant director in the G.A.O.'s human resources division, said the utilities' share for 1993 alone would be at least $4.5 billion. Covering that in full would add about 2.5 percent to the nation's total annual utility bills. And this amount would cover only future retirement benefits for active employees, not for those already retired.
Utility companies in at least a dozen states have applied for the increases. A few states, including Connecticut, Florida and North Carolina, have approved some rate increases to cover part of these medical costs. Others, including Georgia and Hawaii, have rejected the companies' requests, with regulators saying they need more time to study the issue.
Regulators are also examining the issue in New York and in California, where seven energy and telephone companies have asked for more than $450 million in higher rates. And in New Jersey, Public Service Electric and Gas, the state's largest utility, recently requested a $50 million increase to cover future health costs of retirees.
The utilities' actions are a response to a new reporting rule, affecting all large companies, that was adopted last year by the semi-official Financial Accounting Standards Board. Before the rule, most companies reported retirees' medical expenses on a pay-as-you-go basis.
Under the rule, each year beginning in 1993, companies must estimate and report a portion of their future medical expenses for retirees. The intention is to alert investors and corporate executives to liabilities that had been largely unnoticed.
The board did not require companies to set aside money for these future costs, but utilities are under special pressures to do so.
The Securities and Exchange Commission staff has questioned whether, in the distant future, state regulators will allow large enough rate increases to cover the potentially enormous obligations of utilities that have not put aside cash for retirees' medical expenses.
The rate requests raise important issues of fairness to current consumers and future generations. Accountants for the utilities say the promises to retirees are a current cost and should be paid now.
"People say, 'Let our grandchildren pay for them,' but this is a current cost of service provided today," said Ben McKnight, a partner with Arthur Andersen & Company and chairman of the public utilities committee of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants.
Paul Menzel, a philosophy professor at Pacific Lutheran University in Tacoma, Wash., said that not to act now would be "downright exploitation of a future generation." , He is the author of "Strong Medicine" (Oxford University Press), a 1990 book that warns of unforeseen expenses as elderly Americans live longer.
 
A Matter of Timing
 Consumer advocates on the staffs of a number of state regulatory commissions say there should be no urgency about raising rates. They say it is impossible to forecast medical costs accurately, or estimate the interest earnings of money set aside to pay for them.
They also contend that the Government will eventually assume more responsibility for health insurance, shifting the costs for future retirees to taxpayers. The General Accounting Office said recently that the retiree health obligations of all private companies would be reduced by 30 percent if Congress approved a proposal by Representative Dan Rostenkowski, Democrat of Illinois, to expand Medicare, the Federal health insurance program for the elderly.
The struggle over financing retiree costs has intensified pressures to cut back on health benefits and slow the rise in health costs, which have been growing at more than twice the general rate of inflation.
Medical benefits that many utilities provide their employees are often much more comprehensive than the health coverage of most of their customers. The public utilities, said Pat Wilson, a principal at the A. Foster Higgins consulting firm, "tend to lead the pack in offering more retiree benefits than other industries."
 
A Comparison to Taxes
 Arthur L. Caplan, director of the University of Minnesota's Center of Biomedical Ethics, compared utility bills to misdirected tax benefits. "The telephone, electricity and gas are essentials of life," he said. "The poor shouldn't be asked to subsidize the better-off and have to do it through a 'tax' that they can't avoid."
But union officials say their members should not be asked to surrender medical benefits, which they often got in lieu of larger wage increases over the years. They note that health care was the main issue in the 1989 telephone workers' strike against the Nynex Corporation.
"These are enormously productive industries," said George Kohl, research director with the Communications Workers of America. "If you start slashing benefits in the most productive industries, you would get a downward spiral in the standard of living of the rest of the country."
Each company can write off its entire liability at once, as General Electric and I.B.M. have done, or spread it over 20 years, which most utilities plan to do.
The calculation is different for every company, depending on the benefits, workers' ages, the number of retirees and active workers, and assumptions about medical inflation and interest rates.
 
Estimates for California
 Some California utility companies recently estimated that annual increases in health-care costs would start at 17 percent in 1993 and taper off to about 5 percent by 2015. To cover its future health costs for retirees, Pacific Bell Telephone is asking the California Public Utilities Commission for $204 million in higher rates in 1993. And the GTE Corporation in California is asking for a $61.3 million increase, which a commission aide said would add $1.46 to the average monthly residential bill of $42.33.
Some utilities, including Consolidated Edison and Brooklyn Union Gas in New York, Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and several regional telephone companies, are already using the new accounting method and putting money aside for retirees' medical costs.
Several states have granted rate increases to cover future health benefits for retirees. The Florida Public Service Commission recently approved a $2.9 million increase to cover such expenses for the Centel Corporation's employees in that state.
Connecticut has authorized $4.8 million for the Southern New England Telephone Company and smaller amounts for several water companies. North Carolina approved $1.2 million for a unit of the Virginia Electric and Power Company and is considering a similar request for $9.8 million by Duke Power.

Gulf States Utilities Names Key Manager to Top Posts

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
The Gulf States Utilities Company, the Texas-based power provider that has been in financial trouble since it finished a nuclear plant in 1986 in the midst of a regional recession, yesterday named Joseph L. Donnelly as chief executive.
Mr. Donnelly, senior executive vice president and a chief architect of the company's partial recovery, will also become chairman on March 1. 
 Mr. Donnelly, 62, who has been with the company since being hired in 1979 as senior vice president for finance, replaces E. Linn Draper, who is leaving as chairman, president and chief executive to become president of the American Electric Power Company, in Columbus, Ohio.
Gulf States, based in Beaumont, Tex., serves a 28,000-square-mile area between Houston and New Orleans with a population of 1.3 million. It was "tottering on the verge of bankruptcy" in 1986 and 1987, Mr. Donnelly said yesterday, because it completed its River Bend reactor, in St. Francisville, La., at a higher cost than planned, just as a recession was cutting power demand.
The recession made it harder to raise rates, he said. "We've been in rate proceedings for years and years and years," he said. "We had a mismatch of revenues and obligations."
The company cut stock dividends in 1986 and 1987 to conserve cash and sought a merger. By last year, its condition improved and it paid off $127 million of the $252 million it owed on back dividends on preferred and preference stock. Mr. Donnelly said Gulf States would like to pay off the rest in 1992.
Mr. Donnelly holds a bachelor's degree in political science from the University of Scranton and a doctor of jurisprudence degree from the University of Pennsylvania Law School. He was a deputy attorney general of Pennsylvania from 1955 to 1958, after which he joined the Pennsylvania Power and Light Company, where he held a variety of posts until coming to Gulf States.

HEADLINE: Fort St. John Journal;
For That Long Road to Alaska, a Long Birthday

BYLINE: By CLYDE H. FARNSWORTH, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: FORT ST. JOHN, British Columbia

 BODY:
Leslie Markham, a 79-year-old who lives in a trailer park here just off the Alaska Highway, recalls the day in 1942 during the road's construction when the muskeg "ate" one of the United States Army's Caterpillar tractors.
As the driver of a two-and-a-half-ton truck, Mr. Markham watched from more solid ground as "that Cat sank deeper and deeper and just got swallowed whole." The tractor's operator climbed out safely, and three other tractors sprouting cables and winches managed to extract the sunken machine many hours later. 
 Muskeg is an Algonguian term for grassy bog, and Canada probably has more of it than any other country. But muskeg, which melts treacherously in the summer, was only one of the hazards that thousands of workers like Mr. Markham faced in getting that road, now a nearly solid stretch of asphalt, across 100 rivers and five mountain ranges to Fairbanks, Alaska.
In 1992, Canada and the United States are planning a 50th-anniversary commemoration of their wartime collaboration in road-building to counter what was regarded in 1942 as a serious threat of a Japanese invasion through Alaska.
 
Old Road Warriors Returning
 Some of the old road warriors will return for the events, promoted as Rendezvous '92. Others will celebrate closer to where they live now, like a group of black veterans of the Army Corps of Engineers who plan a reunion on Jan. 18 to 20 at Florida A & M University in Tallahassee. A number of black engineering battalions commanded by white officers served in the segregated Army of that era.
Figures gathered by the University of Alaska in Fairbanks indicate that 10,607 American troops were involved in the project, among them 3,695 blacks. About 7,500 civilian construction workers took part, most of them Canadian.
Many others, from dog sledders and snowmobile operators to rally drivers and cyclists, are expected to help with the celebrations, and some organizers hope that President Bush and Prime Minister Brian Mulroney will stop by.
Although the two Governments formed a committee in 1930 to study the possibility of building a road through British Columbia and the Yukon territory to Alaska, it was the bombing of Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941, that provided the real incentive.
Construction of the 1,500-mile highway started just south of here at Dawson Creek in March 1942, and despite the hardships of cutting through rock, bog and bush at temperatures of 40 below zero for weeks at a time, the force of about 18,000 workers completed the highway in only eight months and 12 days, a remarkable feat of engineering.
Contemplating the highway that in some sections now bears as many as 3,000 vehicles a day, Mr. Markham, the son of a homesteader from Wisconsin, said, "In those days, it really seemed an impossible task."
The sense of urgency grew in June 1942, when Japanese bombers and fighters attacked the United States naval base at Dutch Harbor, Alaska. The next month several thousand Japanese troops invaded Attu and Kiska in the the Aleutian Island archipelago. American and Canadian troops later drove them out in what has come to be described as the Forgotten War.
The army of workers that poured into this sparsely settled region to help fight off the Japanese contributed to some military successes, and the road, also known as the Alcan Highway, has since helped to bring about economic development and other changes.
A driver heading north from Fort St. John will see a trail of Century 21 "For Sale" signs. Drivers of big 18-wheeler trucks, like Mel Mytron, 43, who carts oil equipment to Fort Nelson, hang out at Dodd's truck stop eating ham and eggs and drinking endlessly refilled cups of coffee.
Many historians say the road was been a mixed blessing at best because of its devastating effect on the northern Indians and Eskimos.
As the southerners flooded in, scores of indigenous people died in epidemics of new diseases against which they had no immunity, including measles, meningitis, dysentery, whooping cough, influenza, mumps, tonsillitis, bronchial pneumonia and tuberculosis.
And as members of the indigenous communities scrambled for highway jobs, they abandoned traditional means of subsistence like hunting and trapping, causing their food reserves to fall precariously.
Organizers of the Rendezvous '92 celebrations insist that they want this part of the Alaska Highway story forcefully told as well.
 
'Negative Effects, Too'
 "We want people to realize it did have negative effects, too," said Sandy Baker, an official on the Alaska Highway Rendezvous '92 committee. "This is a commemoration, not a celebration, of something that is a fact of history."
Indigenous people are themselves involved in the commemoration, using it as a vehicle to express their cultural views and to let visitors see their traditional ways.
As Win Baker, originally from Ontario, whose husband worked for a construction contractor in 1942, put it, "Everyone here came from somewhere else, and they came to do something."
She said the highway "sort of symbolizes the country -- huge, important for others needing work, but with something to show for it all."

HEADLINE: Overhaul of Dividend Tax Is Urged

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Challenging a fundamental feature of the nation's tax law, the Treasury contended today that the double taxation of dividends -- first at the corporate level and then at the shareholder level -- distorts decision-making throughout the economy and thereby reduces output as much as $25 billion a year.
The Treasury proposed to "integrate" corporate and shareholder levies so earnings would no longer be taxed two or more times and suggested options to do so. 
 Most European countries, as well as Canada and Australia, have adopted distribution-related systems of tax integration in which a separate corporate-level tax remains on retained earnings, but some or all of it is eliminated for earnings distributed to shareholders.
"Integration is beneficial, no matter how you do it," Kenneth W. Gideon, Assistant Treasury Secretary for tax policy, said at a news briefing. Noting that many of America's trading partners had already moved in this direction, Mr. Gideon added, "This is an issue we're going to have to deal with."
The issue is so far-reaching and complex that the Treasury study stopped short of recommending a particular solution. Its immediate aim was to open a debate that is expected to unfold over years rather than months.
Mr. Gideon, however, pointed to a preference in the study, which was mandated by the Tax Reform Act of 1986, for either allowing investors to exclude dividends from taxable income or for adopting a comprehensive business income tax.
The idea of integrating the tax system has been discussed for two decades. Big business tended to oppose the idea, but Mr. Gideon said that for various reasons, including shifts in relative tax rates and heavier reliance on debt, there is now a "very different world" in which to debate and legislate.
The Treasury report concluded that the current "classical" system of tax law exacts a heavy toll.
For one thing, since those who operate as sole proprietors of a business or as partners, for example, are taxed only once on their earnings, the law "often perversely penalizes" the corporate organizational form, an odd thing for a capitalist country.
The current system, the report maintained, "also distorts corporate financial decisions -- in particular by encouraging debt and discouraging new equity financing of corporate investments." Moreover, the system prejudices corporate decisions on whether to pay dividends or retain profits and causes companies to maneuver distributions to help stockholders avoid double taxation.
 
Possible Benefits
 The report said the potential benefits of integration included raising the value of capital stock in the corporate sector by $125 billion to $500 billion, lowering the corporate debt-to-asset ratio from one to seven percentage points and increasing domestic product by $2.5 billion to $25 billion a year.
The study did not include estimates of revenue loss for any of the options.
One option -- a shareholder allocation system widely regarded as the fullest form of integration -- was analyzed and presented by the study but rejected by Mr. Gideon and his colleagues.
Under such a plan, a company's income would be apportioned to stockholders who would then include it in income and would get credits for paying corporate taxes. But this system would pose several policy problems involving the extension to shareholders of corporate tax preferences and the treatment of foreign-source income on which no United States tax had been paid.
 
Two Options Favored
 Of the two options favored by the Treasury, Mr. Gideon seemed to favor dividend exclusion, which he said "accomplishes a lot of the goals of integration" without the huge overhaul that would be required by a comprehensive business income tax.
The comprehensive business tax was thought to require a 10-year phasing in. In it, there would be no deductions for dividends or interest paid by companies, and stockholders and bondholders could exclude them from their income. "The result is that one -- but only one -- level of tax would be collected on capital income earned by businesses," the study said.
In framing the debate, the Treasury laid out four goals for designing a new system: greater uniformity of levies on investment across economic sectors; more uniformity in how debt and equity is taxed; minimum distortion of the choice between retaining profits and paying them out as dividends, and taxing investment once instead of two or even three times.

HEADLINE: Linking Arms Cuts to Taxes

BYLINE: By CLIFFORD KRAUSS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Senator Phil Gramm, one of the most influential Republican lawmakers on budget policy, called today for a 5 percent cut in military spending by 1993 to allow the Government to raise the personal income tax exemption for every taxpayer by $416.
The conservative Texas Republican said his plan would result in a $466-a-year tax cut for a family of four whose income is $35,000. Because Mr. Gramm's proposal would cut military spending by more than the 1990 budget agreement provided for, it would bend, if not break, the agreement, which he helped to negotiate.
 
Significance of Remarks
 Mr. Gramm's proposed cut in military spending from $291 billion this year to $276.5 billion in the 1994 fiscal year and $275.3 billion by the 1995 fiscal year is thought to be close to the kind of cut President Bush is thinking of proposing in his State of the Union Message later this month. By making his proposal first, Mr. Gramm could protect Mr. Bush from criticism by Congressional conservatives who warn that military spending has already been sliced enough. 
 Mr. Gramm's comments are all the more significant because his state benefits substantially from military spending and has numerous military installations. Given the choice between sustaining the personnel size of the military or modernizing its equipment, Mr. Gramm said that he believed in a modern military that included a missile shield in space.
Mr. Gramm, speaking at a news conference, also suggested that any cuts in military spending beyond what he has proposed be equally divided between reducing the Federal deficit and increasing the personal income tax exemption. He said that there was "nothing magic" about his 5 percent proposal and that the final figure ought to determined by the Defense Department.
"I believe that even in a world where the lion and lamb are about to lie down together, I want to be sure we're the lion," he said.
Mr. Gramm promoted his proposal as an alternative to several Democratic plans that would increase spending on social programs. One such plan, offered last week by Senator Jim Sasser, the Tennessee Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee, and Senator Paul S. Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, would increase Federal spending by $55 billion to stimulate the economy.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Spiegel to Close Honeybee Unit

 BODY:
Spiegel Inc. said yesterday that it plans to close its 17-store Honeybee division on Feb. 29, a move that will result in a pretax write-off of $9 million in the 1991 calendar year. The Honeybee stores had sales of $12 million in 1991, Spiegel said.
Honeybee, a retailer of women's apparel, will continue to sell clothes through Spiegel's catalogues. 
 "The Honeybee stores have been hard hit by the recession, especially in the Northeast, where they are concentrated," said John J. Shea, vice chairman of Spiegel Inc. Many of the current stores are in the downtown and smaller mall locations inherited when Spiegel bought the company in 1988 for $23 million, he said.
"The resources required to turn the stores' business around are out of proportion with their potential in the current and anticipated retail environment," Mr. Shea said.
Honeybee store division headquarters in Huntingdon Valley, Pa., will begin closing immediately. The retail distribution center, also in Huntingdon Valley, will close over the next six months.
The Honeybee catalogue division will continue to operate out of Spiegel plants in Chicago and Oak Brook, Ill.

HEADLINE: A Winning Year for Stock Funds

BYLINE: By SETH FAISON Jr.

 BODY:
With a striking 8.7 percent price jump in the final 11 days of December, stock mutual funds posted a yearly gain of 36 percent in 1991, their best since 1967.
In contrast to 1990, when they lost 6.3 percent of their value, stock funds were brawny last year. They out-performed two traditional competitors for small investors' money: fixed-income funds, which were up 18 percent, and money-market funds, up 5.6 percent. 
 Falling interest rates increasingly drove investors to stock funds. By the end of the year, when the Federal Reserve slashed the discount rate to 3 1/2 percent, stock funds had become more popular than ever.
Many analysts caution that it may be hard in 1992 to repeat such a sparkling performance.
"There's still favorable momentum," said A. Michael Lipper, president of Lipper Analytical Services, which tracks mutual funds. "But if there is disappointment in the economy, there is risk."
The biggest gainers of 1991 were stock funds made up of smaller, growth-oriented issues. High-growth funds studied by Mr. Lipper grew by an average 16.4 percent in the fourth quarter and a stunning 67 percent over the full year. Small-stock funds had lost 9.9 percent in 1990.
"Growth stocks are in vogue right now," said Robert Freedman, chief investment officer for John Hancock Mutual Funds in Boston, whose Special Equity Fund notched an 85 percent gain for the year.
Low inflation, low interest rates and a weak economy, Mr. Freedman noted, are favorable to growth-oriented, as opposed to larger, value-oriented stocks, which are generally bought because of their assets or prospective earnings.
Health and biotechnology funds surged 74 percent last year, extending an advance that began in early 1990; they rose by 16 percent in the fourth quarter alone. Biotechnology stocks, which led this group in the third quarter, dropped sharply in November, when medical equipment and technology stocks picked up.
Dragged down by disappointingly slow oil stocks, natural-resource funds performed the worst of any particular sector stock in the fourth quarter -- down 2.9 percent; they had an anemic 3.7 percent gain for the year. Gold funds also did poorly in 1991, declining by 4.5 percent.
Financial services funds, taking advantage of the flood of underwriting business and investment in the market in 1991, grew by a strong 60 percent in the year, and by 10.5 percent in the fourth quarter.
"It was a year where being an active manager worked," Mr. Lipper said.
Fund managers who carefully picked stocks outperformed ordinary indexes, like the Standard & Poor's 500 stock index, which rose 26 percent for the year.
Some fund managers stressed the advantages of sticking with a stock, even if its price rose sharply, rather than taking a quick profit.
"When a stock is accelerating, why sell it?" asked James E. Stowers 3d, executive vice president of Twentieth Century Investors Inc., whose Vista Investors Fund was the fourth quarter's best performer, with a 22.9 percent gain.
"They get volatile, sure, but that's half the fun," he added.
Other managers found that fast-rising stocks were best sold early.
Heiko Thieme, manager of the American Heritage Fund, which grew by a nearly unbeatable 97 percent for the year, said he sold issues far sooner than he had planned because they rose faster than expected.
 
Tale of One Stock
 Mr. Thieme bought one biotechnology stock for his fund, Anergen Inc., when it fell to $8 a share and expected to hold on to it for some time. When it rose to $24 in only two weeks, however, he could not resist selling. The stock subsequently fell again, and yesterday closed at $12.25 a share.
Mr. Thieme said he ususally preferred to split his fund to about 60 percent big-name stocks and 40 percent smaller stocks. But this year he shifted the ratio, taking advantage of bargains -- and a faster rate of growth -- in small issues.
"It was a strange market," said David Dreman, who manages the Dreman High Return Fund. "On the one hand, there was almost mania in biotechs. No price was too high." Yet, he noted, stocks that follow cyclical trends in the market only began to excel in the final weeks of the year.

HEADLINE: Tax Repeal Is Introduced In Assembly Tactics Duel

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
After weeks of a Republican boycott that brought legislating to a halt in the State Assembly, Democratic members finally managed a quorum today and introduced two sets of bills that would repeal the $2.8 billion tax increase they rammed through the Legislature 18 months ago.
But truculent Republicans, who showed up for the session only after the Democrats achieved a 42-member majority on their own, continued their stalling tactics. An Appropriations Committee hearing on the repeal package was delayed until late in the evening as wary Democrats refused to leave the Assembly floor for fear that a new Republican boycott would emerge and again deny a quorum if committee members left for a hearing. 
 When the committee finally met, its Democratic majority managed to approve a repeal package already passed in the Senate, setting the stage for a floor vote on Wednesday.
But two Democrats suggested that they could well vote against repeal when it gets there, which means the package is in trouble unless the Democrats can muster one or two Republican votes, which seems unlikely.
 
Democrat Is Doubtful
 One Democrat, Henry A. McEnroe of South Orange, abstained on the committee vote, and added, "While I never say never, I don't intend to support the repeal."
Another Democrat, William J. Pascrell Jr. of Paterson, is the author of the alternative package of repeal bills, which include a number of spending cuts. But he angrily vowed not to support any tax rollback unless his own repeal package was passed by the Senate, so it could be voted on by the Assembly. Mr. Pascrell also forced the committee to send his seven-bill package to the floor intact. When the committee at first tabled parts of it, he threatened to withhold his needed approval of the Senate-passed version.
The fledgling rebellion among its own members took the Democrats by surprise, although they had taken steps to avoid continuing parliamentary sabotage by the Republicans.
"We're holding the committee hearing in an upstairs room," said a Democratic staff member, "so we can go get them" if the Republicans call for a quorum.
 
Republican Rump Sessions
 Although the Democrats hold a 43-to-37 edge in the Assembly and only a bare majority of 41 members are required to conduct business, Democratic illnesses and absences, plus the Republican boycott, had kept attendance below that level until today.
For weeks the Republicans held rump sessions in a diner or a rented meeting hall, refusing to go onto the Assembly floor unless Democrats achieved a quorum on their own.
Today, they did it. But the sullen Republicans, who trooped into the Assembly chamber from the Contemporary Club, a meeting hall across the street, did not give up easily.
When Democratic committee members left the floor to begin their hearing, already three hours late, Republicans issued a quorum call and invoked a parliamentary rule that members could not leave the floor until the day's agenda was completed. And the agenda was swollen by a backlog of legislation bottled up during the monthlong boycott.
The committee hearing was recessed while the members returned to the floor.
 
Tax Gamesmanship
 At issue in the parliamentary gamesmanship were two sets of bills that would roll back $2.8 billion in tax increases that the Democrats pushed through the Legislature in 1990 over the strenuous objection of the Republicans, who occasionally wore gags to protest what they said was a Democratic effort to silence them.
But the legislative climate underwent a dramatic, virtually instant reversal after the elections on Nov. 5, when the Republicans won overwhelming, veto-proof majorities in both houses by lambasting the Democrats for the tax increases.
Republican jubilation quickly died when the Democrats, still in control until Jan. 14, announced that they would steal the Republican thunder by rolling back the taxes themselves, leaving the Republicans to decide how to replace the lost revenues and make up for a huge shortfall in a recession.
The Democrats managed to get their tax rollback legislation through the Senate, where they enjoy a 27-13 majority, but until today were unable to get a quorum in the lower house.
Gov. Jim Florio has not said whether he would sign or veto a package repealing the taxes, on which he staked his political career.

HEADLINE: Record-Setting Dow Rally Ends on 1.35 Loss

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
The stock market's mighty winning streak finally ended yesterday, but just barely. After 11 straight rises and 6 straight records, the Dow Jones industrial average inched downward for a change but hung on above 3,200. At 3,200.13 at the close, it was off 1.35 points.
Trading was heavy, and while there appeared to be some weakness in large issues, the broad market continued to make strong advances. The Nasdaq composite index rode to a new high of 597.90, up 5.25, and the American Stock Exchange's composite index also set a new record, up 0.44, to 399.27. 
 The Russell 2,000, an indicator of small-stock activity, jumped 2.24 points, to close at a record 194.34.
Philip H. Smythe, an analyst at Birinyi Associates, a market research firm, noted that the Dow's 11-day run, which lifted it 10.3 percent, was the longest in five years. In January 1987, the index posted gains on 13 straight days for an 11 percent gain.
Volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy yesterday, at 251.2 million shares, up from 224.3 million shares on Friday. The Big Board's composite index slipped 0.50 points, to 229.85, as gainers outpaced losers by 1,059 to 787.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks, another blue-chip indicator, fell 1.38 points, to end at 417.96.
 
Some Taking Profits
 After the Dow fell below 3,200 early in the day, stocks rose across the board. Trading was volatile, with doses of program trading to make the day interesting. Birinyi Associates tracked four buying programs and two selling ones that, when combined, had a net effect of raising the Dow 4.68 points.
Gene J. Seagle, the director of technical research for Gruntal & Company, said he thought yesterday gave investors who felt the market had run too far, too fast, a chance to take profits. "And these will be the same investors who will be on the sides waiting to get back in," he said.
"Add those to the investors who have thus far missed the market's move and are waiting to get in, and it keeps building up a support level of potential cash infusion for the market to continue on its way," he added.
The market's move is not such a surprise if you look at January 1985, 1986, 1987 and 1991. The percentage moves in those months ran 17 percent, 27 percent, 26 percent and 22 percent, respectively. Applying the 23 percent average now, the Dow could hit 3,562 before any big drop comes, Mr. Seagle noted.
This market move has similarities to January 1987, which also followed a year when the market held mainly in a narrow range, he said.
"Many important things have come together at this time, like year-end factors, the large amount of sideline cash in money funds looking for a better return, a Presidential cycle and the January effect, where the revenue taken from the market for tax purposes finds its way back for reinvestment," Mr. Seagle said.
 
Heavy Secondary Activity
 Traders support Mr. Seagle's contention that the market is being led by individuals who have returned in a large way. "That's why we're seeing a lot of activity in secondary stocks, as well as the big blue-chip issues," he said.
Ricky Harrington, the director of equity investments for Marion Bass Securities, said that judging by the heavy volume, one or two more days of consolidation could still take place, with nothing pointing to any more than normal.
He thought perhaps the President's trip to Japan could produce further news, but some profit taking in the meantime could be reasonable. "Later in the week we could get some economic news" that could affect the market, he said. "While the consolidation was relegated to a handful of Dow stocks, it could spill over into the over-the-counter market."
Auto stocks were steady or up slightly, as five Japanese car makers, Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi and Mazda, were reported to be ready to lift sales of American vehicles in Japan through their dealerships. Chrysler rose as high as 14 1/8, before closing at 13 5/8, up 1/8 for the day, while Ford Motor rose as high as 31 5/8, to 30 7/8, up 1/2. General Motors rose 1, to 33 1/2.
The stocks affected by the Food and Drug Administration's moratorium on silicone breast implants included Corning, which fell 2, to 77 3/8, and Dow Chemical, off 1 7/8, to 51 7/8. They own Dow Corning Wright, which markets silicone implants in the United States.
Bioplasty, which derives much of its revenues from implants sold outside the country, rose 1/4, to 5 5/8. It said that while the moratorium would not eliminate the commercial availability of the implants outside the United States, should it become permanent, it would hurt the company's future profits. Mentor, another marketer of implants, fell 2, to 12 1/4.

HEADLINE: The Analyst Behind the Lowering of New York's Rating

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS

 BODY:
For months, George W. Leung, vice president of state debt ratings for Moody's Investors Service Inc., has been worried about New York State's mounting budget deficit. Yesterday, he acted on his concerns, recommending a lower rating for the state's appropriations-backed bonds, which represent about two-thirds of New York's $20.9 billion in debt.
After reviewing Mr. Leung's analysis, Moody's public finance department concurred, issuing the lower rating.
 
Aaa Rating for the Rater
 "This decision reflects the fact that time is running out because we are in the final quarter of the fiscal year," Mr. Leung, who lives in South Orange, N.J., said in a telephone interview yesterday. "Not only has the state not dealt with the problem, but the problem has grown." 
 It was a decision that Mr. Leung, (pronounced LONG) said that he made after months of detailed analysis and virtually daily discussions with state budget officials. "We had to weigh the ability of New York State against the scope of its problems," Mr. Leung said. "What was most disturbing was the lack of action."
New York State's deficit rose to $875 million in the third quarter of the 1992 fiscal year, which ends March 31.
Mr. Leung has worked in the state and municipal financing departments at Moody's for 15 years, where he has become known for his sharp analytical skills. Freda Johnson, who supervised Mr. Leung when she headed Moody's public finance department from 1979 to 1990, gave him a Aaa rating. "I have the highest regard for him," Ms. Johnson said.
A graduate of Rutgers, where he studied economics, Mr. Leung received a master's degree in city and regional planning from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
He described his job as "quite demanding," particularly as more and more states struggle to offset growing budget gaps.
Moody's, followed by Standard and Poor's, is one of two principal credit rating agencies for public debt. Because of the vast variety of municipal and state debt -- there are more municipal issues than stocks on the New York Stock Exchange -- it is virtually impossible for an investor to keep abreast of the financial health of every city and state. Thus, investors ely on debt-rating agencies.

HEADLINE: Delay Sought In Paying Tax On L.I. Homes

BYLINE: By JOSH BARBANEL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MINEOLA, L.I., Jan. 6

 BODY:
Here in the suburbs, where a home is a passport to the American dream, the Nassau County Executive declared today that the "American dream is dying" and called for emergency measures including a moratorium on foreclosures for homeowners who cannot pay their taxes.
The County Executive, Thomas S. Gulotta, who has a budget crisis that is forcing layoffs of up to a quarter of the county's workers, said the local economy was "closer to a depression" than a recession and was driving people out of the county. 
 The recession, he said, is aggravating the high cost of living, taxes and utilities, forcing the elderly to consider selling their homes and making homes unaffordable for young couples. To remedy that, he proposed freezing property taxes or even eliminating them altogether.
"The American dream is dying," he said. "We are gradually witnessing the New York City-fication of Nassau County. Property values are decreasing and the middle-income taxpayer is sustaining the largest portion of the burdens for all segments of society."
 
An Extra 2 Years to Pay
 In counties hard hit throughout the metropolitan area, more and more homeowners are falling behind in their taxes, officials say. In Nassau County, where the average property-tax bill is approaching $5,000 a year, delinquent taxes have almost doubled since 1985, to $86.6 million last year, from $43.7 million six years before.
Under Mr. Gulotta's plan, which is subject to the approval of the County Board of Supervisors, taxpayers who now have two years to pay back taxes before foreclosure proceedings begin would get an extra two years. In theory, that would tide them over until the end of the recession, officials said.
Lisa M. Burke, Deputy County Treasurer, said the moratorium was unlikely to encourage many residents to ignore their tax bills.
"There still would be a certain date by which most property taxes would have to be paid," she said, "and most people would want to honor that obligation as soon as they could."
The moratorium on foreclosures was proposed by Mr. Gulotta, a Republican, in a populist State of the County speech. It was preceded by weeks of budget wrangling with fellow Republicans, which has damaged his standing in the county and raised questions about his political survival.
In a dazzling reversal, Mr. Gulotta, who less than two months ago proposed a 25 percent property-tax increase, which was rejected by Republican legislators, backed the growing anti-tax movement.
He supported a freeze on all local taxes, but he went even further, calling for elimination of the property tax as "essential to the future health and vitality of our region." While some tax opponents want to replace it with an income tax, Mr. Gulotta did not propose an alternative, saying more study was needed.
In his speech in the Board of Supervisors chamber, Mr. Gulotta called for state legislation to bar tax assessors from raising taxes on houses that have undergone improvements, in order to spur the economy.
And he said that he said he would also push for establishing a sports authority that would consider a new sports stadium, perhaps on the site of the defunct Roosevelt Raceway.
Mr. Gulotta also said that he planned to sue New York State to prevent the imposition of state mandates on local government and reverse the loss of state aid to school districts.
 
House Lost on $92.07 Debt
 Edwin L. Crawford, the director of the New York State Association of Counties, said that two upstate counties, Montgomery and Saratoga, have already begun researching such a lawsuit. He said that counties were most concerned about state budget cuts imposed in the middle of a county's fiscal year.
Asked about the lawsuit, Tom Conroy, a spokesman for Gov. Mario M. Cuomo, noted that the Governor favors reducing mandates on local governments, and said, "I can't imagine what the basis could be of any suit."
Under a tax system set up in Nassau County during the 1930's, when many county residents fell behind in their property-tax payments, Nassau County auctions unpaid tax debts to speculators. The speculators pay the taxes, charge the homeowners interest and can foreclose on the properties.
In the mid-1980's, after one unsuspecting homeowner lost her home for a $92.07 debt she knew nothing about, the county tightened its rules. Since then, officials said, no homes have been foreclosed upon, although some foreclosure actions are pending.
 
'Single Most Important Asset'
 The new proposal was born out of fear that the recession would bring a new wave of foreclosures, they said.
"A home is the single most important asset owned by most of our residents, representing the investment of a lifetime," Mr. Gulotta said. "No one in Nassau County will lose his or her home due to the inability to pay taxes during this recessionary period."
Though the overall tone of Mr. Gulotta's speech was pessimistic, he said that the American dream could be restored if officials would rise above partisanship and "return to basic beliefs."
"We must be willing to explore every alternative to cut costs and to open the doors of opportunities for all of our citizens," he said.
 
'Feel Our Heartache'
 But some of the specifics he cited seem likely to do more to fuel conflict than to solve problems, especially his conflict with the majority leader of the county legislature, Joseph N. Mondello, the presiding supervisor from the Town of Hempstead and the Republican County Chairman.
In his speech, Mr. Gulotta criticized Mr. Mondello's budget cuts for hurting the elderly and damaging the county highway department. And in a call for consolidating services, he proposed that Hempstead do away with several agencies known in Republican circles as conduits for patronage, from the Civil Service Commission to the security department, which protects public buildings.
To support his theme that the American dream was dying, Mr. Gulotta read a Christmas card he received from Gail and Charlie Kinnison in North Massapequa.
"Dear Tom," it read, "Enclosed is a picture of our darling Kayla. She's our granddaughter, the fifth generation to live in Nassau County. But she and her Mommy and Daddy are leaving here because they can't afford the taxes on a home in Nassau. I wish you could feel our heartache. Merry Christmas."

HEADLINE: Brady, on Bush Trip, Expected to Press Tokyo

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Japan's Finance Minister made a surprise announcement today that Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady would accompany President Bush on his visit here, which begins Tuesday. The announcement caused speculation that he might press Japan for financial measures to bolster the ailing American economy and to help American companies doing business in Japan.
Japanese and American officials were unusually tight-lipped about Mr. Brady's visit and its purpose, other than acknowledging that he was coming, and that added to the speculative fervor. A senior Treasury official has been here since the weekend negotiating with the Japanese, but officials would say only that a range of macroeconomic issues have been discussed. 
 Undoubtedly, Mr. Brady's presence will add to the pressure that the United States is applying to Japan to make trade concessions. American negotiators are trying persuade the Japanese to establish targets for the import of American autos and auto parts, officials have said. The pressure has created some confusion and rancor, as the Americans work to tie up a deal before President Bush arrives.
 
Topics of Speculation
 Speculation on the specific purpose of Mr. Brady's visit ranged from an agreement to see the dollar weaken further against the yen to an agreement to lower interest rates jointly, the adoption of a more stimulative fiscal policy by the Japanese or some form of financial assistance to help American companies doing business in Japan.
The dollar weakened against the yen in Tokyo today, falling to 124 yen from 125.50 yen a week ago and about 128 yen a month ago.
Both countries have been encouraging a weaker dollar to reduce Japan's yawning trade surplus with the United States. The lower dollar makes it more expensive for Americans to buy foreign-made goods, thus inhibiting imports. It also makes it cheaper for those holding yen and other currencies to buy American goods, aiding exports.
Japan has taken two macroeconomic steps recently in response to American demands that the Government try to reduce the growing trade surplus. In a surprise move, the Bank of Japan lowered its official discount rate in the final week of last year. That makes it easier for the United States to reduce interest rates and stimulates growth in Japan, which will tend to raise imports here.
In addition, Japan announced a budget for the fiscal year beginning April 1, that includes heavy public works spending, as the United States has requested, because it would stimulate domestic demand.
Japanese officials have said that they are willing to help President Bush, who is facing an election later this year when the American economy is in recession. But the Japanese have also said there are limits to what they can do.

HEADLINE: Thriving Where Others Won't Go

BYLINE: By ALLEN R. MYERSON

 BODY:
Mariano Diaz stood, hands on hips, in the front of a Ctown grocery store where Harlem meets Central Park. He looked as if he owned the place, which he does. "How many Dominicans do you know in the supermarket business?" he asked his friend Teodoro Cortes.
Mr. Cortes, a builder for many of these stores in the New York area, knew the right answer: "How many supermarkets are there?" he asked. 
 Mr. Cortes was only slightly exaggerating. The Ctown group alone reports that about half its 167 stores, mostly in the New York area, are owned by Dominicans. The owners of the 37 new Bravo stores are almost entirely Dominican. All told, the region's Dominicans sell more than a billion dollars worth of groceries a year.
The Dominican grocery store owners who succeed as well as Mr. Diaz have have followed a quick but steep route to six-figure incomes. Often, they plant their stores in tough neighborhoods where major chains have pulled out or seldom ventured.
New York remains a city where ethnic neighborhoods are often matched by ethnic industries, where Greeks own many of the diners, many diamond merchants are Jewish and greengrocers are often Korean.
The success of the Dominicans in the supermarket business has been less visible, because it has been fairly recent and because store owners, unlike Korean greengrocers, wait on few of their customers themselves.
New York's Dominicans -- about 400,000, according to official estimates -- are the city's largest group of recent immigrants. Behind the statistics about the low incomes in the Hispanic population lie hundreds of stories like Mr. Diaz's.
The Dominican store owners have recently taken a higher profile in the face of reports by city officials that grocers in poor neighborhoods gouge customers who often have no place else to shop. Some of the owners see an attack on the grocers as an attack on Dominicans.
Ctown appears to be the largest New York chain in which Dominicans figure so prominently. It has more than $1 billion in annual sales, according to the Modern Grocer trade publication. Other chains, including Associated and Met Food, also have dozens, perhaps hundreds, of Dominican owners.
These chains are what grocers call voluntary associations, as distinct from companies like Pathmark and A.& P., which own the stores themselves. Under the Ctown agreement, the privately held Krasdale Foods Inc. provides independent store owners with advertising services, legal advice and packaged foods, and often helps arrange financing. Krasdale's profits from the Ctown arrangement come primarily from supplying groceries to the stores.
Ask the Dominican owners and the Krasdale executives what brought them together, and they sketch a story of traditional immigrant virtues, of 14-hour workdays in poor neighborhoods. "They are very industrious," said Charles A. Krasne, president of Krasdale Foods. "And they stick their necks out. They came to New York to get rich, and they succeeded."
 
Changing Neighborhoods
 But they were also united by their economic needs. By the 1970's, several major grocery chains were retreating from the city. Krasdale, then primarily a grocery distributor, saw its market shriveling.
Krasdale also saw that many owners of bodegas -- the small, walk-in stores that are to New York what the auto-oriented 7-Eleven's are to Dallas -- were Dominicans. They often lacked education, but this ready-made minor league had trained them in the grocery business.
The company established the Ktown organization with 12 stores in 1975. When the K Mart Corporation objected, Krasdale changed the name to Ctown. Ctown's structure was suited to a diverse city. Independently owned groceries, Krasdale executives decided, could cater to neighborhood tastes more readily than stores run from some distant headquarters.
"Each store has to have its own flavor, its own personality," Mr. Diaz said.
And having a store owned, not just operated, by the manager improved performance, often doubling profit margins to about 2 percent -- in a high-volume business where margins tend to be as thin as Saran Wrap.
 
Another Immigrant's Tale
 Mr. Krasne's knack for promoting Dominican ambitions in the grocery business takes him back to his family roots. His father was an immigrant, from Russia, and a grocer who founded the family business in 1908.
Mr. Krasne, 61 years old, is a graduate of Yale College and Harvard Business School, a former International Business Machines salesman and an erstwhile computer entrepeneur. But once he saw how readily he could apply his business skills to making the grocery distribution business far more profitable -- ultimately turning it into as much of a consulting and marketing as a distribution company -- he was hooked.
Like other ethnic groups, the Dominicans began with small stores serving their own communities, then branched out. Their stores usually have labor costs much lower than chain-owned competitors, where even the managers might belong to unions. Many Dominican owners put their relatives on the job, recruit other Dominicans at near-minimum wages and work endless hours themselves.
Often, employees go on to run their own businesses. Luis E. Guarnizo, a doctoral candidate in sociology at Johns Hopkins University, said that more than a third of the Dominican business owners he surveyed had begun their careers as employees in other businesses owned by Dominicans. "They learn the ropes, get the skills, and move up," he said.
 
Protecting the Cash
 Such was the course that brought Mr. Diaz to 110th Street and Central Park West. There, at the Ctown grocery store on the ground floor of an apartment building, Mr. Diaz and his wife, Iris, sit caged behind three steel doors, with a band of narrow one-way mirrors looking out on the store, a bank of 10 video monitors displaying every aisle and cash register.
Even with all this security, Mr. Diaz said, a band of intruders could create a distraction that drew him away from his office, break in and be off with thousands of dollars by the time he returned. It is a high-volume cash business, so keeping money around and getting it safely to the bank requires stealth and cunning.
To foil robbers who might be staking out the store, he tries to avoid having the same employees, or the same car, carry the cash to the bank. Armored cars? Too conspicuous, Mr. Diaz said.
Still, just a few weeks ago, $9,000 was taken from his employees on a Monday at noon. He himself was held up at gunpoint in 1990. "When you start getting older, you think about those things," he said, adding that he has four children.
 
Well Lighted and Clean
 His store has little in common with the often cramped, worn bodegas. Bright fluorescent lighting bounces off floors and fixtures buffed to a shine worthy of household-cleanser commercials. Customers often linger, sometimes to trade neighborhood news with Mr. Diaz.
His keychain jangling from a belt loop, Mr. Diaz pops out of his office to run a cash register when he sees the lines getting long.
Mr. Diaz joined other Dominican supermarket owners who filed into the office of Mark Green, the New York City Commissioner of Consumer Affairs, last spring to protest what they asserted were his ethnic assaults. Mr. Green's department reported that stores in poor neighborhoods tended to charge more for the same items than did stores in wealthier areas. To increase variety and competition, he has urged the major chains to return.
Dominican store owners loudly derided Mr. Green's views. "Why is a can of Del Monte beans that a Dominican sells different from a can that an Anglo sells?" Mr. Diaz asked. "In the past these stores were called supermarkets when they were owned by A.& P. Now that they are owned by Dominicans, why are they called bodegas?"
In an interview, Mr. Green responded sharply. "Are these owners really saying that their Latino customers are not entitled to larger stores that may have more choices and lower prices?" he asked, adding that he has also challenged some practices of Korean greengrocers and Israeli electronics merchants in the city.
Mr. Diaz, 36 years old, developed his own skills by working at bodegas. After he arrived in the United States about 15 years ago, his retailing education began at a store an uncle owned in Jamaica, Queens. He saved enough, and learned enough, to buy another store with two relatives before he bought his own, on 100th Street in Manhattan, in about 1982.
Soon, he began scouting the neighborhood for a larger store. When he saw new apartment buildings rising on 110th Street, about half a mile north of his bodega and several steep blocks from the nearest supermarket, he noticed that the ground floor had room for several narrow shops.
The neighborhood's need for a store was confirmed a few years ago by Mr. Green, who cited reports that the D'Agostino grocery chain's store at 110th Street and Broadway would not deliver as far east as Harlem (the store now delivers as far as Central Park West).
In 1987, Mr. Diaz talked to the Krasdale company about becoming a Ctown owner himself. He took a 15-year lease on the 110th Street space, sold his bodega for $350,000 and began installing coolers and cash registers.
After his store opened in December 1988, Mr. Diaz worked months without a day off. Now he rests on Sundays, working the other days from about 10 A.M. to 8 or 10 P.M.
For this, he says, he reaps annual sales of about $4 million and profits of about $100,000. But already, he is looking for new, young partners, perhaps to run other stores. "Hopefully," he said, "if my kids pursue this kind of work, we will do something together."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
Economist Post Filled By Salomon Brothers

BYLINE: By JONATHAN FUERBRINGER

 BODY:
Salomon Brothers yesterday announced the appointment of John P. Lipsky as its first chief economist since the 1988 departure of Henry Kaufman, whose economic insights dominated Wall Street for years.
The firm also named David G. Shulman to the new job of United States equity strategist. 
 Mr. Lipsky, who has been Salomon's chief economist for Europe, based in London, said his appointment was a sign of the growth and globalization of Salomon's research capabilities since Mr. Kaufman, who hired Mr. Lipsky, left the firm.
"Henry Kaufman became Henry Kaufman," Mr. Lipsky said in an interview yesterday, "because he was almost uniquely right about the inflationary consequences of the economic policies of the late 70's. But I will be happy just to be right."
Mr. Shulman is adding his new job to that of manager of the real estate research group. The new job, he suggested, might give him the opportunity, finally, to be a little upbeat.
The two appointments come as Salomon continues to restructure itself in the wake of the Government securitities scandal that became known in August and resulted in the resignation of much of the top management of the firm, with Warren E. Buffett taking on the job of acting chairman.
Mr. Lipsky, 44, said the new management of Salomon includes people "I have respected and worked with for a long time." He added, "I feel comfortable with the direction that they are moving in."
Mr. Lipsky will bring an international bent to the resurrected chief economist job. He said that while he did not intend to be Salomon's sole economic spokesman, there was a feeling in the firm and among clients "that there be a spokesman for the firms's global market view."
Mr. Kaufman, who spent 26 years at Salomon and now heads his own New York-based economic consulting firm, Henry Kaufman & Company, said yesterday that Mr. Lipsky's appointment was "recognizing the in-house talent that I hoped one day would be recognized."
Mr. Shulman, 48, joined Salomon Brothers in 1986. He is a managing director and was appointed to head the real estate research group in January 1990. Before joining Salomon, he was vice president at TCW Realty Advisors in Los Angeles and an associate professor of management and economics at the University of California at Riverside. He has a bachelor's degree from Baruch College in New York City and master's and doctorate degrees from the U.C.L.A. Graduate School of Management.
Mr. Lipsky joined Salomon it 1984, after working for the International Monetary Fund on exchange rate surveillance and on negotiations of economic programs for countries in Latin America and Asia. He earned his bachelor's degree in economics at Wesleyan University in Connecticut and his master's and doctorate in economics from Stanford Unitversity. He will return from London to New York soon.

HEADLINE: Business and Health;
Companies' Costs: How Much Is Fair?

BYLINE: By Milt Freudenheim

 BODY:
LARGE employers, especially manufacturers, are telling Congress they have been saddled with an unfair share of the nation's health-care spending. A new study for the National Association of Manufacturers contends that hospitals overcharged employers by $10.8 billion in 1991 to make up for losses on unpaid bills.
The study by Lewin/ICF, a Washington-based health-care consulting firm, also said that hospitals charged an additional $10.6 billion because Medicaid and Medicare payments did not fully cover hospital costs. The association estimated that employees and their employers -- including Federal, state and local governments -- spent $171 billion on health care last year. 
 The National Association of Manufacturers gave a copy of the study to Steve Kelmer, an Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Welfare, who said he hoped it would provide background for White House aides preparing the President's State of the Union address.
But the issue is clouded by a dearth of reliable numbers. Hospitals often calculate "uncompensated care" by using nominal, undiscounted prices, which insurers do not pay. And, insurers note, many local governments reimburse hospitals for losses on charity care. They add that some hospitals have managed to set aside reserves, purchase securities and invest in new buildings and equipment even as they were reporting financial difficulties because of razor-thin operating margins.
There are few Government statistics on how the costs are shifted, and what information there is does not seem to show a significant shift from public to private payers. An analysis by Katherine Levit, an economist, and Cathy Cowan, a program analyst with the Health Care Financing Administration, said that throughout the 1980's, business and Government each paid about a third of health-care costs, with an equal share from patients.
Making the manufacturers' case, Terrell Womack, vice president for benefits at Champion International, the paper company based in Stamford, Conn., said that 15 to 25 percent of the "typical" $10,000 hospital tab paid by Champion could be traced to charges that the hospital had added to make up for money owed on other patients' bills.
"You're asking the manufacturing sectors of the economy, which is under intense international competition, to subsidize all these people who aren't providing health-care benefits," he said. "That's not good national policy. It's a type of hidden tax."
The manufacturers add that they have also been hit from another quarter -- by charges for their employees' spouses and other dependents, who often work in service industries or for smaller companies, where health benefits are often skimpy or nonexistent. Donald W. Moran, a vice president of Lewin/ICF, said 17 million employed people received health coverage from an employer other than their own.
Manufacturing companies, which often have strong unions and many older workers, typically offer excellent health coverage. Sharon Canner, an assistant vice president with the manufacturers' association, said 98 percent of the group's members helped pay for employees' medical care. "Manufacturing is by far the highest provider of benefits," she said.
Dr. Donald A. Young, executive director of the Prospective Payment Assessment Commission, a Government body that advises Congress on Medicare payments to hospitals, said the average hospital lost $3.2 million in 1989, the most recent year for which information is available. The losses included $1.4 million on charity cases, $1 million on Medicare, $745,000 on Medicaid and $33,000 on other underfinanced Government programs. The losses were handsomely assuaged by private payers, who were charged 128 percent of costs, plus nonoperating and "other" revenues, for a net average surplus for the hospital of $1.2 million, Dr. Young said.
But, he said, these numbers did not prove that the Government squeeze on hospitals had actually caused the increased charges to private payers. "The literature and other things suggest that hospitals would have charged more anyhow, to maximize revenues, even if Medicare and Medicaid were paying 100 percent of hospital costs," Dr. Young contended.
"We could argue that the Government is paying an appropriate amount, and the private sector is paying too much," Dr. Young said. "We are all bothered by the continued significant increases in hospital cost-producing services." Thus, he said, "continuing to put pressure on hospitals is the correct policy."
Not surprisingly, in view of their role as buyers of health care, large employers also do their share of pressing for hospital cost concessions. John Glaudemans, an assistant vice president for public policy issues at the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, noted that many large employers and their insurers were also squeezing hospitals by insisting on discounts; on outpatient treatment, which is less expensive, and on shorter hospital stays.

HEADLINE: Energy Companies to Curb Drilling

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: DALLAS, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Dismayed by low prices for oil and natural gas, many energy companies are concluding that it makes more sense to buy than to drill.
This finding -- from an annual survey by Salomon Brothers of the spending plans of 241 energy companies -- is more bad news for the battered oilfield services industry, the worst-performing sector of the stock market in 1991. 
 The survey found that 68 percent of the companies are looking to buy proven reserves, which suggests they will spend less on oilfield services as long as crude and natural-gas prices remain depressed, said James D. Crandell, a managing director and oil-services analyst at Salomon Brothers, who directed the survey.
"This really represents a sharp turnaround," Mr. Crandell said. A year ago, three of four energy companies were more committed to drilling than buying reserves.
"Even back in 1985 and '86, when oil was on its way to $10 a barrel, more companies thought the economics of drilling were more favorable than the economics of purchasing reserves," Mr. Crandell said.
Among leading indendepent producers, 71 percent said they wanted to buy reserves this year, he said, the highest level since the Salomon survey was started in 1982.
Over all, the money that worldwide energy companies intend to spend for finding and producing oil and natural gas will be little changed this year, rising by 1.3 percent, to $53.7 billion, from the $53.1 billion projected at the start of 1991.
 
Shift From North America
 But the amount of that budgeted for projects in North America is continuing to decline. Dozens of large companies, including virtually all global giants like Exxon, Mobil, Texaco and Chevron, as well as companies whose efforts used to be mainly in the United States, like Pennzoil, said they would spend more on projects outside North America.
The survey showed that 80 companies collectively planned to increase their budgets for foreign exploration and production by 9.1 percent over a year ago. Also, 157 companies plan to pare spending in the United States by a combined 10.7 percent from the level projected a year ago.
The decline in actual spending for domestic projects this year could be even lower, Mr. Crandell said. Budget projections made at the start of 1991 were cut during the year, as natural gas prices plunged to nearly $1 per 1,000 cubic feet in July and oil prices slumped below $20 a barrel after the end of the Persian Gulf war.
 
Fewer Exploring Rigs
 In turn, drilling activity plunged in the United States to an average weekly rig count for the year of 860, the lowest level since 1942. Many analysts expect a further decline, perhaps below an average of 750 rigs exploring for oil and gas, this year. The rig count for the first week of 1992 was 764, down from 1,108 the corresponding week a year ago, Baker Hughes Inc., the oilfield-services company in Houston, said Friday.
Oil executives as a group expect the average price for domestic crude to be $20.40 a barrel this year, down from their projection a year ago of $22.05, Mr. Crandell said. The February futures contract for domestic crude traded at $19.21 today on the New York Mercantile Exchange. The projection for average natural gas prices this year was $1.62 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Most companies said the surplus of natural gas would continue for the next few years. For that reason, twice as many companies plan to spend more money drilling for oil than for natural gas, Mr. Crandell said. And more companies will direct their drilling expenditures on trying to produce bigger quantities of oil and natural gas from proven fields than on searching for new ones.

Dollar Off on Speculation About Pact on Stronger Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar fell sharply against other major currencies yesterday as traders theorized that American and Japanese officials would push the currency lower to reduce the United States trade deficit.
Gold prices also fell, losing $1.10 on the Commodity Exchange in New York to close at $349.30 an ounce. The Republic National Bank later quoted a bid of $349.40, off $1.10. 
 The dollar began its slide overseas. Tokyo traders bid the dollar down after an unidentified Finance Ministry official was quoted as saying that the Japanese Government could accept the dollar falling below 124 yen.
The dollar slumped further on speculation that President Bush and Japanese officials meeting today would agree to allow the yen to rise further against the dollar.
A higher yen would help reduce Japan's trade surplus with the United States, which totaled $41 billion in 1990. American products are cheaper in Japan and Japanese goods more expensive in the United States when the yen moves higher and the dollar falls.
 
Dollar Falls in New York
 The dollar fell to 123.40 yen in New York, from 124.65 late Friday. In earlier London trading, the dollar was quoted at 124.05 yen.
In Tokyo overnight, the dollar fell 0.85 yen, to 124.40 yen, from its previous close there last Tuesday. Japanese currency markets were closed from Wednesday through Sunday for the New Year's holiday.
Analysts said the dollar also fell victim to profit taking after it rallied higher last week. With the United States economy still stumbling and fresh economic indicators out this week, many traders decided to take their profits while they could.
The British pound surged nearly 3 1/2 cents higher, to $1.8830, in New York trading, from $1.8485 on Friday. In London, sterling rose to $1.8785, from $1.8445 late Friday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with late Friday's prices, included: 1.51575 German marks, down from 1.5435; 1.3435 Swiss francs, down from 1.3730; 5.1730 French francs, down from 5.2675; 1,144.00 Italian lire, down from 1,165.00, and 1.14255 Canadian dollars, down from 1.14655.
Gold fell in London to a late bid of $348.50, from $352.00 late Friday. In Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $349.50, from $352.00 late Friday.
Earlier, in Hong Kong, gold fell $2.03 to close at $352.22.
Silver fell 0.4 cent and closed at $3.941 on the Comex. Silver also fell in London to a late bid of $3.92, from $3.98 late Friday.

HEADLINE: Careers;
Real Estate May Require New Skills

BYLINE: By Elizabeth M. Fowler

 BODY:
IN spite of a recession that has been devastating to real estate, good job opportunities may eventually appear in real estate, said Lynn K. Cherney, a managing director of Ferguson Partners Ltd., a Chicago consulting firm that specializes in advising the real estate industry.
A recent study by the firm documents many changes in the industry and calls for finding a new approach to educate people going into real estate by the year 2000. This education, the study says, should shift the emphasis away from finance and law in many real estate programs at the degree level of master of business administration. "For the study we talked to real estate executives around the country as well as professors of real estate at many universities," she said. 
 The pendulum has swung back toward the need for a broad general education, before training in the specifics.
Tomorrow's real estate leaders, the study found, must be capable of dealing with global issues, complex financing that might involve foreign currencies, environmental obstacles, a political process that moves slowly, and the ever-present requirement for more sophisticated marketing.
Formal undergraduate training should involve the liberal arts, foreign languages, communications skills, computer skills, along with marketing courses and knowledge gained on the job, the study showed. In addition, there should be graduate training in general management and finance.
The study indicates why the change is needed in educational focus. Real estate companies will be much larger, as evidenced by consolidations like the one that involved Coldwell Banker, acquired by Sears, Roebuck, which expanded further by acquiring Schlott, a large real estate firm in New Jersey.
Many of the enlarged real estate companies will have international operations and must be staffed with managers who can deal with broader operations. This will give the companies more stability during economic downturns.
"The bigger firms will provide more services such as development of projects and the management of the projects," she explained. She pointed out that many more real estate firms would be part of giant companies like Prudential Insurance and Equitable Life Assurance. Also, there will be more control of real estate companies in this country by foreign owners.
All this, Miss Cherney said, will lead to a new type of career opportunity in real estate.
Since the companies will have international divisions or possibly be owned by a foreign company, there will be a need for executives who are bilingual or multilingual and who understand how to deal with foreign culutres and foreign economic and political issues.
And since environmental problems will affect real estate even more in the future, the real estate executives of the year 2000 must understand issues like waste disposal, urban land use, recycling, waste, air and noise pollution, to mention some, as well as use of fuel sources like nuclear and solar energy.
In the realm of public affairs, the problems of today will be magnified by the year 2000 because of the growing population and accompanying urban sprawl. These problems include taxation, already a major issue, traffic congestion, new roads and public transit, municipal needs like additional water sources and more sewage plants.
Institutional investors with large amounts of pension fund money to invest will be reassessing their investment strategy in real esate companies and putting more focus on sound performing real estate assets.
This will put an emphasis on improved financial management of real estate firms and the need for their treasurers to have broader relationships with banks, pension funds, foreign investors and other capital sources.
At the same time, corporate real estate departments, Miss Cherney believes, will shrink as the big companies continue to slim down their managements. That indicates the need for more help and consultations with the outside real estate firms.
Miss Cherney points out that professors of real estate at various universities around the nation are well aware of these changes in the industry. "While other industries are looking for more specialized preparation for their field, real estate is bucking that trend, seeking managers who will have a well-rounded advanced education, she said."
She cited Peter T. Allen, an adjunct professor at the University of Michigan's graduate business school, who believes that a liberal arts background, customer experience, plus a graduate degree in an area like urban planning would be a good background for tomorrow's real estate executive.

Brits in High Places
It is the beginning of a new chapter in fashion history, and we don't mean Chapter 11. Liz Tilberis, the highly regarded editor of British Vogue, was named editor in chief of Harper's Bazaar magazine yesterday, ending months of speculation.
The new editor is soft-spoken, silver-haired and British. And she wears Chanel. (Note: With Anna Wintour at Vogue, this puts British editors at the top of two of America's most venerable fashion magazines.) 
 "I'm coming, but I'm not sure when," Ms. Tilberis said yesterday by telephone from London, where she lives with her husband and two children. "It's a question of sorting everything out."
D. Claeys Bahrenburg, the president of Hearst Magazines, which publishes Harper's Bazaar, confirmed yesterday that Ms. Tilberis would become editor in chief of the magazine, at a date to be announced later. The editors and staff of Harper's Bazaar have been in limbo for weeks, since the retirement announcement of the editor in chief, Anthony T. Mazzola, who has run the magazine since 1972.
"Everyone is terribly nervous," said a veteran Bazaar editor who insisted on anonymity. "In this economy nobody wants to be out of a job."
Mr. Mazzola is to stay at Hearst to edit a 125th-anniversary edition of Harper's Bazaar. His wife, Michele, who has been the special projects editor of the magazine, said she would probably join him, at least temporarily, in that project.
Ms. Tilberis, for her part, would not reveal what kind of makeover she planned for the magazine.
"It's a dark secret," she said. "I know exactly what I'm going to do, but I'm not telling anybody."
Ms. Tilberis, who is 44 years old, has been at British Vogue for her entire career, since winning the Vogue Talent Contest, an essay writing competition, in 1969. She is well known and well liked on Seventh Avenue, and was considered a protege of Ms. Wintour in England.
Ms. Tilberis served as fashion editor under Ms. Wintour at British Vogue in the mid-1980's. She became editor in chief in 1987.
"The more British editors, the better," Ms. Wintour said.
 
Armani Goes Shopping
 Giorgio Armani, whose A/X shop has been attracting crowds in SoHo, stopped off to do a little shopping of his own last week -- at Brooks Brothers, according to store executives.
The Italian designer, who recently revived the American sack suit popularized by Brooks, dropped about $2,300 in two visits to the Brooks Brothers store on Madison Avenue. He stocked up on shirts, braces and ties, proving that designers sometimes choose to buy something other than their own merchandise.
Brooks Brothers executives pointed out that soon Mr. Armani wouldn't need to fly to New York to purchase their goods: the store plans to begin selling its clothes in Italian specialty stores this year.

Nemchinov Finds Net, And Words

BYLINE: By FILIP BONDY

 BODY:
Sergei Nemchinov scored a goal, set up two others and then conducted his first postgame interview in English.
On a night when the humdrum Winnipeg Jets were at Madison Square Garden to absorb a methodical 4-2 licking by the Rangers, Nemchinov's stickhandling and linguistic grand slam provided the only real excitement in the house. 
 "In the Russian league I don't score as many goals, usually 20 goals in 44 games," the Ranger center said after considerable pause. "Here, there are smaller rinks, so there are more shots taken."
Nemchinov, a Muscovite who was drafted in the 12th round by the Rangers in 1990, scored his 20th goal of the season last night in the first period. His second-period assist represented his seventh point in four games.
There is an economy of motion, and words, here. Nemchinov went one-for-three again on his shots, continuing his league-leading shooting percentage of 33.3. He also continued to impress with his strong hands, his two-way hockey and his improving linguistic skills.
"I don't understand a thing he says," Coach Roger Neilson said. "But he understands everything, and his teammates seem to know what he's saying all the time.
"When I watched him play four games last year in Finland, I wrote in my report he was a good defensive player and that I thought he'd score 15 to 20 goals," Neilson said. "I guess I was talking about the first half of the season."
The Rangers built a three-goal lead last night in the first period, a formidable advantage not easily gained or lost against the meticulous Jets.
From then on, the game at Madison Square Garden served its homely purpose. The Rangers ground out a victory that again lifted them into a tie with Washington for first place in the Patrick Division standings, where victories continue to count two more points than esthetics.
The Jets, arguably the National Hockey League's most boring team, managed few dangerous shots at goaltender Mike Richter. The Rangers knocked them off their rhythm, and the Jets clearly did not battle back.
 
Three Quick Goals
 The game was decided early, on a flurry of three Ranger goals within an eight-minute period of the first period. First, James Patrick swept the puck from behind the Winnipeg net, into a crowd of players. From in front of the crease, John Ogrodnick poked the puck under Jet goaltender Bob Essensa for his 13th goal and a 1-0 lead at 4 minutes 48 seconds.
Essensa was screened on that play, but he had no such alibi on a standard slap shot by Ranger defenseman Jeff Beukeboom from straight on near the blue line. The puck went through Essensa's pads at 12:06, and the Rangers were clearly in control.
Nemchinov scored just 38 seconds later, fanning on a backhander as he skated by the crease on the right side, then flipping the puck high over Essensa from a nearly impossible angle for a 3-0 bulge.
"He's been an unbelievable surprise," Mark Messier said of his Russian teammate. "For a guy to come over here like that, with the culture and getting settled in, and to do everything so smoothly. He's a real leader in his own way.
"He's not able to talk a lot, but he plays, game in and out."
Messier might have been talking about himself -- high praise indeed.

 
 
SLAP SHOTS
 ALEKSEI KOVALEV, the Rangers' first-round draft choice from Moscow, was selected as the All-Star right wing at the world junior championships completed last weekend at Fussen, Germany. Kovalev had five goals and five assists in seven games, leading the Commonwealth of Independent States to the championship. . . . Ranger General Manager NEIL SMITH expects to bring Kovalev to New York by next season, and hasn't ruled out the outside possibility of Rangerizing the Russian in time for this spring's playoffs.

HEADLINE: Randy Warshaw Taking Next Step, at the Joyce

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
Randy Warshaw would seem to be in an enviable position. A former dancer with the popular and influential modern-dance choreographer Trisha Brown, he is now much in demand himself as a teacher of modern dance. He has a vibrant seven-member company of his own that has performed at some of the major dance theaters in New York City and in Europe, and is establishing a second home in Miami, where he grew up. And tonight, Mr. Warshaw and his company open the three-week Altogether Different festival at the Joyce Theater, where the choreographer will present four new dances.
But at the age of 32, Mr. Warshaw is also at a difficult point in his career. He does not fit into the categories of hot new choreographic Wunderkind or acknowledged older master. How do you sell a "middle-aged" choreographer? Without the resources to hire a manager, he must devote a large chunk of time to the business of dance, losing the time and energy to focus on and create the new work that will help him develop both his audiences and an individual voice. Paradoxically, too, there are fewer places in New York for him to perform. His company has grown beyond the intimate loft theaters that dot Manhattan, but it is not ready for larger, more formal theaters. All of which makes him just right for the Altogether Different festival. 
 Six other choreographers and their companies will present work in the festival: Mark Dendy tomorrow, Friday and Sunday; Elizabeth Streb, on Thursday and Jan. 17; Peter Pucci, on Saturday and Jan. 18, 19 and 22; Doug Varone next Tuesday and on Jan. 19 and 25; Sally Silvers on Jan. 15, 24 and 26, and Molissa Fenley, on Jan. 18, 21, 23, 25 and 26. (Mr. Warshaw's program will be repeated on Sunday and on Jan. 16.) Each has made a mark on the New York dance scene. But all are at midpoints in their careers, in hard economic times and in the post-dance boom era.
"I'm thankful the Joyce has stepped in," Mr. Warshaw said. "Here was this gorgeous space sitting in downtown Manhattan. It was an appropriate place to present choreographers at this point in their careers and they started doing it. This is a step out of the loft, but not a situation like the Brooklyn Academy of Music or City Center, which would just have been pretentious."
Mr. Warshaw found his way into dance almost accidentally. An athletic child, he was interested in studying dance in college, as his brother was doing. He enrolled in a class in contact improvisation, a highly physical form of improvisatory movement, and worked with Steve Paxton, a contact guru who had danced with Ms. Brown.
"I dropped everything else," he recalled. He left college after his junior year to dance with Ms. Brown. "I called my mother when I joined Trisha's company and said, 'Well, I guess I'm a dancer.' "
He was drawn by the "rich physical camaraderie" of Ms. Brown's company. "Moving to New York and studying and working with Trisha gave me a fantastic model," he said. "I saw someone in her mid to late 40's just hitting their stride." He was able to study the ways an experienced choreographer worked. And he began to realize that he wanted to create his own dances, leading him to withdraw from the company in 1987, after seven years.
"What I gained from working with Trisha was a sense that you could give shape choreographically to deep physicality without losing the inner spirit of it," Mr. Warshaw said. His first piece, created in 1985, was "Fragile Anchor," a work filled with swirling, slithery dance. "I was dealing with the tenuousness of things that seemed solid and grounded, and that in some sense continues to be a concern of mine."
 
Life's Thicket of Choices
 That first piece was longer than Mr. Warshaw's entire Joyce program of four dances, which is called "Fictions of Relationship" and explores "the fact that relationships are simply what we create," Mr. Warshaw said, "and that we have an infinite variety of choices.
"The dances start from sensations, vague suspicions, really intangible feelings. The intangible state of your nervous system. So the process of making work is a process of giving form to things inside of me that have no form. I remember very clearly the confusion of adolescence, when I thought that if only I could get everything out in front of me, I could put it on a table and organize it. I think I am still motivated by that desire to give form to something inside me so I can begin to come to terms with it. That is the art of communication, what we attempt to do with the people closest to us. I'm only looking for that satisfaction. I'm trying to become a better choreographer so I can do that in a more compelling way and perhaps with more consistency."
Mr. Warshaw is also trying for distillation in the shorter new pieces. "I've been reading a lot of short stories," he said. "One, by Joyce Carol Oates, was only a paragraph long. 'Fictions of Relationship' is also about exploring the shorter form. One of the things I thought about when I was trying to make sense of shortness was what I wanted to leave the viewer with, as opposed to how much time to take to develop things."
Over the past year, Mr. Warshaw has tried to focus on his creative work, which he felt was slipping away as the demands of running a company became greater. He has learned to be more open with his dancers about business matters, letting them choose to continue or quit rehearsals when money runs out or a grant is uncertain. He has also learned to ask them to help occasionally with company work -- guiltily, he said. "The dancers subsidize the company," he said. "They are the ones who go to work all night in restaurants after rehearsal.
"There are incredible pressures placed on choreographers today. You're a one-man band. That tends to isolate you. I used to hear Trisha talking about earlier times, when everyone knew everyone. But there are so many people working in dance now. The demands of the profession are hitting people earlier and earlier.
"The emphasis has been on the importance of each season. Your next season is determined by the success of this year's season. What a ridiculous demand to place on people who are just beginning to speak!"
For that is what, in the end, Mr. Warshaw considers to be his place in dance today. "I feel like I'm just starting. By working, you realize what it is you need to learn. It becomes more and more rich. I feel I've just barely gotten my feet on the ground." He smiled. "It's very frightening."

HEADLINE: Throwing Back Undersize Fish Is Said to Encourage Smaller Fry

BYLINE: By LINDSEY GRUSON

 BODY:
WHAT would happen to the human race if tall people were hunted down and killed en masse while short people lived and reproduced freely?
"Eventually I could play in the National Basketball Association," said Dr. James A. Bohnsack, a biologist with the National Marine Fisheries Service whose dream of dunking professionally was dashed by his 5-feet 6-inch stature. "What's now considered short would soon be tall." 
 That is exactly what is happening to fish, Dr. Bohnsack and other biologists say. Amateur anglers have long released puny fish and kept their bigger cousins for display over the mantle. But now, these biologists say, regulations are requiring commercial fishing operators to do the same thing on a grand scale. So the fittest fish -- that is, the fish most likely to pass on its genes -- now is the small fish.
This theory has led Dr. Bohnsack to propose protecting big fish and their genes by placing thousands of square miles of coastal waters off limits to fishing altogether, a radical revision of the country's marine conservation programs. The proposed reserves, encompassing perhaps 20 percent of all coastal waters, would serve as genetic refuges and seed banks for restocking nearby areas.
 
'We're in Trouble'
 Many biologists dismiss the idea that overfishing has caused rapid genetic changes. Nevertheless, Dr. Bohnsack's proposal has gained wide support from marine biologists. And there is a consensus that current marine conservation regulations, which rely on species' size, limited seasons and restrictions on fishing gear, have failed. The list of depopulated fish reads like a dictionary of coastal marine life. Some species like Atlantic herring and haddock show little evidence of recovery despite 15 years of conservation efforts.
"If we leave things the way they are, we're in trouble," said Dr. Greg Waugh, deputy executive director of the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council, which regulates Federal waters from Florida to North Carolina. "Just going with size limits and bag limits isn't sufficient."
In an accelerating spiral, the failure of one species often leads to the collapse of others. California's abalone industry, developed in the 19th century, relied after World War II on pink abalone. But as stocks were depleted, fishermen switched to red abalone, then to green and finally to black. A few years ago the entire industry failed. So the fishermen turned to sea urchins. Now that catch is threatened.
Coastal fisheries, the researchers argue, probably survived years of increasingly intense harvesting because they were maintained by natural refuges -- areas too deep and too remote to harvest. But these reserves were moved to the front lines by armies of fishermen equipped with sophisticated gear, including satellite navigation systems, sonar, refrigeration and powerful engines.
The catch has plummeted all along the country's coasts. Fish thrown back as Lilliputians just a few years ago now are considered Brobdingnagians of the deep. Researchers at the Southeast Fisheries Science Center in Beaufort, N.C., a division of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, say large Warsaw grouper and other marine giants disappeared with frightening speed after a party boat fleet began plying the waters off the Carolina coasts in 1972.
 
Red Snapper Decline
 "It used to be we'd hook one almost every trip," Dr. Gene Huntsman, leader of the laboratory's reef fish and coastal pelagic team, recalled in describing the 300-plus pounders that once dominated the area's waters. "We haven't seen one in years."
Between 1972 and 1985, he noted, the weight of most of the 275 species tracked by the team plunged about 75 percent on average: red porgies went from 2.6 pounds to 1.3 pounds, red snapper from 18.0 to 4.4, snowy grouper from 17.6 to 4.4, speckled hind from 19.1 to 6.6, scamp from 10.1 to 3.3 and gag from 18.0 to 4.4. Dr. Huntsman noted that the trend, which has continued, was similar if less dramatic for the commercial catch.
The commercial catch of red snapper in waters along the south Florida coast, once considered among the richest in the world, has also plummeted, dropping from 253,000 pounds in 1983 to 8,177 pounds in 1989, according to statistics compiled by the South Atlantic Fisheries Management Council, a Federal agency that regulates ocean waters from North Carolina to Florida. The decline for the entire Gulf of Mexico was only slightly less precipitous, falling from 14 million pounds in 1965 to 4.1 million pounds in 1985.
While many biologists note that evolutionary changes usually take hundreds of years, evidence is growing that fishing pressure compresses generations and can accelerate the rate of such change. One study concluded that Atlantic salmon spawned earlier after fewer than two decades of heavy fishing; another that the average size of chinook salmon declined by more than 50 percent in 60 years and that the average age of maturity dropped by about two years. "Nets stop the big ones while the little ones get through," Dr. Bohnsack said.
"The result is a race of miniatures."
More recently, a New Zealand study of three orange-roughy spawning sites in the Pacific found that heavy fishing had a significant genetic impact. More alarmingly, the study, published in the journal Fisheries Research last year, also concluded that the genetic impact could occur before the species was threatened by extinction.
But Dr. John Gold, a professor of genetics at Texas A & M University, said it was almost impossible to demonstrate empirically that excessive fishing caused genetic changes like a diminution in size. While the simplicity and logic of the theory makes it compelling, he noted that the supposed changes involved several genes whose individual effect was small, cumulative and independent.
"Bohnsack's head and heart are in the right place," said Dr. Gold, whose specialty is molecular genetics. "But the idea, although a good one, is very difficult to test."
Proponents acknowledge that marine reserves may at first increase pressure on stocks in the remaining open waters and economic hardship for nearby coastal communities. But the biologists note that tourism and scuba diving can help mitigate the loss of revenue and that, unlike bag and size limits, refuges are easy to police. The reserves' negative impact will be more than offset within a few years, they argue.
That, at least, is what happened in the Philippines, which in 1974 closed a 820-yard sliver of reef off Sumilon Island. Within two years, the mean harvest rate of 1.76 pounds per man day had tripled, according to a study cited by Dr. Gary E. Davis, a marine biologist with the United States National Park Service.
And after five years the sustained yield on adjacent areas had climbed to between 18.2 and 26.4 tons per square kilometer per year, among the highest reported for any coral reef in the world. Then poachers started invading the reserve. Within two years yields plummeted by 50 percent over the entire area, according to the study, published two years ago by the California Cooperative of Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, a consortium of marine institutions.
 
Improvement With Age
 The underlying reason for the success of the reserves, which have been set up in half a dozen countries around the world, is that most reef fish rarely venture far from their home bases. And while juvenile fish channel their energy into growing, adults are disproportionately fecund.
"Unlike humans, fish get bigger and better as they get older," Dr. Bohnsack said. "It's exponential." The gonads of a single 23.8-inch female red snapper, he noted, weigh as much as those of 212 females of 16.4 inches and produce as many eggs, about 9.3 million. "A few older organisms may be more important to total reproductive output than many younger ones," he noted in a recent paper delivered at a meeting of the Gulf and Caribbean Fisheries Institute.
So current conservation methods, which spare juveniles but allow the harvest of larger fish, are counterproductive, the biologists argue. And by shortening the average lifespan, they increase vulnerability to mismanagement and catastrophes. "What happens if you have a natural disaster that prevents reproduction for a while?" Dr. Waugh asked.
Dr. Bohnsack said he was greeted with ridicule when he first broached the idea of a network of marine preserves three years ago in a paper for the American Fisherman's Society. "When people first heard the idea, the visceral response was 'Are you out of your mind?' " he recalled. "But after thinking about it, looking at the problem, they realize it's the only thing that makes sense."
Increasingly, a consensus is forming in support of the idea among marine conservationists. Dr. Davis said researchers at a symposium on marine fisheries in San Antonio were surprised by suggestions that the idea needed more testing, even though there remains vigorous debate over reserves' preferred size and location.
"We need to take the bull by the horns and create some of those refuges," he said.

Let the Commercials Begin. And They Have.

BYLINE: By Richard Sandomir

 BODY:
The assault of the Olympic commercials has begun, as CBS pitches its February broadcast of the Winter Olympics from Albertville and NBC hawks its July 26-Aug. 9 pay-per-view cable package of the Summer Olympics from Barcelona, Spain.
The goals of both are divergent. The intent of CBS's "Share a Moment With the World" campaign is to remind viewers to tune in from Feb. 8-23 -- a conventional promotional strategy. 
 The aim of NBC's "Catch the Fire Behind the Flame" campaign is to educate the public about the first Olympics to appear both on network television and a pay-per-view basis and to sell packages ranging in price from $95 to $170 -- a difficult task made even worse by the recession and the novelty of the effort.
Thus far, CBS is executing its strategy more effectively, with a series of sophisticated, goose-bumpy spots like one that links viewers and the story of a young girl rising early to train for the Olympic dream and uses the line, "Remember, that's not just America's team out there. That's somebody's kid."
Or this one about a bobsled team, with a camera mounted on a speeding sled: "They are four who must function as one. For one breakneck minute, they will hurtle down a swerving tunnel of sheer ice. . . . They call it fun."
The series of spots, which include some that focus on an actual athletes, feature the soothing and authoritative voice of Fritz Weaver, the actor. An additional 15 spots are ready to come out of CBS's chute over the next few weeks.
CBS's job is easier than NBC's. Viewers don't have to pay to watch the 116 hours of Albertville coverage. They just have to be excited enough to resist the lure of the competing programs planned by ABC and NBC. CBS's main challenge is to instill the desire to watch despite the relative paucity of winter events and the anonymous status of most winter athletes.
NBC's Triplecast promotional strategy is different from CBS's and, so far, it hasn't looked quite as enticing. Yes, it is still in its early stages, six months away from the Barcelona Games, but it hasn't packed the impact one would expect from this joint venture between NBC and Cablevision.
The main idea of the Triplecast is choice. While NBC will broadcast 161 hours of Olympic programming on its normal broadcast network, the Triplecast offers three cable channels, with certain sports dedicated to each one running simultaneously and without commercials. Each channel will broadcast 12 hours of live events, which will then be repeated in the following 12 hours.
"If you could be the executive producer, would you choose to watch this great athlete, this one, this rider fulfill his dream, or a team sport like basketball?" asks one spot. Says another: "You can catch every punch, every stroke and every dash of the Olympics. You have the power to choose."
If the intent of the Triplecast promotion so far has been to get viewers to start abandoning the last-minute pay-per-view buying habits that characterize the purchase of boxing events, it needs the oomph that comes with swaddling them in the arms of a Jackie Joyner-Kersee.
But asking, "Would you choose to watch this great athlete?" obscures the strategy of letting the stars sell the product. The great athletes have names.
The campaign correctly, if deceptively, does not give the prices of the packages, giving the viewer the incentive to want to know more. So the spots ask that prospective buyers call an 800 number (1-800-OLYMPIC).
The Triplecast management's stated goal is to sign up at least 2 million viewers and as many as 3.5 million. Those are lofty hopes, particularly in light of the fact that the Triplecast will compete against NBC.
The biggest question of all is whether there are enough Olympic junkies willing to be guinea pigs for this pay-per-view experiment, or will 161 hours delivered the old-fashioned way, on NBC, be enough?
Right now, the commercial campaign, the engine of education and excitement, does not deliver a strong enough message for viewers to pull out their Visa cards.

 
 
AIRWAVES
 Some observations on the weekend's National Football League divisional playoff games: CBS's VERNE LUNDQUIST exercised creative word usage, saying that Redskin JUMPY GEATHERS had "put the forklift" on Falcons running back ERRIC PEGRAM and that Redskins' DANNY COPELAND "counterpunches to the 46" after an interception. . . . NBC's TODD CHRISTENSEN rightly ripped bad time management by the Oilers in the fourth quarter, including a timeout that gave the Broncos more time on their winning drive.
NBC's BILL WALSH gave his usual football clinic during the Chiefs-Bills game, hammering at the Chiefs' "stereotyped" run-run-pass offensive scheme, suggesting the Chiefs abandon caution and start the second half in the shotgun. . . . CBS's PAT SUMMERALL and JOHN MADDEN frolicked verbally during the Lions-Cowboys blowout and Madden scored with a comment on how difficult it had to be for quarterbacks to pass when both teams' helmets were silver-colored. Of course, Lions quarterback ERIK KRAMER didn't seem to notice.
Top shots of the weekend: Close-ups by NBC of the grimace on injured Chiefs quarterback STEVE DeBERG's face and by CBS of two fumbled snaps by Cowboys' quarterback TROY AIKMAN.

HEADLINE: On My Mind;
Presenting Hypocrisy Inc.

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
President Bush lands in Tokyo with 21 top American business executives and a full cargo of economic evasion, self-delusion, bombast and prefabricated "agreements" that cleverly avoid the realities of the problems between the United States and Japan.
 But that's all right -- it will be fair trade at its best. The Japanese will meet him with their own complete product line of economic hypocrisy, including that new and fast-growing specialty, contempt lightly camouflaged as compassion. 
 So the mission will leave the United States and Japan in exactly their present positions -- the Japanese using their skills, social strengths, history and every trick in the trade to remain powerful and growing, the Americans wasting their own rich talents and national heritage, looking up now and then for a good cry.
 The reason for the failure will be that neither the U.S. nor Japan talk candidly to each other or to their own people about the core reasons for the problems and what can be done to solve them.
 And, just as important, both sides do not acknowledge that not everything can be solved. Some problems between them are deep in national social contracts that neither intends to change -- so we might as well get on with the struggle where there is no way out.
 Experience, I keep learning, does not necessarily mean wisdom, but I did wind up my tour as a foreign correspondent in Japan knowing one thing about the Japanese mystery: There was none. The country, like every other, is scrutable, on its own terms.
 Japan is a social, political and economic whole -- a cartel if you don't like it, a cooperative community if you do. The Japanese have shown that within that sense of community they can argue, adapt and change. But government, business, politicians, the bureaucracy and the unions regard themselves as members of a national economics team, not adversaries.
 The idea that they are opponents to be separated by antitrust laws or conflict of interest concepts -- a basis of American society -- is to them foreign and foolish. Every day businessmen and government officials cooperate with each other -- Americans would call it conspire -- and against the outside world in ways that in the U.S. would put them all in jail.
 The contract is for loyalty up, loyalty down. Japanese unions have a way of staging work stoppages during lunch breaks. But their members know they will not wake up one morning to find out that 70,000 of them have been fired. Before that would happen, executives would resign, other companies would pitch in and the banks would come through with loans, on government orders.
 The Japanese are simply not going to change that system. It has made them one of the most prosperous countries on earth and, thanks to the U.S., all accomplished peacefully under parliamentary democracy.
 Americans would not like to be Japanese. The Japanese system does promote conformity, obsequiousness, rigidity. It suits neither American law nor American tradition. And let's never forget that it has been American history, law and culture that inspired the world and still does -- hardly the Japanese.
 But once our politicians recognize the differences between the countries instead of pretending there are really none, the U.S. can face reality. One essential is to examine our own laws and traditions, to see if some should be changed to permit more of the industry cooperation, combined research, shared capital investment and encouragement of savings that have helped Japan. We don't have to become Japanese; neither do we have to remain ostriches.
 Second step: In those defined cases where the U.S., calmly and patiently, decides that the Japanese system is being used deliberately against us we should calmly and patiently sock it to them.
 An American President should have the courage to say all that. Then he has to go one hard step further and say that what the whole world says about us is true. We spend too much, invest too little, allow our schools to be dominated by the limits of dullards. He should tell us that if we do not change we will wind up really deserving what the Japanese now just pretend to have for us -- compassion. And how would we like that?
 Then he can accomplish something in Tokyo, not before.

HEADLINE: Neither Party Offering a Good Economic Plan

 BODY:
To the Editor:
The failure of economists to expect much uplift to the economy from the Democratic Party plan to give middle-income families a tax cut of about $8 a week is easy to understand. People concerned about losing their jobs would be slow to spend the extra money, even if they noticed it in their paychecks. 
 Not so easy to understand is the absence of unanimous pessimism among economists about the Republican Party plan, with its orientation toward stimulating investment. Office buildings and shopping malls have been heavily overbuilt, the average age of automobiles is lower than it was five years ago, square feet of residential stock is historically high in relation to population, computer manufacturers are cutting prices. It is hard to see where capacities could be profitably expanded.
Since no program at all is better than a program that only serves to increase the deficit (and the onerous interest burden on it), a stalemate between the Democratic Congress and the White House might be the best attainable outcome for the next 12 months. Then a new administration, with four years in front of it, could undertake to stimulate the economy by increasing grants to state and local governments.
This money would be spent. Much of it would be investment spending in areas such as education and infrastructure, where additional investment is very clearly in the national interest. If and when there is another period of inflationary overheating, the deficit should be increased.
We are, after all, among the least heavily taxed among developed countries. This too is a reason for doubting that our salvation lies in reducing taxes.

HEADLINE: RATING FOR CREDIT OF NEW YORK STATE DOWNGRADED AGAIN

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Strongly censuring New York State's fiscal condition and the political paralysis in Albany, a major Wall Street credit agency today downgraded the rating on most of the state's debt, leaving New York with the second lowest rating of all states.
The new rating from Moody's Investors Service, which affects only the portion of the state's debt backed by annual legislative appropriations, is the lowest in the state's history and could mean that New York would have to pay higher interest rates when it borrows money in the future. The lower rating places New York in a tie with Louisiana for the nation's second lowest credit rating, ahead of only Massachusetts. 
 New York's credit rating has now been downgraded twice in less than two years. After being lowered from A1 to A by Moody's in June 1990, today's action, which lowered the state's rating to Baa1, left the state one step above the lowest investment-grade rating and two steps above the rating accorded many junk bonds.
 
Flurry of Finger-Pointing
 A statement released by Moody's late this afternoon attributed the downgrading to "the state's inability to exercise budgetary control and address the midyear deficit on a timely basis." The announcement set off a flurry of finger-pointing by the state's political leaders, with Democrats and Republicans blaming each other for failing to break a two-month impasse over closing the $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget.
The action by Moody's did not affect the state's general-obligation bonds, which continue to be rated A by Moody's. But the downgrading brought Moody's into line with the two-tiered rating system used by the other major credit rating agency, Standard & Poor's, which previously rated the state's general-obligation bonds higher than its appropriation-backed debt.
In what many state officials viewed as a last-chance warning, the Moody's statement said the agency would review the rating on New York's general-obligation bonds at a later date.
"We must act now to insure that we give the raters no cause to take this action again," Gov. Mario M. Cuomo said in a statement.
State budget officials and credit analysts said it was not immediately clear how much the downgrading might cost the state in its coming bond sales. Bonds with lower ratings are considered greater risks and their issuers usually have to pay higher interest rates to sell them.
The State Comptroller, Edward V. Regan, said last week that the state and its public authorities were planning to sell nearly $3 billion in bonds in the first quarter of 1992.
State budget officials said they were concerned not only that the downgrading would divert taxpayer money to debt service from needs like road building and health care but also that it would have long-lingering effects on market psychology.
Moody's lowered the credit rating on New York's appropriation-backed debt -- which is distinguished from the state's general-obligation debt -- after the vice president for state debt ratings at Moody's, George W. Leung, recommended the downgrading. The appropriation-backed debt currently accounts for about two-thirds of the state's debt and is its fastest-growing component.
Under the State Constitution, general-obligation bonds can only be issued with voter approval. They are backed by the full faith and credit of the state, meaning that bondholders have the first claim on each year's tax revenues.
Appropriation-backed debt, by contrast, does not require voter approval and is backed by annual appropriations passed by the Legislature. It includes the state's certificates of participation and debt issued by a host of state authorities, including the Dormitory Authority, the Urban Development Corporation and the Metropolitan Transportation Authority.
Because the servicing of appropriation-backed debt must compete for resources each year with the state's other fiscal demands, it is considered a less secure investment than general-obligation bonds.
Vladimir Stadnyk, a managing partner at Standard & Poor's, said his firm's decision on whether to downgrade the state's ratings would not be affected by the Moody's announcement. But, he said, "as far as the general-obligation rating, we continue to be concerned with the lack of action on the part of the state."
"As time dwindles by, the less comfortable we would be with the current rating," he said.
 
Trying to Break Logjam
 Officials with both Moody's and Standard & Poor's have been warning for weeks that the budget impasse in Albany could generate a downgrading. Mr. Cuomo has tried unsuccessfully to use their alarms as leverage to break the logjam.
But with the March 31 end of the fiscal year fast approaching, each passing day has left less cash in the state's treasury. That has narrowed the options for closing the $875 million gap without borrowing heavily, and credit raters have consistently criticized the growth of the state's accumulated deficit. It is now nearly $6.3 billion, up from $4 billion in 1983, when Mr. Cuomo took office.
The Moody's statement said the state's inability to solve its midyear budget problem "is a legacy of this year's delayed budget," which was passed a record 65 days after the start of the fiscal year. It said that budget compromises of recent years had "exhausted one-shot resources and marginal solutions" and it called for "fundamental" restructuring of the state's finances.
Mr. Cuomo and Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, both Queens Democrats, attributed the downgrading to what the Governor said was "the State Senate's failure to recognize the critical need to close the current-year deficit."
But the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, Republican of Oyster Bay, L.I., said the Moody's call for fundamental restructuring supported his call for deep cuts in the state's Medicaid and welfare budgets.

HEADLINE: As Bonn Talks Louder, Some in the U.S. Wince

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 6

 BODY:
United States policy makers concerned with eastern and western Europe say they have become disturbed during the last six months by what they regard as new assertiveness on the part of the German Government and its willingness to flex its muscles in international relations.
Some of these officials -- at the White House below the level of President Bush, and at the State Department below the level of Secretary James A. Baker 3d -- say they are worried about this issue. Their response for the time being is to discuss their feelings among themselves but not to convey them to the Germans. 
 The main cause of disquiet is Bonn's decision to push ahead in the Yugoslav crisis with separate recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, rebuffing pleas of the United States, the United Nations and other European governments to remain in the previous framework of European Community peace efforts. It was the most striking display of German assertiveness on foreign policy since German reunification in October 1990.
 
Joint European Effort
 The 12-member European Community's previous approach to Yugoslavia consisted of negotiations among the leaders of the six Yugoslav republics under the auspices of the community, augmented by the United Nations mission headed by Cyrus R. Vance seeking a general cease-fire and the deployment of peacekeeping troops.
But the German approach, started in the early autumn by Foreign Minister Hans-Dietrich Genscher, focused solely on diplomatic recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, both of which had declared their intention to secede from the Yugoslav federation last June.
While most of Germany's European Community colleagues opposed recognition throughout the fall, in December at a meeting in Brussels, Mr. Genscher's 11 fellow foreign ministers in the European Community bowed to his adamant insistence that they approve Germany's demand to proceed with early diplomatic recognition of the two breakaway republics, which is to take place formally on Jan. 15.
 
'Unilateral Action'
 Describing this, Der Spiegel, the newsmagazine, said "It was the first time since 1949 that Bonn took a unilateral action in foreign policy." The German Federal Republic was founded in that year.
A senior state Department official, who said he had been "uneasy" about the new German stance for the last six months, said, "I really am bothered about it, personally." He said that Germany's new assertiveness "is going to be difficult for us to stomach," and that, "There is no question that we have to take the Germans more seriously than they have been."
He and other Administration officials concerned with Germany said they were worried less about the fact of the German initiative on Yugoslavia than about "the strong-arm tactics," as one put it. A second official said he was disturbed by "the style -- that we are right and the rest of you should follow us" -- displayed by Mr. Genscher in the Brussels deliberations.
These officials say they are concerned that Germany, with its economic might and new tougher diplomatic tone, will become a dominant power in the new Europe, and perhaps beyond, that will not necessarily be in harmony with American policies.
 
'A Great Victory'
 These officials were also disturbed by Chancellor Kohl's statement, after the Brussels meeting, that the decision there was "a great victory for German foreign policy."
A State Department official official, noting that the chancellor used the German word "Sieg," for victory, commented, "Kohl may have proclaimed the first German Sieg since 1945."
After the word "Sieg" became associated with Nazi propaganda, including Hitler's repeated predictions of an "Endsieg," or final victory, right up until his suicide in April 1945, Germans in general and politicians in particular tended to shun proclamations of "victory" except in sports. In place of Sieg they employed the more anodyne expression, "Erfolg," which means "success."
Robert Gerald Livingston, a retired American diplomat who specialized in German affairs for the last four decades, remarked, "Speaking of 'Sieg' would bother me if it became a constant in German politics."
But Mr. Livingston, director of the American Institute for Contemporary German Studies at the Johns Hopkins University, said of the Kohl Government's assertiveness: "I think it is less muscle-flexing than the consequence of passion, even an obsession, for order. What they see in Eastern Europe and beyond is chaos and anarchy. It disturbs them on the political level and on the emotional level, the fear that unwashed and unwanted immigrants are going to pour in."
Administration officials contend that Bonn has also become more muscular on trade and financial issues, notably by sidestepping a United States request to help in persuading France to agree to reduce Europe's high agricultural subsidies and by raising German interest rates last month without regard to effects on Bonn's partners.
Several officials recalled that they had expected the tone in United States-German relations to be set by President Bush's invitation in a speech in May 1989 in Mainz to the Kohl Government to join "a partnership in leadership." That was less than six months before the fall of the Berlin wall.
 
'Partnership a la Carte'
 "We saw it as a matter of working side by side," one Administration official recalled. "The Germans have something else in mind, more a division of labor, a partnership a la carte." He noted that except for contributing to the costs of supporting the allied forces in the Gulf War, the Bonn Government stayed aloof.
The new Bonn stance is acknowledged somewhat gingerly by German officials, who talk of unified Germany, with its population of 78 million, as having "larger responsibilities." Those responsibilities clearly involve speaking out more forcefully when it appears that German interests are affected.
Thus when the United States sent a note to Germany and the other European Community members warning them against the consequences of early recognition of Croatia and Slovenia, Bonn officials complained sharply to American diplomats that they were being singled out for criticism.
The note went out over the signature of Deputy Secretary of State Lawrence S. Eagleburger, who said that selective, premature recognition could "lead to greater bloodshed" in Yugoslavia.
 
A Charge Is Rebutted
 Last month, reacting to press reports suggesting that Germany had been less than scrupulous in trying to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction, Jurgen Ruhfus, Ambassador to the United States, pointedly rejected the criticism in an Op-Ed article in The Washington Post. Such a public defense by a German diplomat would have been scarcely thinkable here a few years ago.
German diplomats, strongly defending their Government's actions in all fields, said this week that no one in the Administration had indicated concerns to them about either the style or the substance of Bonn Government actions in international affairs.
At home, the Kohl-Genscher approach to the Yugoslav crisis and other international issues has drawn considerable support in the German press, with the exception of the Suddeutsche Zeitung of Munich and Der Spiegel.
The newsmagazine reported recently that President Richard von Weizsacker also had misgivings about the Government policy toward Yugoslavia. In his New Year's address to the nation, Mr. von Weizsacker said there were "some concerns abroad about new German might," and he cautioned against seeking "a special role for us."
 Contrary to that report, Chancellor Kohl actually used the word "Erfolg" and not "Sieg." The Times should have checked the original text of Mr. Kohl's remarks, and not relied on a secondhand account of them.

CORRECTION-DATE: January 10, 1992, Friday

 CORRECTION:
An article on Tuesday about Germany's new assertiveness in its policy toward Croatia placed great stress on an assertion by an unidentified State Department official that Chancellor Helmut Kohl had used the German word "Sieg," instead of "Erfolg," to mean "success." As the article explained, the word "Sieg" has come to be associated with declarations of the Nazi Government.

HEADLINE: Dow Up 4.70 In Resuming Its Advance

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
After a one-day pause, the stock market resumed its daily record-setting yesterday, as investors, unable to find better returns elsewhere, continued to beat a path to equities. The Dow Jones industrial average rose 4.70 points, to 3,204.83, its seventh record in eight sessions.
Don Hays, director of investment strategy for Wheat, First Securities in Richmond, said he was amazed at the amount of money pouring out of bank certificates of deposit and money market funds that has found its way into this market. "There are people who have never invested in stocks before, sticking their toes in," he said. 
 Action on the New York Stock Exchange was choppy and the volume heavy, as 252.8 million shares were traded, up from 251.2 million on Monday. Gaining issues narrowly outpaced losers, 916 to 881.
 
Small Issues Lead the Way
 For the most part, lower interest rates and belief that the economy will recover continue to buoy the market, with smaller issues leading the march.
Other indexes achieving highs included the Nasdaq composite, which rose 4.39 points to close at 602.29, and the American Stock Exchange composite, up 2.44 points, to 401.71.
The Russell 2,000, another barometer of small stocks, also finished at a high of 195.77, up 1.40 points.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell short yesterday and slipped 0.56 point to end the session at 417.40.
While Monday's downside close on the Dow, its first since mid-December, and weak stock performances in the London and Japanese markets injected a note of caution at the beginning of yesterday's session, the stock market managed to erase its early losses by late morning.
For most of day the market gained, then lost, then gained again in a late flurry to carry it to new highs.
Mr. Hays called the market very fragmented. "If you were in the right stocks, you made money, but some stocks have already started their correction. Technical factors in the market tell us that we may have from a one-to-10-week correction taking place."
While there is indeed a lot of money coming in from small investors, Mr. Hays said there was another side to the coin. Many investors who made large profits last year and cashed in, large investors nervous over corporate earnings and a still-weak economy are pulling at the market from the other direction.
Analysts expect some investors to move to the sidelines ahead of economic news expected out later this week. On Thursday the December Producer Price Index figures will be released, and on Friday, employment numbers.
Elsewhere in the market, Dow Chemical, which fell in Monday trading after the Food and Drug Administration urged a moratorium on the use and shipments of silicone breast implants, rebounded smartly yesterday, moving up 2 3/4, to 54 5/8, as James H. Wilbur, an analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham, repeated a buy recommendation based on the stock's price decline following the F.D.A.'s announcement. Dow Chemical and Corning Inc. jointly own Dow Corning Wright, which makes implants.
 
Retailing Is Weak
 Among the actively traded issues was the Gap, which is one of the few retailers that analysts have recommended. The stock fell 2 1/4, to 56 3/4, and served as a reminder of the weakness in the retail sector, traders said.
DNA Plant Technology nearly doubled, rising 4, to 8 1/2, after it announced that its joint venture with Du Pont, Intermountain Canola, was producing a brand of canola oil with only 6 percent saturated fat. Cooking oils represent a $3 billion market.
Borland InternationalBORL.O fell 1 3/4, to 78 1/4, as Christopher Mortenson, an analyst at Alex. Brown & Sons, lowered his third- and fourth-quarter earnings estimates for the computer software products manufacturer. Traders, however, said he had reiterated his buy recommendation.
I.B.M., one of the bluest of the blue- chip issues, was up 2 1/4, to 94 5/8, yesterday. Many analysts noted that the stock had been overly beaten up at the end of last year, and that the price might have dropped low enough to become attractive.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Bristol-Myers's Drug Prices Are Cut for Health Programs

BYLINE: By MILT FREUDENHEIM

 BODY:
Acting at a time when Congressional drug-industry critics are demanding Government regulation of pharmaceutical prices, the Bristol-Myers Squibb Company announced yesterday that it was reducing its prices by $20 million to Federal programs for veterans, the military and the Public Health Service, and by $60 million for the Federal-state Medicaid program for the poor.
Bristol-Myers Squibb said it was the first drug company to make reductions for the Federal programs that were as low as, or lower than, rebates that all drug companies are now required to give to state-run Medicaid programs. 
 The announcement followed general pledges by Merck & Company and Pfizer Inc. to restrain drug price increases.
About 32 million people, including military dependents, are eligible under the veterans and military programs; 25 million under Medicaid, and 11.6 million in public health programs for American Indians and other medically underserved groups.
Analysts estimated that the company had about $290 million in Medicaid sales in 1991 and worldwide pharmaceutical sales of $5.8 billion. The company said it provided $55 million in Medicaid rebates last year, under the 1990 law requiring the cuts.
Bruce R. Ross, president of the Bristol-Myers Squibb U.S. Pharmaceutical Group, said, "The Federal Government has been and is our single largest customer in the United States." The company declined to disclose its total business in the Federal and state programs.
Mr. Ross noted that the new discounts and the prices of Bristol-Myers's newest drugs to treat AIDS, cholesterol levels and high blood pressure were determined amid growing anger over medical costs.
Uwe E. Reinhardt, a health economist at Princeton University, said that "the issue of drug prices becomes political because it hurts about one-third of the U.S. population," people who have to pay prices that have been rising at about double the general inflation rate.
Marc O. Mayer, a drug securities analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein, said the Bristol-Myers announcement was "basically an upfront concession" in an election year during a "tremendous buildup in political pressure" for price regulation.
 
 
Criticized in the Senate
 Bristol-Myers was criticized at a Senate hearing last year for charging a Federal purchasing program $75.64 for a three-week supply of its antipsychotic drug Prolixen. The company said yesterday that it was lowering the price of Prolixen to $44.85.
It said the price of Capoten, a heart and blood pressure treatment that is its largest-selling drug, would drop 11 percent, to $34.05 for a three-month supply, from $38.22, in the same Federal program.
Mr. Ross said the company had raised prices to some of these Federal programs last year when five-year contracts came up for renewal. The company was unable to say last night if the new cuts would cancel out the 1991 increases.
Congressional reaction was mixed. Senator Orrin G. Hatch, the Utah Republican who has urged drug companies to reduce prices voluntarily, said the Bristol-Myers announcement was "the first step" in that direction.
Representative Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, said he would not change his proposal to establish a "pool" of Government programs that would jointly demand price concessions. But Mr. Wyden added that "if other companies follow up on what Bristol-Myers Squibb is doing" with voluntary price reductions, "it might help hold off stronger governmental approaches and have a real impact on the national health debate."

HEADLINE: Hardships the Job Numbers Miss

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE

 BODY:
The United States unemployment rate is officially 6.8 percent today. But economists are now saying that this figure considerably underestimates the real number. They warn that the current unemployment figure, influential in gauging the nation's economic health and determining what policies should be adopted to improve it, provides a false sense of the economy's strength and its potential for rebounding.
The problem: changes in the work force over the last 15 years that are not accounted for in calculating the rate. One such change is the growing number of people on the edge of unemployment, counted as working but facing the hardships and insecurity of the jobless. These people, probably numbering more than three million, include many temporary and freelance workers, older men pushed into lower-paying jobs, consultants and single mothers who cannot work as many hours as they would like. 
 Workers like these often have no company-sponsored health insurance -- or even assurance from one day to the next that they will not be terminated. People in that predicament, though listed as employed, often behave as if they are not. They are afraid to buy a new home and hesitant to spend money on a new car, gifts or even dinner out and an evening at the movies.
The other important and growing category not captured by traditional employment data is an unknown number of people, perhaps more than a million, who have given up looking for a job or even admitting that they would like one. These include teen-agers, former factory workers and an unknown number of people unwilling to seek jobs that pay less than about $7 an hour. The monthly employment statistics, which will next be released on Friday, cover only people who have work or say they are actively hunting for it.
"It is quite clear that our employment statistics no longer fully explain what is going on out there," said Thomas Plewes, associate commissioner of the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics, which gathers the monthly employment data.
Only lately have policy makers begun to agree, recognizing as the recession drags on that a 6.8 percent unemployment rate -- mild by the standards of past recessions -- may be a misleading indicator of the economy's problems. Just last month, the Bush Administration, which had been forecasting a recovery by Christmas, acknowledged that Americans were suffering more hardship than the official data indicated and that the recession that began 18 months ago still gripped the nation.
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, took note of the shortcomings in the employment numbers during recent Congressional testimony. "Don't look at these data and say that everyone is in good shape," he said in reply to a question, "because clearly they are not."
The Bureau of Labor Statistics derives the nation's unemployment rate from a monthly Census Bureau survey of 65,000 representative American households. The department bases its unemployment rate on those who report, in effect, that they did not work during the week before the survey, but did hunt actively for a job. Such responses produced 8.5 million unemployed in November -- a 6.8 percent jobless rate that is well below the 10.8 percent rate in the 1981-82 recession.
But an examination of Labor Department data and interviews with labor economists suggest that the November number would probably have been more than 12 million, or nearly 10 percent of the labor force, if the definition of joblessness was broadened to include those who wanted jobs but were not job hunting and those who held jobs but nevertheless suffered the concerns usually associated with unemployment.
The Labor Department is beginning to consider changes that might broaden the concept of who is considered unemployed, although Mr. Plewes cautioned that gathering the additional information needed to make the rate more accurate would require more questions about Americans' behavior that might violate their privacy.
"More penetrating questions in the monthly employment surveys would yield different answers," said John T. Dunlop, a Harvard labor economist and Secretary of Labor in the Ford Administration.
 
A Matter of Classification
 That is evident from the way the bureau classifies the employed. The statistics, for example, listed 116.8 million people as holding jobs in November; that is, they met the bureau's criteria of having worked for pay in the week before the survey.
Such a blanket classification fails to capture the experiences of the proliferating number of Americans who work and draw pay but are carried on corporate rolls as freelancers, contract workers, consultants or temporaries.
Most of these people presumably show up in a subcategory of 12 million jobholders whom the bureau describes as temporary workers or self-employed. It is a substantial subcategory, one that has risen to 10 percent of the labor force from 8 percent in 1980. It covers the owner of a prosperous store or law firm. But the subcategory also covers the more precariously employed: the consultant, the freelancer, or the contract worker who hires out day-to-day as a clerk, engineer or gardener.
"There are probably more than five million freelancers and temps," said Mitchell Fromstein, chairman of Manpower Inc., which recruits and supplies such people at an hourly fee. "All the major corporations have them in what they call a supplemental work force," he said, "and the practice is growing."
Some freelancers prefer to work this way. But Mr. Fromstein said the majority wanted regular jobs and took temporary work because they could not get permanent employment. Among those who sign on with Manpower, a third acknowledge on their applications that they are hunting for a permanent job.
 Then there is the phenomenon of the part-time worker. Again, the Labor Department groups some jobholders as "part timers for economic reasons" -- people who tell the surveyors they would like to work full time, but can get only part-time hours. Their numbers jumped to 6.5 million last month, 5.2 percent of the work force, from 5 million in July 1990, at the start of the recession.
Clearly, these part timers suffer from partial unemployment, many economists say, and the Labor Department agrees, although this circumstance is not reflected in the national unemployment rate.
Neither is the hidden unemployment that exists among the 14.9 million people who were listed by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in November as working part time voluntarily. Most in fact do not want more hours. But while this group has not changed over the years as a percentage of the labor force (roughly 12 percent), the composition may have shifted to include more people who, in easier circumstances, would have sought full-time work.
Specifically, economists point to an unknown number of single mothers who tell the surveyors that they work part time and prefer it that way, but in fact need more money and would work more hours if they could afford child care.
A decade ago, the Labor Department's definitions of employment and unemployment worked much better. Then, layoffs occurred en masse among blue-collar workers in manufacturing whose union affiliations, benefits and wages of more than $12 an hour gave them a strong attachment to the work force. During the 1981-82 recession, 2.3 million such jobs disappeared, and the people who held them joined the ranks of the unemployed as they sought work to replace their middle-class wages -- or waited to be recalled.
The current recession also features blue-collar job losses: 824,000 in the first 16 months. But whereas a decade ago job losses among white-collar workers in retailing, insurance, banking and real estate were virtually nil, 570,000 such jobs have disappeared in the first 16 months of this recession.
These are the white-collar equivalent of factory workers -- sales clerks, computer operators, restaurant workers, office personnel. They are more likely than factory workers to slide from full-time to part-time work, or to leave the labor force altogether, and therefore not be counted as unemployed.
 
$7.12 an Hour for Clerks
 "If you are a sales clerk earning $7.12 an hour, which is the average in the retail industry today, you are not as attached to the labor force as an auto worker or a steelworker who is still earning more than $15 an hour on average," Mr. Plewes said. "With less at stake, you are more likely to drop out and stay home. Or avoid layoff by agreeing to work fewer hours, a common practice in retailing."
The downgrading phenomenon has spread beyond retailing, to factory workers who have given up hope of re-entering factories and now retrain for office jobs; to executives who have become self-employed consultants with sporadic incomes, and to commercial pilots who become painting contractors or open other small businesses.
Other trends also distort the employment data. A rising number of people have dropped out of the labor force who in another age would have described themselves as unemployed and job-hunting. Some are among the Labor Department's 1.2 million discouraged workers, a growing contingent of people who in many cases have been laid off and have stopped job-hunting on the ground that a suitable job is not available.
Others are women. For the first time since the 1960's, the flow of women into the job market has stopped rising and has begun to fall. Still others are men and women 16 to 20 years old, who in the past would have hunted actively for a job and listed themselves as unemployed until they found one, but now stay quietly at home or extend their schooling. In addition, there are men over 55, whose participation in the labor force has been falling for years.
 
Variety of Reasons
 The question in all of these cases is why these people have dropped out, lowering the potential unemployment rate.
Katherine Newman, a Columbia University anthropologist, points to the rising incidence of women who leave the labor force to rear children. Improved pension benefits have lured many men in their late 50's into a welcome retirement. And college enrollment is at record levels among young people who see long-term earning power tied to education.
But negative forces also play a role. Rather than commute long distances to another factory, some "discouraged" blue-collar workers stay home or live on their spouses' pay.
Buyouts and severance pay have pushed some men into retirement prematurely, idling them against their wishes, often with adequate incomes. Women have been heavily represented in retailing, banking, real estate, computers and other service jobs hit with layoffs in the last two years.
"There is a group among them who said, 'I am just going to cool it, outside the labor force, until things get better,' " said Mr. Plewes of the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

HEADLINE: Maxwell Official Sees Hope for U.S. Holdings

BYLINE: By GERALDINE FABRIKANT

 BODY:
David H. Shaffer, chairman of the publishing company Macmillan Inc. and managing director of its parent, Maxwell Communication, said in an interview yesterday that he had strong hopes that Maxwell's American-based assets would remain intact, despite the turmoil in the publishing empire of the late Robert Maxwell.
The Maxwell board, which filed for bankrutpcy court protection in the United States hoping to avoid a liquidiation of its main American-bassed assets -- Macmillan and the Official Airlines Guide -- saw most of its power transferred last week to a British-appointed administrator and an American examiner. 
 While the British system leads readily to liquidation in bankruptcy cases, the American system is more prone to reorganization; in this case, representatives of the two countries will negotiate the outcome. Thus, despite Mr. Shaffer's enthusiasm, the companies' fate is by no means clear.
 
Negotiating a Plan
 The administrator, Price Waterhouse, the accounting firm, must hammer out a reorganization plan with the consent of Mr. Shaffer and the examiner, Richard Gitlin, for submission to the bankruptcy court.
The team has 120 days from Dec. 16 to prepare a plan to present to creditors, which are a group of international banks that are owed about $2.4 billion. The plan will then be subject to their approval within 60 days, although a compromise is possible, as are deadline extensions.
One bankrutpcy expert not involved in the case said a plan could provide for some assets to be sold, with the creditors becoming owners of those that remain.
Yesterday, however, Mr. Shaffer listed a variety of reasons that he expected the company might be held together.
"The economy is going in the wrong direction," he said. With the values of media properties at a low, a fire sale of such properites would diminish the sale price, he said.
Also, "the structure has a low tax basis," he said, "so 35 percent of any gain would go to the Government."
 
Contribution to Income
 The American operations of Maxwell accounted for about 75 percent of its operating income of 200 million last year. During the 1991 fiscal year, when Mr. Maxwell was still alive, assets that accounted for about a third of the United States income of 150 million were sold, leaving the company with American businesses that generated 100 million, according to executives with knowledge of the company's finances.
Mr. Shaffer said Macmillan expected a decline this year, partly as a result of the soft advertising environment but also because of problems created by a breach of credibility with buyers of Maxwell products. He would not say just how great the drop was expected to be, but said it would come from the company's information businesses, rather than the publishing businesses.
Mr. Shaffer said that basically the company was in good shape and that Mr. Maxwell had not kept Macmillan from making necessary capital investments. He added that there were no plans for layoffs because the company was already relatively lean.

HEADLINE: Message to Albany: Baa1-Humbug

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
It is a symptom of the times that New York State's credit rating has become not only a financial benchmark but a significant political one as well.
In the last two years, the state's credit rating has twice been downgraded because of the inability of its leaders to balance the budget. In both cases, Wall Street rating agencies have made it clear that the dismal grades were given primarily for the state's political failure, not the sluggishness of its economy. 
 That was certainly so on Monday when Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating on the state's appropriation-backed debt from A to Baa1, the second-lowest rating of any state. In a three-page statement, Moody's dedicated only a fraction of a sentence to what it called "protracted weakness in the economy."
The rest of the statement focused on the state's failure to close its $875 million budget gap, the anticipated growth of the state's accumulated deficit, and the inability to restructure budget priorities in any fundamental way. All, it suggested, were failures of political will.
 
Partisan Blame Avoided
 What the rating agency avoided, both in its statement and in interviews, was the apportionment of blame to either the Republicans who control the State Senate or the Democrats who control the Assembly and sit in the governor's office.
"There's plenty of culpability," said George W. Leung, the vice president and managing director for state debt ratings at Moody's. "The issue of paralysis is what we're concerned about."
But what the state's politicians seem most concerned about, particularly in an election year, is how to shift the onus for the downgrading to the opposition. Indeed, some political leaders -- including the state Democratic chairman, John A. Marino, and the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., a Norwich Republican -- have suggested that the other party deliberately instigated the downgrading in order to use it later as a political club.
On the eve of his State of the State address, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo reiterated in a news conference today the argument he had made in the weeks leading to the downgrading.
 
Welfare Stereotype
 The Senate Republicans, he said, had deliberately refused to reach a budget compromise because they believe that their unbending insistence on deep cuts in welfare and Medicaid programs will help them in the November election.
Mr. Cuomo said that in demanding cuts in welfare grants and limits on Medicaid benefits for some welfare recipients, the Republicans were playing on the stereotype of welfare as a benefit to "a big minority swigging a can of beer who could work and says: 'No, I don't want to. I want to spend your money.' "
"I don't see any justification for that except you can sell it to people," Mr. Cuomo said. "You can con them."
The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, who is no relation to John A. Marino, responded that the Moody's statement made it clear that the raters were looking for structural reforms in the state budget, meaning cuts in social services that the Democrats are unwilling to make.
 
'Structural' vs. 'Silly'
 "They now openly taunt the raters by continuing to insist on a deficit plan that contains no structural reforms," Mr. Marino said in a statement.
Vincent Tese, the state's economic development commissioner, said that Mr. Marino's argument was "silly."
"The market and the raters know there are philosophical differences between the way Democrats view things and the way Republicans view things," he said. "But they expect you to be able to bridge that for the good of the state. What they want to see is a balanced budget."
Whoever is right, the cost of the downgrading to the state is undeniable. Although Mr. Cuomo said his budget analysts had not determined how much the downgrading would cost in extra interest on future bond sales, bond traders reported an immediate impact today on the state's appropriation-backed debt.
Several Wall Street traders said the yields on such bonds had risen today anywhere from 8 to 20 basis points, meaning that sellers suffered from declining bond prices. Duncan K. Smith, the senior managing director of Lebenthal & Company, said, however, that the full impact of the downgrading would not be known until the state sells a new bond issue.
Moody's intended its downgrading to spur the state into action, warning that the rating on the state's general obligation bonds would be threatened by a continued impasse. That downgrading would send an even more severe signal to the credit markets.
Instead, the paralysis deplored by Mr. Leung only seemed to deepen. Mr. Cuomo said today that he had finally given up hope of negotiating a multiyear financial plan aimed at closing both the $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget and the $4 billion gap projected for the fiscal year beginning on April 1.
The Senate Republicans said they continued to hold out hope for such a plan, even though Moody's said in its statement that "references to a 15-month plan are no longer realistic."
Mr. Cuomo also seemed to hold out little optimism for patching together a more traditional deficit reduction plan that would close this year's gap through spending cuts and other emergency measures. He said the state could eliminate about $400 million of this year's $875 million gap through spending freezes and other administrative actions, but that it would have to borrow to close the rest of the gap.
That would mark the fourth consecutive year that the state has had to borrow significantly to close an end-of-the-year deficit, a record that the credit raters have criticized loudly.

Cuomo addressed the state's credit rating at a news conference yesterday, saying that Senate Republicans' deliberate refusal to reach a budget compromise was caused by their unbending insistence on deep cuts in welfare and Medicaid programs, a stand that may help them in November.

HEADLINE: COMPANY NEWS;
Hartmarx Will Merge 2 Retail Units

BYLINE: By STEPHANIE STROM

 BODY:
The Hartmarx Corporation announced yesterday that it would merge the operations of two of its retail divisions in yet another effort to curb costs as the recession continues to chip away at its sales.
The manufacturer and retailer, based in Chicago, said it would combine its Hartmarx Specialty Stores Inc., the troubled parent of Wallach's, Baskin, Field Brothers and 26 others, with its Kuppenheimer Men's Clothiers, a discount chain. 
 The consolidation, Hartmarx said, would help it reduce expenses and costs by eliminating redundant functions. In addition, without doing away with the specialty stores, the combination places greater emphasis on a business that has greater appeal in hard times.
 
Layoffs Are Expected
 Harvey A. Weinberg, chairman and chief executive of Hartmarx, said a number of employees in Chicago and Dallas, where most of the operations for the specialty stores are based, would be laid off when the company merges the accounting, data processing and distibution operations of the two divisions, but that the total had not yet been determined.
The accounting and data processing operations will be based in Atlanta, where Kuppenheimer has its headquarters, and distribution for Kuppenheimer's merchandise will move to the company's distribution center in Columbus, Ohio.
"I started Dallas," Mr. Weinberg said in an interview. "I remember walking around in the mud when they were building the Dallas offices. This is very hard for all of us."
He said merchandising and marketing for the new combined unit, to be called the Hartmarx Retail Group, would remain distinct. Many of the company's specialty stores stock stylish tailored clothing, with an average price of about $500 for a man's suit, while Kuppenheimer's 162 stores sell private-label men's clothing for significantly less. Hartmarx makes most of the clothing sold in its stores, though more than 75 percent of that apparel is sold through other outlets.
 
Staying in Specialty Business
 Mr. Weinberg said the internal merger was not intended as a signal that Hartmarx intended to abandon the specialty store business. As a way of cutting costs, it has been closing about 100 unprofitable stores over the last two years, and a few analysts have suggested that it do away with the specialty stores business altogether.
"As a provider of real value, Kuppenheimer is at the moment a very important channel for us, a good growth channel," Mr. Weinberg said. "The specialty stores have been hurt by the recession and by the recession in men's clothing."
Josie Esquivel, an analyst at Shearson Lehman Brothers, said the consolidation would give the company "enormous" cost savings but was not a significant enough restructuring of the stores division.
"They've got to revitalize the stores, revitalize the assortment of merchandise," she said. "They've got to do something drastic -- Pow! -- because they've taken too long turning this thing around."
Ms. Esquivel said she was in the process of lowering her fourth-quarter earnings estimate, currently at a loss of 15 cents a share. She expects the company's earnings for its fiscal year ended Nov. 30, which should be announced sometime in February, to be down by at least $1.22 a share.
David R. McMahon, who was president and chief executive of Kuppenheimer, was named president of the new Hartmarx Retail Group. The company said John Eyler, chairman and chief executive of the specialty stores division, had resigned. Mr. Eyler could not be reached for comment yesterday.
"John made a great contribution to this company, but we really just needed one C.E.O., and we needed someone with an operational bent," Mr. Weinberg said.
Mr. McMahon, 54, gained praise for resuscitating and repositioning Kuppenheimer after Hartmarx bought it in 1983. Although its sales have declined, they have not dropped as markedly as sales in its specialty stores, which have eroded as the tailored men's wear business has dwindled.
When Hartmarx acquired Kuppenheimer it was a "pipe rack" men's apparel store, selling odd lots and manufacturers' overruns at bargain-basement prices. Hartmarx upgraded the product mix with clothes made in its factories and gave the sparsely fixtured stores some ambience. And when Sears, Roebuck & Company eliminated its tailored men's wear business about two years ago, Hartmarx persuaded it to open Kuppenheimer boutiques in its stores.
Mr. Weinberg said Hartmarx's retail stores had generally had a tough time in the holiday sales season, mostly because there were fewer selling days between Thanksgiving and Christmas. He said the company's Country Miss division, which sells women's apparel, was up slightly, but the specialty stores, Hartmarx's albatross in the current recession, were "down substantially." The company told analysts that sales in December plunged 16 percent at its specialty stores open at least a year.

Zale, Under Pressure, Revamps Management

BYLINE: By DIANA B. HENRIQUES

 BODY:
The Zale Corporation, a Dallas-based jewelry retailer whose creditors are seeking to force it into bankruptcy, has announced a new management arrangement aimed at making the troubled chain more responsive to its customers.
Irving R. Gerstein, the company's chairman, also said yesterday that Zale was meeting with its banks and bondholders "to discuss the company's business plans." Several large bondholders have already sought to force the company into bankruptcy court, but Zale has not yet indicated if it will seek to resist that process in court. 
 The new management structure calls for less centralized oversight and returns more autonomy to each of the company's four divisions, according to Dean Kehler of Argosy Group in New York, a small investment banking firm that is advising the company on its restructuring. "The arguments for doing this are that the division managers are closer to their customers," Mr. Kehler said. "That is especially important in a situation like this, where the target audiences are very different and the division identities need to be more distinct."
In addition to stores operated under the Zale name and catering to mid-market consumers, the parent company also operates the upscale Bailey, Banks & Biddle and Corrigans stores, through its Guild division, and the more modestly priced Gordon's chain.
Until now, the operation of those divisions has been largely centralized at the corporate level -- an arrangement that may have blurred the distinctions and hurt Zale's overall marketing effort, according to Randolph Lively, a senior vice president with the company and the new designated manager for the Guild division.
Under the new structure, the Zale division will be overseen by Joseph Keifer, who joined Zale in 1971 and was most recently in charge of store operations at the central staff level. Ed Jaben, who began his career at Gordon's and joined Zale when it acquired Gordon's in 1989, will return to familiar territory as general manager of that division. And Max Brown will continue to oversee Diamond Park Fine Jewelry, which operates leased space in department stores.
The jewelry chain, hurt by the recession and dismal Christmas sales, has already announced that it will close 400 of its 2,000 stores and lay off some 2,500 employees, or about 20 percent of its work force. It has also halted payments on its publicly traded bonds, part of its $850 million debt burden, and stopped paying suppliers and other creditors.

HEADLINE: Bank Funds and C.D.'s Fall

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
Yields on bank money market accounts and certificates of deposit continued to decline sharply in the week ended yesterday, according to The Bank Rate Monitor, a publication that watches interest rates.
The lowering of interest rates by the Federal Reserve to help spur the economy has hurt consumers who rely on income from savings accounts and other relatively safe investments. Banks are much slower to reduce interest they charge on loans and much faster in cutting the interest they offer depositors.
 
'Grim Picture'
 Robert K. Heady, publisher of The Monitor, said yesterday: "Unfortunately for the consumer, although bank yields are dropping like rocks, borrowing rates still remain stubbornly high. For example, the prime rate has come down two percentage points in the past four months, from 8.50 percent to 6.50 percent, and average certificate of deposit yields have fallen by more than one percentage point, to the 3 percent to 4 percent range. But personal loan rates have declined by only one-half of 1 percent. 
 "This grim picture," he added, "is not helping consumers to spend their way out of the recession as has been hoped."
In the last week, New York commercial banks reduced yields on money market accounts by an average 6 basis points, to 3.71 percent, while cutting the three-month certificate by 3 basis points, to 3.61 percent, and a six-month certificate by 2 basis points, to 3.69 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
Among the savings institutions, the reductions tended to be sharper, with money market accounts down 10 basis points, to 4.44 percent; a three-month certificate off 12 basis points, to 4.29 percent, and a six-month certificate down 14 basis points, to 4.44 percent.
For money market accounts, the steepest cut among area institutions was by Marine Midland, which lowered its rate by 56 basis points. First Nationwide dropped the yield on three-month certicates by 25 points, and it and Howard Savings Bank cut 25 points from their six-month certificate rates.
The Bank Rate Monitor said the average yields at 20 large banks outside the New York area also showed significant declines in savings products, with the average yield on a money market account and six-month certificate of deposit both down 13 basis points, to 3.88 percent and 3.98 percent, respectively.
By comparison, at the Treasury's weekly auction of three- and six-month bills, the average rate at auction was 3.85 percent and 3.86 percent, respectively.


GRAPHIC: Annual effective yields, in percent, on money market accounts, three-month certificates of deposit and six-month C.D.'s expected at selected institutions on Thursday, January 2, 1992. Some C.D. yields assume reinvestment after maturity. Yields are based on the method of compounding and the rate stated for the lowest minimum to open an account, but minimums may vary. Higher yields may be offered for larger deposits. C.D. figures are for fixed rates only.

HEADLINE: Market Place;
Junk-Bond and Mark Funds Excel

BYLINE: By LESLIE WAYNE

 BODY:
Last year was a strong one for bond funds, particularly for those invested in high-yield junk bonds. In the fourth quarter, however, the best-performing funds were those that invested in the Deutsche mark and in long-term domestic securities.
Figures compiled by Lipper Analytical Services showed that the year's top-performing bond funds had annual returns exceeding 60 percent. The best-performing fund was the Dean Witter High Yield Fund, with a 67.21 percent return, followed by the Liberty High Income Bond Fund, which returned 60.5 percent. 
 "Some of the high-yield funds actually did better than the average equity fund," said A. Michael Lipper, president of the rating firm.
Mr. Lipper said that high-yield funds benefited from lower interest rates, which allowed many issuers to refinance their balance sheets, and from the scarcity of new issues of junk debt, limiting the available supply and raising the prices of some bonds.
In the fourth quarter, a falling dollar and a rising mark pushed up returns on funds that were fully invested in the German currency. The top performer in the quarter was the Fidelity D-Mark Performance Portfolio, which had a quarterly return of 11.6 percent. It was followed by the Shearson Currency: D-Mark fund. Both of these are unmanaged funds based on indexes of German Treasury securities that acted as a surrogate for the Deutsche mark itself.
During the fourth quarter, the Bundesbank, Germany's central bank, raised interest rates when those in the United States were falling. That caused the dollar to fall relative to the Deutsche mark, pushing up the value of German currency funds.
But Deutsche mark funds were not the only ones to benefit from a falling dollar. Of the quarter's top 25 performers, 18 were world income funds, which were invested in single foreign currencies or baskets of foreign currencies.
On average, general taxable bond funds rose by 18.7 percent for the year and 4.84 percent for the quarter. Among tax-exempt securities, general municipal bond funds rose by 11.9 percent for the year and 3.36 percent for the quarter. By comparison, general equity funds, which invested in a broad range of stocks, rose by 35.57 percent for the year and 8.31 percent for the quarter.
In the fourth quarter, sharply falling American interest rates resulted in sharply rising bond prices, particularly benefiting funds that invested in long-term securities, which have greater price fluctations than securities with shorter maturities.
Over all, Mr. Lipper said, investors during the quarter earned more of their returns from changes in bond prices than from interest rate yields. Typically, the opposite is the case, with most of the returns in bond funds generally coming from coupon yields.
With prices of long-term bonds rising the most, target maturity funds, which invest in securities that mature far into the future, were strong performers. These funds as a group rose by 17.67 percent in the year and 6.65 percent in the quarter, rising in December alone, on average, by 7.33 percent.
Of the groups of bond funds, long-term funds were the second-best performers after high-yield funds and slightly outperformed world income funds.
In the municipal securities market, the most notable trend was a narrowing of the yield spread between tax-exempt securities and Treasuries. This trend began early in the year and continued as interest rates fell. On an after-tax basis, however, funds investing in tax-exempt securities, on average, still returned slightly more than those investing in Treasuries.
Mr. Lipper attributed the improved performance of municipal bonds to a general belief among investors that taxes will increase, particularly on the state level. Also, he said, there was an increased demand for these securities from investors whose certificates of deposits were maturing and who were unwilling to reinvest in certificates at their current low rates.
Mark Durbiano, portfolio manager of the Pittsburgh-based Liberty High Income Bond Fund, attributed the performance of his $170 million fund, which came in second among all funds for the year, to being "in the right asset at the right time."
He said he doubted that he could duplicate the 60.5 percent his fund returned in 1991, but that he believed there was "still money to be made" in junk securities. He expects that in 1992, investors disatisfied with low coupon rates will begin to put more money into high-yield funds.
In fact, Mr. Durbiano continued, in the last three to four years, he has seen the high-yield bond market begin to trade more like the equity market, with prices rising and falling because of factors other than simply interest rates.
Judy Pagliuca, manager of the Fidelity D-Mark Performance Portfolio, the top performer for the quarter with an 11.6 percent return, said that the $22 million fund's strong performance reflected the "wide interest rate difference between the U.S. and Germany, particularly in December."
Ms. Pagliuca said that the market would probably continue to focus on this difference unless there were indications that the German economy was beginning to fall or that the American economy had bottomed out, which would mean that domestic rates should begin to rise again. If either happens, Ms. Pagliuca said, she would advise clients to move out of her fund.

HEADLINE: Ratings Are Cut on $100 Billion of G.M. and Chrysler Debt

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Just a day after Detroit's auto makers reported their worst sales year since 1983, Wall Street debt-rating agencies downgraded nearly $100 billion of General Motors and Chrysler debt.
Moody's Investors Service said yesterday that it had cut the rating on $75 billion of borrowings by the General Motors Corporation, the world's largest car maker, from A1, its fourth-highest rating, to A2, its fifth-highest. 
 The Standard & Poor's Corporation cut ratings on $20 billion of Chrysler Corporation debt, moving the nation's No. 3 auto maker even deeper into junk-bond territory. It is the only Big Three auto maker with bonds rated below investment grade.
The auto makers reported on Monday that total sales of cars and trucks fell 11.2 percent last year, to about 12.3 million units. General Motors, Chrysler and the Ford Motor Company are expected to post more than $6 billion in operating losses for 1991.
The ratings agencies essentially said that investing in the auto makers was now more risky than in the past because of the effects of the severe slump on the companies' finances.
The move, serving as a gentle warning to investors, could raise borrowing costs for the auto makers.
G.M.'s stock dropped 50 cents a share, to $33, on the New York Stock Exchange; Chrysler closed at $13.125, also off 50 cents.
Chrysler said it was "extremely disappointed" by the downgrading. G.M. officials were not immediately available for comment.
But Chrysler's president, Robert Lutz, said the move would have no effect on the auto maker's operations or financial standing. "It's a relatively minor change that's of no financial or operational significance," Mr. Lutz told reporters at the Detroit Auto Show. "Going from BB-minus to B-plus doesn't mean we're crossing a horrible threshold."
The action provides little solace to the Big Three, whose top executives are currently visiting Japan with President Bush to push for measures to open the Japanese market.
The ratings agencies painted a bleak picture for Detroit, even as the auto makers lay off thousands of workers, close plants and struggle to reshape their business in the face of a competitive onslaught.
Moody's said its downgrade of G.M. was based on its "belief that G.M.'s long-term competitive position may continue to weaken." The ratings agency also said it expected the recession in the North American auto industry to be deeper and more protracted than previously thought.
Standard & Poor's said, "More difficult than anticipated automotive market conditions or lack of success with new products could cause further erosion in credit quality at Chrysler and Chrysler Financial within the next two years."

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
President of MBIA Adds Duties of Chief

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
MBIA Inc., the leading insurer of municipal securities, said yesterday that its president, David H. Elliott, had been named the chief executive. Mr. Elliott, who is 50 years old, will remain as president. He is also president of the MBIA Corporation, the operating subsidiary.
He succeeds William O. Bailey, 65, who has served as chairman and chief executive since MBIA was formed in 1986 and who will continue as chairman. 
 The deterioration in the financial condition of state and local governments across the country has been a boon for MBIA and other insurers of tax-exempt municipal bonds, and Mr. Elliott and Wall Street analysts said they expect the trend to continue.
"Several things are going on," Mr. Elliott said in a telephone interview from MBIA's headquarters in Armonk, N.Y.
"First, the municipal bond market is growing," Mr. Elliott said. "New-issue volume was up 26 percent last year, and with the gigantic infrastructure needs facing the country, that is likely to continue."
In addition, since the 1986 tax act the municipal bond market has become dominated by individual investors, Mr. Elliott noted, "and it is individuals who demand the protection offered by insurance."
"We guarantee principal and interest payments," he said. "For a small sacrifice in yield, it is a good bargain."
Typically, yields on AAA-rated insured municipal bonds are about 15 to 20 basis points, or hundredths of a percentage point, lower than on uninsured municipal securities, Mr. Elliott said.
The risks to the company's bright outlook are minimal, analysts said.
"The big downside risk is that if the economy does not recover and we go into a prolonged recessionary period, there might be some municipal defaults," said Michael A. Smith, a first vice president at Lehman Brothers.
"But MBIA has built-in strengths to counteract that. We recommend the stock to investors and are looking for earnings growth of 12 percent to 15 percent over the next few years," Mr. Smith said.
A graduate of Yale and the Boston University Law School, Mr. Elliott began his career in the insurance industry in 1969 with the Aetna Life and Casualty Company, where he held a number of different posts in a 17-year stint.
When he left Aetna to join MBIA, Mr. Elliott was vice president of the financial guarantee department, a post he had held since 1983.
Mr. Elliott, who is married with three children, lives in South Salem, N.Y.

Dollar Is Generally Lower, But Is Mixed Against Yen

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar settled lower against most leading currencies yesterday, but its performance against the Japanese yen was split ahead of today's meeting between President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa.
In Tokyo, the dollar fell 1.40 yen to close at 123 yen. Later, in London, it was quoted at 124.35 yen. But in New York, the dollar settled at 123.95 yen, up from 123.40 yen on Monday. 
 Gold prices were narrowly mixed. On the New York Commodity Exchange, gold bullion for current delivery settled at $349.50 an ounce, up 20 cents from Monday. The Republic National Bank said gold gained 10 cents an ounce to a late bid price of $349.40. Gold rose more strongly in London to a late bid price of $349.70 an ounce, from $348.50 late Monday, but in Zurich, it fell to a closing bid of $349.40, from $349.50. Earlier in Hong Kong, gold fell $1.41 to close at a bid of $350.81.
The dollar declined in overseas trading, then seesawed when activity shifted to domestic markets. But a late flurry of selling pushed the dollar lower against all leading currencies except the yen.
"People are concerned that the U.S. is seeking a lower dollar to help boost exports" and make foreign goods more expensive to American consumers, said Marc Chandler, an analyst with IDEA, an advisory firm.
A lower dollar makes United States products cheaper for foreigners and foreign goods more expensive for Americans.
Randolph Donney, director of research at Pegasus Econometric Group in Hoboken, N.J., said traders were concerned that Mr. Bush and his entourage of American business executives might try to "turn up the heat on Japan" to depress the dollar.
"It's time to sit back and wait a bit on the yen until after the meetings" between the leaders, Mr. Donney said.
In London, the British pound fell to $1.8720, from $1.8785 late Monday, but in New York it rose to $1.8855, from $1.8830 on Monday.
Other late dollar rates in New York, compared with the late Monday rates, included: 1.5070 German marks, down from 1.5158; 1.3390 Swiss francs, down from 1.3435; 5.1435 French francs, down from 5.1730; 1,139.00 Italian lire, down from 1,144.00, and 1.1427 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1426.

Condo Auctions: Who Really Wins

BYLINE: By Peter Passell

 BODY:
SEARCHING for that ultimate bargain in the depressed market for condos? Chances are you may have been tempted by the auction extravaganzas, in which dozens of apartments in half-empty developments are offered to the highest bidders.
But the temptation, suggest Orley Ashenfelter of Princeton and David Genesove of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, is probably worth resisting. For the only real winners seem to be buyers who wait until the auction is completed, and then scavenge the remains. 
 In a paper presented last week at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in New Orleans, the two economists analyzed the results of the auction of 83 units in a New Jersey apartment complex. They were looking for -- and found -- evidence of what economic theorists call a price anomaly. Buyers early in the auction paid considerably more for equivalent apartments than those who waited until late in the day.
But to their surprise, they discovered that the auction also failed to define a true market price: The best deals by far were made in private negotiations after the auction was over.
Auctions interest economists because they can provide insights into the nuts-and-bolts workings of larger, more anonymous markets for everything from currencies to common stocks. Professor Ashenfelter, a wine buff who writes a newsletter on the economics of the wine market, has been struck by seemingly irrational behavior of bidders at wine auctions. When identical cases of wine are sold in a single auction, he noted, the ones sold first generally fetched higher prices.
Wine auctioneers are apparently aware of the phenomenon, he says, and generally take care to package wines in lots that are not precisely identical. Otherwise, bidders would catch on and avoid the early lots, driving down the total proceeds from the auction.
Professor Ashenfelter wondered whether this price anomaly was at work in the market for housing. He and Professor Genesove used a condo auction that took place in April 1990 in Princeton to find out.
Prices in the early sales were indeed higher: On average, the winning bid on units from the same line fell by about a quarter of a percent in each sequential sale. But the way this (and most other) condo auctions are structured forced the economists to look further to see whether the decline was really the result of a price anomaly.
Under the auction rules, all the units in a specific line were put up for bids together. The first winner got his pick of any of 30 apartments; the next winner chose among the remaining 29, and so forth. Thus the observed decline in winning bids might also be due to quality differences -- some, for example, were on higher floors while some had better views.
So the economists assigned an assistant to check local records for resales of apartments that had been purchased at the auction as investments. These secondary sales, they figured, would provide a statistical benchmark for separating price differences associated with quality differences from any anomaly caused solely by the order of the auction sale.
This task proved easier than expected. It seems that 37 percent of the auction sales fell through -- buyers got cold feet, or could not come up with the financing. And these apartments were all quickly resold by the developer at negotiated prices.
Matching first and second selling prices, the two economists found that no more than a quarter of the price decline observed during the auction was related to lesser quality; when it was sold during the auction remained important.
Thus the bizarre and not easily explained price anomaly effect holds for $100,000 condos as much as it does for $30 vintage Bordeaux. What really flummoxed Professor Ashenfelter, though, was the dramatic decline in condo prices after the auction was finished.
The intuitive appeal of a condo auction (apart from the irrational hope of getting something for nothing) is that the open bidding will provide a realistic sense of what the real estate is worth in the market. But this auction -- and, Professor Ashenfelter suspects, most condo auctions -- did anything but: By waiting a few days, buyers could have had the same units for an average of 13 percent less.
The economists conclude that condo auctions may be suckers' bait. But they do offer a fail-safe way to even the odds, a strategy that takes advantage of the fact that most states give buyers of real estate a grace period in which to back out. "The optimal strategy for a bidder," they write, "would have been to tie up a condominium with a high bid, and then renege on its sale and renegotiate a lower price."
The alternative, of course, is to buy the old-fashioned way -- through face-to-face negotiation.

HEADLINE: Helping to Mate 2 Arts That Seemed as One

BYLINE: By JENNIFER DUNNING

 BODY:
John Duffy has two favorite stories. Each has a great deal to say about Meet the Composer, which Mr. Duffy helped found in 1974 and which he now directs, and the Composer-Choreographer Collaboration Project, one of the organization's most popular programs.
The first story is about a little boy who stood up at a session in which a composer discussed his work with schoolchildren. When had the composer been born? the child asked. "And when did he die?" The second anecdote comes from a newspaper interview in which the composer Aaron Copland was asked why he never created dance music after "Appalachian Spring," the score for Martha Graham's work of the same name. No one had asked him, the composer answered. "That was kind of a jolt," Mr. Duffy said. 
 One of Meet the Composer's most important missions is to convince the general population that composers are not creatures from another world who necessarily lived and died a century or so ago. Another aim is to help living American composers find outlets for their music. Coincidentally, a third, to help composers and choreographers find each other and work together through the collaboration project, does both.
The success stories Mr. Duffy cites include recent collaborations between Eiko and Koma and the composer Robert Mirabal, Susan Marshall and Pauline Oliveiros, David Gordon and Philip Glass, and Peter Martins and Charles Wuorinen.
 
Search for Quality
 "This program grew out of my sense that the quality of music for dance had become very paltry," Mr. Duffy, a composer who has created scores for dance and theater, said the other day. "When I thought back to the fact that we live in a century when great orchestral collaborations came from works for dance. Works by Stravinsky, Shostakovich radiated in the dance world, then were transferred to the concert stage. And suddenly we were just getting drum machines."
The three-year-old project offers grants, generally $15,000 to $50,000, to be shared equally by choreographer and composer. "We had to fight for that," Mr. Duffy recalled. A representative of one major source of money for dance balked at that. "He felt there might be an economic eruption. We were warned that choreographers didn't make as much as composers, and that dancers did it for love. The fact is that dancers and choreographers have in a sense accepted that. But of course it turned out that choreographers loved to get paid.
"One of the things about Meet the Composers is that we wanted to focus just on fees and income and leave the esthetics to the individual. Even some of the most eminent choreographers who've gotten grants through our program are quite amazed to get a check for $25,000 when they're used to doing something for $3,000. They've been subsidizing their work for a long time."
The organization, which has a $3.3 million budget and is supported by the government, foundations and private sources, gets about 80 to 90 applications a year for the project. It commissions about 20 works, the number depending on the scope of the collaborations, which are selected by a panel of staff members, choreographers, composers and producers after scrutiny of videotapes and audiotapes submitted by the applicants.
"The application comes from the dance company," Mr. Duffy said. "We don't match composers and choreographers. People generally know the composer they want. And as long as they are professionals, we make no judgments. The criteria are first of all inventiveness, and professionalism. And the composers and choreographers have to be equal partners, the composers creating work that is as strong and filled with imagination and consummate craft as the choreographers'."
Money goes to ballet, modern dance, ethnic, jazz and tap projects, to be created by choreographers whom Mr. Duffy describes as "well-known, in mid-career or just starting out." Choreographers and companies who need information about contemporary music are eligible for small "pre-commissioning awards" to explore the field.
Meet the Composer is also a clearing house for information on choreographers and composers. "Choreographers call us for advice," Mr. Duffy said. "I tell them: 'Here is where you can hear music, pick up records, go to a music festival. The best thing is to listen to the music and get in touch with a composer who moves you.' There are many realms to music."
Plans are being studied for establishing library centers throughout the country, possibly run by the eight national affiliates. The libraries would make tapes and background information available to those seeking collaborators.
Through the project, Mr. Duffy said, composers get new audiences for their music, as well as income. The scorn traditionally expressed by musicians toward music created for dance has become pretty much a thing of the past, Mr. Duffy said. "And the other thing about dance," he said, "is that you get to know people like choreographers and lighting designers and you get excited. You carry that back to your studio and you're fired by it."

Loss of a Job Summons The Specter of Poverty

BYLINE: By WALTER GOODMAN

 BODY:
Tonight Bill Moyers focuses on people who do not have the luxury of seeing the big picture when it comes to global economics. For these workers in Milwaukee, the flight of factories to other countries has meant unemployment or jobs that do not pay enough to support a family. "Minimum Wages," at 9 on Channels 13 and 49, captures anxieties that are spreading across America.
This sober report notes that although 85,000 manufacturing jobs have been lost in Milwaukee in the last few years, the city's unemployment rate remains relatively low. But the sorts of jobs available do not pay enough to keep up installments on the house or the car or to plan ahead. Since many of them do not offer health benefits, a serious illness can be devastating. 
 "Minimum wage will not pay the bills," says a 38-year-old industrial worker who lost his job two years ago when Briggs & Stratton, Milwaukee's biggest employer, moved a factory to Mexico, where workers make in a day what American workers make in an hour. Steve was reduced to being a security guard, at $4.50 an hour and no benefits.
The other stories are cast from the same die. After a year of unemployment, Tony and Terry, parents of three young children, are in danger of losing their house. Mr. Moyers observes that they represent the "first generation of Americans expected to do worse than their parents." The camera catches the emotional as well as the financial strains as unemployment stretches on.
All these people are struggling against going on welfare. "I could not stand on that line," says one man. "I said this is not me; this is not me." Terry is embarrassed about having to accept donated food. But what a company executive interviewed here calls "the realities of the marketplace" are forcing many onto the dole. Even workers who have managed to get into a retraining course at a local technical school face a shrinking job market with shrinking wages.
As usual, black workers have been the hardest hit, but the interviews make plain that white-collar workers are being battered along with those they once supervised. A middle manager who has been out of work for eight months, although he is ready to accept a fraction of his former salary, remarks wryly, "The only thing I could recommend is going into top management."
Except for an unexceptionable wind-up statement or two -- "Our society requires the simple justice that rewards hard work" -- Mr. Moyers sensibly resists sermonizing this time around. The hour, filled with the clouded faces and cloudy prospects of people who want only to earn enough, as Terry says, to "get in the car, go grocery shopping and have a normal life again," speaks for itself.
Along with other television reports, "Minimum Wages" adds to the pressure on the Administration to act on a condition that it has been reluctant to acknowledge.

The Bill of Rights, Stretching and Growing

BYLINE: By HERBERT MITGANG

 BODY:

A People's Charter
The Pursuit of Rights in America
By James MacGregor Burns
and Stewart Burns
577 pages. Alfred A. Knopf. $30.
In a majestic chronicle that covers history, political science and the philosophy behind the social contract between citizen and government, "A People's Charter" celebrates and extends the Bill of Rights toward the dawn of the next century. It's a bold and path-breaking book that brings the first 10 Amendments down to earth and, at the same time, reaches for the moon in its idealism. 
 The authors, a father and son -- James MacGregor Burns, political scientist, historian and professor emeritus of government at Williams College, and Stewart Burns, social historian and associate editor of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Papers at Stanford University -- subtitle their book "The Pursuit of Rights in America." If they had their way with American and world leaders, that brilliant Jeffersonian phrase in the Declaration -- "the pursuit of happiness" -- would come closer to reality for people everywhere.
After declaring the people's historic rights to life and liberty, Jefferson substituted the word happiness for the traditional word property. "But happiness was not for Jefferson merely some kind of pleasant sensation," the authors write. "Rather this further end of mankind was grounded solidly in people's daily lives and welfare."
This dramatically written book unearths facts to advance a liberal-rights agenda. Jefferson had advised young American friends traveling in Europe to do what he had done while serving as Minister to France: visit the homes of laborers, see what they eat, how they are clothed, if they are overworked, whether the Government or their employers take an unjust proportion of their labor, how much property they are allowed to keep for themselves, and if they are allowed to exercise personal liberty.
Building on Jefferson's interests and principles as a "philosophical radical," the authors follow a straight course to Lincoln's Emancipation Proclamation and the three reconstruction amendments (ending slavery, granting the right to vote and due process of law for all citizens). They proceed to President Franklin D. Roosevelt, who created the New Deal revolution. During his third term, Roosevelt proposed an economic Bill of Rights to give "security and prosperity" to all, "regardless of station, race or creed."
President Roosevelt's "second Bill of Rights" ranged beyond anything conceived by the framers of the Declaration. Among these desired "rights" were remunerative jobs; food, clothing and recreation; a decent financial return for farmers; freedom for businessmen from unfair competition and monopolies; decent homes; adequate medical care; economic protection in case of unemployment or old age; good education.
The authors comment: "In 15 minutes Franklin Roosevelt had coupled the expansion of traditional civil liberties and protections to eight explicit social and economic freedoms. In these few minutes he had set the economic and social agenda for the Democratic Party and for American liberalism for at least the next half-century."
"A People's Charter" is outspoken in declaring that Presidents Ronald Reagan and George Bush are the enemies of these ideals:
"No more extensive and effective campaign against the Bill of Rights of liberal orthodoxy has been mounted in this century, save perhaps during the Red Fear, than by the Reagan initiatives of the 1980's, renewed by George Bush at the end of that decade. While many liberals by the 1980's were defensive, self-doubting, even guilt-ridden, the Reaganites were confident and aggressive. So abundant and vulnerable were their targets that they had no need to mount a single grand counteroffensive but produced a multitude of sorties on the different fronts. Only in retrospect did the sheer breadth and force of the attack become evident."
The authors make it clear that it was not simply social goals that came under assault in the 1980's; the Bill of Rights itself became a target of opportunity. "The Reaganite campaign against the First Amendment was reinforced from the grass roots, by private New Right organizations and by an amalgam of fundamentalists, right-wing evangelicals and other religious conservatives that touted itself as the 'moral majority,' " they write.
What makes "A People's Charter" distinctive is its emphasis on the centuries-old roots and meaning of the rights of women and minorities. In a chapter titled "Everybody Sing Freedom," Dr. King's words and accomplishments in raising hopes and broadening rights for blacks are traced in detail. Similarly, a chapter called "Women at the Cutting Edge" describes how the National Organization for Women and other groups initiated a wave of feminist activism and contributed to the effort for an equal rights amendment. The authors attribute the failure of the amendment to its "abstract nature and indeterminate language."
Looking ahead, the authors say that a new rights program in the United States would depend on extraordinary leadership in Washington as well as at the grass-roots level, with women leading the way. They also envision a time, they write, when there will be a global bill of rights.
Some remedies for change through collective leadership and action offered in "A People's Charter" may sound starry-eyed, but the ideas are well intentioned. The authors conclude that we will never know for sure what Jefferson had in mind when he inserted the word happiness in the Declaration, but they want the pursuit to continue in the third American century.

Honorary committees can be an eclectic lot. Take, for example, the the list for the national campaign of the National Museum of the American Indian. They include PRESIDENT BUSH, the four living former Presidents and their wives, KEVIN COSTNER, PAUL NEWMAN, ARNOLD PALMER, SARGENT SHRIVER, BARRY GOLDWATER, the writer OCTAVIO PAZ, Chancellor W. ANN REYNOLDS of the City University of New York, the Navajo Indian artist R. C. GORMAN and such Indian leaders as WILMA MANKILLER, chief of the Cherokee Nation of Oklahoma, and LaDONNA HARRIS, president of Americans for Indian Opportunity.
"We went down a list of people in elected office, people who are active in the national Indian community and those in entertainment," said Representative BEN NIGHTHORSE CAMPBELL, Democrat of Colorado, the only American Indian in Congress. "We wanted high-profile people whose support would make it easier for us to raise money, and we chose them for their interest and sensitivity to Indian issues. My gosh, it's pretty hard to find a group with five living Presidents!" 
 The museum, now in upper Manhattan, is to have its main collection in a new Smithsonian Institution building in Washington. While the campaign will seek to raise $60 million for that building, Mr. Campbell said he was not worried about the dampening effects of the economy.
"I always believe there is money out there," he said. "It changes hands, and we simply must find out who has it."

HEADLINE: Japan's Consumers Are Proud to Buy Japanese;
Showroom Showdown

 BODY:
To the Editor:
There in our driveway sits a testament to unpatriotism. Gleaming garnet color, moon roof, leather, compact disk player. Everything about it says "made in Japan." We set out to buy another Ford. We had two last week. We really do hate the trade deficit. We really do want to buy American (and did so three years ago with the Fords after years of Volvos, Volkswagens, even some beaten up but great old Jaguars). 
 But the Ford dealer offered us less on our used Taurus than the dealer representing Japan offered. It was also simple math. We were able to buy a car stickered at about $30,000 for payments that would be equal to a $20,000 car made in the United States.
Those who control the money dictate the terms by which they lend. The Japanese figured that by lending at a lower interest rate, they would snag even patriots like ourselves, who have to make payments for four years and want a car least likely to break down. We also couldn't resist the offer of a free car, equal to our new one, lent every time we brought ours in and an 800 number that would bring us a repair van anywhere in the United States if we needed it.
Before President Bush beats up on the Japanese for their success, he should try to remember what it's like when you have to pay for your own car. When your payments are higher, they're higher, no matter what your politics. When your transportation stalls or quits, you're out in the cold.

HEADLINE: Japanese Visit, on the Surface: Jovial Bush, Friendly Crowds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 8

 BODY:
He is about to engage the Japanese Government in a titanic struggle over his nation's economic future. But on Tuesday, opening a four-day state visit to Japan to discuss trade and security issues, President Bush was trying his utmost to build bridges, not wreck them.
He played tourist at an ancient palace. He engaged an astonished circle of middle-aged Japanese men in a slightly goofy, highly telegenic game in which a leather ball is kicked around. He waxed enthusiastic to college students about brotherhood and understanding. He undertook that most American of political tasks -- a ribbon cutting at a new store. 
 In all of this, often over a din of brass bands and lusty cheers, Mr. Bush sought to improve the unflattering image that his visit has taken on in Japan, that of a strong-arm raid on the mercantile system and even the national treasury.
"I will do my level best as President of the United States to preserve and strengthen the important relationship between Japan and my country," he said at one point. "It has a lot to do with world peace. It has a lot to do with world economic stability. It has a lot to do with two great economic and democratic countries working together, setting an example for other countries around the world."
This morning, Mr. Bush and Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, dropped in on business and government officials of both their countries and conducted a brief colloquy to underscore their mutual interest in seeing the trade talks go well.
"President Bush and I are working hard to advance our bilateral relationship, including its economic relationship," Mr. Miyazawa said "not only for the sake of our two countries, but for the world.".
The President, in his trademark stacatto, replied: "We've got to be specific; we've got to get as much as we can -- set tables, times, let's do it by then. And I think we can do it."
Because of the enormous financial influence of both nations, he said, "world leadership is at stake."
Despite these remarks, it was not clear how long Tuesday's veneer of hospitality that preceded today's serious business, or their optimistic tone, might last.
Aides to Mr. Miyazawa were reported to remain deadlocked with American officials over demands that Japanese automakers sharply increase purchases of American-made components, even beyond a commitment to buy an additional $8 billion in American-made parts by 1994.
 
Auto Magnates Weigh In
 Automobiles and related products are responsible for three-fourths of the $41 billion yearly trade deficit that Washington runs with Tokyo.
The tension over the visit was further heightened by the heads of Detroit's Big Three automakers, who stepped off Air Force One after a flight here from Osaka on Tuesday night and promptly struck a frosty tone toward their Japanese hosts.
The chairman of Ford, Harold Poling, told reporters that Japanese consumers buy so few American cars because they are too fond of luxury makes like Mercedes and BMW, not because American cars are poorly made.
Japanese bought more than 130,000 German-made automobiles in 1990, but only about 30,000 American-made ones -- and 9,500 of those were Hondas assembled in the United States.
Mr. Poling's counterpart at Chrysler, Lee A. Iacocca, was contemptuous of suggestions by some Japanese officials that problems of quality in American cars, not Japanese trade barriers, were at the root of the Big Three's poor sales in this country.
"We're not that stupid," Mr. Iacocca said. "We know our problems. They don't have to preach to us."
Mr. Iacocca, Mr. Poling and the General Motors chairman, Robert Stempel, are among 18 corporate leaders accompanying Mr. Bush on his visit.
Behind the scenes, the President's aides toiled to bury any expectations of major trade concessions from his talks with Mr. Miyazawa..
Instead, they played up the international security aspects of the visit. These include the signing of a so-called "Tokyo Declaration" that acknowledges the growing global influence of Japan and sets out ways it can work with the United States in addressing both world problems and regional crises.
Bush Administration officials said that Mr. Miyazawa's Government may also agree to foot more of the cost of American military forces in the Pacific region.
When Mr. Bush left Washington for the Pacific 10 days ago, he said that his primary purpose was to "relentlessly pursue our mission to create jobs and restore prosperity for all Americans."
On Tuesday, an Administration official took a different tack, saying, "You've got to look at this in the broader historical perspective of what just happened to the Soviet Union, and the end of the cold war."
This broader perspective did not appear to be of much concern to the touring President, who spent Tuesday playing the role of good-will ambassador and stressing his trade message, perhaps as much for the benefit of audiences back in the United States as here.
Mr. Bush may have had his domestic political opponents on both the left and right in mind when he argued that "free and open commerce is not a zero-sum game. Free trade on a level playing field creates jobs and lifts standards in both of our countries."
On arriving from South Korea early Tuesday, Mr. and Mrs. Bush visited Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, to tour the restored Shishinden palace, once home to Japan's emperor. His guide was former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who spent much of the day as the Bushes' unofficial host.
Outside the palace, the President saw several men in brightly colored ceremonial garb engaged in a round of kemari, a game in which players kick a deerskin ball to each other, taking care to keep it from touching the ground.
As cameras whirred, Mr. Bush leapt into the circle of astonished men, attacking the horsehair-stuffed ball with obvious relish in soccer style, giving it several bounches off his head.
Not until he was told that that was not allowed under the rules did Mr. Bush relent, and he shortly left, saying to no one in particular, "We won."
Later at a nearby hotel, Mr. Bush briefly met about 200 American and Japanese students who are looking into each other's cultures under university exchange programs.
Noting that Mr. Miyazawa once joined in a student exchange with the United States, Mr. Bush said: "I want the people of our countries to have a better understanding of one another. We need more Americans who can speak Japanese and who understand the workings of the Japanese marketplace."
Then he sped off by helicopter to nearby Kashihara, where he opened an American-owned Toys "R" Us discount store.

HEADLINE: JAPAN ANNOUNCES A HOST OF STEPS TO AID U.S. TRADE

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Seeking to demonstrate its willingness to take concrete steps to reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the Japanese Government late on Tuesday announced a host of incentives to make it easier for American companies to export their goods. The move came on the first day of President Bush's visit here.
Some measures had been announced earlier, while some merely expanded on existing programs. 
 But in spite of Japan's move, the difficult talks on what could amount to a new approach to managing trade between Japan and the United States appeared to bog down as negotiators worked late into the night but were unable to resolve tough American demands for increased Japanese imports.
"We are waiting to see what the Government of Japan comes forward with as a concrete, tangible set of actions," said a senior Administration official at a news briefing as the talks continued today.
 
Array of Incentives
 The Japanese package announced Tuesday night included an array of subsidized loans and voluntary targets for imports by Japanese corporations. It even included expansion of a program under which the Government offers low-cost financing to promote the export of American goods to developing countries receiving Japanese foreign aid.
Nuboru Hatakeyama, Vice Minister for International Trade and Industry, told foreign reporters at a news conference that the measures would increase Japanese imports over two years by more than $10 billion on products ranging from electronics components to automobiles.
 
More Action Is Sought
 Mr. Hatakeyama said it was not certain how much of the imports would come from the United States, and officials said it could also include products shipped by Japanese-owned factories abroad back to Japan. But officials also indicated that they expected the majority of the imports to come from American-owned companies.
The United States did not officially respond to the announcements. Officials said they were pleased that the Trade Ministry was taking the initiative but said more action was required. "An individual action plan from MITI certainly is not going to take care of the much deeper problem within the Japanese economy, which makes it very resistant to imports," said one American official.
What has struck many here is that the effect of all these measures and those still under negotiation will be a large increase in Government intervention in the market to try to help American-made goods sell here. Both sides have gone out of their way to express their conviction that markets must remain free, but the trade package emerging under heavy political pressure from President Bush's visit will amount to managed trade, many Japanese and some Americans acknowledge.
American officials have said that if successful, these discussions could mark a significant new direction. "I think this could have some long-term profound effects on the trade relationship," the Administration official said.
A key issue still being negotiated, officials on both sides indicated, is the dollar value of American autos and auto parts the Japanese will promise to acquire. Under a voluntary program, Japanese auto companies have said they will increase their purchases of American-made autos and parts to about $17 billion by 1994, from $9 billion now. The United States is said to be asking for a higher figure.
 
Easier Rules Expected
 Japan is also expected to ease some pollution-control regulations and testing standards for imported cars, to offer tax breaks for buyers of imported cars and to encourage Japanese auto companies to sell American-made cars through their extensive sales networks.
Officials on both sides have avoided referring to the import goals under discussion as targets. The Bush Administration has insisted that its only aim is to remove barriers to the free flow of goods and to halt exclusionary business practices in Japan.
"We want agreements that produce permanent improvement in access and in U.S. sales to Japanese markets and permanent improvement in the lives of Japanese consumers," President Bush said on Tuesday in western Japan, where he attended the opening of a Toys "R" Us store.
"We didn't ask them to make concessions," insisted Robert C. Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, who is one of 18 senior American executives accompanying the President. "We're not asking that they give us anything. We're just asking to compete." That, however, does not appear to be the case.
In the mid-1980's, the Reagan Administration negotiated an agreement with Japan to increase America's share of Japan's market for semiconductors to 20 percent, declaring that American manufacturers had been unfairly excluded from the market. Later, however, President Bush's trade negotiators insisted that they were opposed to setting such targets. The series of tense negotiations taking shape here this week on a range of manufactured goods appears to mark a step toward reversing course yet again.
"We are facing a dilemma," Mr. Hatakeyama said. "Theoretically speaking, this type of thing would be better not to exist. But we are experiencing a large trade imbalance with the rest of the world and we think it would be good for the Japanese Government to try everything she can."
He insisted that in Japan the Government could not dictate to private companies, since it has an open economy. He thus described the programs as "a kind of moral campaign" to persuade Japanese companies to import more. As he pointed out, some 88 Japanese corporations have complied so far.
Mr. Hatekeyama also insisted that the figures being discussed were not import "targets" but "estimates."
So far, the Trade Ministry reported, Japanese companies that account for more than 50 percent of Japan's imports and exports have said they will participate in the program to increase imports and links with foreign suppliers.
These range from agreements by Japan's big auto makers to sell American cars through their sales networks -- for instance, Toyota will sell G.M. cars -- to programs to permit more American auto-parts concerns to participate in the design of key parts and components for Japanese autos.
A series of "foreign access zones" will be opened near airports and ports to help imports. The Government will offer more low-cost loans to importers.
Tax breaks and subsidized loans will be offered to help foreign companies seeking to locate in Japan, a means of attracting more foreign direct investment into Japan from the current trickle. The Government will also establish a company to help foreign companies recruit Japanese staff. Under certain conditions foreign companies entering Japan will be offered Government loan guarantees to help them obtain needed bank loans, too.
The Japanese Government said it would also expand a program under which it offers trade financing to promote American exports to projects in developing countries underwritten by Japan. Under this program, which is being carried out in cooperation with the Export-Import Bank in the United States, the Japanese Government said it was likely to finance more than $10 billion in projects over several years, and that the greater part of the imports for these development projects would come from the United States.
That still leaves the negotiators wrestling with the politically sensitive issue of setting goals for sales of American automobiles and parts. It also does not include measures that are expected to be announced by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday.
An unusual level of secrecy has been maintained around Mr. Brady's visit, but there has been widespread speculation that he will be trying to work out financial measures to lift American exports.

HEADLINE: A National Curriculum: Seeking Fairness for All

SERIES: Lessons From Britain: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The 11-year-olds in Richard Nokes's history class are not having an easy time. They are trying to figure out how ancient Roman roads were built, and their only sources are translations of descriptions by writers of the time.
It is a sophisticated lesson in how to read primary documents, a skill expected of every child now that Britain has a required national curriculum. 
 Just last month, an advisory panel to President Bush recommended that the United States adopt voluntary national curriculum standards and national tests. As the debate begins in the United States, Britain's experience holds several revealing lessons.
 
The Debates Go On
 The British national curriculum has won wide acceptance as a way to raise standards and insure equal educational opportunity, although many teachers and scholars believe it is far too detailed and was rushed into the classroom. The curriculum exposed the need for much more extensive teacher training, particularly in math and science.
New required national tests have proved far trickier. Debates continue on whether they are fair, what form they should take, and whether they discriminate.
Britain is using the same kinds of tests that would be introduced in the United States, ones that avoid formulaic multiple-choice questions and are instead designed to test children's abilities more thoroughly. Yet teachers have criticized them as too time-consuming, and opinions remain divided on whether the tests were simply impractical or whether teachers were not given enough training or time to administer them.
In June 1988, a new education law required a national curriculum for the first time, along with identical national tests for every schoolchild at ages 7, 11 and 14. But minimum levels are not set for specific ages; the idea is to mandate what must be taught, not what must be learned in each grade. The law applies to England and Wales.
For Donald Naismith, a sometime adviser to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and now director of education for the London borough of Wandsworth, the national curriculum is a way to enforce higher academic standards and prevent dilution of Britain's national identity. For Jane Traies, the principal of the Swakeleys School, a girls' high school in West London, the national curriculum means that her students will not be allowed to blight their futures by dropping such traditionally "male" courses as math and science.
That these educators, who consider themselves far apart ideologically, both support a national curriculum testifies to the popularity of an idea that not so long ago was heretical.
"I had a lot of anxiety about the national curriculum being a straitjacket," said Kathleen Higgins, director of education and community services for Hillingdon, a West London borough. "But we use it as an entitlement for education for all children. It's like an oyster with grit. We've managed to turn it into something wonderful."
Because Britain has long given national tests at ages 16 and 18 that help determine whether students advance to college, a de facto national curriculum existed for a relatively small, elite group. But only 20 percent of British students attend college, and in many cases poor or working-class students chose or were shunted into less demanding academic tracks.
Now all students through age 14 must study English, science and math, technology, history, geography, art, music, a modern foreign language and physical education. The Government is proposing to make art and music optional after age 14, and to require either history or geography through age 16. The Government has spent almost $1 billion developing the curriculum and tests.
The curriculum, which was drawn up by experts in specific fields but reviewed by Government officials, lists the factual knowledge and the analytical skills children should have at different ages. It breaks down each subject into "attainment targets," areas like genetics and evolution in science, and then describes levels of achievement within those, from basic to advanced.
There are no minimum levels children must achieve by certain a age, although each subject's curriculum outlines a range of levels most children will probably achieve at ages 7, 11, 14 and 16. For example, in science and math, most children would be expected to achieve level 6 or 7 by age 16. Level 10 would be achieved by the brightest college-bound students.
The law does not require specific textbooks or teaching methods. Rather than listing books, the curriculum says students should read "a range of fiction, poetry, literary nonfiction and drama, including pre-20th century literature." Students are required to read Shakespeare and other classic works (for example, the curriculum suggests, but does not require, the Bible and Jane Austen's novels).
Partly because the British curriculum leaves enough room to add whatever books teachers want, the battles over reading classics or including works by women and minorities now raging in the United States have been largely absent in Britain. But the issue of multiculturalism also seems to be less important in Britain, where, despite an increasing immigrant population, minorities do not have as much political power as in the United States.
 
Teachers Must Bear Heavy New Burdens
 For most teachers, however, the biggest problems have not been ideological, but logistical. Teachers have had to endure several dizzying years, studying the new curriculum, overhauling their lesson plans and adjusting to rapid-fire revisions.
Ian Host, head of the science department at the Small Heath High School in Birmingham, spent most of last year figuring out how to plan lessons that matched the 17 attainment targets and 10 levels of achievement in the curriculum. Meanwhile, the Government, responding to complaints that the curriculum was too unwieldy, reduced the number of attainment targets first from 17 to 5, and then to 4.
Lord Griffiths, who heads the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council, charged with overseeing the testing process, said that two-thirds of the attainment targets were still measured by teachers, not tests.
The hardest-hit teachers are in elementary schools, where many of the national curriculum subjects are being taught for the first time and teachers are especially unfamiliar with math and science requirements. Five-year-olds, for example, are supposed to be introduced to the concept of probability. David Hart, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, says teachers in "infant schools," for children from 5 to 7, are reeling. "The poor old infant teachers are so overloaded there is a danger the basics are being neglected," he said.
Indeed, introducing the curriculum has shown an urgent need for better teacher training, an issue the National Curriculum Council will examine, said its chairman, David Pascall.
Despite the frenetic pace, the neglect of teacher training, and what even Government officials agree is an unwieldy curriculum, surveys have consistently found that teachers welcomed the continuity, higher standards and sense of priorities the national curriculum brought.
"For very good schools, it is a dampener on innovation," said Margaret Maden, director of education for the county of Warwickshire, in central England. "But it has meant improvement for a lot of schools."
Testing is at the core of all the changes -- because it provides a way to check whether the high standards of the national curriculum are actually being met and a way to give parents adequate information so they can choose among schools.
But precisely because students, teachers and schools will all be judged by test results, the stakes are high and the debate contentious.
 
First Tests Create A Long Nightmare
 The first tests for 7-year-olds were just given last year. By all accounts, teachers found the experience a nightmare. They reported working an average of 58 hours a week giving the tests and struggling to figure out how to grade them. For teachers already strained by all the changes of the past few years, national tests worsened morale even further.
The tests were designed to be very different from the traditional exams familiar to generations of students, exams in which children facing a time limit wrote down answers. Instead, children were asked to guess in advance whether certain substances would sink or float, for example, or were given two magnets and asked to explain how to determine which one was stronger. They were also rated on longer-term projects, such as predicting and recording weather changes for several weeks.
 
Eye on the Workplace
 These "performance-based" tests are exactly the ones that testing experts in the United States want to see introduced as part of American national tests. They are better than traditional tests, experts argue, because they give children a fairer chance to demonstrate what they know and because they test skills needed in the workplace, such as reasoning ability.
Many British teachers, however, found the workload overwhelming, and the Government quickly issued a list of changes for this spring's round of tests. Half the tests for 7-year-olds will now be the "paper and pencil" variety, the science and math experiments were dropped, a spelling test was introduced, and teachers were given more time to conduct exams. Tim Eggar, the Government's second-ranking education official, said the initial tests for 7-year-olds were simply impractical. "There was a very commendable desire to assess as much of a child's different skills and knowledge base as possible," he said. "This inevitably resulted in a very elaborate system of testing. We've been dragging that back to reality. You've got to have a relatively simple testing system given in a reasonable time frame by an average classroom teacher dealing with an average class."
Lord Griffiths of the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council said the initial tests tried to serve too many purposes at once -- evaluating students and teachers, judging schools, communicating to parents. American tests now being drawn up also try to combine several purposes.
Yet support for the new "performance" style of tests remains strong, even among the same teachers who complained about the time such tests took to administer.
"The idea of written exams as the be-all and end-all belongs to the Victorian days of empire," said Ms. Traies. "Then they needed clerks to fill out forms in triplicate. What this country needs is people who can work cooperatively in groups."
Several educators said the tests themselves were good, but that teachers were not given enough training, time or aides to help watch the class while teachers gave the tests to small groups. Many hope not to see a return to paper-and-pencil tests because, they argue, these have tended to favor more privileged children.
"I am worried that the tests will be used to categorize and label pupils, and that the evidence on which they'll be labeled will not necessarily be reliable," said Peter Mortimore, deputy director of London University's Institute of Education, who helped draft some of the early tests. "This could be disastrous in a system which traditionally does well by the brightest and disastrously by the others."
Results from last year's tests showed that in one-third of the cases, teachers had underestimated their students' abilities -- particularly in the case of minority students. Professor Mortimore said that it was precisely because the tests were sophisticated that they were able to demonstrate the potential of so many students.
But Lord Griffiths and Mr. Eggar argued that this discrepancy showed just how much tests were needed to check teachers' assumptions. They say that the very labeling of children that critics fear the tests will bring about is already done by teachers.
Furthermore, said John Marks, who also serves on the testing council, tests can uncover problems and help children while there is still time. "You're not damaging their future by condemning them to some lower-ability rung, but saying here's some youngsters who need different treatment," he said. "If you've got a child who can't read, he can't get on. It's no good saying, 'I'm from a deprived background.' "

Chart: "Genetics and Evolution, Step by Step"
 
This category is one of the attainment targets of the science curriculum now required in British schools. There are no minimum requirements, but the anticipated norms are that children at age 7 would achieve from levels 1 to 3; at age 11, from levels 2 to 5; at age 15, from levels 3 to 7; at age 16, from levels 4 to 10

HEADLINE: AID PANEL STALLS ON FORMER SOVIETS

BYLINE: By KEITH BRADSHER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Just 15 days before the Washington Coordinating Conference on aid to the former Soviet republics is scheduled to begin, American and foreign diplomats are still trying to assemble a detailed agenda, a complete list of participants and even a consensus on what aid should be included.
Born of a last-moment insert in a speech on Dec. 12 by Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d, the conference is seen by American officials as a way to prevent countries from duplicative efforts and insure that no region of the former Soviet Union is neglected. 
 But as diplomats arrived in Washington today to begin setting the conference's agenda, differences remained on whether broad economic and financial problems in the former Soviet republics should be included and on whether European nations would allow an American conference to guide their aid programs.
Some American officials say they hope the conference will end up guiding the billions of dollars in aid pledged by Western countries since the failed Soviet coup in August and allow the United States to seize the lead from the European Community on aid to the Soviet Union.
 
'Short Time Fuse'
 But those American officials and some European officials also say the conference might turn out to be a place for countries to do little more than exchange information on the scale of problems now facing the former Soviet republics.
"There's a lot of fluidity here," said one American official who insisted on not being identified. "There's a very short time fuse here as far as sorting out our own position."
Mr. Baker called for the conference in a speech at Princeton University after the barest consultation within the Administration and without first seeking the endorsement of American allies abroad, a State Department official said. Mr. Baker contended then that it was needed to organize a worldwide relief effort too large for any single nation to undertake.
The member countries of the European Community are still drafting their responses. They will be sending their foreign ministers to Brussels for a meeting on Friday to devise a common position on what issues should be addressed at the conference and the extent to which the coordination of European aid should be put on the table.
 
Wider Changes Urged
 Germany, Britain and Canada contend that the conference agenda, which is to be decided here on Wednesday, should at least allow discussion of issues like the Soviet Union's $63 billion foreign debt, the increasingly worthless ruble and the long-term economic recovery of Russia and 11 other former Soviet republics. A British official who insisted on not being identified said the success of humanitarian aid would depend on wider changes in the former Soviet republics.
"Our feeling is that you can't really look at all the subjects on the agenda without at least discussing the economic and financial situation," he said.
Mr. Baker mentioned in his speech on Dec. 12 the need for steps now to prevent a recurrence of shortages next winter, but the focus of American planning since then has been on short-term humanitarian relief.
The European eagerness to address other issues partly reflects concern by Western European governments and commercial banks that little of the nearly $60 billion they lent to the Soviet Union might be repaid. The United States is reluctant to help, contending that the Europeans won considerable political influence when they made the loans and knew the credit risks involved.
The United States and Japan want the two-day conference to focus exclusively on ways to provide food, shelter, medicine, fuel and advice to prevent social unrest. International task forces are being set up to review each of those five issues at the conference, and actual pledges of money and goods will not be sought.
"You sort of dilute the focus of this conference if you draw in a lot of other issues," an American official said.
Broader issues should be addressed by the Group of Seven industrialized democracies, some of whose officials will meet on Thursday in Bonn, said Hiroshi Hirabayashi, deputy chief of the Japanese Embassy in Washington.
The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund announced today that Russia and Azerbaijan had applied for full membership. The United States endorsed membership for Russia and five other former Soviet republics on Friday.

HEADLINE: U.N.'s Yugoslavia Envoy Says Rising War-Weariness Led to the Cease-Fire

BYLINE: By DAVID BINDER

 BODY:
Cyrus R. Vance, the special United Nations envoy for Yugoslavia, said yesterday that he believed that general war weariness was the primary factor leading to the cease-fire accord that took hold there under his supervision last Friday evening.
In an interview in New York, he said that while he was dismayed by the incident yesterday in which a Yugoslav Air Force jet shot down a helicopter, killing five European monitors, he did not think this could cause hostilities to resume between Serbs and Croats. 
 During the interview he received a call from Adm. Stane Brovet, the Yugoslav Deputy Defense Minister in Belgrade, who expressed sorrow over the incident and told Mr. Vance that the Air Force commander had been suspended and a full investigation begun.
Mr. Vance said he strongly suspected the incident was provoked by "hardliners" bent on discouraging intervention by the European Community or by the United Nations to bring an end to the still undeclared war that began last June in Yugoslavia.
 
'Growing Weariness'
 "There is growing weariness on all sides," the 74-year-old former Secretary of State said of the leaders of the warring factions in Yugoslavia. "Secondly the economy continues to deteriorate on all sides. The problem of displaced persons continues to grow. Desertions are also growing."
He was joined in the interview by his deputy, Herbert Okun, a retired Foreign Service officer who accompanied Mr. Vance on all five of his missions to Yugoslavia that began in mid-October.
"On the fourth mission I began to see light," Mr. Vance said of his shuttle diplomacy between Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital, and Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. "You could see it and feel it when people began to talk about the feasibility of a peacekeeping plan."
Despite Mr. Vance's sense of optimism, the cease-fire agreement resulting from that trip, signed in Geneva on Nov. 23 by Presidents Slobodan Milosevic of Serbia and Franjo Tudjman of Croatia and Yugoslavia's Defense Minister, Veljko Kadijevic, was broken immediately, like the 14 that preceded it. .
The November accord envisioned a cessation of hostilities and a simultaneous move by Croatian forces to unblock some 40 Yugoslav Army barracks where more than 25,000 federal troops were held hostage.
Mr. Vance said the Croatian and Serbian leaders were "disgusted" that the cease-fire did not take hold, but "very appreciative" that the blockades were gradually removed.
The difference between all the previous cease-fire agreements and the current one, Mr. Vance said, is that last Friday's agreement includes detailed mechanisms for separating the warring factions and preventing them from "shooting back" without first consulting international monitors.
Amplifying this, Mr. Okun said of the new agreement, "There will be military liaison officers from the United Nations, attached to the Army headquarters in Zagreb and Belgrade and to field headquarters down to the corps level, and contact between the liaison officers across the lines."
He said both Serb and Croat commanders had vowed to support United Nations liaison teams with their logistics.
 
Signed in Sarajevo
 All this is detailed in the "implementation accord" signed by Serb and Croat armed forces commanders on Jan. 2 in Sarajevo, the Bosnian city where World War I was ignited by the assassination of the Austrian archduke.
Mr. Okun and Mr. Vance had flown to Sarajevo after whirlwind stops in Belgrade and Zagreb, where they obtained the approval of both Serbian and Croatian leaderships. There, they drafted the accord over a period of four hours in the Konak, or official residence of the Bosnian-Hercegovinian Government, "on a 1914 Underwood typewriter," Mr. Okun recalled.
Sitting in the Konak, with Mr. Vance at the head of the table, Gojko Susak, Defense Minister of Croatia, signed for his side, while Col. Gen. Andrija Raseta signed for the federal forces. Then the two Americans dashed back to Belgrade for a "working dinner" with Serbia's President.
Mr. Okun said that of the 11 weeks he and Mr. Vance had spent on the negotiating task, "six or seven weeks were on the road, mostly in Yugoslavia."
Initially they flew among Yugoslavia's republican capitals on executive jets lent them by the Swiss Government, but on the last mission they used a small American Air Force jet.
Asked about the protests against the Sarajevo accord by Serbian minority leaders that took place this week in the Croatian region called Krajina, a scene of major fighting in the previous six months, Mr. Vance said he believed leaders in Belgrade would be able to bring them into line.
On another critical point he said he was convinced that the Serbian-led Yugoslav Army would "literally pull out of Croatia," where it holds about one-third of the republic's territory. "Literally and definitively," he said.
He said the first United Nations liaison officers were being chosen this week and that the initial team of 50 would "probably include an American." They are scheduled to be sent to Yugoslavia next week, to be followed -- if the cease-fire holds -- by about 10,000 blue-helmeted peacekeeping troops.
Mr. Vance said he was heartened that the European Community's peace conference on Yugoslavia, involving leaders of all six former republics, would resume work in Brussels on Thursday. Mr. Okun is leaving Wednesday for Brussels to attend that session.

HEADLINE: Imelda Marcos Back on Center Stage

BYLINE: By PHILIP SHENON, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MANILA, Jan. 7

 BODY:
With the announcement by Imelda Marcos that she will run for President in the Philippine elections, the widow of former President Ferdinand E. Marcos added further uncertainty today to an already chaotic and unpredictable campaign.
Mrs. Marcos, declaring that her candidacy was a reaction to the "sick and misdirected Government" of President Corazon C. Aquino, has undermined the presidential ambitions of several former Marcos family cronies and put new pressure on Mrs. Aquino to reconsider her refusal to seek a second term. 
 "Happy days are here again," said a beaming Mrs. Marcos, the 61-year-old former Filipino first lady whose entry into the race guarantees that, if nothing else, the rest of the presidential campaign will have the feel of theater. "If we are united, I am sure this nation will be great again."
While Mrs. Marcos scores low in opinion polls and is tainted by accusations that she and her husband looted the Philippine treasury during his 20-year rule, politicians and political analysts agree that her candidacy cannot be dismissed.
 
'The Best Demagogue'
 "People have discounted all those reports about the Marcos plunder," said Blas Ople, a newspaper columnist who was a Labor Minister under Mr. Marcos and who believes that Mrs. Marcos could win the May election. "In terms of stage appeal, no one comes close to Mrs. Marcos. She is the best demagogue in the country today."
But election victories in the Philippines are traditionally more dependent on money, intimidation and patronage than on public support.
In characteristically flamboyant style, Mrs. Marcos announced her candidacy on the steps of a Manila courthouse only minutes after she pleaded not guilty to new corruption charges.
The Government of Mrs. Aquino, swept to power in the popular uprising in 1986 that forced the Marcoses into exile in the United States, has accused the Marcos family of stealing nearly $5 billion from the Philippine treasury. Mrs. Marcos faces dozens of corruption-related criminal charges in Philippine courts.
 
Attacks Aquino Government
 "I have gone all over the country and seen so much suffering and economic chaos," said Mrs. Marcos, who returned home from exile last November insisting that she had no political plans. "After months of direct consultations with our poor and oppressed citizens, I have decided to run for office to seek the presidency."
Mrs. Marcos said the Aquino Government was "sick and misdirected" and that it "would rather spend hundreds of millions of dollars to persecute and vilify its own citizens while the poor and the destitute -- the victims of natural and man-made disasters -- languish in sickness and death caused by the failure to deliver basic services."
Mrs. Aquino's executive secretary, Franklin Drilon, did not respond directly to Mrs. Marcos' attack today on the President. But, in a one-sentence statement released to reporters, he said, "Imelda is entitled to chart her own political destiny, and nothing has changed the President's plans."
Mrs. Aquino has insisted that she will not seek a second term. But some of her political supporters are at work trying to convince her to reconsider her retirement from politics, and the entry of Mrs. Marcos into the race gives them a new and powerful argument. Mrs. Aquino's husband, Benigno S. Aquino Jr., was a leader of opposition to Mr. Marcos when he was assassinated in 1983, and Mrs. Aquino is known to believe that Mrs. Marcos played a role in the killing.
 
Seeks Opposition Endorsement
 Mrs. Marcos said today she would seek the endorsement of the Nacionalista Party, an anti-Aquino party that has fragmented in recent months as three of its most prominent members have announced their own plans to seek the presidency. Those candidates are Eduardo Cojuangco, Mrs. Aquino's first cousin who is also one of Mr. Marcos's closest friends, and two early supporters of Mrs. Aquino who have since turned against her -- Vice President Salvador Laurel and former Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile.
All three men had sought the support and financial backing of Mrs. Marcos but, with today's announcement, were rebuffed.

HEADLINE: Mr. Marino's Bad Budgeting

 BODY:
New York State's lowered credit rating hardly comes as a shock. Gov. Mario Cuomo has been warning about it and the rating agencies have been hinting at it. Despite these alarms Senate Republicans, led by Ralph Marino, the majority leader, accused Mr. Cuomo of crying wolf and refused to help resolve the state's latest budget impasse.
On Monday, Moody's Investors Service downgraded the rating on most of New York's debt, leaving the state with the second-lowest rating, Baa1, in the country. The least Mr. Marino can do now is limit the damage by negotiating in good faith on a plan to close a gap of $875 million in this year's $30 billion budget. 
 Mr. Cuomo said yesterday he could save $400 million through cuts in executive agencies. But that still leaves a $475 million hole to plug in just two months; Mr. Marino's intransigence is inevitably pushing the state to the irresponsible alternative of borrowing. That would add new debt to next year's anticipated deficit of $4 billion.
The lower credit rating on appropriation-backed bonds, which account for about two-thirds of the state's debt, no doubt means the state will have to pay higher interest rates on its bonds. Moody's has also warned that if Albany fails to approve a responsible budget for the next fiscal year, on time, it might downgrade its A rating on New York's general obligation bonds.
The other rating agency, Standard & Poor's, could lower its ratings at any time. So what is Mr. Marino waiting for? He continues to reject the Assembly's plan, which, though it relies too heavily on non-recurring revenues, makes fair spending cuts in services and administrative costs. Instead he calls for deep cuts in Medicaid and welfare, while keeping school aid cuts to a minimum.
But even his plan would not produce a balanced budget, raising the unavoidable suspicion that it is less a budget proposal than a campaign platform for Republican legislators facing re-election this year. New York deserves better.

HEADLINE: Wait Until the Soviet People Have Spoken

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Enough rhetoric about the failure of Soviet socialism ("The Soviet State, Born of a Dream, Dies," front page, Dec. 26). How about facts? 
 * The 1917 Bolshevik revolution that threw off the Czar was hardly an experiment by ivory tower idealists. It was a necessary revolt of workers and peasants led by women in bread lines whose families were starving.
* Lenin and Trotsky, leaders of the Russian Revolution, fought for democratic socialism (a planned economy to benefit society) under the control of workers, with full rights for women and national minorities.
* Many would have us believe that Stalinism was the logical outcome of the Bolshevik revolution. Not so. Stalin came to power after annihilating Trotskyist opposition. The Stalinist bureaucracy led an assault on democratic socialism and Communism to feed their coffers at the expense of the majority. That bureaucracy developed out of an impoverished and technologically backward Soviet Union, invaded and besieged for decades by Western capitalist countries.
* Stalin's 1930's reign of terror turned socialism on its head, with everything Lenin and Trotsky fought for and represented. Stalin had Trotsky assassinated while in exile in Mexico to kill his leadership role in Soviet and international socialism. The United States Government shed no tears.
Genuine democratic socialism in the Soviet Union hasn't been tried since Stalin's rise. Mikhail S. Gorbachev and Boris N. Yeltsin follow in Stalin's, not Lenin's or Trotsky's, footsteps. They will sell off the country and further impoverish the people for their own privileges like the bureaucrats before them.
Chances are, the workers, the women waiting in long bread lines, the poor who can't get housing and food will revolt against Mr. Yeltsin's market economy of big money and high living for a few and poverty for the rest. And though we hear little if anything about the protests of Soviet women, they will likely lead the resistance against capitalism and the fight for genuine socialism, just as they did in 1917. Yet this is a much brighter picture than what President Bush and Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d have in store for the Soviet people.

HEADLINE: Bush Offers a Proposal to Battle Pollution in Asia

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 7

 BODY:
Hoping to exploit American leadership in environmental protection in a part of the world where rapid population and economic growth is creating some of the worst industrial pollution and depletion of natural resources, the Bush Administration unveiled an environmental initiative for Asia today.
The program, involving 18 United States Government agencies working jointly with as many as 29 developing nations, territories or island groups in Asia and the Pacific, will attempt to match American expertise with the needs of nations where anti-pollution measures are not keeping pace with industrial development. 
 American consultants and companies will be assisted in marketing their skills and technologies to Asian and Pacific nations. Asians interested in learning more about environmental policy and technological advances will be offered places in a new United States Environmental Training Institute scheduled to open in April, jointly supported by the Government and private enterprise.
Several Asian cities, including Bangkok and New Delhi, are among the world's most polluted urban areas, without emissions controls or enforceable laws regulating industry. At the same time, some Asian nations are beginning to be more willing to spend money on cleaning the enviroment, American officials say. Taiwan and South Korea are planning anti-pollution programs that could cost up to $12 billion.
 
Problems Called Serious
 "The problems of urban Asia are terribly, terribly serious," said Tom Fox, director of the Center for International Development and Environment at the independent World Resources Institute here.
"There are all kinds of health-related environmental issues that grow from the confluence of population growth and poverty," Mr. Fox said in an interview. "Air quality, water, waste disposal, the whole range of sanitation issues are all susceptible to technology transfer. American technology leadership in these fields has been demonstrated in our cities."
"This program may not be the whole answer, but it's a good start," he added.
The United States-Asia Environmental Partnership, the first pan-Asian public policy effort to be undertaken by the Bush Administration, was first announced by President Bush in a speech Saturday in Singapore.
 
U.S. Warns Countries
 The United States has informed the following countries and territories that they are eligible for the new environmental program:
Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Cook Islands, Federated States of Micronesia, Fiji, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Kiribati, Laos, Malaysia, Maldives, Marshall Islands, Mongolia, Nepal, Niue, Pakistan, Papua New Guinea, Philippines, Singapore, Solomon Islands, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Taiwan, Thailand, Tonga, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.
Afghanistan, Myanmar, North Korea and Vietnam were not included because the United States refuses to deal with those countries. But neither was China, with which the Administration has tried to maintain ties.
A notable inclusion on the list was Pakistan, which is under an American aid embargo.

HEADLINE: Japanese Visit, on the Surface: Jovial Bush, Friendly Crowds

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 8

 BODY:
He is about to engage the Japanese Government in a titanic struggle over his nation's economic future. But on Tuesday, opening a four-day state visit to Japan to discuss trade and security issues, President Bush was trying his utmost to build bridges, not wreck them.
He played tourist at an ancient palace. He engaged an astonished circle of middle-aged Japanese men in a slightly goofy, highly telegenic game in which a leather ball is kicked around. He waxed enthusiastic to college students about brotherhood and understanding. He undertook that most American of political tasks -- a ribbon cutting at a new store. 
 In all of this, often over a din of brass bands and lusty cheers, Mr. Bush sought to improve the unflattering image that his visit has taken on in Japan, that of a strong-arm raid on the mercantile system and even the national treasury.
"I will do my level best as President of the United States to preserve and strengthen the important relationship between Japan and my country," he said at one point. "It has a lot to do with world peace. It has a lot to do with world economic stability. It has a lot to do with two great economic and democratic countries working together, setting an example for other countries around the world."
This morning, Mr. Bush and Japan's Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, dropped in on business and government officials of both their countries and conducted a brief colloquy to underscore their mutual interest in seeing the trade talks go well.
"President Bush and I are working hard to advance our bilateral relationship, including its economic relationship," Mr. Miyazawa said "not only for the sake of our two countries, but for the world.".
The President, in his trademark stacatto, replied: "We've got to be specific; we've got to get as much as we can -- set tables, times, let's do it by then. And I think we can do it."
Because of the enormous financial influence of both nations, he said, "world leadership is at stake."
Despite these remarks, it was not clear how long Tuesday's veneer of hospitality that preceded today's serious business, or their optimistic tone, might last.
Aides to Mr. Miyazawa were reported to remain deadlocked with American officials over demands that Japanese automakers sharply increase purchases of American-made components, even beyond a commitment to buy an additional $8 billion in American-made parts by 1994.
 
Auto Magnates Weigh In
 Automobiles and related products are responsible for three-fourths of the $41 billion yearly trade deficit that Washington runs with Tokyo.
The tension over the visit was further heightened by the heads of Detroit's Big Three automakers, who stepped off Air Force One after a flight here from Osaka on Tuesday night and promptly struck a frosty tone toward their Japanese hosts.
The chairman of Ford, Harold Poling, told reporters that Japanese consumers buy so few American cars because they are too fond of luxury makes like Mercedes and BMW, not because American cars are poorly made.
Japanese bought more than 130,000 German-made automobiles in 1990, but only about 30,000 American-made ones -- and 9,500 of those were Hondas assembled in the United States.
Mr. Poling's counterpart at Chrysler, Lee A. Iacocca, was contemptuous of suggestions by some Japanese officials that problems of quality in American cars, not Japanese trade barriers, were at the root of the Big Three's poor sales in this country.
"We're not that stupid," Mr. Iacocca said. "We know our problems. They don't have to preach to us."
Mr. Iacocca, Mr. Poling and the General Motors chairman, Robert Stempel, are among 18 corporate leaders accompanying Mr. Bush on his visit.
Behind the scenes, the President's aides toiled to bury any expectations of major trade concessions from his talks with Mr. Miyazawa..
Instead, they played up the international security aspects of the visit. These include the signing of a so-called "Tokyo Declaration" that acknowledges the growing global influence of Japan and sets out ways it can work with the United States in addressing both world problems and regional crises.
Bush Administration officials said that Mr. Miyazawa's Government may also agree to foot more of the cost of American military forces in the Pacific region.
When Mr. Bush left Washington for the Pacific 10 days ago, he said that his primary purpose was to "relentlessly pursue our mission to create jobs and restore prosperity for all Americans."
On Tuesday, an Administration official took a different tack, saying, "You've got to look at this in the broader historical perspective of what just happened to the Soviet Union, and the end of the cold war."
This broader perspective did not appear to be of much concern to the touring President, who spent Tuesday playing the role of good-will ambassador and stressing his trade message, perhaps as much for the benefit of audiences back in the United States as here.
Mr. Bush may have had his domestic political opponents on both the left and right in mind when he argued that "free and open commerce is not a zero-sum game. Free trade on a level playing field creates jobs and lifts standards in both of our countries."
On arriving from South Korea early Tuesday, Mr. and Mrs. Bush visited Kyoto, Japan's ancient capital, to tour the restored Shishinden palace, once home to Japan's emperor. His guide was former Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, who spent much of the day as the Bushes' unofficial host.
Outside the palace, the President saw several men in brightly colored ceremonial garb engaged in a round of kemari, a game in which players kick a deerskin ball to each other, taking care to keep it from touching the ground.
As cameras whirred, Mr. Bush leapt into the circle of astonished men, attacking the horsehair-stuffed ball with obvious relish in soccer style, giving it several bounches off his head.
Not until he was told that that was not allowed under the rules did Mr. Bush relent, and he shortly left, saying to no one in particular, "We won."
Later at a nearby hotel, Mr. Bush briefly met about 200 American and Japanese students who are looking into each other's cultures under university exchange programs.
Noting that Mr. Miyazawa once joined in a student exchange with the United States, Mr. Bush said: "I want the people of our countries to have a better understanding of one another. We need more Americans who can speak Japanese and who understand the workings of the Japanese marketplace."
Then he sped off by helicopter to nearby Kashihara, where he opened an American-owned Toys "R" Us discount store.

HEADLINE: JAPAN ANNOUNCES A HOST OF STEPS TO AID U.S. TRADE

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Wednesday, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Seeking to demonstrate its willingness to take concrete steps to reduce its growing trade surplus with the United States, the Japanese Government late on Tuesday announced a host of incentives to make it easier for American companies to export their goods. The move came on the first day of President Bush's visit here.
Some measures had been announced earlier, while some merely expanded on existing programs. 
 But in spite of Japan's move, the difficult talks on what could amount to a new approach to managing trade between Japan and the United States appeared to bog down as negotiators worked late into the night but were unable to resolve tough American demands for increased Japanese imports.
"We are waiting to see what the Government of Japan comes forward with as a concrete, tangible set of actions," said a senior Administration official at a news briefing as the talks continued today.
 
Array of Incentives
 The Japanese package announced Tuesday night included an array of subsidized loans and voluntary targets for imports by Japanese corporations. It even included expansion of a program under which the Government offers low-cost financing to promote the export of American goods to developing countries receiving Japanese foreign aid.
Nuboru Hatakeyama, Vice Minister for International Trade and Industry, told foreign reporters at a news conference that the measures would increase Japanese imports over two years by more than $10 billion on products ranging from electronics components to automobiles.
 
More Action Is Sought
 Mr. Hatakeyama said it was not certain how much of the imports would come from the United States, and officials said it could also include products shipped by Japanese-owned factories abroad back to Japan. But officials also indicated that they expected the majority of the imports to come from American-owned companies.
The United States did not officially respond to the announcements. Officials said they were pleased that the Trade Ministry was taking the initiative but said more action was required. "An individual action plan from MITI certainly is not going to take care of the much deeper problem within the Japanese economy, which makes it very resistant to imports," said one American official.
What has struck many here is that the effect of all these measures and those still under negotiation will be a large increase in Government intervention in the market to try to help American-made goods sell here. Both sides have gone out of their way to express their conviction that markets must remain free, but the trade package emerging under heavy political pressure from President Bush's visit will amount to managed trade, many Japanese and some Americans acknowledge.
American officials have said that if successful, these discussions could mark a significant new direction. "I think this could have some long-term profound effects on the trade relationship," the Administration official said.
A key issue still being negotiated, officials on both sides indicated, is the dollar value of American autos and auto parts the Japanese will promise to acquire. Under a voluntary program, Japanese auto companies have said they will increase their purchases of American-made autos and parts to about $17 billion by 1994, from $9 billion now. The United States is said to be asking for a higher figure.
 
Easier Rules Expected
 Japan is also expected to ease some pollution-control regulations and testing standards for imported cars, to offer tax breaks for buyers of imported cars and to encourage Japanese auto companies to sell American-made cars through their extensive sales networks.
Officials on both sides have avoided referring to the import goals under discussion as targets. The Bush Administration has insisted that its only aim is to remove barriers to the free flow of goods and to halt exclusionary business practices in Japan.
"We want agreements that produce permanent improvement in access and in U.S. sales to Japanese markets and permanent improvement in the lives of Japanese consumers," President Bush said on Tuesday in western Japan, where he attended the opening of a Toys "R" Us store.
"We didn't ask them to make concessions," insisted Robert C. Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, who is one of 18 senior American executives accompanying the President. "We're not asking that they give us anything. We're just asking to compete." That, however, does not appear to be the case.
In the mid-1980's, the Reagan Administration negotiated an agreement with Japan to increase America's share of Japan's market for semiconductors to 20 percent, declaring that American manufacturers had been unfairly excluded from the market. Later, however, President Bush's trade negotiators insisted that they were opposed to setting such targets. The series of tense negotiations taking shape here this week on a range of manufactured goods appears to mark a step toward reversing course yet again.
"We are facing a dilemma," Mr. Hatakeyama said. "Theoretically speaking, this type of thing would be better not to exist. But we are experiencing a large trade imbalance with the rest of the world and we think it would be good for the Japanese Government to try everything she can."
He insisted that in Japan the Government could not dictate to private companies, since it has an open economy. He thus described the programs as "a kind of moral campaign" to persuade Japanese companies to import more. As he pointed out, some 88 Japanese corporations have complied so far.
Mr. Hatekeyama also insisted that the figures being discussed were not import "targets" but "estimates."
So far, the Trade Ministry reported, Japanese companies that account for more than 50 percent of Japan's imports and exports have said they will participate in the program to increase imports and links with foreign suppliers.
These range from agreements by Japan's big auto makers to sell American cars through their sales networks -- for instance, Toyota will sell G.M. cars -- to programs to permit more American auto-parts concerns to participate in the design of key parts and components for Japanese autos.
A series of "foreign access zones" will be opened near airports and ports to help imports. The Government will offer more low-cost loans to importers.
Tax breaks and subsidized loans will be offered to help foreign companies seeking to locate in Japan, a means of attracting more foreign direct investment into Japan from the current trickle. The Government will also establish a company to help foreign companies recruit Japanese staff. Under certain conditions foreign companies entering Japan will be offered Government loan guarantees to help them obtain needed bank loans, too.
The Japanese Government said it would also expand a program under which it offers trade financing to promote American exports to projects in developing countries underwritten by Japan. Under this program, which is being carried out in cooperation with the Export-Import Bank in the United States, the Japanese Government said it was likely to finance more than $10 billion in projects over several years, and that the greater part of the imports for these development projects would come from the United States.
That still leaves the negotiators wrestling with the politically sensitive issue of setting goals for sales of American automobiles and parts. It also does not include measures that are expected to be announced by Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady, who arrived in Tokyo on Tuesday.
An unusual level of secrecy has been maintained around Mr. Brady's visit, but there has been widespread speculation that he will be trying to work out financial measures to lift American exports.

HEADLINE: A National Curriculum: Seeking Fairness for All

SERIES: Lessons From Britain: Second of two articles.

BYLINE: By SUSAN CHIRA, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LONDON

 BODY:
The 11-year-olds in Richard Nokes's history class are not having an easy time. They are trying to figure out how ancient Roman roads were built, and their only sources are translations of descriptions by writers of the time.
It is a sophisticated lesson in how to read primary documents, a skill expected of every child now that Britain has a required national curriculum. 
 Just last month, an advisory panel to President Bush recommended that the United States adopt voluntary national curriculum standards and national tests. As the debate begins in the United States, Britain's experience holds several revealing lessons.
 
The Debates Go On
 The British national curriculum has won wide acceptance as a way to raise standards and insure equal educational opportunity, although many teachers and scholars believe it is far too detailed and was rushed into the classroom. The curriculum exposed the need for much more extensive teacher training, particularly in math and science.
New required national tests have proved far trickier. Debates continue on whether they are fair, what form they should take, and whether they discriminate.
Britain is using the same kinds of tests that would be introduced in the United States, ones that avoid formulaic multiple-choice questions and are instead designed to test children's abilities more thoroughly. Yet teachers have criticized them as too time-consuming, and opinions remain divided on whether the tests were simply impractical or whether teachers were not given enough training or time to administer them.
In June 1988, a new education law required a national curriculum for the first time, along with identical national tests for every schoolchild at ages 7, 11 and 14. But minimum levels are not set for specific ages; the idea is to mandate what must be taught, not what must be learned in each grade. The law applies to England and Wales.
For Donald Naismith, a sometime adviser to former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher and now director of education for the London borough of Wandsworth, the national curriculum is a way to enforce higher academic standards and prevent dilution of Britain's national identity. For Jane Traies, the principal of the Swakeleys School, a girls' high school in West London, the national curriculum means that her students will not be allowed to blight their futures by dropping such traditionally "male" courses as math and science.
That these educators, who consider themselves far apart ideologically, both support a national curriculum testifies to the popularity of an idea that not so long ago was heretical.
"I had a lot of anxiety about the national curriculum being a straitjacket," said Kathleen Higgins, director of education and community services for Hillingdon, a West London borough. "But we use it as an entitlement for education for all children. It's like an oyster with grit. We've managed to turn it into something wonderful."
Because Britain has long given national tests at ages 16 and 18 that help determine whether students advance to college, a de facto national curriculum existed for a relatively small, elite group. But only 20 percent of British students attend college, and in many cases poor or working-class students chose or were shunted into less demanding academic tracks.
Now all students through age 14 must study English, science and math, technology, history, geography, art, music, a modern foreign language and physical education. The Government is proposing to make art and music optional after age 14, and to require either history or geography through age 16. The Government has spent almost $1 billion developing the curriculum and tests.
The curriculum, which was drawn up by experts in specific fields but reviewed by Government officials, lists the factual knowledge and the analytical skills children should have at different ages. It breaks down each subject into "attainment targets," areas like genetics and evolution in science, and then describes levels of achievement within those, from basic to advanced.
There are no minimum levels children must achieve by certain a age, although each subject's curriculum outlines a range of levels most children will probably achieve at ages 7, 11, 14 and 16. For example, in science and math, most children would be expected to achieve level 6 or 7 by age 16. Level 10 would be achieved by the brightest college-bound students.
The law does not require specific textbooks or teaching methods. Rather than listing books, the curriculum says students should read "a range of fiction, poetry, literary nonfiction and drama, including pre-20th century literature." Students are required to read Shakespeare and other classic works (for example, the curriculum suggests, but does not require, the Bible and Jane Austen's novels).
Partly because the British curriculum leaves enough room to add whatever books teachers want, the battles over reading classics or including works by women and minorities now raging in the United States have been largely absent in Britain. But the issue of multiculturalism also seems to be less important in Britain, where, despite an increasing immigrant population, minorities do not have as much political power as in the United States.
 
Teachers Must Bear Heavy New Burdens
 For most teachers, however, the biggest problems have not been ideological, but logistical. Teachers have had to endure several dizzying years, studying the new curriculum, overhauling their lesson plans and adjusting to rapid-fire revisions.
Ian Host, head of the science department at the Small Heath High School in Birmingham, spent most of last year figuring out how to plan lessons that matched the 17 attainment targets and 10 levels of achievement in the curriculum. Meanwhile, the Government, responding to complaints that the curriculum was too unwieldy, reduced the number of attainment targets first from 17 to 5, and then to 4.
Lord Griffiths, who heads the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council, charged with overseeing the testing process, said that two-thirds of the attainment targets were still measured by teachers, not tests.
The hardest-hit teachers are in elementary schools, where many of the national curriculum subjects are being taught for the first time and teachers are especially unfamiliar with math and science requirements. Five-year-olds, for example, are supposed to be introduced to the concept of probability. David Hart, president of the National Association of Head Teachers, says teachers in "infant schools," for children from 5 to 7, are reeling. "The poor old infant teachers are so overloaded there is a danger the basics are being neglected," he said.
Indeed, introducing the curriculum has shown an urgent need for better teacher training, an issue the National Curriculum Council will examine, said its chairman, David Pascall.
Despite the frenetic pace, the neglect of teacher training, and what even Government officials agree is an unwieldy curriculum, surveys have consistently found that teachers welcomed the continuity, higher standards and sense of priorities the national curriculum brought.
"For very good schools, it is a dampener on innovation," said Margaret Maden, director of education for the county of Warwickshire, in central England. "But it has meant improvement for a lot of schools."
Testing is at the core of all the changes -- because it provides a way to check whether the high standards of the national curriculum are actually being met and a way to give parents adequate information so they can choose among schools.
But precisely because students, teachers and schools will all be judged by test results, the stakes are high and the debate contentious.
 
First Tests Create A Long Nightmare
 The first tests for 7-year-olds were just given last year. By all accounts, teachers found the experience a nightmare. They reported working an average of 58 hours a week giving the tests and struggling to figure out how to grade them. For teachers already strained by all the changes of the past few years, national tests worsened morale even further.
The tests were designed to be very different from the traditional exams familiar to generations of students, exams in which children facing a time limit wrote down answers. Instead, children were asked to guess in advance whether certain substances would sink or float, for example, or were given two magnets and asked to explain how to determine which one was stronger. They were also rated on longer-term projects, such as predicting and recording weather changes for several weeks.
 
Eye on the Workplace
 These "performance-based" tests are exactly the ones that testing experts in the United States want to see introduced as part of American national tests. They are better than traditional tests, experts argue, because they give children a fairer chance to demonstrate what they know and because they test skills needed in the workplace, such as reasoning ability.
Many British teachers, however, found the workload overwhelming, and the Government quickly issued a list of changes for this spring's round of tests. Half the tests for 7-year-olds will now be the "paper and pencil" variety, the science and math experiments were dropped, a spelling test was introduced, and teachers were given more time to conduct exams. Tim Eggar, the Government's second-ranking education official, said the initial tests for 7-year-olds were simply impractical. "There was a very commendable desire to assess as much of a child's different skills and knowledge base as possible," he said. "This inevitably resulted in a very elaborate system of testing. We've been dragging that back to reality. You've got to have a relatively simple testing system given in a reasonable time frame by an average classroom teacher dealing with an average class."
Lord Griffiths of the Schools Examinations and Assessment Council said the initial tests tried to serve too many purposes at once -- evaluating students and teachers, judging schools, communicating to parents. American tests now being drawn up also try to combine several purposes.
Yet support for the new "performance" style of tests remains strong, even among the same teachers who complained about the time such tests took to administer.
"The idea of written exams as the be-all and end-all belongs to the Victorian days of empire," said Ms. Traies. "Then they needed clerks to fill out forms in triplicate. What this country needs is people who can work cooperatively in groups."
Several educators said the tests themselves were good, but that teachers were not given enough training, time or aides to help watch the class while teachers gave the tests to small groups. Many hope not to see a return to paper-and-pencil tests because, they argue, these have tended to favor more privileged children.
"I am worried that the tests will be used to categorize and label pupils, and that the evidence on which they'll be labeled will not necessarily be reliable," said Peter Mortimore, deputy director of London University's Institute of Education, who helped draft some of the early tests. "This could be disastrous in a system which traditionally does well by the brightest and disastrously by the others."
Results from last year's tests showed that in one-third of the cases, teachers had underestimated their students' abilities -- particularly in the case of minority students. Professor Mortimore said that it was precisely because the tests were sophisticated that they were able to demonstrate the potential of so many students.
But Lord Griffiths and Mr. Eggar argued that this discrepancy showed just how much tests were needed to check teachers' assumptions. They say that the very labeling of children that critics fear the tests will bring about is already done by teachers.
Furthermore, said John Marks, who also serves on the testing council, tests can uncover problems and help children while there is still time. "You're not damaging their future by condemning them to some lower-ability rung, but saying here's some youngsters who need different treatment," he said. "If you've got a child who can't read, he can't get on. It's no good saying, 'I'm from a deprived background.' "

Chart: "Genetics and Evolution, Step by Step"
 
This category is one of the attainment targets of the science curriculum now required in British schools. There are no minimum requirements, but the anticipated norms are that children at age 7 would achieve from levels 1 to 3; at age 11, from levels 2 to 5; at age 15, from levels 3 to 7; at age 16, from levels 4 to 10
 
Level - Goal for pupils
 
1. Know that human beings vary form one individual to the next.
2. Be able to measure simple differences between people.
3. Know that some life forms became extinct a long time ago and others more recently.
4. Be able to measure variations in living organisms.
5. Know that information in the form of genes is passed on from one generation to the next.
6. Know that variation in living organisms has both genetic and environmental causes.
 
Know that some diseases can be inherited.
 
10. Be able to analyze a range of monohybrid crosses involving both dominance and co-dominance.
 
Understand how DNA replicates itself and ocntrols protein synthesis by means of a base code.
 
Understand the basic principles of genetic engineering in relation to drug and hormone production.
 
Be able to make informed judgment about the economic, social and ethical issues concerning the recent developments in genetic engineering.

HEADLINE: Message to Albany: Bah-Humbug

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 7

 BODY:
It is a symptom of the times that New York State's credit rating has become not only a financial benchmark but a significant political one as well.
 In the last two years, the state's credit rating has twice been downgraded because of the inability of its leaders to balance the budget. In both cases, Wall Street rating agencies have made it clear that the dismal grades were given primarily for the state's political failure, not the sluggishness of its economy. 
That was certainly so on Monday when Moody's Investors Service lowered the rating on the state's appropriation-backed debt from A to Baa1, the second-lowest rating of any state. In a three-page statement, Moody's dedicated only a fraction of a sentence to what it called "protracted weakness in the economy."
 The rest of the statement focused on the state's failure to close its $875 million budget gap, the anticipated growth of the state's accumulated deficit, and the inability to restructure budget priorities in any fundamental way. All, it suggested, were failures of political will.
 
Partisan Blame Avoided
 What the rating agency avoided, both in its statement and in interviews, was the apportionment of blame to either the Republicans who control the State Senate or the Democrats who control the Assembly and sit in the governor's office.
 "There's plenty of culpability," said George W. Leung, the vice president and managing director for state debt ratings at Moody's. "The issue of paralysis is what we're concerned about."
 But what the state's politicians seem most concerned about, particularly in an election year, is how to shift the onus for the downgrading to the opposition. Indeed, some political leaders -- including the state Democratic chairman, John A. Marino, and the Assembly minority leader, Clarence D. Rappleyea Jr., a Norwich Republican -- have suggested that the other party deliberately instigated the downgrading in order to use it later as a political club.
 On the eve of his State of the State address, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo reiterated in a news conference today the argument he had made in the weeks leading to the downgrading.
 
Welfare Stereotype
 The Senate Republicans, he said, had deliberately refused to reach a budget compromise because they believe that their unbending insistence on deep cuts in welfare and Medicaid programs will help them in the November election.
 Mr. Cuomo said that in demanding cuts in welfare grants and limits on Medicaid benefits for some welfare recipients, the Republicans were playing on the stereotype of welfare as a benefit to "a big minority swigging a can of beer who could work and says: 'No, I don't want to. I want to spend your money.' "
 "I don't see any justification for that except you can sell it to people," Mr. Cuomo said. "You can con them."
 The Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, who is no relation to John A. Marino, responded that the Moody's statement made it clear that the raters were looking for structural reforms in the state budget, meaning cuts in social services that the Democrats are unwilling to make.
 
'Structural' vs. 'Silly' 
 "They now openly taunt the raters by continuing to insist on a deficit plan that contains no structural reforms," Mr. Marino said in a statement.
 Vincent Tese, the state's economic development commissioner, said that Mr. Marino's argument was "silly."
 "The market and the raters know there are philosophical differences between the way Democrats view things and the way Republicans view things," he said. "But they expect you to be able to bridge that for the good of the state. What they want to see is a balanced budget."
 Whoever is right, the cost of the downgrading to the state is undeniable. Although Mr. Cuomo said his budget analysts had not determined how much the downgrading would cost in extra interest on future bond sales, bond traders reported an immediate impact today on the state's appropriation-backed debt.
 Several Wall Street traders said the yields on such bonds had risen today anywhere from 8 to 20 basis points, meaning that sellers suffered from declining bond prices. Duncan K. Smith, the senior managing director of Lebenthal & Company, said, however, that the full impact of the downgrading would not be known until the state sells a new bond issue.
 Moody's intended its downgrading to spur the state into action, warning that the rating on the state's general obligation bonds would be threatened by a continued impasse. That downgrading would send an even more severe signal to the credit markets.
 Instead, the paralysis deplored by Mr. Leung only seemed to deepen. Mr. Cuomo said today that he had finally given up hope of negotiating a multiyear financial plan aimed at closing both the $875 million gap in this year's $30 billion budget and the $4 billion gap projected for the fiscal year beginning on April 1.
 The Senate Republicans said they continued to hold out hope for such a plan, even though Moody's said in its statement that "references to a 15-month plan are no longer realistic."
 Mr. Cuomo also seemed to hold out little optimism for patching together a more traditional deficit reduction plan that would close this year's gap through spending cuts and other emergency measures. He said the state could eliminate about $400 million of this year's $875 million gap through spending freezes and other administrative actions, but that it would have to borrow to close the rest of the gap.
 That would mark the fourth consecutive year that the state has had to borrow significantly to close an end-of-the-year deficit, a record that the credit raters have criticized loudly.

Cuomo addressed the state's credit rating at a news conference yesterday, saying that Senate Republicans' deliberate refusal to reach a budget compromise was caused by their unbending insistence on deep cuts in welfare and Medicaid programs, a stand that may help them in November.

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN;
ACCORD ANNOUNCED BY U.S. AND JAPAN TO SPUR ECONOMIES

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Thursday, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In the first agreement to emerge from the summit meeting here between President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa, the United States and Japan announced a broad commitment on Wednesday to try to lift the world economy from a looming slowdown by adopting budgetary and interest-rate policies that would promote faster growth.
The aim is to focus the domestic policies of the world's two largest economies clearly on expansion rather than on fighting inflation, with the hope that Europe's leading industrial economies will follow suit and create momentum for a period of healthier growth after an anemic 1991. 
 While the strategy was warmly supported by Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa, who held their first full day of talks on Wednesday, officials acknowledged that it was not a blueprint for definite policy measures.
 
Conforms to U.S. Policy
 Neither the United States nor Japan made specific promises on what steps it would take should it fall short of the growth projections. The announcement was a statement of intent -- but a potentially meaningful one because of the influence of the two countries involved, and one that it is hoped will have a positive psychological impact.
The agreement is in line with policy goals President Bush has already set, but it called for Japan, and later possibly some European countries, to put a greater emphasis on economic growth than they had been intending.
The two countries have already cut their interest rates sharply in recent weeks in steps that officials here said were taken in keeping with the desire for more rapid economic growth. The Japanese Government also announced a budget for the coming fiscal year that includes heavy spending on projects like new roads, sewers and bridges to stimulate quicker economic expansion.
 
Administration Expectations
 One Administration priority for the trip will not be fulfilled. Mr. Bush will return with no financial commitment from Japan for the giant $8.4 billion superconducting supercollider in Texas, raising new doubts about the project's future. [Page A9.]
And the American auto executives who accompanied Mr. Bush found few areas of agreement with the Japanese. Still, negotiators for the two governments appeared close to an agreement today on Japanese purchases of American-made autos and auto parts. The Japanese Foreign Ministry even said a basic agreement had been reached, but American official were not yet confirming that. [A10.]
The Bush Administration expects the American economy to begin rebounding by the middle of this year at the latest. In the meantime, Mr. Bush's options are limited by the huge Federal budget deficit, his ideological proclivities and a Congress controlled by the opposition party.
The expectation is that in his State of the Union Message on Jan. 28, the President will propose a capital gains tax cut, a modest tax reduction for middle-class taxpayers and some new tax incentives for home building, savings and business investment. But he has promised to offset all his proposed tax cuts with spending reductions elsewhere in the budget, and he will not recommend big new public works projects. Moreover, in an election year, his proposals are likely to be debated vigorously in Congress, where passage is uncertain.
Coming during an election year, the accord announced here also creates an environment that may help the President restart the stalled American economy, if other countries, particularly Germany, can be persuaded to lower interest rates and adopt policies to stimulate their economies.
Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady said a senior Treasury aide was already in Europe trying to organize this concerted economic campaign. A broader agreement to promote world growth may be announced when the finance ministers of the seven leading industrial nations meet later this month, American officials said.
"This action reflects recognition that the two countries have a special responsibility to pursue domestic policies that will strengthen the world economy," Mr. Brady said.
Like most of what is emerging at this unusual summit meeting, it was largely a political document, but one that underscored a new priority for Japan and the United States, which together account for 40 percent of the world economy.
"It is a confidence-building gesture, but an important one," insisted one official involved in the negotiations. "Psychologically, it will make a difference for businessmen to see that growth is a priority."
 
Commitment to Growth
 Yuichi Ezawa, a senior Finance Ministry official, said, "The important thing is that Japan and the United States expressed the same interest."
The announcement of "A Strategy for World Growth" came on Wednesday as extensive talks between the leaders and difficult trade negotiations that were marred when President Bush suddenly became ill. White House officials said Mr. Bush had the flu and would be able to resume a lighter schedule today.
The illness raised questions, however, over whether President Bush would return with the principal goal of this meeting, a significant trade agreement that the United States hopes will increase Japanese purchases of American autos, auto parts and other goods.
Those talks have been contentious, with the United States insisting that the Japanese make a detailed commitment on imports of American autos, auto parts and other goods in an effort to narrow Japan's yawning trade surplus.
There are reports that Japan is preparing to offer to increase such purchases by billions of dollars a year.
Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security adviser and a participant in the meetings between the President and the Prime Minister, said Wednesday's discussions ranged from the American military presence in Asia to the changes taking place in the former Soviet Union and efforts to force North Korea to halt a nuclear weapons program. They also discussed the peace process in Cambodia.
President Bush urged Japan to push forward in various trade negotiations, Mr. Scowcroft said. Mr. Bush contended, Mr. Scowcroft said, that Japan's markets were not as open as they should be to imports, and he raised the issue of access to foreign-made automobiles, auto parts, computers, financial services, glass, paper and other products.
One area where the two leaders were in agreement was the new economic strategy to lift world growth. But officials said it was also the product of some difficult negotiations in which both sides had to make compromises.
Mr. Ezawa of the Finance Ministry said American officials had been urging Japan to take stronger measures to insure that it achieves its target of 3.5 percent growth in the coming fiscal year, which begins April 1.
The Japanese economy was projected to grow 3.8 percent in the current fiscal year, but is likely to have expanded by about 3 percent when the year closes at the end of March, economists say. The growth rate slowed sharply in the latter half of the year.
 
Economists' Reaction
 Economists welcomed Wednesday's agreement and said Japan should be able to meet its growth target.
"This is definitely achievable," said Yoshihisa Kitai, the senior economist at the Long-Term Credit Bank. "It depends on the willingness of the Japanese Government, and now they have said they have the will."

HEADLINE: Wilder Ends Race for Presidency, Citing Virginia's Fiscal Troubles

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Unable to come up with a message or an organization that promised success in the 1992 Presidential race, Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia came up tonight with the biggest surprise of the youthful campaign: he pulled out of the contest.
Mr. Wilder, the first black ever elected governor of an American state, said he did not have the time to seek the Democratic nomination for President and also to run the state of Virginia, which faces its worst budget crisis in half a century because of the current recession. 
 "Long before I announced for President," Mr. Wilder said in Richmond in his annual State of the Commonwealth address to the General Assembly, "I said that if it became too difficult for me to govern the Commonwealth and conduct a Presidential campaign, I would terminate one endeavor. I was left with a choice: either to devote all of my energies to delivering the message or to guiding Virginia through these difficult times. I have chosen the latter."
His explanation for getting out of the race was essentially the same that another Governor, Mario M. Cuomo of New York, recently gave when he announced that he would not enter the race. But unlike Mr. Wilder, Mr. Cuomo enjoyed universally high poll ratings, the promise of ample campaign financing and the prospect that with the help of numerous political allies he could put together a smoothly functioning campaign organization.
Mr. Wilder's announcement caught all but his closest advisers by surprise and injected a new element of suspense into the race for the Democratic nomination.
Mr. Wilder, a grandson of slaves who was born in poverty in Richmond and then struggled to become not only Governor but also a trial lawyer and a millionaire, had been angling for a major share of the nation's black vote. Now that vote, about one of every five Democrats, is more than ever up for grabs by the remaining five major Democratic candidates.
Black voters play an important role both in the March 3 primary in Maryland and the March 7 primary in South Carolina, as well as in the flurry of primaries in Southern and border states on March 10, Super Tuesday. His Democratic rivals had never ceded the black vote to the 60-year-old Governor the way Democrats ceded it to the Rev. Jesse Jackson in 1988, but he was still thought to have considerable strength there.
 
Help for Clinton
 At first glance, Mr. Wilder's withdrawal could be a particular boon to Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the only Southerner among the remaining major candidates. Mr. Clinton is counting on a strong showing in the Super Tuesday primaries.
"I have known and respected Doug Wilder for years and I understand and respect his decision," Mr. Clinton said tonight in a statement released at a campaign stop in Oklahoma. "We haven't heard the last of Doug Wilder, and I look forward to the contributions he will continue to make this year and in the years ahead."
Still, other campaigns were eyeing the Wilder support. "We'll be moving aggressively to let Wilder supporters know that their support is welcome," said Lorraine Voles, press secretary to Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa.
Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska said: "No American can look at the personal and political courage of Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder without feeling a sense of pride for all that he has accomplished in his life."
The Wilder campaign was troubled almost from the day the Governor announced his candidacy on Sept. 13, standing on the steps of the Virginia Capitol. He said then that he was "the longest of long shots."
He had fairly high name recognition around the country, a factor that sometimes made him look good in polls. But there was no depth of support.
 
Less Than $1 Million Raised
 When questioned at length, prospective voters said they found the Wilder message lacking in substance, heavy on symbolism but short on detail about what the Governor intended to do about the flagging economy, soaring health care costs and other problems.
The latest Federal figures on campaign money raised by candidates showed Mr. Wilder trailing all major Democrats, with less than $1 million taken in, half of that in matching Government money. His campaign staff was little more than skeletal: seven paid workers in New Hampshire, the first primary state, and none in Maryland and South Carolina, where the next major tests will take place.
As late as 6 P.M. today, the Governor's staff was cranking out campaign schedules, and his advisers were laying plans to film television advertisements in New Hampshire. He was due to visit Baltimore on Thursday
"We're in it all the way, from New Hampshire on," Joe Trippi, the Wilder television advertising consultant, said in mid-afternoon when asked whether the Governor would make a major advertising push in New Hampshire.
In a statement released after the Governor's annual address to the General Assembly, in which he waited until the very end to discuss his Presidential plans, Mr. Wilder said he originally got into the 1992 race because "a job had to be done and a message spoken."
"I am concerned about the direction this country is headed and recognize the need for leadership," he continued. "I have the vision, experience and fortitude that is necessary to help reverse this dangerous trend and put this great nation of ours on the right track again."
Some polls, he noted, showed him doing well, particularly in Maryland and South Carolina. What he did not say was that the poll takers attributed much of his high standing in those states to name recognition.
Nor did Mr. Wilder mention in his speech to the General Assembly, some of whose members cheered his withdrawal, that polls in his home state showed his popularity steadily falling, to the point that his political future even there was more and more in doubt. Under state law, he cannot succeed himself as Governor, but he could run for another office, like a United States Senate seat.
In his campaign speeches, Mr. Wilder portrayed himself as "a fiscal conservative with a social conscience." Then he would point out that while other states were raising taxes in an effort to counter the national recession, he forced Virginia to make do by cutting its budget, not by imposing new taxes. Yet when pressed to say whether he was a conservative, a liberal or a moderate, he would insist he was none of them, which many political experts found difficult to comprehend.
In the 1989 Virginia Governor's race, Mr. Wilder had steered clear of race as an issue and had managed the considerable feat of putting together a winning coalition of blacks and moderate whites. He began his 1992 Presidential quest in the same manner but began to hammer upon the racial issue his campaign faltered. By today, the main thrust of his campaign was aimed at black voters.

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN;
Excerpts From the White House Briefings on Bush's Condition

BYLINE: By Reuters

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from briefings by Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, in Tokyo yesterday and today about President Bush's health:
 
OPENING STATEMENT YESTERDAY
President Bush is in his suite at the Akasaka Palace and is feeling fine following a bout with the flu. The President's personal physician, Dr. Burton Lee, said the President is in good shape and probably will feel okay tomorrow. 
 Before tonight's state dinner, at Prime Minister Miyazawa's official residence, President Bush told his physician that he felt somewhat ill. Dr. Lee examined the President and determined that he had a touch of the flu, but the President wanted to attend the state dinner. During the dinner tonight at approximately 8:20 P.M., the President slumped over in his chair, was feeling weak, and was helped to the floor by Secret Service agents.
The President recovered in a few minutes and remarked to his agents, "I just wanted to get a little attention."
Dr. Lee, who was also attending the dinner, was at the President's side immediately and determined there was no need for special assistance as the President left the dinner to return to his suite.
The President stood up, waved to the crowd, and walked to his car for the drive back to the residence here in Tokyo. Mrs. Bush stayed at the dinner, and Gen. Brent Scowcroft, the President's national security advisor, delivered the President's toast.
Dr. Lee reports tonight that the President has a case of gastroenteritis, commonly known as intestinal flu. The President was administered a dose of Tigan to control nausea and has gone to bed. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	When the President was asked how he felt by your pool upon leaving the dinner, he said, "I feel good."
The latest information is that the President is asleep at the hotel, and he was suffering from the flu.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q. (inaudible)
A. He was in what we might call a faint condition, in the sense that he slumped over at the table, was conscious, however, and was helped to the floor by the leader of his Secret Service detail.
He remained on the floor for just a few minutes and then as I said, he got up on his own power and walked to the car.
Q. How do you know it's not a recurrence of the previous episode, that it's the flu that caused it, and not the previous heart condition?
A. Dr. Lee has examined the President and has determined that there's no connection whatsoever with the atrial fibrillation that the President experienced earlier.
A. Earlier today you said he had taken half a tablet of Halcion. Do you think -- did the doctor say that had any effect on him, that could have been a cause of it?
Q. I don't have any idea. I don't have any information on that.
Q. Are any further tests planned of the President?
A. The President of course is under the care and supervision of Dr. Lee and his medical staff. Dr. Roberts was also at the dinner, so there were two physicians there at the time. And they will remain with him at the palace and will watch his progress through the night and tomorrow. But they do not expect any difficulty.
Q. Do you have any special monitoring going on through the night as when he had his atrial fibrillation, he wore a portable device, anything extraordinary tonight?
A. Nothing extraordinary tonight. Dr. Lee does not feel there's any special monitoring required. All aspects of the examination indicate that it is a common case of the flu.
Q. Often in cases of intestinal flu there's nausea. Was the President nauseous when he slumped to the floor, or was there any vomiting or anything like that?
A. Yes, he was nauseous. He did vomit just before he slumped to the floor, and the medicine that he was given this evening was for his nausea.
Q. If the President was able to walk to his car under his own power, why was his departure obscured deliberately by security officers?
A. That precaution is always undertaken so that there's no impediment to efficient treatment of the President.
Q. Marlin, can you tell us what time the ambulance was called and why that was considered prudent at some point?
A. That also is a routine procedure if there's any kind of illness where the President's doctors determine that that could be necessary, and therefore certainly every precaution was taken.
But it was also quickly determined that that would not be necessary.
Q. Could you update us please, Marlin, on the medication that the President was taking for the atrial fibrillation, and whether in fact all of those medications are over, or is he still taking that?
A. All of that medication has been terminated several months ago.
Q. One follow up question, please. Where is Vice President Quayle and has he been notified of ----
A. The deputy chief of staff, Andrew Card, who was at the dinner also with the President, notified chief of staff Skinner in Washington, who in turn notified the Vice President and all other appropriate officials. But there was no need for any special alarm, there was no need for any special alerts to any aspect of the Government, and the notification was simply for information only so that when Government officials, including the Vice President saw these reports on television, that they would know that it's a case of the flu and there's no special concern. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	Q. Is this the first time during his trip that the President has complained of feeling ill in some way? And is there any consideration of changing the way the President's hectic travel schedule is arranged?
A. It's the first time that I'm aware of that there's been any concern at all. The President's schedule is one that he has carried out in similar fashion for more than three years, one that he enjoys. He has a very rigorous schedule. He is a very physical and able man, and I don't expect any changes.
 
OPENING STATEMENT TODAY
 President Bush got a decent night's sleep last night. He awoke at about 6:30 this morning. He's up and about at the Akasaka Palace. He still is suffering from some weakness related to the flu, but the major symptoms have subsided.
All of the President's vital signs this morning are normal, as they were last night. There is no indication of any illness other than the common flu. No medication has been prescribed for today.
I spoke with the President this morning. He is in good spirits. He is concerned about the inconvenience caused to dinner guests last night. He joked he might have a large dry cleaning bill to deal with.
This morning, the President made a number of telephone calls, including to Vice President Quayle, chief of staff Skinner and members of his family.
Dr. Burton Lee, the President's physician, reports that the President is in overall excellent health and should recover from this bout with the flu in a normal period of time. In fact, the President expects to resume much of his schedule here in Tokyo this afternoon. . . .
The President feels the trip is going very well and hopes that this episode will not detract from the overall focus of the visit. He thanks Prime Minister Miyazawa for his many courtesies last night and looks forward to the business meeting with him this afternoon.
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS

 	 	 		. . .	 	The state dinner tonight is still on, the President plans to attend. There are no changes at this point.
 
Precautionary Tests
 Q. Have any precautionary tests been made, such as an electrocardiogram?
A. The doctors are certain that there is no other illness or any other problems related to this, that it's a simple case of the flu. The President is human, he gets sick, and I would refer you to last night's pool report that said that half the press corps has been sick with the flu since we left.
 
Lost Consciousness
 Q. Marlin, did the President at any point in fact lose consciousness?
A. I don't know. He fainted, fell down behind the table, and was up in just a few seconds. As you know, Dr. Lee was right there, noticed that he was looking pale earlier, so was right beside him. Dr. Lee said that he was just there on the floor. Dr. Lee asked him to stay motionless for a few minutes until he could be sure of his condition. So I think a fainted condition is the best description.
 
Types of Gastroenteritis
 Q. Gastroenteritis has a couple of different forms: one is viral, one is from an irritation. Can you tell us which this is?
A. I don't know that, no. I don't know.
 
On Contagion
 Q. Is he contagious, Marlin, do we know?
A. We don't believe he is, no.
 
Ambulance Refused
 A. Do we know who made the decision, whether it was the President's own decision to use the limousine rather than the ambulance?
A. It was the doctor and the security.
 
Tests Given to Bush
 Q. Can you tell us the tests that the President has undergone? Did he have an electrocardiogram? Was his heart rate checked?
A. No, I won't go into any of the tests, but suffice it to say that there is no indication of any illness other than the flu. He's under no medication of any kind today. He's recovering in an absolutely normal way, and it's a very common flu.
 
On Fainting
 Q. Last night you said that the President had not lost consciousness. Now you seem to be suggesting that he may have for a few seconds. Can you clarify that, please?
A. He fainted. All his vital signs were normal. That's all I'm willing to say about the tests, and that was the same last night and this morning.
 
Role of Halcion
 Q. Do you have any more information today about the President's taking Halcion?
A. No, I don't have any indication. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Bush's Next Appearance
 Q. When's the first time we're going to see the President today?
A. You will see him at the bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Miyazawa, which is about 1:30. . . .
 
Officials Telephoned
 Q. Did he talk to anyone else besides Skinner, his family and Quayle?
A. No, just the ones I mentioned. He was making other phone calls so by now he may have talked to more, but as of 8:00, those are who he'd talked to.
 
Schedule Changes
 Q. Marlin, so he's not -- he's canceling this morning? He's not participating in this morning bilat that he was going to do, the extended bilateral?
A. That's moved to this afternoon, the 1:30. All the meetings that were on the schedule are being retained on the schedule, but they're being -- they'll be put on this afternoon instead of this morning. . . .
 
Bush's Plans
 Q. What's President Bush going to be doing, just resting till this afternoon?
A. Yes, he's just resting.
 
Current Symptoms
 Q. Well, what symptoms does he now have? If he hasn't got a fever and he's normal, then what are the symptoms that tell you he still has the flu?
A. He's a little weak from the loss of fluids last night and is resting for that, and he has a little bit of nausea. He's sipping fluids at this point.
 
Solid Food
 Q. Has he had any solid food since last night?
A. Has not had solid foods.
Q. When will he have food again, do you know?
A. Don't know.
Q. Has he been sick to his stomach since last night?
A. No, he has not.
 
Medications Taken
 Q. Do you know what medication he has taken on this trip other than halcyon?
A. Tigan is the only thing, for nausea, taken last night.
Q. No heart medication? Nothing else?
A. No.
Q. How about his thyroid medicine?
A. All of that medication has been completed.
Q. Even the thyroid?
A. Well, the thyroid's a continuing thing, yes, but there's no connection. . . .
 
Back to Work?
 Q. Has he conducted any business this morning?
A. Just the phone calls that I've mentioned. One more question.
 
Miyazawa Meeting
 Q. The afternoon meeting with Miyazawa, is that going to be continuing negotiations on the trade stuff, or has this been pretty well buttoned up?
A. No, it will be across-the-board discussions. As you know, the meetings were going on last night and still this morning with the Foreign Ministry and the U.S. traveling officials on all the various sectoral questions. Those meetings are continuing again this morning. We feel progress has been made, but they have not buttoned up at this point.
 
Bush's Role in Talks
 Q. Is the President going to have to involve himself today in these negotiations to button up the action plan, or is he basically leaving that now to Mosbacher and Brady?
A. I don't expect any of them to be involved in the negotiations. Those are being handled by our State Department officials who've been working at the Foreign Ministry. The President's conversations with the Prime Minister relate to security matters as well as some general economic matters.
But the negotiations on sectoral changes are being conducted at the ministerial level.
 
Changing Routine
 Q. Last night you suggested that there wasn't any need to change the President's habit of a rigorous schedule on these trips. Isn't there an element of common sense if, for example, a 67-year-old man who has the flu doesn't play tennis, doesn't take sleeping pills and so on -- why not change?
A. Well, common sense would say there's a lot of 67-year-old people who play tennis and do those things, and it's quite normal for the President. There's not reason to not do it.
Q. (Inaudible)
A. And that's his normal routine -- he's a vigorous man, very healthy. There's no reason for him to change his schedule at all.
 
Doctor's Orders
 Q. Marlin, whose decision was it to cancel this morning's events? Did he make that decision or was he told by the doctor that he shouldn't ---- (inaudible)?
A. No, that's a collective decision by the staff.
 
Tone of Talks
 Q. You described those talks last night as severe and a lot of pressure being put on. Has the character of them changed in any way? Have any agreements been reached? Or have they continued to be hard-fought battles?
A. The sectoral discussions are all hard-fought battles. I would say there are very tough negotiations going on. Both sides have very strong positions and a lot at stake, and we're working those very hard.
 
Results of Meetings
 Q. Well, are you in a position to say whether there will be any specific substantive achievements, or will you leave here with nothing resolved?
A. We feel very encouraged by the whole process. We think we've already had a very successful trip, and it will be even more successful by the time we're ready to leave.
Q. That really doesn't answer the question whether there will be specific accomplishments.
A. There have already been specific accomplishments, and there will be more.
 
Points of Accord
 Q. On the trade talks, can you say that there have been, aside from the tough talks still continuing, several areas of agreement yet, or are they just all contentious?
A. There are several areas of agreement, there are several areas that are still being discussed.
 
Bush's Campaign
 Q. The President has said quite a few times that the only thing that might make him change his mind about running for re-election is health.
A. That doesn't include the flu.
Q. Well, that's the question. Can you tell us that this episode will have absolutely no effect on his re-election plans?
A. It will have absolutely no effect on his re-election plans. Thank you very much.

HEADLINE: Politics Reign at Spotted Owl Hearing

BYLINE: By TIMOTHY EGAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PORTLAND, Ore., Jan. 8

 BODY:
For only the third time in history the Cabinet-level committee known as the "God squad" began deliberations today on whether certain economic activities of man are more important than the potential extinction of an animal species.
But the hearings here by the panel, the Endangered Species Committee, concerning the northern spotted owl were only a few minutes old when it became dominated by internal conflicts of the Bush Administration over environmental policies. 
 Today, in a surprise move, the Environmental Protection Agency, which has harshly criticized Government policies that favor logging in the Pacific Northwest, abruptly withdrew from the hearings before Administrative Law Judge Harvey Sweitzer, taking with it some of the most crucial evidence on behalf of saving the owl.
 
'There Was a Deal'
 While the agency's lawyer, Tim Backstrom, offered no explanation for the withdrawal from the fact-finding hearings, critics said that political pressure had been brought against them.
"There was a deal struck here somewhere," said Victor Sher, a lawyer with the Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund. "To withdraw on the eve of a trial is wrong and inexplicable."
Gordon Bender, chief of staff to the agency's Administrator, William K. Reilly, said in Washington that the agency no longer needed to participate in the hearings because other administrative means had been developed for bringing information to the committee.
Ultimately, the decision on whether the Bureau of Land Management can be granted an exemption from the Endangered Species Act rests with the seven-member committee, which will vote in March. But that group, called "the God squad" because of its authority to let a species become extinct if it decides that saving jobs is more important, must make its decision based on the record developed in these hearings, which are expected to last about a month.
"After what happened this morning, we are concerned that the process is seriously flawed," said Melinda Bruce, a lawyer with the state of Oregon.
The withdrawal of the Government environmental advocate comes at a time when other Bush Administration leaders are attacking the Endangered Species Act.
The landmark 1973 law, one of the nation's most powerful pieces of environmental legislation, comes up for reauthorization by Congress this year. While the law has led to protection for 639 threatened or endangered species, critics, including the Secretary of Interior, whose job it is to enforce the act, say it has caused economic turmoil, particularly here in the northwest timber country, where logging on Federal land has been restricted to protect the owl.
"I have come to the conclusion in dealing with more than 25 endangered species that the way we do this thing is all wrong," said Manuel Lujan Jr., the Interior Secretary, in Washington. "My job is to protect these species, but by the same token I must make available to the American people these natural resources."
Mr. Lujan said he was in favor of changing the law so that, rather than saving individual species, it would give protection to whole ecosystems. "This law was meant to be used as a shield but instead it has been used as a sword," Mr. Lujan said. "It is not just the spotted owl. The Delta smelt, Colorado squaw fish, the desert tortoise. There is no end to it."
The Endangered Species Committee, which is headed by Mr. Lujan, can let logging proceed in the old growth forest that is home to the owl in Oregon if the group finds that economic considerations outweigh those of the owl's significance.
But the hearings today showed just how divided the Government's house is. Two agencies, both of them part of the Interior Department, are pitted against each other in the fact-finding proceedings here before Judge Sweitzer.
"It's like an inter-family feud," said Mr. Lujan. "I feel like two of my children are going at it." But critics say that because of his criticism of the Endangered Species Act, he is incapable of making an impartial decision.
 
Question of Logging
 One agency, the Bureau of Land Management, has asked that it be allowed to go ahead with logging on about 4,500 acres of Federal land in western Oregon on which fewer than 50 owls depend.
Fewer than 500 of the birds are left in existence. The owl was listed as a threatened species in 1990.
Another agency, the Fish and Wildlife Service, has said that logging would imperil the owl. It is that agency's role in these hearings to act as the protector and defender of the owl.
In opening statements today Government lawyers offered contrary views of what is at stake.
If the logging cannot proceed on the Federal land in question, "it is far more likely to result in homeless people rather than homeless owls," said Robert W. Nesbit, a lawyer with the Bureau of Land Management.
The timber industry has run into hard times, in part because of environmental restrictions and in part because the recession has caused homebuilding and demand for wood to slump. Because timber demand is down, no jobs would be lost by not cutting the 200- to 500-year-old trees in question, said Patrick Parenteau, a lawyer for the Fish and Wildlife Service.
"There's no need for this timber at this time," he said in his opening statement. "But because there is so little of this old growth left, the mere existence of it has economic benefits. Cutting down the last of the magnificent old growth forest in the Pacific Northwest does nothing to advance the economic vision of the region."
The question of economic value is crucial. Under normal circumstances, job or monetary loss is not considered in whether to grant endangered species designations. But it weighs heavily in the "God squad" deliberations.
Five members of the committee must vote to approve an exemption from the Endangered Species Act.

Diplomats seeking a negotiated settlement of Haiti's three-month political crisis say that the country's deposed President, the Rev. Jean-Bertrand Aristide, has endorsed the nomination of a leading political rival as Prime Minister in a compromise arrangement that would eventually bring about his return from exile.
Officials from the Organization of American States, which has sponsored negotiations for Father Aristide's return, said today that after two days of discussions with Haitian parliamentary leaders in Venezuela, the deposed President had accepted the nomination of Rene Theodore, one of two names put forward by the legislators, to be his Prime Minister. 
 Mr. Theodore, a founder of the Haitian Unified Communist Party whom American diplomats have described as a "moderate and urbane politician" had recently been one of Father Aristide's leading critics, suggesting forcefully that the deposed President had repeatedly violated the Constitution and encouraged class violence in his nearly eight months in office.
 
Overthrow of Aristide
 Father Aristide, a stirringly popular leftist priest who won 67 percent of the vote in Haiti's first democratic elections 13 months ago, was overthrown and forced into exile in Venezuela after a military coup last Sept. 30.
Almost immediately after his overthrow, the Organization of American States moved to impose a hemisphere-wide commercial embargo on Haiti to force his restoration. Warning that a successful military coup in Haiti could destabilize fragile democracies throughout the region, the O.A.S. has consistently demanded Father Aristide's negotiated return to power.
After today's announcement in Caracas that Father Aristide had accepted Mr. Theodore, the Colombian diplomat who has led the negotiations, Augusto Ramirez Ocampo, other O.A.S. officials and diplomats expressed cautious optimism that the agreement would soon lead to the establishment of a new government in Haiti and the lifting of economic sanctions.
 
Preliminary Steps
 The details of Father Aristide's return, several diplomats said, was the subject of negotiations and, according to some, was unlikely to occur before several more months. These diplomats said that time was needed to restart a crippled economy, to iron out security arrangements for Father Aristide and to carry out major reforms of the Haitian police, army and judicial system under O.A.S. supervision.
The diplomats said that although he had been proposed by conservative leaders of the National Assembly, Mr. Theodore, 51 years old and the leader of a small party that still carried the Communist label, had not conclusively gathered enough support among the entire Parliament, Haiti's conservative economic elite, and most important, the army, to assure that his nomination would be approved.
 
Support of the Wealthy
 Before news of Mr. Theodore's selection began to circulate in the capital this afternoon, several Haitian legislators warned that support among the wealthy and the army for Father Aristide's return could only be assured if the deposed President were to endorse the nomination of Marc L. Bazin, the other candidate proposed by the legislators who traveled to Venezuela.
Mr. Bazin is a conservative former World Bank official who placed a distant second in the 1990 elections won by Father Aristide. An O.A.S. official who asked not to be identified said that Father Aristide had rejected Mr. Bazin, in part, because of what he felt was the conservative politician's endorsement of the coup d'etat against him.
Associates said that Mr. Theodore, who did not return several telephone calls, has been meeting with military and business leaders in recent weeks to reassure them and seek their support.
In recent statements, Mr. Theodore has also stressed the importance of the private sector and called for more domestic and foreign investment.
For years, a variety of underground political movements, some of them claiming Communism as their ideology led efforts to organize insurrections and invasions by small armed bands aimed at unseating the Duvalier family dictatorship that ruled Haiti for 29 years until its overthrow in 1986.
In its early years, Mr. Theodore's Unified Haitian Communist Party, was recognized and actively supported by Moscow. It was largely composed of educated young people.
The party suffered a major setback in 1969, the year it was formed, when many of its leading members were rounded up and killed.
Mr. Theodore was on a mission to Budapest at the time, and eventually made his way to Paris. In 1978, he became the party's leader in exile. In the 1990 election the party did poorly, winning just three seats in Parliament.

HEADLINE: F.B.I. to Shift From Cold War to Crime War

BYLINE: By DAVID JOHNSTON

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
In a personnel shake-up that reflects the end of the cold war, the Federal Bureau of Investigation plans to reassign several hundred agents from internal security investigations to combat serious crime and gang violence, officials in the Bush Administration said today.
Although the move is expected to involved fewer than 300 agents in a force of about 10,000, the shift is symbolically dramatic, representing a downgrading of counter-espionage efforts in favor of a more intensive attack on violent crime, particularly gang violence. "Call it a peace dividend," one official said. 
 The reassignment comes as a result of the breakup of the Eastern bloc and the diminished threat of spying against the United States by the former Warsaw Pact nations, who in the past had vigorously collected intelligence in the United States.
Those changes have left the bureau's foreign counterintelligence section, which is responsible for investigating threats to national security by foreign agents operating in the United States, without a clearly defined purpose and facing the possibility of budget cuts.
The move also represents an effort by the Federal Government to marshal greater resources against serious street crime, areas in which state and local officials have historically played a greater role than have the Federal law-enforcement authorities.
 
Greater Federal Role Planned
 Attorney General William P. Barr said at his confirmation hearings last fall that he planned to make the effort to curb violent crime a top priority for the Justice Department. Since then, officials have been working on several proposals to increase the Federal role.
The scaling down of counterintelligence operations represents a major change for the F.B.I. In the past, internal security has ranked as one of the bureau's top priorities.In cities with a large foreign diplomatic presence, like Washington and New York, hundreds of agents have been assigned to surveillance and investigative work.
William S. Sessions, the Director of the F.B.I., has insisted in recent months that the demand for a strong counterintelligence presence remained high, despite the dismantling of the Soviet Union and toppling of Communist governments in Eastern Europe.
Some bureau officials justified the continued staffing levels by asserting that the newly emerging independent states had merely shifted their resources from military espionage to industrial spying in an effort to help their limping economies.
But the impending move appears to represent a changed environment in which domestic law-enforcement concerns now override the threat of overseas spying.
The expected changes will require scores of agents to move from their current jobs to cities like Chicagoo and Los Angeles, where gang-related violence has reached epidemic levels. Several dozen cities are expected to receive an infusion of new agents, but the precise locations remained unclear today.
 
Operation Triggerlock
 The Government has already taken several actions to step up its activites against violent crime. Last year the Justice Department initiated Operation Triggerlock, setting up task forces in several cities to enforce Federal laws that make it illegal for habitual felons to own weapons.
Last fall, in a speech in San Francisco, Mr. Barr outlined several proposals to attack Asian-American gangs that appear to dovetail with the reassignment of counterintelligence experts for a broader attack on gang violence.
Those proposals included the wider use of electronnic surveillance and long-term undercover operations against Asian criminal enterprises and a proposal to enact new laws enabling the authorities to shut down Asian crime groups as criminal enterprises.
In fighting gang violence, the F.B.I. has already sought to apply techniques developed in investigations of organized crime, including infiltration and the use of informers to file broad racketeering charges intended to dismantle the gang's leadership.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS;
Connoisseur to Be Merged Into a Sister Publication

BYLINE: By STUART ELLIOTT

 BODY:
Abandoning plans to remake Connoisseur magazine from a fine-arts publication into a chronicle of popular culture, Hearst Magazines announced yesterday that it would merge the monthly into another of its titles, Town & Country, after Connoisseur's February issue.
Gael Love, the editor in chief who was brought in to change the 91-year-old magazine, expressed surprise at the decision. 
 D. Claeys Bahrenburg, president of the Hearst Magazines division of the Hearst Corporation in New York, said, "We took a hard look at this and we thought it was best to reallocate our resources." Mr. Bahrenburg declined to discuss the potential losses, citing Hearst's status as a private company.
 
Experiment Ended
 The decision ended an experiment that began last January when Hearst dismissed Thomas Hoving, who had been editor in chief of Connoisseur since it was moved to America from Britain in 1982. During that time, Connoisseur specialized in articles on antiques, opera and art.
Replacing him was Ms. Love, a protege of Andy Warhol and the former top editor of Fame and Interview magazines. She moved quickly to change Connoisseur's editorial content, offering a mix of pop-culture topics like profiles of movie stars and reports on the British royal family.
But from the first issue published under Ms. Love, in June, the revamped Connoisseur drew criticism, particularly from fans of Vanity Fair, the monthly competitor from Conde Nast Publications.
Asked then about Ms. Love's debut issue, Tina Brown, editor in chief of Vanity Fair, said, "Oh, you mean the October 1985 issue of Vanity Fair." Both magazines had Diana, Princess of Wales, wearing the same tiara, on their covers.
Despite that, Mr. Bahrenburg said, he did not regret the decision to bring in Ms. Love.
"We needed to raise circulation and ad pages," he added, beyond what Connoisseur had attracted under Mr. Hoving. But, he continued, the drastic economic woes felt since the 1987 stock market crash by "affluent, young, free-spending" readers and advertisers of luxury goods doomed those efforts.
 
Falling Ad Pages
 In 1988, Connoisseur carried 1,083 advertising pages; the number fell to 925 in 1989, 759 in 1990 and 530 in 1991. Circulation, which Mr. Bahrenburg had hoped would rise at some point to 500,000, was at 328,453 for the six months that ended Dec. 31.
Effective in June, Hearst will raise Town & Country's rate base, the circulation guaranteed to advertisers, to reflect the absorption of Connoisseur; it will rise to 475,000 from 440,000. Connoisseur's most recent rate base had been 320,000.
Some editorial features and columns of Connoisseur will be added to Town & Country.
Connoisseur's publisher, Carole Ference, will be reassigned within Hearst Magazines, Mr. Bahrenburg said. As for Ms. Love, he added, "She and I are having dialogue" as to her future.
Ms. Love said yesterday that she had not been notified of Hearst's decision before the announcement. She declined further comment.
A publishing executive who insisted on anonymity described the period of time that Ms. Love edited Connoisseur as too short to make a decision like Hearst's to close the magazine.
"It's not like Conde Nast," the executive added, "where they nurse things till they happen."
This is the first time Hearst has closed one of its flagship monthly titles since July 1986, when it shut Science Digest and sold the subscription list to Time Inc.

HEADLINE: Fast Food Fills Menu For Many Hotel Chains

BYLINE: By EDWIN MCDOWELL

 BODY:
Guests who feel the urge for pizza at many Marriott hotels now find their call for room service answered with a Pizza Hut pizza, made in the Marriott kitchen.
At the Day's Inn in downtown Atlanta, guests can satisfy their craving for a hamburger merely by stepping through a lobby door into the adjoining Wendy's. 
 Most of the 21 Homewood Suites have one-touch telephones in their guest rooms that connect with nearby restaurants, but phones at those hotels in Jacksonville, Fla., are connected to seven restaurants, including Pizza Hut and Domino's Pizza.
 
Benefits Are Mutual
 Such knot-tying between the lodging and fast-food industries is on the rise, though it is clearly a marriage of convenience. Faced with sluggish growth at its traditional properties, which just about blanket America, the fast-food industry is aggressively seeking new outlets.
Economy hotels seem to be targets ready made for fast food. They account for about 38 percent of the nation's 44,500 hotels and motels and are the fastest-growing segment of the lodging market. But few of them have restaurants -- or want them.
"Restaurants have always been money losers for hotels, unless they can attract other than just the hotel guest," said Betsy Bromberg O'Rourke, a spokeswoman for Choice Hotels International. Choice's 2,500 properties include Quality Inns and Hotels, Comfort Inns, Econo Lodges and Rodeway Inns. At its Sleep Inns, Choice's growing chain of economy hotels, telephones are connected to restaurants that promise to deliver in 30 minutes.
"The hotel industry generally makes a 15 to 20 percent departmental profit on food and beverage," said Bruce Baltin, a partner in Pannell Kerr Forster, the national accounting and consulting firm. "But if you add administration, marketing, occupancy costs and capital charges, they about break even."
For that reason, when all-suite hotels were conceived a decade or so ago, "the idea was that they wouldn't build restaurants because they weren't profitable," said Gary L. Carr, also of Pannell Kerr Forster. In two years, he said, "A lot of hotels have converted their restaurants into meeting rooms, at least as a stop-gap measure in this bad economy."
Not all the efforts involve telephoning. Virtually all 860 of the franchised Super 8 Motels are within a short walk of a family-style restaurant.
"Sometimes we'll even contact an Arby's or Denny's, and ask if anybody's interested in going into, say, Cedar Rapids, where a Super 8 is going up," said Joan Ganje-Fischer, a vice president of the Aberdeen, S.D., motel company.
 
A Full-Service Option
 What is different about the connection between the Marriott Corporation, based in Bethesda, Md., and Pizza Hut, a division of Pepsico Inc. based in Wichita, Kan., is that most Marriott properties already have restaurants and room service.
An executive of a small luxury chain, who insisted that neither she nor her company be identified, said it was "unseemly" for a full-service hotel to serve the food "that can be found on every street corner."
Yet name recognition was precisely what attracted Marriott, which once owned the Gino's and Roy Rogers restaurant chains.
"We had been doing our own room service pizza for some years," said Gordon Lambourne, a spokesman for the Marriott. "It was very popular, but we wanted to get a well-known, consistent product. We did some studies and found there's a brand preference for something like pizza."
After testing Pizza Hut in several company hotels last summer, including ones at the San Francisco International Airport and in Bethesda, Marriott gave the go-ahead. Its employees are trained in pizza-making by Pizza Hut, which supplies the ingredients, and the pizzas are made in special ovens in Marriott kitchens.
Now in about 40 Marriott hotels, Pizza Hut is scheduled to be on the room service menu of 25 more by July, Mr. Lambourne said, and could eventually be offered at 200 Marriott hotels. Depending on the size and ingredients, room-service pizzas -- identified by brand name -- cost about $1 more than those from a local Pizza Hut.
In addition to the licensing fee it collects from Marriott, Pizza Hut benefits in other ways from the partnership, which was eased by the fact that Steven S. Reinemund, the president of Pizza Hut, had been a Marriott executive.
"This gives us access to a potentially new audience of people," said Roger Rydell, the company's public affairs director. Pizza Hut has almost 7,000 stores in the United States.
Mr. Rydell said that Pizza Hut would like to talk to Radisson and Hyatt hotels, which now offer their own pizza on room-service menus. "We think their guests would prefer to have a brand product," he said. Partly in recognition of that marketing advantage, Radisson made up a brand name for its in-house product, Napolizza.
Many hotels let local managers to decide whether to make delivery arrangements with nearby restaurants, and some lodgings have long put leaflets or signs in rooms.
"If my restaurant is not open and a guest is hungry, I'll recommend restaurants in the neighborhood that will deliver," said Rich Bernhard, general manager of the Ramada Westport in Westport, Mo., near the St. Louis International Airport. It recommends three pizzarias, Domino's, Pizza Hut and Imo's, as well as a steak house that will deliver for a surcharge.
"About five years ago we tried putting in vending machines with apples and sandwiches, but it didn't go over," Mr. Bernhard said.
For security reasons, the Ramada Westport requires deliverers to report to the front desk. "They give us the room number," Mr. Bernhard said, "and we call and verify that the guest ordered."
The Homewood Suites in Jacksonville also requires deliverers to stop at the front desk.
Because Day's Inns are individually franchised, Carol Bivins, a Day's vice president, said each owner decides whether to provide food service, and what, if any, arrangements to make with nearby restaurants. "It's a rare hotelier that can turn a profit from sleeping service and food service," she said.
That's why the Day's Inn in downtown Atlanta has leased to Wendy's the space adjoining the hotel. "Before we became a Day's Inn," said Melinda Martin, the hotel manager, "another restaurant had been in that space."
Not only does Ms. Martin not mind guests bringing hamburgers and other fast food back to their rooms, "In the convention season, from January to March," she said, "we even offer room service from Wendy's."

HEADLINE: ALBANY NOTEBOOK;
At Feel-Good Event, Most Felt Rotten
BYL>By CALVIN SIMS

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
State of the State speeches are usually occasions when legislators smile, shake hands, applaud the Governor wildly or politely depending on their party and otherwise take a bath of good feelings, whether they feel good or not.
But it is a measure of the frayed mood of officials here that the pretense this year not only faded but gave way about 40 minutes into Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's speech to a shouting match between Mr. Cuomo and an Assemblyman from his own party and hometown. 
 Many legislators had been squirming in their seats as the Governor used his speech today to cast them as the enemy of widespread reforms. Specifically, Mr. Cuomo said, to avoid a repeat of last year's budget delay, elected officials should give up a day's pay for each day the budget is late. The budget was 65 days late last year.
Angered by this suggestion, Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio, Democrat of Queens, interrupted Mr. Cuomo's speech, yelling: "It's good when you got a lot of dollars! It's good when you got a lot of dollars, Guv!"
Mr. Cuomo stopped in midsentence and asked Mr. Seminerio if he needed a loan. And the two men had heated words for about three minutes as the audience laughed and applauded. Mr. Coumo ended the exchange, saying he was glad that "at least everybody is awake," referring to Mr. Seminerio, who has been known to nap during sessions.
The exchange fit into the day's prevailing mood -- crabby. Like disgruntled students dragging back to class after a too-short recess, New York State's 211 legislators returned to the Capitol today to listen to the Governor's message and start a new session that is universally expected to prove the longest and most contentious in state history.
Weary Legislators
Yes, there was the normal opening-day camaraderie -- beaming grins, strong handshakes and lots of backslaps -- but there were visible signs of the contention to come.
The small talk among the crowd that crammed into the Assembly chamber for Mr. Cuomo's address was about the escalating battle between Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders over how to resolve the state's persistent budget crisis. With the end of the current fiscal year coming on March 31, the state has yet to close a budget gap of more than $875 million.
"You see a lot of smiling faces, but the truth is that most of us are not happy to be back here because we just barely left," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat. "The last session was so combative that I think most of us are very, very weary of the legislative process."
After Mr. Cuomo's speech, Mr. Seminerio said his comments were not intended to show disrespect for the Governor but to emphasize that state budget delays rest not with the rank-and-file members of the Legislature but with the Governor and the two top legislators leaders who have been at odds.
"I do love the Governor and he's a gentleman, and I would vote for him for President, but my mother did not raise no fools," the Assemblyman said. "I'm not going to be working for nothing."
Many legislators agreed with Mr. Seminerio. Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, called the Governor's plan to withhold legislators' salaries "coercion" and said that "many younger lawmakers who rely on their salaries to pay mortgages and bills simply could not afford it."
Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Nassau County, suggested that the Governor give up the many honorariums that he receives for speeches.
A Republican Response
In another example of the friction among politicians at the start of the new session, State Senate Republicans for the first time issued a televised response that was broadcast on the state-run system, NY-SCAN, immediately after Mr. Cuomo's speech.
The State Senate's majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican, attributed New York's economic problems to the "nearly two decades of Democratic control of the executive office and Assembly" in which, Mr. Marino said, "taxes, spending, fiscal mismanagement and regulatory control" spiraled out of control.
John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Marino, said the majority leader made a "special effort" to obtain television time for the response because "he sharply disagrees with the Governor over how to resolve this fiscal situation."
A Child's View
Following tradition, many legislators brought their families to the Assembly chamber to hear the Governor's address.
Six-year-old Terrance Grannis, the Assemblyman's son, said that he usually finds the speech "pretty boring" but that this year's was exciting because of the "strong man who yelled at the Governor."

HEADLINE: Grants Open Doors for Nuclear Waste

BYLINE: By KEITH SCHNEIDER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Lured by lucrative grants, seven communities around the country have notified the Government that they are interested in becoming the site of a multibillion-dollar warehouse to store thousands of tons of high-level nuclear wastes, the Department of Energy said today.
But the notifications by the communities, among them five Indian tribes, have also stirred political dissension and raised questions about whether the Government is taking advantage of hard economic times and rural poverty to gain a site for some of the nation's most dangerous industrial wastes. 
 In Grant County, N.D., citizens opened a petition drive to recall three county commissioners who proposed studying the area as a potential nuclear waste site. Gov. George E. Sinner, a Democrat, has expressed reservations about putting such an installation in his state.
In New Mexico, where the Mescalero Apache Tribe has told the Government it would consider storing nuclear waste on its reservation, the Governor and Attorney General are the most vocal opponents. The criticism has become so fierce that Wendell Chino, the President of the tribe, declined in a short telephone interview today to discuss the project. "We've said just about all we want to say about it," he said.
 
Grants as a Carrot
 A Federal law enacted in 1987 required the Energy Department to build, by 1998, a network of concrete bunkers and buildings to temporarily store and package spent fuel rods from civilian nuclear power reactors before they are permanently entombed in the Government's high-level nuclear waste repository now under study in Nevada.
The law established an independent agency in Boise, Idaho, the Office of Nuclear Waste Negotiator, to scour the countryside for suitable sites and interested communities. A principal attraction the office can offer is the research grants that applicants can gain by considering the Monitored Retrievable Storage Facility.
Simply by applying to study the potential to build a nuclear waste installation, communities are eligible for up to $100,000 in grants from the Department of Energy. David Leroy, the United States Nuclear Waste Negotiator, said in an interview today that the communities were free to use the money almost any way they chose. Two of the seven communities have received the $100,000 grants and the rest are expected to, the Energy Department said today.
Communities that decide to pursue the idea further are eligible for a second phase of study that could provide several million dollars in grants, the Energy Department said today. In this second phase, the applicant must provide detailed scientific data to the Government. By 1993, the Energy Department hopes to have identified at least one firm site for the nuclear installation and to begin more rigorous environmental studies.
 
Former Foes Change Stance
 One of the tribes that indicated an interest is the Yakima Indian Nation in south central Washington state. Until now, the tribe was among the most vocal opponents of the Energy Department's management of nuclear waste at its Hanford nuclear weapons plant, which the Government built just east of the reservation on desert it seized from the tribe.
But last month, according to participants at the National Congress of American Indians convention in San Francisco, Russell Jim, a tribe leader, defended the decision to pursue the grants as a logical step for the 8,000-member tribe and their 1.3 million-acre reservation. Mr. Jim said the tribe's members had been living with nuclear wastes at Hanford since World War II and might be able to offer new solutions. He noted that the grants only required the tribe to study the potential for a nuclear waste installation and were not a commitment to allow the Government to begin construction.
Mr. Jim and Delano Saluskin, another tribe leader, did not return a reporter's telephone calls today.
Leaders from other tribes, including the Mescalero Apache, talked of the ambivalence toward the Government offers.
"Many of the tribes all over America are overwhelmingly dependent on Government programs and grants for basic services and jobs," said Robert T. Coulter, executive director of the Indian Law Resource Center in Helena, Mont., and a member of the Potawatomi Tribe. "When the Federal Government offers money without any obligation, it is tempting, and that is a regrettable fact of life."
 
Vulnerability of 'Colonization'
 Susan Shown Harjo, president of the Morning Star Foundation, an Indian rights advocacy group in Washington, added: "Five hundred years of colonization has done a real job on us. It makes us targets of cash and poverty politics."
John W. Bartlett, the director of the Energy Department's Office of Civilian Radioactive Waste Management, said today the new nuclear waste installation would be large enough to temporarily store 10,000 metric tons of spent fuel from the country's more than 100 civilian nuclear power reactors. More than 22,000 metric tons of spent fuel are being stored in glowing blue pools and above-ground installations at nuclear plants across the country. By the middle of the 21st century, the amount of spent fuel is expected to grow to more than 84,000 metric tons, the Energy Department said today.
Mr. Bartlett said the technology to store and package the fuel for permanent disposal is well understood. Utilities in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia operate similar temporary storage installations, he said. He added that the temporary storage site was a vital nuclear installation to prepare the most dangerous radioactive wastes for permanent burial.
In 1986, the Energy Department estimated that it would take 500 people to build the waste installation, 300 to 400 people to operate it, and would cost $1.6 billion.
Along with Grant County, N.D., the Mescalero Apache tribe, and the Yakima Indian Nation, the other communities that have notified the Government of their interest are Fremont County, Wyo., the Prairie Island Indian Community fo Minnesota, the Sac and Fox Nation of Oklahoma and the Chickasaw Indian Nation of Oklahoma.

HEADLINE: Cuomo Offers Plan to Stimulate Recovery in New York Economy

BYLINE: By SAM HOWE VERHOVEK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
In a State of the State address that mixed exhortation and confrontation, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo pledged today to help lift New York out of the grim hold of the recession and challenged lawmakers to undertake major improvements in the way the state manages its own finances.
The centerpiece of the Governor's recovery program was his call for an $800 million bond act that he said would spur construction projects across the state and create thousands of jobs. The proposal would not go before the voters until November, a fact bemoaned by some lawmakers today even as they praised the concept. 
 "We must pump confidence and capital and jobs into our own state economy," said the Governor, whose 55-minute address marked the 10th year he has presided over the traditional start of Albany's legislative season. "We must build a new New York with our own hands, without waiting for Washington." [Excerpts, page B9.]
 
Locked in Bitter Feud
 The Governor spoke against the stark backdrop of near-paralysis in the State Capitol, where he and lawmakers have been locked in a bitter and largely fruitless feud over how to close nearly $5 billion in budget deficits.
In an apparent bid to go over the heads of those legislators, the Governor proposed summoning a special constitutional convention to force changes in the way the state's budgets are put together. The Legislature would have to approve the convention, but it would then be run by popularly elected delegates.
Such a convention, which last met in 1967, would consider a measure that would allow the Governor's proposed budget to take effect temporarily in any year that the Legislature did not pass a budget on time, which has happened for the last seven years in a row.
Other measures advanced by Mr. Cuomo would dock the pay of the Governor and all the lawmakers for every day the budget remained late -- it was adopted 65 days past the April 1 deadline last year -- and institute a "limited initiative" ballot with which the public could force lawmakers to vote on specific bills, including the budget.
But while Mr. Cuomo characterized the convention as "one grand stroke of intelligent populism," many lawmakers derided it as demagoguery and said they were skeptical it would ever come about. And the confrontational aspect of the day was aptly symbolized by an unusual exchange between Mr. Cuomo and a Democratic Assemblyman, Anthony S. Seminerio of Queens, who interrupted the speech with an angry outburst from his seat.
"Don't tell me I won't get paid for my work -- that's political nonsense," Mr. Seminerio bellowed at the Governor. "We're here every day, 14 or 15 hours a day."
The economic proposals outlined by the Governor today combined his new call for the bond act with a package of major initiatives he has already announced, including such improvements in the infrastructure in the New York City area as a light-rail system to connect the region's airports with existing transportation lines and a huge office and housing development in Hunters Point, Queens.
And he offered several new proposals in the health and housing fields that touched on major problems but, in their relatively modest scope, illustrated the difficulties of finding financing for an all-out assault on social ills in the current economic climate. Among these were a health education campaign to counter the recent rise in tuberculosis and measles cases and a $40 million revolving-loan program to help out first-time home buyers.
 
Medical Programs
 The Governor said he would propose creation of six neighborhood emergency medical-treatment centers from Buffalo to Harlem and an "Early Care" medical program aimed at keeping infants and toddlers healthy, a move that he said might build the foundation for a universal health care program that has been shunted aside in recent years here as unaffordable.
And he pledged to consider privatization measures that ranged from the very small, like a pilot program to contract out laundry services for state mental wards, to the very large, including a proposal to sell the publicly owned World Trade Center.
Mr. Cuomo is expected to outline ways to pay for these new ideas when he presents his budget proposal for the 1992-93 fiscal year on Jan. 21. The Governor pledged today that there would be "no new taxes" in his plan.
For the first time, the State of the State address was followed by an offical Republican response that was carried on many of the same public-television stations that broadcast Mr. Cuomo's speech.
It was delivered by the Senate majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, who used it to reiterate his calls for reductions in Medicaid and welfare spending. "The growth in these programs has fueled tax increases, taken money away from road repairs and schools, and caused a structural imbalance in our budget that threatens our very ability to provide for people," he said.
Senator Marino said after the speech that his party had decided to "go on the offensive" in asking for the air time. "We thought the best way to do that is to enunciate our position, even though I don't enunciate well," he said.
 
An Interesting Contrast
 The speech today in the ornate Assembly chamber offered an interesting contrast to Gov. Franklin D. Roosevelt's State of the State address in the same place 60 years ago, which offered a similar lament about Washington's inability to deal with harsh economic times.
"In any state of this union of states, the complete solving of those economic problems which are national in scope is an impossibility without leadership and a plan of action by our national government," Mr. Roosevelt said in 1932.
Today, Mr. Cuomo said, "The national Government, unable or unwilling to handle the challenge, gradually has shifted the burden to the states."
While Mr. Roosevelt's address was widely interpreted as a declaration that he would run for President, Mr. Cuomo's attack on Federal policies produced no similar speculation today because last month he firmly took himself out of the race. He cited New York's budget morass as the chief factor precluding a Presidential bid.
There was something vaguely wistful, then, about Mr. Cuomo's assault on Washington since it was coming from a man who portrayed himself today not as a potential President but as one of just dozens of governors struggling against a terrible national tide. Still, he sought to use the moment as an uplifting paean to his state, which he described as "an Empire State that has helped build this great nation from the very beginning."
Mr. Cuomo may well face an uphill struggle in securing approval of the major initiatives he outlined today. The last bond proposal, the $1.97 billion environmental bond act, was defeated by New York voters in 1990 amid concerns about adding to the state's long-term debt.
Even if the Governor gets his constitutional convention, there is no guarantee that it will change anything. The 1967 convention worked for months and proposed sweeping revisions in the organization of state agencies and the courts, only to have the entire plan rejected when it was put before the voters.
Mr. Cuomo certainly did not exempt himself from his general criticism of the way things have been run in Albany. "I'm not proud of what I have done," Mr. Cuomo said in a reference to the unresolved fight over the budget. "I'm the chief executive. I was supposed to produce a result. I failed, but so did you."

GRAPHIC: Chart: "THE KEY POINTS: State of the State"
 
These are some of the main proposals in Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State address:
 
An $800 million bond act for infrastructure projects that would create jobs in construction and related industries.
 
A constitutional convention to consider changes in the structure of the state government and the way budgets are put together.
 
A series of measures to encourage the timely approval of a balanced budget, including temporary adoption of the Governor's proposed budget if the Legislature does not approve a fiscal plan on time.
 
Giving local school districts greater control over curriculum requirements, and changing the distribution of school aid to give more money to poor urban districts.
 
A state assumption of local Medicaid costs, as well as a series of measures to contain health-care costs and lay the foundation for universal health care. (pg. B8)

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN;
Stunned Japanese Offer Sympathy As Some Are Struck by Symbolism

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 8

 BODY:
President Bush's sudden illness shook Japanese leaders today and spread shock and sympathy throughout a country that had been following his visit with great interest all week.
Television footage of Mr. Bush's collapse at the banquet at the official residence of Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa was played over and over, sidelining the details of the agreements on economic cooperation and mutual security steps that were the focus of attention earlier. 
 Mr. Bush appeared to have made a highly favorable impression until now, with the Japanese enjoying scenes of his bouncing a ball on his head in Kyoto and, today, playing tennis with Emperor Akihito and his eldest son, Crown Prince Naruhito.
 
Prime Minister's Tears
 Prime Minister Miyazawa seemed to reflect the concerns of Japan as television cameras focused on him cradling Mr. Bush's head as the President sank to the floor supported by Secret Service aides and others at the banquet tonight.
At first, Mr. Miyazawa, who is 72 years old, looked dazed himself. Then, as Mr. Bush rose to his feet, he led the applause in the banquet hall. During his subsequent toast, Mr. Miyazawa's eyes filled with tears and his voice was choked with emotion, according to a person near him.
After the banquet, Mr. Miyazawa wrote by hand a letter to the President for delivery to the Akasaka Palace guest house. He especially noted the way Barbara Bush had introduced a note of relief and humor at the dinner by joking that Mr. Bush's illness was brought on by his defeat at tennis earlier in the day when the Emperor and the Crown Prince beat Mr. Bush and Michael Armacost, the American Ambassador to Japan.
"Thanks to Barbara's great help, as always, the dinner ended in great success," Mr. Miyazawa wrote, according to a Foreign Ministry official.
After the banquet, the Prime Minister left his official residence, a brown brick structure that dates from 1929, to be at his own home, a private house in the fashionable Harajuku section of the center of Tokyo.
This evening, the Prime Minister's top political adviser, Koichi Kato, the Chief Cabinet Secretary, visited the Akasaka guest house to convey Japan's concern. He met with Brent Scowcroft, the White House national security adviser.
The Foreign Minister, Michio Watanabe, sent flowers to the guest house but told television reporters earlier not to worry. "It was nothing," he said on television tonight. "He was just tired."
Another dinner guest, Toshio Yamaguchi, a former Cabinet member who is a veteran member of the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Parliament, also sought to minimize the crisis atmosphere. "It was just like he had to lie down on a sofa for a while,' he told a television interviewer.
Emperor Akihito also sent a note to Mr. Bush expressing his hopes for a speedy recovery, officials said.
The vivid and dramatic image of Mr. Bush struggling in the arms of the Japanese Prime Minister seemed likely to make an indelible impression on the Japanese people, especially since it came after a trip in which the United States had been asking for steps to help its weakened economy.
 
Debate Over Symbolism
 The symbolism of the seemingly strong Mr. Bush collapsing was even compared by some to the widespread impression in Japan that the United States is reeling under the recession and is asking Japan to take steps to help it recover.
"It's so symbolic," said Naohiro Amaya, a former Deputy Minister of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry, appearing on television tonight. "The superpower America is tired and everyone around it has to take care of it."
Whether such a conclusion was widespread was impossible to judge tonight, but some officials discounted the idea.
"Such symbolism is really far-fetched and I don't buy it," said Nobuaki Tanaka, director of the bureau that handles political relations with the United States. "I think what people really feel is warmth and fondness toward the President. They are relieved that he's not too ill."
Mr. Tanaka said he doubted that Mr. Bush's sickness would disrupt the array of negotiations and talks under way to deepen economic cooperation and solve a series of disputes on American demands that Tokyo buy more American-made cars and auto parts.
Senior Foreign Ministry spokesmen also came to the Okura Hotel tonight to hear the briefing of Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, and then to ask Mr. Fitzwater afterward if there was nothing more to Mr. Bush's illness. The Japanese officials said they were reassured that this was true.

HEADLINE: Presidential Wars Behind Him, Cuomo Attacks His Legislative Foes

BYLINE: By KEVIN SACK, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Gov. Mario M. Cuomo used his 10th State of the State address today to declare to both the Legislature and the state that he is no longer the political hostage of his Presidential ambitions.
Liberated of any need to position himself toward the right or to coax the Legislature into consensus, Mr. Cuomo cast himself as a strong protector of the social services safety net and as a populist crusader against legislative intransigence. 
 In a reflection of austere times, few of the initiatives Mr. Cuomo discussed today were either large or new. He focused instead on a spirited defense of social programs against recessionary budget-cutting pressures and on a package of reform proposals calculated to shame the Legislature for its inaction.
Some legislators speculated that if the Governor had chosen to run for President he would have been more wary about reinforcing his stereotype as a Northeastern liberal and about picking a fight with the Legislature.
"He seemed to be saying I can go out there now, I'm not a Presidential candidate, and I can beat you guys up anytime I want," said Assemblyman Sheldon Silver, a Manhattan Democrat.
 
A Diminished Figure
 Mr. Cuomo's decision not to run this year left him a diminished figure on the national stage, and to a certain extent within New York. But he made it clear today that he will make full use of the few political weapons still available to him -- the leverage provided by his veto power over reapportionment and the deep discontent of the public in a year when all legislators face re-election and the Governor does not.
Several legislators said the Governor may have found an effective and necessary tactic in his use of the Legislature as a foil, given the state's desperate fiscal condition and the nation's clear anti-incumbency sentiment. But they said it also could prove a risky strategy.
"It's one thing to declare a political war," said Assemblyman Richard L. Brodsky, a Westchester Democrat. "It's another thing to declare an institutional war."
Just in case the image of a Governor unchained was not self-evident, Mr. Cuomo began his speech by paying homage to Terry Anderson, the favorite son of Batavia, N.Y., who was released last year after more than six years in captivity. Mr. Cuomo, the poet-politician, spun Mr. Anderson's story into a metaphor for New York State.
"With his fate in the hands of people he could not control, Terry Anderson resolved to do all that he could with his personal strengths," Mr. Cuomo said. "New York State, like other states, is struggling with a powerful force it cannot control, a national recession."
But by the time Mr. Cuomo concluded his 55-minute speech, listeners could wonder whether the hostage Mr. Cuomo was depicting was really the state or its Governor, and whether the oppressor was really the economy or the Legislature.
 
Blaming the Senate
 In the last three weeks, Mr. Cuomo has blamed the recalcitrance of the Republican-led State Senate for shackling his ability to run for President, for tying up the state budget and for encouraging the downgrading of the state's credit rating.
With today's speech, he seemed determined to break free of those bonds -- or at least to portray the Legislature as Albany's equivalent of the Hezbollah.
In vintage fashion, he said he would never agree to Republican proposals to reduce the size of the welfare grant and to restrict Medicaid coverage to 60 days for some recipients.
"We must change our ways, there is no doubt about that," said Mr. Cuomo, who has shown a new willingness to balance the budget with cuts in social programs. "But we must do it without losing our way, no matter how fiercely the political winds blow at the moment. We are not going to give up our integrity as a people to win an election."
Mr. Cuomo went on to highlight his reform initiatives -- few of which stand much chance of approval -- to dock the pay of elected officials who fail to pass timely budgets, to give voters the right to force legislative debate on various issues and to call a Constitutional convention to circumvent legislative resistance.
"Some of us are indignant at being accused of not functioning, but we haven't and you know it," he told the legislators, gesturing so energetically that a sign-language interpreter seemed superfluous. "And it's cost everybody money and in some cases it was as though we were doing it cavalierly."
 
A Democratic Heckler
 The defining moment of the speech, and potentially of the legislative session, came minutes later, when Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio, a Queens Democrat, heckled Mr. Cuomo about his legislative pay-cut proposal.
A clear breach of legislative etiquette, Mr. Seminerio's angry outburst sent a signal across the Assembly chamber and across the airwaves that the Governor in his post-Presidential period will be just that, a Governor, and one who does not particularly intimidate the Legislature.
Even more telling was the Governor's response. Unlike two years ago, when an Act Up demonstrator interrupted Mr. Cuomo's State of the State speech with a protest against the state's AIDS policy, Mr. Cuomo did not listen politely and later commend the speaker for his cause.
Instead, he resorted to a favorite political device -- ridicule. "I'm glad that at least everybody is awake," Mr. Cuomo told Mr. Seminerio, who is known to nap at his desk occasionally. "Tony, you vote against it. At least this way we'll get a vote out of you."
Even before the speech was finished, the war against the Legislature was well under way. It was personal. And it was no holds barred.

HEADLINE: Excerpts from Address: A Plan to Fix the State

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State Address to the Legislature yesterday, as recorded by The New York Times.

 	 	 		. . .	 	New York State, like other states, is struggling with a powerful force it cannot control, a national recession. As a result of a decade of excesses and omissions and bad choices, the nation has lost its grip on the world economy and that is hurting us in the most fundamental ways. Businesses are closing. Millions of Americans have lost their jobs.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Reviving the Economy
 Together, the projects in that new New York plan will generate more than 100,000 jobs, more than $9 billion in economic opportunity for the state by the new millenium. 
 Now here are some of the pieces, only a few. Some of you are familiar with them already, but just to give you some sense of the dimensions and of the immense value that the new New York plan will add to the state's economic strength:
*An automatic billion-dollar people-mover, a light rail system that will connect New York's major airports to the rest of the transportation network. That's $1.6 billion, the funding already virtually guaranteed.
* The Freight Link America project that will connect New York City and Long Island to the rest of the nation.
* Queens West in Queens, overlooking Manhattan, one of the largest residential-commercial developments of its kind in the United States of America.
* The world's most extensive science, business and industry library, a library without walls -- unique, literally unique -- costs nearly $100 million, financed by private money, some Federal money, state money, etc., on its way, we've begun that project already. . . .
* Calverton Airport's conversion into a state-of-the-art transportation facility is on the list.
* Completion of the fourth lane of the Long Island Expressway, and other extensive highway work, is on the list.
* For the first time, a connection between Long Island and New England. . . . We're going to do with futuristic, high-speed ferries. This is really exciting and is going to lend a great deal of value to Long Island's economy.
* A 10-year, $300 million statewide capital improvement program for New York's unparalleled park system.

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Call for Accountability
 . . . If taxpayers can be punished for failing to meet their obligations on time, then what happens when we elected officials, led by the Governor and you, are delinquent in meeting our obligations? Let's be honest. If we fail to pass timely budgets and send school districts and local governments to the brink of bankruptcy, why should we be allowed to continue enjoying our own considerable compensation, paid for by the taxpayers we punish with our delinquency, without paying some price ourselves? . . . I've given you a bill that would guarantee a timely budget by making the executive budget effective on April 1 if we fail to produce a different version before then. If you refuse that solution, I ask you please to show respect for the people we serve by passing another bill which I have given you which requires that we elected officials surrender our pay for every day that the budget is late, period.

 	 	 		. . .	 	. . . A constitutional convention could make it easier for people to run for public office. It's a disgrace how important wealth is. Everybody here knows that, that if you've got a lot of money, you have a tremendous advantage. You could be dumber, more venal, not as well intentioned and still have an advantage. Maybe we could change that. We haven't been able to do it in our system, maybe a constitutional convention could. The way you vote, the way you register, it could allow you to select judges the way these excellent judges were selected, on the merits, appoint them after they qualify on the merits. Merit selection for all judges. It could insure that Albany would never again make a late budget. It could insure a new fiscal year.

Lauren Bolfango, a recent law school graduate, works 37 1/2 hours a week researching cases, writing pleas and motions and doing other standard tasks of a new associate in a small law firm here.
What sets her apart is that she does the work without charge, after losing hope that her search for employment would ever produce a real job and deciding that volunteering in her chosen profession was better than being unemployed. 
 "I got tired of sitting around and watching soaps," said Ms. Bolfango, 27 years old, who graduated last spring from the University of California's Hastings College of Law here. She contacted 100 law firms in search of a job, without a glimmer of an offer. "I wanted to have something on my resume," she said. "I feel kind of lucky I'm doing anything at all."
Ms. Bolfango is one of thousands upon thousands of well-educated young professionals who have had the misfortune to begin their working lives in a deteriorating economy that has cut a mean swath through the white-collar work force. For some that has meant unemployment, lower wages or no wages at all. For others, it has meant deferred dreams, changed career plans or extended apprenticeships.
 
Ivy League Bartenders
 Some recent Ivy League graduates, for instance, are tending bar and driving taxicabs, and doctoral students are stalling completion of their dissertations because staying in a $20,000-a-year teaching assistantship is better than leaving a university and having no job at all. Internships that used to last for a few summer months are turning into year-round jobs at less than year-round salaries. And dean's list applicants who once preferred the riches of private industry are turning to government agencies that have entry-level slots to fill.
A turn from the private to the public sector can be costly.
Take R. David Powell, a recent graduate of Emory University Law School in Atlanta, where graduates have seen their average salaries fall to $45,000 from $48,000 in the space of the past year. Mr. Powell expected to practice real-estate law at a large firm in the city for a salary of about $50,000. Instead, he accepted a position as law clerk to Chief United States Magistrate Allen L. Chancey Jr. for $32,500 a year.
 
Blue-Collar Plight
 "I feel lucky I even have a job," Mr. Powell said. "Several people in my class who had jobs with large firms in New York got letters before their first day of work that they had been terminated."
These young people seem to understand that their hardship does not match that of their working-class peers, who are hungry for blue-collar positions that are even harder to find, who are without the blessing of advanced degrees and who, unlike Ms. Bolfango, are often without the help of credit cards, generous parents or a spouse's income. Over and over, they say they know they are lucky, although not as lucky as their friends and siblings who entered the work force in the booming 1980's.
And many are showing verve and enterprise in translating adversity into opportunity. That is the case with Andrew Yap, a recent graduate of Florida International University in Miami, who offered to intern without pay at a local business magazine, impressed his superiors and four months later wound up with exactly the marketing research job he wanted at the magazine's parent company.
But their voices still quaver with disappointment or resignation when they talk of what they are doing now versus what they expected, their prospects today versus those of friends just a few years ahead of them.
Typical is Ronald A. Sobala of Houston, a recent marketing graduate from Baylor University who has been looking for a job since graduating last December. He works part time as an electrician and lives with an uncle to save money.
"The job search has been a shock to me," said Mr. Sobala, 31, who earned $27,000 a year as a manager of a Zale's jewelery store before he returned to college in 1987. "I had high expectations of working as a country-music promoter, but I couldn't find the prestigious job I was looking for. I even tried car sales. Now I'm just making a living, trying to pay off my student loans."
Ed Funkhouser, who has a doctorate in economics from Harvard University, settled for a year-to-year teaching post at the University of California at Santa Barbara rather than a more prestigious, tenure-track job that a few years ago would have been his for the asking.
"I wish things were different, but they aren't," said Mr. Funkhouser, who earns about $5,000 less in a year then he had expected and has a heavier teaching load. "This is just the way it is. And now there are not just fewer jobs, there are more people like me who want to change."
Janet Byron, with a master's degree in journalism from the University of California at Berkeley, works as an intern at The Oakland Tribune, functioning as a full-time reporter but earning 75 percent of the regular starting salary.
"I assumed I wouldn't get a full-time job," Ms. Byron said. "I have a whole folder full of rejections. But this way I have a leg up. I have a regular byline."
Nancy Roche of LaVerne, Calif., a graduate of California Polytechnic University in Pomona, is looking for a position in marketing or personnel while working as a manicurist -- the very job that put her through college.
 
Still in Shock
 "There's zero openings in my fields now, and a few years ago people were getting hired," Ms. Roche said. "I've been hearing, 'That position is closed because we can't afford it anymore.' I'm shocked. I'm still in shock everyday."
Amy S. Redar of Chererville, Ind., a recent graduate of Indiana University who had hoped for work with the Federal or state Environmental Protection Agency, is headed instead for a Peace Corps assignment in Ecuador. "It was one of my few options," Ms. Redar said.
What distinguishes this recession from the last is the toll it is taking on white-collar jobs. In the 1981 recession, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics in Washington, 838,000 new white collar jobs were created while this time 209,000 have been lost.
"The number of options young people have is certainly narrowed," said Thomas J. Plewes, the bureau's associate commissioner for employment and unemployment statistics.
Mr. Plewes added that the contraction of opportunity in the private sector had produced an unusually high-qualified crop of young economists and statisticians for Government agencies like his own. The 20 people hired in his department last year, Mr. Plewes said, all had college grade-point averages of 3.5 or higher.
There is widespread disagreement among economists, employment agencies and college placement officials about whether the current dearth of jobs has actually forced reductions in salaries and benefits for the entry-level professionals who succeed in finding work in their chosen fields.
But experts concur that only the cream of the crop of young lawyers, bankers, engineers, professors, journalists and the like are finding the sort of jobs they expected while the rest are scaling down their aspirations, and thus their wages. And these experts say a growing number of companies, as they cut back their costly experienced work force, are expecting younger workers to do more for the same amount of money.
That threat hangs over the head of Martha Diaz, a legal secretary at a Miami law firm. "My boss said I should consider myself lucky," Ms. Diaz said, unwilling to identify her employer for fear of losing her job. "She told me that a lot of attorneys are sharing secretaries to lighten the financial burden but are not increasing their salaries. You could wind up doing double or triple the work for the same amount of money."
 
More Work for Less Pay
 Or double and triple the work for less, which is what has happened to Wendy Lamm, a photographer at The Oakland Tribune, which instituted a two-tier wage system last year as part of a plan to keep the sinking newspaper afloat. Ms. Lamm earns about $22,000 a year, 20 percent less then colleagues who were hired just weeks earlier.
Ms. Lamm is grateful for a job at a time of retrenchment in the newspaper industry, sympathetic about The Tribune's corporate plight, which has forced salary reductions for long-term employees as well, and aware that her assignments are better because she is one of only five photographers on a shrunken staff.
"I have mixed feeling, because I feel I kind of squeaked in," Ms. Lamm said. "But there's this sense that the ceiling has dropped. You can't live the way you thought you'd be able to live."

HEADLINE: Marino Says Reform Needed

BYLINE: Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Following are excerpts of Senate Majority Leader Ralph J. Marino's response to Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's State of the State Address, as recorded by The New York Times.

 	 	 		. . .	 	New York State is in trouble, and we are at a crossroads. It is the opinion of Republicans that we cannot continue on the same track. The time to change direction is now. Since 1982, state spending has virtually doubled while our population has grown by only 3 percent. Spending growth has outpaced inflation by 56 percent.

 	 	 		. . .	 	New York's economic problems, fueled by taxes, spending, regulatory controls and fiscal mismanagement, spiraled out of control. . . . Today, it is the virtually automatic growth of New York's Medicaid and welfare programs that is the chief cause of our budget problems at both the state and local level. 
 Democrats have criticized Republicans for wanting to change and limit these programs. They say we are against helping the poor. That's nonsense. New York State spends almost twice what California does on Medicaid, to serve a million fewer people. . . . We must eliminate waste and duplication, we must make welfare benefits temporary, not permanent, for able-bodied people. And we must rely on lower-cost managed care programs to deliver health care to the needy.

 	 	 		. . .	 	We need structural reform. The benefits we provide should be brought in line with what other states provide and there should be a residency requirement for welfare recipients, to end the practice of people coming to New York for our more generous benefits. . . . Last year, local school aid was cut by more than $700 million. The additional cuts that have been proposed would trigger property tax increases across our state. . . .

 	 	 		. . .	 	We can save this state, but only if we are willing to make the tough decisions to fix the budget, open the process, avoid taxes and commit ourselves to a program to re-energize New York's economy by creating jobs and opportunities to grow.
This is what Republicans will fight for.

Institutions Inject Cash Into Money Funds

BYLINE: By ELIZABETH M. FOWLER

 BODY:
The inflow of cash into tax-exempt and taxable money market funds in the last week was huge, IBC/Donoghue's Money Fund Report said yesterday.
Walter S. Frank, the publication's chief economist, said the amount of money flowing into the taxables was the highest been since the money funds were begun in the 1970's. 
 The increase in the assets came mainly from institutional investors. The seven-day compounded average yield for the tax-exempt funds dropped from 4.41 percent to 3.89, and the seven-day simple yield dropped from 4.32 percent this week to 3.82 because of seasonal factors.
During the same period, the 30-day compounded yield rose 2 basis points, to 4.01 perecent from 3.99 percent, and the simple yield rose by 2, to 3.93 from 3.91 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point.
The top Connecticut fund was the Dreyfus Connecticut Municipal Money Market Fund, with a seven-day compound yield of 4.50 percent, down from 4.79 percent the previous week.
In New Jersey, the top fund was Calvert Tax Free Reserves, N.J., with a 4.40 yield, compared with 5.11 last week.
In New York, the top fund was Salomon Brothers N.Y. Municipal Money Market fund, with a yield of 4.47 percent, down from 5.20 percent.
The assets of the tax-exempt funds rose by $4.1 billion, to $95.1 billion.
IBC/Donoghue's said the average number of days to maturity of securities held in the tax-free portfolios fell by one day, to 55.
Of the funds monitored by IBC/Donoghue's, with assets larger than $100 million, the Strong Municipal Money Market Fund in Milwaukee, led the way with a 4.91 percent seven-day compound yield.
 
Taxable Assets Up
 The assets of the taxable funds were up by $26.9 billion, increasing assets to a total of $483.2 billion, from $456.3 billion the previous week. Of this, Mr. Frank said, about $21.3 billion came from institutional investors. At the beginning of the year, he said, there is traditionally a large inflow of funds.
The average days to maturity of the taxables this week fell by three days, to 56.
The average seven-day compounded taxable yield fell to 4.49 percent, from 4.61 the previous week, with the simple yield at 4.40 percent, compared with 4.51 percent. The 30-day compounded yield was down four basis points, to 4.62 from 4.66 percent, and the simple yield to 4.52 from 4.56.
The taxable fund with the best return was Prudential Command Money Fund with a return of 5.69 percent, some of which could be attributed to realized capital gains.
By comparison, the average bank money market account, a prime competitor of money funds, was at 4.06 percent, according to The Bank Rate Monitor's national index.

HEADLINE: Florio's Education Panel Offers Many Changes, at a Hefty Price

BYLINE: By WAYNE KING, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TRENTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
An educational study commission appointed by Gov. Jim Florio recommended a host of costly changes in the state's school system today, including adding 40 days to the school year and providing preschool to every 3- and 4-year-old in the state. But the panel offered no suggestions about how to pay for them.
The co-chairmen of the Governor's Quality Education Commission conceded that political and economic realities would make such changes extremely difficult, but dismissed suggestions that the recommendations were too visionary to come to pass. 
 "Can we afford some of these things?" asked James Cullen, the president and chief executive officer of New Jersey Bell and a co-chairman of the commission, which in the last year studied educational priorities at the behest of the Governor.
"We cannot afford not to," said Mr. Cullen. "We cannot afford not to deal with them."
The 29-member commission's 20 recommendations, which the panel said were intended to spur statewide discussion and debate, were handed to Governor Florio and the Board of Education today. They call for extending the school year to 220 days from the present 180 by the year 2000, lengthening the school day itself and providing "high-quality" preschool education to 3- and 4-year-olds.
 
A Shopping List of Ideas
 The panel also recommended a school refurbishment program that alone would cost $6 billion.
Mr. Cullen and the other co-chairman, P. Michael Timpane, president of Teachers College at Columbia University, said the commission made no attempt to assess costs of its recommendations, essentially creating a shopping list without price tags.
The ambitious proposals will certainly bring enormous costs to a state that already spends $10 billion, 40 percent of its total combined state and local revenue each year, on education, and has the nation's highest per-pupil expenditure, $9,410 in 1991.
The state's Education Commissioner, John Ellis, is laying plans to extend the school year, a move whose cost is an estimated $2 billion a year, mostly for increased teacher salaries and air-conditioning.
That means the recommendations will likely face tough sledding in a state already in the throes of a tax rebellion. Other commission proposals like consolidating some school districts to cuts administrative costs are likely to run into opposition because they threaten to dilute local control and raise the specter of combining urban and suburban school populations.
The commission co-chairmen emphasized that the recommendations for school consolidation were not intended to achieve racial integration, as has been suggested by the State's Public Advocate, Wilfredo Caraballo, and by Mr. Ellis. The idea has generated a storm of opposition.
Both the commission and Mr. Ellis said efforts at school consolidation were desirable not necessarily to achieve integration, but to improve educational quality and cut administrative costs.
Indeed, Mr. Ellis said in an interview that he did not want the question of consolidation to focus on racial balance and thus lead to emotional rather than rational debate. "If you introduce desegregation into consolidation, it is so polarizing you can't discuss the issue," Mr. Ellis said.
"Our society is unfortunately so race conscious" he said, "that introducing racial balance into the debate will probably be counterproductive."
 
Merger Proposals
 But New Jersey has about 600 school districts, and the commission recommends that any that do not provide a full kindergarten-through-12th-grade curriculum or that have an enrollment of fewer than 2,500 students be consolidated by the 1997-98 school year.
The commission recommended that a list of such schools be prepared, and that the list as a whole be either accepted or rejected by the Governor to avoid endless bargaining and revisions, and that it be automatically implemented unless rejected by the Legislature.
Some districts have fewer than 100 students -- one Hunterdon County district was said by the panel to have only 56 students -- and consolidation could pare the number of districts from 600 to about 250, Mr. Cullen said.
The panel's recommendations brought mixed reactions. The League of Women Voters, for example, was highly critical of a call for the state to continue to pay for all of teachers' pensions and social security costs.
 
Mixed Reactions
 Under the Governor's Quality Education Act, these costs were to be transferred to the local school districts, but the panel recommended full funding by the state.
But the League said full state funding would "undermine equal educational opportunity" because more affluent districts receive more money that poorer districts under state funding formulas.
The League maintained that state pension payments amount to $1,066 per pupil in Millburn and $1,037 in Ridgewood, compared with $522 in Camden and $617 in Irvington.
And while the current State Senate President, John A. Lynch, praised the recommendations as "insightful and well thought-out," the incoming chairman of the Assembly Education Committee, John A. Rocco, a Republican of Camden, criticized the committee for failing to recommend "fundamental changes in school finance"
The New Jersey School Boards Association, however, praised the recommendations as "forward-looking." While acknowledging that many of the proposed innovations, like expanding early childhood education, would require a substantial amount of money, the organization said the report should not be declared "dead on arrival simply because of today's difficult economic times."
The potential benefits are simply too great, the organization said.

HEADLINE: Broke Comptroller

BYLINE: By CONSTANCE L. HAYS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WATERBURY, Conn., Jan. 8

 BODY:
As the head of an accounting firm here that bears his name, Michael J. Maunsell made it his business to oversee the financial affairs of others. His clients included individuals and more complicated accounts, like that of the neighboring town of Southbury.
Those were the credentials that swept the political newcomer to victory last November when he ran for city comptroller on the Democratic ticket, a ticket that pledged fiscal responsibility for this onetime manufacturing center, which has stumbled badly under the combined effects of municipal scandal and the recession. 
 Thus, it was a shock for residents to learn today that Mr. Maunsell had filed for personal bankruptcy on Dec. 31, one day before taking his oath of office. Citing liabilities of $6.9 million and assets of $261,739, Mr. Maunsell and his wife, Eleanore, declared personal bankruptcy in Federal Bankruptcy Court in Hartford.
His debts, largely a result of failed real-estate investments, are considerably more than the city's own $4 million deficit.
While Mr. Maunsell is not charged with any crime and other officials were quick to point out that his problems are personal, not professional, some residents were clearly fed up with their public officials.
 
'Par for the Course'
 "All of a sudden, now, it comes out?" said an incredulous Fred Ruscitto, who was walking down Grand Street, Waterbury's boulevard of government buildings, buttoned up against the chill wind this afternoon. "Oh, sure. Seven million dollars, and you don't know about it till now? It should be pretty obvious."
"This isn't new at all," Mr. Ruscitto said, adding that he had voted for an independent candidate, Josephine Mills, for mayor. "This is par for the course."
Mr. Maunsell responded to requests for comment with a prepared statement, in which said he had filed for bankruptcy "to provide a fresh start for both myself and my family." The statement continued: "The need to file bankruptcy arose from my inability to sell real-estate investments made in the 80's. I regret the need to file personal bankruptcy and hope that you will understand."
Mr. Maunsell is not alone among Waterbury officials with legal problems.
The city's former Mayor, Joseph J. Santopietro, left office charged with an assortment of Federal crimes, among them receiving bribes, embezzlement and fraud. He is to go on trial next month. The current Mayor, Edward D. Bergin Jr., was acquitted in state court last April on charges of taking illegal payments from a towing company.
In his statement, Mr. Maunsell said he expected the bankruptcy filing "to have no adverse effect on my business or on my ability to manage the finances of the City of Waterbury."
 
'The Bottom Line'
 But some residents were not so sure. "This affects a lot of people in the city," said Joanne Silva, who works in a downtown stationery store, looking back at Waterbury's recent political history. "It's just a sad situation. The bottom line is greed, and deception, and it affects people's trust."
The Republican leader of the city's aldermen, Nicholas P. Augelli, said he declined to comment on Mr. Maunsell's situation "until all the facts are in." The chairman of the city's Democratic Party, Gary J. Reardon, said Mr. Maunsell's situation was, by and large, news to him. "I had heard a few things, that he may have been having trouble," Mr. Reardon said. "I was surprised at the extent of it. I wish him the best."
Among Mr. Maunsell's creditors is Citytrust, a Connecticut bank that was seized by Federal regulators last year. Mr. Maunsell was a partner in an investment group that took out a $5.6 million loan for a real-estate project. He also made investments in the Colonial Realty Company, a Hartford-based concern that went bankrupt in 1990, taking with it several banks and dozens of small investors.
 
Entire Amount of Loans
 Mayor Bergin said he had confidence in Mr. Maunsell's ability to do his job despite his personal problems. "He is at work today," said the Mayor, "and he will be at work tomorrow and the rest of the week." He added, "What he is going through, a great number of people are going through."
Mr. Maunsell was being pursued by creditors for the entire amount of loans taken out by an investment group in which he was a partner, Mr. Bergin said.
Colonial Realty figured prominently in the indictment of Mr. Santopietro, the former Mayor. Government prosecutors contend that he took bribes from Colonial officials in return for investing $1 million in city employees' pension funds with the company.

HEADLINE: Woolworth Cuts Back On Stores

BYLINE: By EBEN SHAPIRO

 BODY:
Facing a persistently weak economy, the Woolworth Corporation said yesterday that it planned to close, sell or reformat 900 of its 6,500 stores in the United States during the next 18 months.
Woolworth, which over its 113 years turned to selling clothes, shoes and sporting equipment after starting out as a simple variety store, said that half the closed stores would be reopened as faster-growing types of Woolworth stores. The company said that less than half of the 10,000 workers at the stores would lose their jobs. 
 The stores to be closed include about 500 clothing stores, 300 Kinney Family Shoe stores and 90 Woolworth stores, which together lost $50 million from January last year through October.
 
Redeploying Assets
 "Unfavorable economic conditions, that contributed to these results, have greatly accelerated the urgency and magnitude of our store closing and redeployment program," said Harold E. Sells, Woolworth's chairman and chief executive. The company characterized the move as a part of a continuing program to funnel assets to its fastest-growing units, which include Champs Sport, a sports clothing and equipment chain, Lady Foot Locker, a women's athletic shoe store, and Northern Reflections, an outdoor clothing store for women.
"We are taking the losers and trying to turn them into winners," Mr. Sells said.
The closings will lead to a charge of $250 million, or $1.92 a share, against the company's fourth-quarter earnings.
Woolworth, which got its start in 1879, when Frank Woolworth opened the Great Five Cent Store in Lancaster, Pa., has been expanding since 1982 beyond its slow-growing variety store business. Unable to compete directly with the large discount department stores, like Wal-Mart Stores Inc., on price and selection, Woolworth has been emphasizing convenience by concentrating the variety business on small Woolworth Express stores, selling items from toothpaste to film, in urban locations. The Woolworth stores themselves have found it increasingly difficult to compete with the discount giants.
 
One Big Success
 The company's biggest success has been with its Foot Locker stores, which have more than $1 billion in annual sales in the United States, out of a total of about $5.5 billion.
For the year ended January 1991, Woolworth had worldwide sales of $9.8 billion and profits of $317 million. The company has 9,300 stores in 11 countries, including the 6,500 in the United States. Woolworth said that the stores to be closed employ 4,700 full-time and 5,300 part-time employees. Mr. Sells said more than half the workers would be offered other jobs within the company. Woolworth has 70,000 employees in the United States.
The closings are spread out throughout the United States and are not concentrated in any particular area, a company spokeswoman said. .
Woolworth's closings are part of a general post-Christmas upheaval among retailers. Since the third dismal holiday selling season in a row ended last month, Zale, the Dallas-based jewelry retailer, announced it was closing 400 outlets; Seaman's, the largest furniture retailer in the Northeast, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, and the apparel retailer Hartmarx said it was consolidating its specialty and discount stores.
Analysts said Woolworth was taking a positive step to improve its profits. "Because of the uncertain economy, they have to close some of their upprofitable operations," said Walter Loeb, a retail consultant in New York. "They will see an immediate payback."
 
Stores With Potential
 Jeffrey Feiner, a retail analyst with Salomon Brothers, said, "They are concentrating on those stores and business which have the most favorable long-term growth potential."
Woolworth's stock rose $1.50 yesterday, to $29 a share, in trading on the New York Stock Exchange.
Of the clothing stores being closed, Woolworth is shutting 207 women's apparel boutiques that do business under the Susie's and Sportelle names, including the Susie's store that is in the landmark Woolworth Building in lower Manhattan.
The company plans to convert those locations into other formats. The struggling Susie's stores were unable to compete with more fashionable retailers.
Woolworth also said it planned to close its 268-store Richman Brothers/Anderson-Little men's and women's apparel shops, along with three manufacturing plants. Woolworth said it would try to sell the Richman Brothers/Anderson-Little unit as an operating company.
The 300 Kinney family shoe stores being closed represent one-quarter of the total Kinney stores. And 90 Woolworth general merchandise stores out of 1,000 are being shut.
In a recent report on Woolworth, a retail analyst for the investment firm of Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, Richard N. Baum, called Kinney Family Shoe stores "a survior in a declining segment." Mr. Baum said Kinney profits had come under pressure because of competition from more focused sellers of athletic shoes and women's shoes.
 
Opening Up Locations
 Mr. Sells of Woolworth said the store closings "will give us an immediate inventory of good locations" for the company's faster-growing businesses.
Mr. Sells said 10 percent of the company's stores in the United States were in space formerly occupied by a different type of company store.
Many of the Susie's stores will be converted into Northern Reflections, an outdoor store developed in Canada that has been popular with consumers. There are 30 such stores in the United States, and Mr. Sells said there might be 500 within five years.
Mr. Feiner of Salomon Brothers said the stores had "demonstrated the ability to grow at very high rates businesses that they developed initially."
The company's fast-growing Lady Foot Locker division will also move into some of the Susie's locations.
But Mr. Loeb, the analyst, warned that the women's shoe business was becoming increasingly crowded and that the company's growth in that area might slow.
Woolworth also said yesterday that an accounting change related to pension issues would lead to a charge of $115 million, or 88 cents a share, in its current fiscal year.
The company also said it planned capital expenditures of $400 million in the year beginning Jan. 26, 1992, mostly for opening 850 stores worldwide. This amount includes expenditures for stores to be opened in space freed up by the closing of underperforming stores.

HEADLINE: Contributions To Neediest Aid Homeless

BYLINE: By J. PEDER ZANE

 BODY:
"The other day as our 4-year-old was festooning the living room, he suddenly stopped to ask, 'Do homeless people have any Christmas decorations?' " Anna Mayer of Dobbs Ferry wrote in a note with her family's $100 contribution to The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.
"When I told him I thought most homeless people didn't, he thought for a minute. Then he ran to the hallway where he had hung his favorite, most colorful ornament. 'Let's send them this one,' he said. He put it gently into a shoe box. Back in the living room he picked up another ornament to put into the shoe box. 'Maybe they would like to have two,' he said. Our family's donation is in honor of Daniel and his spirit of giving." 
 That spirit to help society's most public and persistent symbols of need has prompted scores of people to designate their Neediest Cases donations for the homeless.
Stanley Rosenfeld of Manhasset, L.I., said he was moved to give after a disturbing experience. After attending a performance at Lincoln Center, he said, he was "surprised to see homeless people sleeping outside this magnificent edifice." He said he hoped his $50 donation "can somehow help these unfortunate people particularly since the weather is turning cold."
 
More Than 'a Little Change'

 
 The daily frustration of seeing the homeless but not knowing how to help in a meaningful way led Sumiko Patrone of Manhattan to give $50. "I have never given money to homeless people when I pass by on the street even though I feel pain to look at them," he wrote. "I believe that we, as a society, should have some kind of program to place them in proper living condition instead of giving them a little change now and then."
Mr. Patrone's donation combined with thousands of others helps buy food and clothing to meet the immediate needs of homeless people. The seven charities supported by the Neediest Cases also the use the money to run programs that pull people out of homelessness. The Children's Aid Society, for example, uses money from the Neediest Cases to maintain 34 apartments for homeless families to live in while they are helped to find permanent housing.
The Federation of Protestant Welfare Agencies uses the money for the Open Door, a center on Ninth Avenue and 41st Street that provides up to 220 homeless people with food and shelter each day.
Since it was founded in 1912 by Adolph S. Ochs, who was then the publisher of The New York Times, the Neediest Cases Fund has raised money for New York's sick, poor and disabled. The Times covers all of the campaign's overhead so that every dollar collected can be passed on directly to the seven charities.
Last year the Fund raised $4.4 million. This year's appeal, conducted against a background of poverty and economic anxiety made even more pervasive by the recession, topped the $4 million mark yesterday, with two months to go.
Dan Margulis and Carole Kahrs of Princeton, N.J., who did not want the amount of their donation disclosed, wrote, "Those people who hesitate to give spare change to people begging on the streets for fear they that they don't really need it or will use the money unwisely, can, through your fund, do something to directly address the enormous problem of homelessness in this city."
Brenda Hilsberg of Manhattan, who gave $50, echoed their sentiments. "Thanks for making it possible for those of us who care to help ease the burden for those less fortunate than we."

HEADLINE: Many Electronics Makers Avoid Recession's Brunt

BYLINE: By ANTHONY RAMIREZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LAS VEGAS, Nev., Jan. 8

 BODY:
As the consumer electronics industry meets today at a mammoth semiannual show here, the nation's purveyors of color television sets, videocassette recorders, car stereos and cellular telephones can look back at 1991 as a year in which they escaped the worst effects of the recession. Sales actually rose.
Figures released this week by the Electronic Industries Association, the consumer electronics trade group, show that factory sales totaled a record $33.9 billion, up 2.9 percent from the year before. Since electronics prices were virtually unchanged, or in some cases lower than a year earlier, inflation-adjusted sales rose by more than 3 percent. 
 That passes for success when retailers and most other consumer-products companies watched in dismay as Christmas shoppers, hands nowhere near their wallets and purses, hummed past holiday displays and said politely, "Just looking."
 
Ever-Optimistic Exhibitors
 Home computer and cellular phone sales were strong as entrepreneurs and small businesses looked for new ways to gain efficiency and sales. Color televisions remained the best-selling category, but sales were almost flat, while camcorders gained popularity as consumers sought to upgrade their video systems.
About 1,500 ever-optimistic exhibitors have gathered under the sunny, if slightly chilly, Nevada skies this week. They have rented a record 840,000 square feet -- about two-and-a-half times the area of the Great Pyramid of Cheops -- at the Las Vegas Convention Center and three hotels. About 75,000 people, mainly buyers from retail chains, will see the latest in new products.
Veterans of these shows complain that they see only permutations of some hardy perennial products, but nothing truly new. Among this year's permutations are televisions shaped more like movie screens so that wide-screen epics like "Lawrence of Arabia" are not chopped on the left and right, like the mythological Procrustes who shortened his victims to fit his iron bed.
The set, under the RCA label, is made by Thomson Consumer Electronics, a unit of the French giant that owns the RCA and General Electric television brands. It has proportions of 16 by 9 compared with the typical 4 by 3 and is scheduled for distribution to leading retailers this year.
Still, there are some genuine innovations. Just as the compact disk has eclipsed the long-playing vinyl record and is beginning to hurt tape cassette sales, the music industry will now attempt to interest listeners in two newer formats: the Sony Corporation's mini-disk, a recordable disk smaller than current compact disks; and Philips N.V.'s digital compact cassette, a tape that can carry and record digital music.
Many in the industry say Sony and Philips are being more cautious than expected about introducing these media, apparently fearing consumer confusion and resistance. But the sales of blank audio cassettes totaled $357 million last year, down about 5 percent, so the industry is interested in another recording medium to revive sales.
Some traditional big-ticket items fared poorly in 1991, according to the Electronic Industries Association figures. Color televisions and projection televisions, the biggest-selling category of consumer electronic products, with $7 billion of sales, were up about 1 percent; videocassette recorders, with $2.5 billion, were up by about the same percentage, and audio components, about $2 billion, were up even less than that.
Companies like Panasonic and Yamaha say sales of stereo receivers, which would seem to be postponable expenses, are flat over all. Mainly, the expensive units are selling well. Consumers are buying better equipment, said Steve C. Girod, vice president of marketing for the Yamaha Electronics Corporation of Buena Park, Calif.
 
'Surround Sound' Effect
 Many consumers are upgrading their color televisions and videocassette recorders by improving the sound with better speakers and receivers. New features give "surround sound" effects like those in a movie theater, so the Terminator's sawed-off shotgun sounds like it is roaring just behind the living-room rhododendrons.
Those big-ticket items used by business people, or newer to the market, sold especially strongly. Cellular telephones, which can cost up to $2,500 apiece, totaled about $1.4 billion in sales. That was a 9.3 percent gain for the year, the largest rise of any leading category of electronic products. Camcorders, the little video cameras that cost up to $1,000, were the second-strongest growth segment, with $2.4 billion in sales, up 5.8 percent.
Home computers were relatively popular, too. With 1991 sales of $4 billion, they grew about 6 percent. With the economy in such a poor state, the Tandy Corporation said, many of its units are being bought by small businesses or by professionals working feverishly at home. "The only difference these days between a home and an office computer is where it's located," said Edward Juge, director of market planning for Tandy, based in Fort Worth. "People are looking for computer horsepower wherever they are, and the recession just heightens that need."
Car stereos, especially the expensive ones, often costing around $800, grew 5.5 percent, with annual sales of $4.5 billion. Many drivers are buying fancy compact-disk changers that hold four or five CD's, or a whole traffic jam's worth of music. "They're putting the bigger changers in their trunk," said Jack De Basio, national product planning manager for the Clarion Corporation of America in Gardena, Calif., with a note of glee in his voice.
Sales of many little-ticket items were especially slow. Portable tape and compact-disk players, which cost from $25 to $300, had sales of about $1.6 billion, down 3 percent from the year before. Sales of telephones, both conventional and cordless, were flat at about $1.15 billion, although they usually cost well under $100 apiece.
As for the longer-term trends, a new study by Veronis, Suhler & Associates, a New York investment banking firm, found that Americans are spending less time on leisure activities, but more time listening to recordings and watching videocassettes.
The survey, comparing how adults spent their leisure time in 1985 and 1990, found that annual leisure activities declined from an average of 3,307 hours in 1985 to 3,262 hours in 1990, or by nearly two full days. Americans spent less time watching network television, listening to the radio and reading newspapers and magazines, according to the survey.
But the average American spent more time listening to recorded music (up 27 percent) and a lot more time watching recorded videocassettes (up 233 percent).

Tandem Sees Cuts and Loss

BYLINE: AP

DATELINE: CUPERTINO, Calif., Jan. 8

 BODY:
Citing the recession and changes in the industry, Tandem Computers Inc. said today that it would restructure operations and would likely post an operating loss for its first fiscal quarter, which ended Dec. 31.
Tandem, known for computers with redundant parts to prevent breakdowns, said it would take a $90 million restructuring charge for the quarter. The company did not estimate the amount of the loss but said it would not be solely because of the restructuring. 
 "We believe the economic framework of the computer industry is changing," said James G. Treybig, Tandem's president and chief executive.
The restructuring -- including consolidation of offices and work force reductions -- should save $40 million to $50 million in the 1992 fiscal year and $90 million to $100 million in 1993.
Tandem has cut the number of employees by 3 percent since July, to slightly more than 11,000, and expects an additional 6 percent reduction during the 1992 fiscal year.
Tandem shares rose $1.25 a share today, closing at $12.875 on the New York Stock Exchange.

HEADLINE: Consumers' Borrowing Restrained

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 8

 BODY:
Consumers kept a tight rein on their use of credit in November, the Federal Reserve Board said today, paying off more in car and bank loans than they took out.
As a result, outstanding credit balances expanded by a slight $27 million after revised growth of $1.67 billion in October and $43 million in September. 
 Originally, the Fed said October consumer credit expanded by $802 million.
Consumer reluctance to borrow and spend in the face of high unemployment is considered a key factor in the economy's difficulty in struggling out of recession.
Purchases of goods and services by consumers fuels about two-thirds of economic activity, so a spending slowdown quickly leads to production cuts.
The most obvious area of continuing slack credit demand was in loans for new cars, which fell in November by $952 million after contracting by $211 million in October and $1.68 billion in September.
Consumers paid off more in car loans than they took out in each of the first 11 months of 1991 as car dealers rang up their poorest sales year since 1983.
Credit charged on credit cards expanded in November by $1.01 billion, lower than the increases of $1.59 billion registered in October and $2.62 billion in September.
Other credit, including bank loans but not home mortgages, was cut back by $160 million in November after growing by $235 million in October but shrinking by $288 million in September.
Credit for the purchase of mobile homes grew in November by $125 million after a $51 million increase in October. This category was down by $603 million in September, the Fed said.
At the end of November, consumers owed a total of $733 billion.

Head of Minolta in U.S. Gives Up President's Job

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
After 22 years as the head of the American subsidiary of the Minolta Camera Company, Sadahei Kusumoto is finally going to be able to concentrate on the part of the job he likes best: representing Minolta to the outside world.
Mr. Kusumoto, who is currently president and chief executive of the Minolta Corporation, will become chairman and chief executive on Jan. 25, turning over the post of president to Osamu Kanaya, who will also be named chief operating officer. 
 "We were only selling cameras when I first came from Japan in 1954," Mr. Kusumoto said. "Now business equipment is bigger than cameras, and it's much more complicated."
Mr. Kusumoto, 63, has been among the most visible Japanese executives in the United States and, according to Minolta, he has now been here longer than any other Japanese manager of an American subsidiary. During his tenure, the Minolta Corporation's sales have risen to $780 million from $11 million.
In recent years, Mr. Kusumoto has been active in the United Way and has advised other Japanese executives on the importance of philanthropic activities in American corporate life. He has also organized contacts between Japanese and black executives to fight perceptions of Japanese racism.
The combination of those activities and a heavy travel schedule to maintain relations with Minolta's 500 equipment distributors has increasingly left his desk in Ramsey, N.J., stacked with work related to internal problems, Mr. Kusumoto said. Now such day-to-day problems will become the responsibility of Mr. Kanaya, 57, a Minolta Camera director who has held a number of financial, planning and administrative positions since joining the company at its Osaka headquarters in 1957.
Mr. Kusumoto said that Mr. Kanaya would be inheriting a tough assignment.
"The recession here is going to last longer than everyone expected," Mr. Kusumoto said. "It's important to organize the company to deal with it. On top of the recession, we have the problem that the yen is getting stronger. It will require great attention to detail."
What advice will he give Mr. Kanaya when he arrives from Japan? "Talking frankly," Mr. Kusumoto said, "is the key to success in the United States."

Coltec Planning Initial Offering

 BODY:
Coltec Industries announced a plan to reduce its huge debt with a $500 million initial public stock offering and a $450 million bond sale.
The New York-based concern, a privately owned maker of aerospace, automotive and industrial products and previous owner of Colt Firearms, filed a proposal on Tuesday to sell 38.5 million shares of common stock, a 60 percent stake, for an estimated $14 a share. 
 Taking advantage of low interest rates, Coltec also announced plans to sell $200 million of senior notes and $250 million of senior subordinated notes.
The company has been closely held since Morgan Stanley led its $660 million leveraged buyout in 1988. Coltec sold its trademark Colt Firearms division in 1990.

G.P.U.'s Chief Started At the Ground Level

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
James R. Leva became president and chief executive of the General Public Utlities Corporation yesterday, 40 years after starting there as a ground hand digging holes for utility poles.
Mr. Leva, 59 years old, had been president and chief operating officer of Jersey Central Power and Light, a subsidiary company based in Morristown, N.J., since 1986. In taking the helm at the holding company, he succeeds William G. Kuhns, who was brought out of retirement last May to replace Standley H. Hoch. Mr. Hoch resigned because of a controversy over his personal relationship with a woman who was then G.P.U.'s vice president for corporate communications. 
 Mr. Leva, who came to Jersey Central Power in 1952 after serving two years with the Marines in Korea, later became a lineman. Then, as a night troubleman, he put himself through Fairleigh Dickinson University, where he earned an electrical engineering degree magna cum laude. He served as a union shop steward and later as vice president for personnel, safety and services, among other posts. He received a law degree from Seton Hall University in 1980 and served as mayor of Morris Township, N.J., for two terms, as well as in various other government posts.
Speaking of his rise from ground hand to the top of the corporate ladder, he said in a telephone interview: "There is less and less of an opportunity for that to happen. I really don't know why. But we seem to take more professionals out of college." He added that he did not know of any linemen working their way through college now.
The holding company, with 1991 revenues of about $3.2 billion, is one of the 20 largest investor-owned utilities, serving 1.9 million customers over an area comprising about half of Pennsylvania and New Jersey.
A key issue for G.P.U., which is based in Parsippany, N.J., is the national debate over transmission access. That involves the terms under which outsiders -- either independent generators or distant utilities -- are allowed to ship power over the lines of a company like G.P.U. to sell to customers who are far away, or even in G.P.U.'s service territory.
Opening up the system would increase competition, but Mr. Leva said: "It's really hard to put a handle on what this transmission access will bring. Our solution is not to be mean -- but lean and flexible."
The company's revenues have declined lately, and Mr. Leva said that if the weather stayed mild, they might not rebound, even though he expects the recession to ease in the second quarter.

HEADLINE: Orders Down At Airbus

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: PARIS, Jan. 8

 BODY:
The four-nation European aircraft consortium Airbus Industrie said today that its new orders fell to about 100 last year, down sharply from 404 in 1990 and below the forecasts of 145 for 1991.
An Airbus spokesman also said the group delivered slightly fewer than the 170 jets it forecast for 1991. In 1990, it delivered 95 aircraft, with the number held down by a strike at one of its partners. 
 The spokesman declined to give exact 1991 order and delivery figures, saying those would be announced by Jean Pierson, an Airbus managing director, at a news conference Thursday.
"Everybody's orders are down this year," the spokesman said. "It was, as we expected, a lot worse than previous years."
All civil aircraft makers expected orders to plunge in 1991 because of the losses suffered by most world airlines and because a pause was likely after the buying binge in the late 1980's.
Airlines have been hurt by economic downturns in the United States and Western Europe and by the Persian Gulf crisis of late 1990 and early 1991, which caused world airline traffic to drop steeply.
Airbus is a consortium made up of Aerospatiale of France, British Aerospace P.L.C., Construcciones Aeronauticas S.A. of Spain and the Deutsche Airbus unit of Daimler-Benz A.G. of Germany.
It booked a record 421 orders in 1989.

HEADLINE: A 1930's Visionary Who Looked Back And Saw Santa Fe

BYLINE: By PATRICIA LEIGH BROWN

DATELINE: SANTA FE, N.M.

 BODY:
BEFORE the Range Rovers, the howling coyote sculptures and Santa Fe (the fragrance), there was an architect named John Gaw Meem, whose wildly romantic Spanish Pueblo revival houses, built primarily in the 1930's, set the stage for it all.
Mr. Meem arrived in this luminous landscape of pinon and juniper in 1920. From 1924 until his death in 1983, he designed houses and churches, municipal and university buildings that married the spirit of native pueblo architecture with the necessities of the modern world. 
 With deliberately battered corners and other atmospheric effects, he created what Chris Wilson, a cultural historian, calls "pueblo getaways from the modern world." Despite the recent preponderance of blue-corn gourmets and Anglos longing to be Navajos, Mr. Meem's imagery -- exotic fantasies of life in the Southwest -- endures.
His houses, which number around 150 in and around Santa Fe, were designed for wealthy, spirited clients, including East Coast sophisticates and women of opinion. In the early 1930's, Amelia Beard Hollenback, who was the first woman to photograph a Hopi snake dance, instructed Mr. Meem, "I want something extremely informal that will let us amuse ourselves with old ways and old things, but may Heaven preserve it from looking Arty!"
"Daddy was fortunate in having very paternalistic clients," said Nancy Wirth, Mr. Meem's daughter, who still lives where she grew up, in a two-story stone house designed by her father in 1937. "He used to say that the best clients were the ones who sat down with him, told him what they wanted and then went to Europe for the year."
Mr. Meem's influence is found in the portals of the Plaza in Santa Fe, which were added in 1969; in a 1929 renovation of La Fonda Hotel; in the Laboratory of Anthropology, and in the main campus of the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, which contains some 30 buildings designed by Mr. Meem.
But it extends to more than his architecture. As chairman of the city Planning Commission, he helped develop the city's first master plan in 1947, which helped protect the character of downtown Santa Fe.
As chairman of the New Mexico Society for the Restoration and Preservation of New Mexico Mission Churches, Meem the preservationist personally restored dozens of historic mission churches, including those at Acoma, Laguna and Zia pueblos.
Today, the cult of John Gaw Meem, who was an engineer by training and never completed his formal architectural training, flourishes among regional architects. Last summer, the Historic Santa Fe Foundation, a private preservation group, organized a special John Gaw Meem house tour. "He's arguably the single most important person in the way the city looks today," said Mr. Wilson, who is writing a book for the University of New Mexico Press called "The Myth of Santa Fe."
His buildings, Mr. Wilson added, "still serve as the ideal image of Santa Fe style."
In other words, John Gaw Meem made Santa Fe safe for Ralph Lauren.
Mr. Meem drew inspiration from regional architecture, but his designs were very much his own. In a 12-room summer house built in 1930 for Eleanor Brownell and Alice Howland near Bishop's Lodge, it is necessary to duck one's head and step high over the raised thresholds when passing through the antique doors. To simulate the earthen floors of early New Mexican houses, which were treated with ox blood to keep them free of dust, Mr. Meem used a dark-brown mastic covering somewhat like linoleum.
The house is arranged like a traditional hacienda, with a chain of rooms gathered around a placita, or open courtyard. The late architectural historian Bainbridge Bunting, who wrote a monograph on Mr. Meem, referred to such houses as "inscapes," a poetic meeting of pueblo spirit and the material world.
Laban Wingert, a Santa Fe architect, has the delicate task of helping a couple who remodeled the house unsympathetically bring it back to Mr. Meem's original plan. "Mr. Meem had such a wonderful sense of form," he observed. "Every corner and projection was thought out."
Each Meem house is a miniature world: quiet, comforting spaces with flickering fireplaces that keep the tumult of the modern world at bay. Like the houses of the California architects Greene & Greene, they seem both aged and ageless, appearing to have magically sprouted from the soil.
These days, cutesy shops overrrun the Plaza and the most authentic-feeling place downtown is Woolworth's. It is difficult to imagine that in 1920, the pueblo style, which now attracts tourists like flypaper, was on the decline.
When Mr. Meem first came to Santa Fe, to recuperate from tuberculosis, the vogue was not flat-roof adobe dwellings but pitched-roof houses with expanses of glass imported from St. Louis and Kansas City. Along with the artist and photographer Carlos Vierra and others, Mr. Meem advocated a return to vernacular styles, the more weathered-looking and beat-up, the better.
"Some old forms are so honest, so completely logical and native to the environment," he once wrote, "that one finds -- to one's delight and surprise -- that modern problems can be solved and are best solved by use of forms based on tradition."
Santa Fe was hardly the typical small town, even in 1920. It was the adventurous bohemian's alternative to Paris and Greenwich Village. During his stay at the Sunmount Sanatorium, Mr. Meem hobnobbed with other wealthy patients. As there is today, there was an unusual abundance of potential commissions for the right architect.
Mr. Meem's houses, photographed by Ansel Adams and Laura Gilpin, contemporaries he hired to record his work, physically embody the Santa Fe fantasy. They have mellowed beyond preciousness and are almost excruciatingly civilized. From chunky wooden chandeliers made from church beams to rustic plank flooring, they are distinctive for their understated but abundant use of ornament, much of it adapted from graphic pueblo and Spanish designs.
In one living room, for instance, Mr. Meem designed a herringbone-pattern ceiling using vigas (unmilled ceiling beams in the natural shape of a tree), and latillas (golden-colored aspen poles stripped of their bark). Lowly details like mirror frames and radiator covers were excuses for handcrafted stamped-tin motifs drawn from Indian and Spanish sources. Mr. Meem's sense of graciousness also led him to lavish attention on hallways and other forgotten household spaces.
A number of Mr. Meem's best clients were collectors who scoured the countryside for church beams and other antique architectural details. Amelia Hollenback, who spent the autumn months in Santa Fe to attend Indian ceremonial dances, was an astute and voracious collector.
"It's lots of fun," she wrote Mr. Meem of her shopping sprees while her house was being planned. "I wish we were building a village."
Completed in 1932, her house was the apotheosis of the genre, a "domestic cloisters for the Southwest," in Mr. Wilson's words. Like many of Mr. Meem's houses, it has intentionally wobbly silhouettes and rounded corners, giving the impression of having been eroded over time.
The size of the rooms was dictated by the dimensions of the old beams Miss Hollenback collected. Among her prizes, seamlessly incorporated into the architecture, are a large number of Spanish colonial doors, carved beams from Acoma and Gran Quivira, a historic pueblo site, and a rare carved portal beam from 1828 decorated with hex signs and archaic Spanish writing.
"Amelia was out collecting the things that everyone else was throwing away," said Mary Jean Cook, who now owns the 15-room house with her husband Dr. Edward S. Cook. "Meem listened to her ideas, and thank God he did."
The Cooks purchased the house, which was hardly used after its completion, in 1971. For the last 13 years, Mrs. Cook, a musician and historian, has been working on a book on Miss Hollenback, who has become something of an alter ego. Miss Hollenback left some 6,000 photographs in a trunk, and her ballgown still hangs in the closet. Mrs. Cook carries her briefcase; the Cooks' cat is named Amelia Hollenback.
Much to Mrs. Cook's delight, Miss Hollenback kept detailed records of both the building process and her collection, noting on a tag the date and origin of each piece. Mrs. Cook is so committed to retaining the original feeling of the house that she does the mud work on the portale walls and fireplaces herself, based on Mr. Meem's own "recipe."
Many owners of Meem houses seem to share this maternal, curatorial feeling. "My philosophy is, don't monkey with it," said Dr. Orville Linck, a retired English professor, who lives in a small Meem house on Delgado Lane. "It's the livability of the place. You get into it, and it's a part of you."

HEADLINE: Russian Actor Tells Of Chaotic Freedom In Russian Theater

BYLINE: By GLENN COLLINS

 BODY:
There are easier things than being an actor in Russia these days, even if you're one of the country's superstars. Russian film makers go begging for financing. Theater companies can't locate the essentials for costumes and props. Finding even a loaf of bread can be difficult. Audiences dwindle as citizens become increasingly distracted by the hunt for necessities. And some of the best playwrights, shell-shocked by political and social upheaval, won't write new works until they regain their artistic bearings.
"But there is one wonderful thing -- we are free," said Vitaly Mefodiyevich Solomin, a Russian stage and film star who will perform at the Circle in the Square Theater on Broadway on Saturday night. "All the constraints and hardships have forced us to be more creative. And at the end of all of this, I think we will have reinvented our theater." 
 Mr. Solomin is a principal actor with the Maly Theater in Moscow, the 235-year-old national company that performs Russian and European classics. He may be remembered by American film buffs for his performances in two Soviet films, "Winter Cherry" and "Siberian Story." But he is known to nearly every Russian for his roles in more than 70 Soviet films, and is absolutely beloved for his portrayal of Dr. Watson in "Sherlock Holmes" on Russian television.
On Saturday evening, American audiences will have a chance to see Mr. Solomin for the first time in a solo performance that will be attended by the Russian Federation's Consul General, Ivan Kuznetsov, and other Russian political and cultural figures in New York.
 
Excerpts of Best-Known Roles
 In "An Evening With Vitaly Solomin," the 50-year-old actor will present excerpts, in Russian, from many of his best-known performances. They include the roles of Ivan Khlestakov from "The Inspector-General" by Nikolai Gogol; the octogenarian Firs in "The Cherry Orchard" by Anton Chekhov, and Laurence Shannon, the defrocked minister in Tennessee Williams's "Night of the Iguana," which is a permanent part of the Maly's repertory.
Mr. Solomin's performance "is a celebration of the Circle in the Square's relationship with Russia and the Maly Theater," said Theodore Mann, artistic director at the Circle in the Square. In 1989 Mr. Mann directed "Night of the Iguana" at the Maly, and last year Boris A. Morozov, the Moscow company's resident director, directed "Zoya's Apartment" here. Fifty acting students from Russia and the United States have thus far participated in an exchange program between the two theaters. "This is the first opportunity American audiences have had to see one of the greatest actors in the world," said Mr. Mann, who has worked with George C. Scott, Raul Julia, Colleen Dewhurst and James Earl Jones through the years.
Although some in New York's Russian community have dubbed Mr. Solomin the Paul Newman of Russia, the bearded, 6-foot-tall, hazel-eyed performer bears more of a resemblance in person to the actor Robert Shaw, projecting the same on-stage gravitas and rugged introspection. So heroic is his physique that he was the model for a colossal World War II Russian soldier in a bronze victory monument in Moscow.
"But really, I think Vitaly is sort of a cross between Kevin Kline and John Malkovich," said Mr. Mann, who has worked with both of them. "His physicality is like Kevin's, but he has the danger of Malkovich. He's a little scary on stage."
 
During the Coup Attempt
 He can be no less formidable off stage. In August he stood with the crowd of truculent Muscovites outside what was known as the Russian White House as they waited to do battle for Boris Yeltsin against troops supporting the abortive coup. The troops never arrived. And when Mr. Solomin returns to Moscow this month, he will star in a film, "Black Square," that seeks to expose the lords of the Russian mafia, the ringleaders of organized crime.
"The film is based on documented research about the ways in which the mafia operates, from the top down, in Russian society," Mr. Solomin said, modulating his big voice casually as his words were translated by Katya Obraztsova, who directed him in his last play, at the independent Actis Cultural Center in Moscow.
"The mafia may try to steal our equipment and sabotage the film," he added. "I suppose our own safety depends on how far 'Black Square' goes in exposing the mafia."
"Black Square" is breaking ground in another way, as a model of the new capitalism. "It's the first privately financed film I've ever acted in," said Mr. Solomin, who made his first film 30 years ago at the age of 20. "And the film will be exhibited outside of the traditional Soviet distribution system."
In his performance on Saturday, Mr. Solomin will also present selections from such contemporary Russian dramas as "The Cage" by Aleksandr Kastinsky, an allegorical play about imprisoned birds that created a sensation in Moscow when Mr. Solomin starred in it last fall.
 
Keeping Up With Chaos
 The play, which will tour America this spring, is still being rewritten to reflect the current political chaos. "But ever since the putsch, many of our best writers have been silent," said Mr. Solomin. "They don't know what to write, because they don't know what to think. They need to come to an understanding of what has happened. But eventually, they will make sense of all this, and they'll revolutionize our theater."
Mr. Solomin said Russian drama needed to break away from its "wholly political" tradition. He added: "In our country, even Shakespeare was seen as a vehicle for political comment, disguised though it was. Now all the plays about Stalin and Brezhnev are so dated, so insular and political. We need to go beyond that, to a theater about humanity, to create a theater of the world."
If the new artistic freedom is welcome, the new economic freedom is increasingly problematical, said Mr. Solomin. "A lot of uncultured money-grubbers are getting involved in film and theater, just to make a profit," he said, and laughed. "Just like here!"
While some theater companies, including the Maly in Moscow, continue to receive subsidies from the central Government, Mr. Solomin said, other troupes are being absorbed by local municipalities, which may not be able to finance them. Most are seeking private funds. Some companies eke out an existence by charging rent for office space in their buildings. And managing producers are agonizing that now, in an era when the state-subsidized theater ticket is no more, they may lose audiences by charging too much.
Mr. Solomin, who was born in Siberia, moved to Moscow at the age of 17 to attend the Maly Theater's school, and still lives in the city with his wife, Masha, the editor of a Russian fashion magazine, and their two daughters, who are 18 and 7 years old.
How can Russians in the arts survive in this time of chaos? "It's hard, but you must keep going your own way," he said. "You must not lose yourself." He smiled. "You must be very quiet in this unquiet time."

N.C.A.A. Adopts Tougher Academic Standards for Eligibility

BYLINE: By MICHAEL MARTINEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ANAHEIM, Calif., Jan. 8

 BODY:
Delegates to the annual National Collegiate Athletic Association Convention continued adopting stronger academic standards on the aging heels of Proposition 48, including a significant and predictably controversial change today that will require incoming athletes to have a higher grade-point average in core academic classes.
Other changes include a toughened requirement that athletes make progress toward a degree and an increase in the number of core-course credits taken by high school students from 11 to 13. The additional subjects must be in English, mathematics or natural or physical science. 
 The passage of the proposals, over strong opposition from black educators, brought the most sweeping changes by the convention since the 1983 passage of Proposition 48, which allowed schools to accept academically deficient athletes but cost those students one year of eligibility so they could concentrate on their studies. That measure, like today's revisions, brought controversy because many believe the standardized tests that weigh heavily in the Proposition 48 formula are culturally and racially biased.
 
Presidents' Recommendations
 "It's going to have a detrimental impact upon access to higher education for African-American students," William DeLauder, president of Delaware State, said of the toughened requirements, which he said had not been well researched. "Any proposal that we bring forward that's going to have an impact on young people's lives ought to be based on sound reason and not on arbitrary reasons. Despite all the discussion, I have not seen anything that has a sound basis."
The more stringent rules follow the recommendations of the Presidents' Commission, a 44-member group of college presidents that has spent the last two years following an agenda of greater involvement in their athletic departments.
The revised measure, Proposition 16, passed easily, by a margin of 249 to 72, although it faced considerable debate and survived a motion by Frank Rienzo, the athletic director at Georgetown University, to refer it back to the academic requirements committee.
Proposition 16 and Proposition 14, which requires two additional course credits for high school athletes, do not take effect until Aug. 1, 1995.
Proposition 16 establishes freshman eligibility guidelines based on a sliding scale that takes into account an incoming freshman's grade-point average and test scores on either the Scholastic Aptitude Test or the American College Testing standardized test.
A student with a score of 700 on the S.A.T. or 17 on the A.C.T., for example, would be required to have a grade-point average of 2.5 on a scale of 4.0. The scale allows for students with lower grade-point averages to be eligible by testing higher in the standardized tests. A student with a 2.0, therefore, could be eligible by testing 900 on the S.A.T. or 21 in the A.C.T.
Proposition 16 essentially tightens the guidelines of Proposition 48, which was the first legislation toward tougher entrance standards for student-athletes. Under Proposition 48, a student could be eligible to compete as a freshman with a 700 S.A.T. score (or a 15 in the A.C.T.) and an overall 2.0 grade-point average. The theory has been that student-athletes who do not meet those standards may need their freshman year to adjust before the additional stress of competing in intercollegiate athletics.
"If we require a 1.5, that's what we'll get," said R. Gerald Turner of the University of Mississippi, the chairman of the Presidents' Commission. "But 90 percent of those who do 2.0 can do 2.5. Our goal is to establish standards that fairly and accurately communicate to young students that if they do these, they will get a degree."
Some delegates, however, said they believed that the new rule would severely affect athletes who are members of minority groups.
"There are going to be kids who will be denied access to education," Rienzo said. "I think the road to academic reform will be covered with the bodies of socio-economically disadvantaged individuals, and the Presidents' Commission is leading the way. Those individuals have no way of representing themselves."
 
Rule Called Unfair
 Backlash against Proposition 16 was immediate and not confined to academia. Representative Edolphus Towns, Democrat of Brooklyn, issued a statement that said: "The proposition is discriminatory, because student athletes are held to higher educational standards than the rest of the student population.
"It seems to me that this rule is unfair, and makes sense to individuals who do not have a solid perspective on the myriad challenges which confront black student athletes."
E. M. Jones, the faculty representative from Grambling State, a predominately black school, said the rules would eventually mean smarter athletes but also less money in the coffers of the universities.
"It's going to take us to a point in which we have A and B students on the football team, and I have no problem with that," he said. "At Grambling we graduate from 48 to 49 percent of scholarship student athletes. But perhaps they won't perform as well, won't be as exciting, and then the coffers are going to drop, because people won't pay to see a mediocre team."

HEADLINE: Mr. Cuomo's Sobering Speech

 BODY:
Even Gov. Mario Cuomo's soaring rhetorical skills were not enough to lift his State of the State address above the depths of a national recession. The New York Governor complained about weak national policies, restated his commitment to the needy and proposed limited programs to help the state. With the economy sagging and a state budget gap that could reach $4.5 billion in the next fiscal year, the speech was inevitably sobering.
Mr. Cuomo must fill in the blanks when he presents his budget later this month. He says he will cut Medicaid and welfare by $1 billion. How? He also wants to create jobs through an $800 million bond issue for construction. Would that add too much debt to deficit-ridden New York? 
 Also unclear is the status of the many public works projects the Governor cited yesterday. For example, Queens West, an ambitious plan for developing the Long Island City waterfront, hinges on private investors, and a state coordinating subsidiary has yet to be created.
The State of the State address is always more atmospheric than substantive. The Governor was strongest on defining a humane New York, one that will "look for solutions instead of scapegoats" and not cut welfare "simply to pander."
His remarks reflected the contentious fight in Albany over social service cuts. The Republican-controlled State Senate has made cutting welfare and Medicaid the centerpiece of its budget strategy, as the Senate's majority leader, Ralph Marino, outlined in his response to Mr. Cuomo. The Governor will need an intelligent plan to compete with Mr. Marino's, which cuts so deeply it would damage the safety net.
In sensible proposals, Mr. Cuomo once again cited the need for improving the school aid formula to channel more help to poor school districts, consolidating some school districts and boards and penalizing elected officials for every day they go past the April 1 deadline for a new budget. He also challenged the Legislature by calling for a constitutional convention to force budget reforms.
Judging from the sometimes combative tone of Mr. Cuomo's speech, he knows the April budget deadline is likely to be missed again this year.

HEADLINE: Aid, at Last, for the Republics

 BODY:
The republics of the former Soviet Union are struggling to turn decrepit Communism into vibrant capitalism. Even if successful, the transition will be traumatic. Ossified factories will close, throwing millions out of work; controls will be lifted, sending prices soaring. The entire fabric of society will have to be created anew.
The republics will need all the help they can get. So it is welcome news that the Bush Administration has finally endorsed membership for Russia and five other republics in the International Monetary Fund and World Bank. Membership allows the two institutions to provide billions of dollars of aid to support economic reform. 
 Until now the Bush Administration has rejected membership because the republics were not desperately poor and had promised but not yet delivered radical reform. All the republics have met the first condition by suffering economic implosion: output is plummeting, and millions face starvation. Russia and two other republics have now also met the second condition by launching sweeping price decontrol.
What type of aid is needed? The I.M.F. helps countries put together a disciplined program of economic stabilization, and provides aid only as long as the regimen is obeyed. The World Bank provides subsidized loans for investment in specific infrastructure projects.
By one estimate, Russia alone will need approximately $30 billion a year for five years, divided almost evenly among funds to stabilize the currency, import emergency food and import consumer goods during the initial burst of inflation. The funds would seek to ward off political backlash by cushioning the initial blow of harsh reform measures.
Even with membership, the republics will be hard pressed to stitch together capitalist institutions in time to make reform work. Without membership, the task would be nearly hopeless.

HEADLINE: ALBANY NOTEBOOK;
At Feel-Good Event, Most Felt Rotten

BYLINE: By CALVIN SIMS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ALBANY, Jan. 8

 BODY:
State of the State speeches are usually occasions when legislators smile, shake hands, applaud the Governor wildly or politely depending on their party and otherwise take a bath of good feelings, whether they feel good or not.
 But it is a measure of the frayed mood of officials here that the pretense this year not only faded but gave way about 40 minutes into Gov. Mario M. Cuomo's speech to a shouting match between Mr. Cuomo and an Assemblyman from his own party and hometown. 
Many legislators had been squirming in their seats as the Governor used his speech today to cast them as the enemy of widespread reforms. Specifically, Mr. Cuomo said, to avoid a repeat of last year's budget delay, elected officials should give up a day's pay for each day the budget is late. The budget was 65 days late last year.
 Angered by this suggestion, Assemblyman Anthony S. Seminerio, Democrat of Queens, interrupted Mr. Cuomo's speech, yelling: "It's good when you got a lot of dollars! It's good when you got a lot of dollars, Guv!"
 Mr. Cuomo stopped in midsentence and asked Mr. Seminerio if he needed a loan. And the two men had heated words for about three minutes as the audience laughed and applauded. Mr. Coumo ended the exchange, saying he was glad that "at least everybody is awake," referring to Mr. Seminerio, who has been known to nap during sessions.
 The exchange fit into the day's prevailing mood -- crabby. Like disgruntled students dragging back to class after a too-short recess, New York State's 211 legislators returned to the Capitol today to listen to the Governor's message and start a new session that is universally expected to prove the longest and most contentious in state history.
 Weary Legislators
 Yes, there was the normal opening-day camaraderie -- beaming grins, strong handshakes and lots of backslaps -- but there were visible signs of the contention to come.
 The small talk among the crowd that crammed into the Assembly chamber for Mr. Cuomo's address was about the escalating battle between Mr. Cuomo and legislative leaders over how to resolve the state's persistent budget crisis. With the end of the current fiscal year coming on March 31, the state has yet to close a budget gap of more than $875 million.
 "You see a lot of smiling faces, but the truth is that most of us are not happy to be back here because we just barely left," said Assemblyman Alexander B. Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat. "The last session was so combative that I think most of us are very, very weary of the legislative process."
 After Mr. Cuomo's speech, Mr. Seminerio said his comments were not intended to show disrespect for the Governor but to emphasize that state budget delays rest not with the rank-and-file members of the Legislature but with the Governor and the two top legislators leaders who have been at odds.
 "I do love the Governor and he's a gentleman, and I would vote for him for President, but my mother did not raise no fools," the Assemblyman said. "I'm not going to be working for nothing."
 Many legislators agreed with Mr. Seminerio. Assembly Speaker Saul Weprin, a Queens Democrat, called the Governor's plan to withhold legislators' salaries "coercion" and said that "many younger lawmakers who rely on their salaries to pay mortgages and bills simply could not afford it."
 Senator Dean G. Skelos, a Republican from Nassau County, suggested that the Governor give up the many honorariums that he receives for speeches.
 A Republican Response
 In another example of the friction among politicians at the start of the new session, State Senate Republicans for the first time issued a televised response that was broadcast on the state-run system, NY-SCAN, immediately after Mr. Cuomo's speech.
 The State Senate's majority leader, Ralph J. Marino, a Long Island Republican, attributed New York's economic problems to the "nearly two decades of Democratic control of the executive office and Assembly" in which, Mr. Marino said, "taxes, spending, fiscal mismanagement and regulatory control" spiraled out of control.
 John E. McArdle, a spokesman for Mr. Marino, said the majority leader made a "special effort" to obtain television time for the response because "he sharply disagrees with the Governor over how to resolve this fiscal situation."
 A Child's View
 Following tradition, many legislators brought their families to the Assembly chamber to hear the Governor's address.
 Six-year-old Terrance Grannis, the Assemblyman's son, said that he usually finds the speech "pretty boring" but that this year's was exciting because of the "strong man who yelled at the Governor."

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN;
BUSH REACHES PACT WITH JAPAN, BUT AUTO MAKERS DENOUNCE IT

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Jan. 10

 BODY:
President Bush left for home today with a Japanese agreement to buy more American cars and $10 billion more in auto parts, but the car makers he brought with him denounced the Japanese pledges as woefully inadequate.
Even Bush Administration officials were saying the arrangements, worked out in the long and often bitter negotiations, fell far short of meeting the goals set by the White House for improving American exports to Japan and thus creating more jobs in the United States. 
 The Presidential party nonetheless contended that the talks were useful in drawing more attention to the continuing dispute over the trade in autos between the United States and Japan.
 
$19 Billion in Auto Parts
 Mr. Bush announced on Thursday the Japanese pledges to buy more American cars and $10 billion more in auto parts yearly by 1995, from $9 billion now to $19 billion in three years.
The results on the auto issues -- the core of American anger over Japan's trading system -- symbolized an economic summit meeting that appeared to throw cold water on Mr. Bush's election-year promises of new export markets and new jobs, and left his reputation for strength and vitality sapped by a dramatic physical collapse.
Administration officials sought in their subsequent briefings to portray the Japanese pledges in a sympathetic light, but the Big Three auto executives, who accompanied Mr. Bush here as part of a delegation of 18 business leaders, were quick to denigrate it, often in quite strong terms.
 
'There Is No Agreement'
 "There is no agreement," said Harold Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company.
He said the Japanese were unwilling to commit to a schedule to lower their $50 billion trade surplus with the United States, three-quarters of which comes from automobile trade. "The proposals on the table as far as the auto industry is concerned are inadequate."
Mr. Bush appeared slightly weary on Thursday, a day after he fainted and vomited at a private dinner held in his honor by Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa. But he attended a state dinner on Thursday night, and insisted at a news conference that afternoon that he was fit.
 
A Superpower Summit
 The state dinner was the final event of a frenetic meeting of economic superpowers that bore earmarks of the vanished Moscow-Washington summits: tense all-night negotiations, carefully barbed remarks at news conferences, artery-clogging doses of diplomatic pomp and proclamations of success.
At the joint news conference on Thursday, the President called his trip to Japan "highly productive" and praised the 18 business leaders who accompanied him.
The heads of Detroit's Big Three automakers have long been vocal critics of Japan's trade practices. Many Japanese reacted angrily to their inclusion on a formal state visit by an American President.
Mr. Bush said, "I believe the U.S. Government and our business leaders have sent a strong message about the importance of fair access to markets." Japan's decisions to sign agreements and "action plans" that would open markets to American goods and services "make it clear that the message has been received," he said.
But other officials were not so sanguine. "The jury is still out," one Administration official said Thursday of the White House verdict on the Japanese summit.
The President's meetings with Mr. Miyazawa produced a stack of real and tentative agreements on trade and security issues.
 
Increase U.S. Share Seen
 They included specific proposals to increase American shares of Japanese markets for products and services like paper, Government-bought computers, glass, construction and legal assistance. The sides also agreed that Japan would take steps to remove hidden trade barriers, like the arcane safety and testing standards for autos, that raise the price of foreign cars being sold in the Japanese market.
Japan also agreed to change tax codes to make foreign investment less expensive and to expand a program that offers low-interest loans to companies seeking to enter or expand business here.
In some cases, however, what aides to Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa called "action plans" were closer to expressions of hope. A plan to expand the foreign presence in Japan's $65 billion-a-year paper industry, for instance, turned out on closer inspection to be a commitment by Japan to study the issue and a promise to "substantially expand" opportunities for foreign papermakers by the end of March.
Similarly, Japan agreed to "initiate measures with the goal of expanding" the business of foreign computer makers in selling their machines to Japanese Government agencies. That $3 billion-a-year market has been difficult for American computer makers to crack, but it is tiny compared with the $16 billion non-Government market, where foreign concerns already reap $4 of every $10 in sales.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa also released a largely symbolic document, called the Tokyo Declaration, that recognized Japan's growing global influence and pledged to harmonize Japanese and American policies on many world issues.
 
Focus on Auto Issues
 Of them all, however, the so-called action plans to promote Japanese purchases of American cars and auto parts were easily the most watched results of the summit and of Mr. Bush's 12-day Pacific journey.
In the weeks before, Mr. Bush billed the trip as a crusade to open Asian markets to American exports, thus creating new jobs that would help lift the economy out of recession. In Japan, where American trade deficits are concentrated, three-quarters of the imbalance is concentrated in auto-related products.
Along with the pledge by Japanese auto companies to increase the amount of American-made components that they buy for their factories $19 billion by 1995, Japanese car plants in the United States would increase the percentage of American parts in their cars to 70 percent, up from a current average of 50 percent
 
To Promote U.S. Cars
 Japan's Government also agreed to promote the sale of American cars at home, allowing existing car dealers to add American models to their product lines and staging more foreign auto shows in Tokyo and other Japanese cities. Japanese companies said they would try to sell as many as 20,000 American cars in a year, which would be in addition to the more than 16,000 American models sold now through American franchise dealers. That total of 36,000 cars would be about seven-tenths of one percent of the 5.1 million cars sold annually in Japan.
The President's negotiators sought to depict the accords on automobiles as a promising step toward opening Japan's huge markets to foreign companies of all stripes.
But the trade concessions that Japan offered appeared too meager and uncertain either to affect the economy much or to ease tensions caused by Japan's $41 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, its largest mercantile partner.
 
No Goal on More Imports
 Japan set no goal for increasing imports of American cars beyond a general pledge to seek new buyers for Detroit's products, and some makers suggested that American cars would be a tough sell in their country's quality-conscious market.
Tokyo's commitment to buy $19 billion in auto parts annually was but a fraction higher than an existing commitment to raise their purchases to about $18 billion a year.
American negotiators, who contend that American parts are well-made but unfairly excluded by the Japanese, had been demanding much larger increases in the purchases of American-made parts.
"We had a view of what we could reasonably ask for," said a senior Administration official, who insisted on anonymity. "I think they have taken a good step in that direction. If I assumed this were the end of it, then I might walk away disappointed."
In that arena and some others as well, Administration negotiators repeatedly acknowledged late Thursday, Japanese pledges of improvements in trade balances were either below White House expectations or were too murky and tentative to be readily measured.
On the one initiative that Mr. Bush had underscored daily on his Pacific tour -- the need for Washington and Japan to adopt a united front at crucial free-trade talks in Geneva -- a senior Administration official in Tokyo said simply, "We're not there yet."
Pressed to say whether or not Japan even supported Mr. Bush's call for a quick agreement to lower global trade barriers, the official twice replied, "I think you have to ask the Japanese Government that question."
Earlier, Mr. Bush maintained that Mr. Miyazawa had committed his nation to working with Washington on the talks, which are mired in an argument over free trade in farm goods.
Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa also declared late Thursday that their nations had established a "global partnership" aimed at harmonizing their policies to promote world economic growth, protect the environment and secure world peace.
The so-called Tokyo Declaration reaffirmed their commitment to an array of programs already conducted by the two nations, from counter-terrorism work to American and Japanese versions of the Peace Corps.
It also proposed establishing several new programs to improve the global quality of life, including a new joint commission on aging and further efforts to guard against the spread of nuclear arms and long-range missiles.
 
He Discusses His Illness
 In his news conference, the President offered new details of his illness on Wednesday, saying his doctors had "totally ruled out" any disorders other than the flu as a factor in his fainting and vomiting spell on Wednesday.
Tests that included an electrocardiogram and blood-pressure reading showed no abnormalities, he said.
Mr. Bush, who is 67 years old, brushed aside suggestions that the collapse, his second public medical emergency in eight months, might raise his age and condition as issues in the 1992 Presidential race.
"Do you think only old people get the flu?" he said to loud laughter, adding, "I think Democrats get the flu from time to time."
The White House said late Wednesday that Mr. Bush planned to return to a full schedule on Thursday morning after a full night's rest. But those plans were quietly dropped the next morning, when he continued to feel slightly ill, and Mr. Bush did not resume his full round of activities until Thursday afternoon.
He canceled a Thursday afternoon helicopter trip to an Eastman Kodak Corporation research center and morning meetings with business leaders, as well as a Friday morning call on American Embassy employees in Tokyo.
The White House also scrapped plans for the President to visit the Commerce Department and make a speech shortly after his return to Washington today. The events would have followed a nonstop 12 1/2-hour flight from Tokyo to Andrews Air Force Base outside the capital.
"It's not a big deal," an official traveling with Mr. Bush said of the cancellations. "It's been a long trip, and it'll be a long flight back. We thought it would be better if he got some rest when he gets home."

HEADLINE: Yelstin, in Rebuff to Ukraine, Lays Claim to Black Sea Fleet

BYLINE: By CELESTINE BOHLEN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 9

 BODY:
In the latest twist in the dispute over the future of the Soviet military, President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia flatly declared today that the Black Sea fleet belongs to Russia, not Ukraine. Disposition of the fleet is a crucial issue because it is one of the most valuable assets of the disintegrating Soviet military.
Mr. Yeltsin's assertion underscores Russian sensitivity about the legendary fleet, which was the core of the Russian Imperial Navy beginning in the 18th century, and about its home port, Sevastopol, a historically Russian city that was besieged by the Turks and their allies in the Crimean War in the 19th century. The Crimea was made part of the Ukrainian republic less than 40 years ago. 
 Only on Wednesday, the Russian President told another audience that "the Black Sea fleet cannot belong to any one republic" because it was the "indivisible" property of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the loose grouping that has replaced the old Soviet Union.
 
An Emphatic Claim
 "It has to be subordinate to the joint command," Mr. Yeltsin said in Saratov, a Russian city on the Volga River.
But today Mr. Yeltsin was emphatic about Russia's historical claim. "The Black Sea fleet was, is and will be Russia's," he told a gathering of workers at an airplane factory in the Russian town of Ulyanovsk, Lenin's birthplace, where he was greeted with applause.
Tass reported that Mr. Yeltsin had sent a message to Admiral Vladimir N. Chernavin, commander of the former Soviet Navy, saying that the fleet's commanders were under the protection of the Russian President and urging them not to swear allegiance to Ukraine.
 
Agreement, and Dispute
 On Dec. 30, the members of the new commonwealth agreed in Minsk that the strategic forces of the former Soviet Union would come under the joint commonwealth command. But the Ukrainian President, Leonid M. Kravchuk, has since argued that the agreement does not cover the Black Sea fleet because its vessels do not carry strategic nuclear weapons, and has demanded that members of the fleet swear loyalty to Ukraine.
In a suggestion that he may be backing off from an immediate confrontation, Mr. Kravchuk told a group of American Congressmen today in Kiev that Ukraine would take control of the fleet by July 1, the deadline set by the republic for removal of all strategic weapons on its territory, Tass said.
Mr. Kravchuk had set Jan. 20 as the deadline for officers and soldiers serving in a future Ukrainian military, including Black Sea sailors, to take an oath of loyalty to the Ukrainian people.
Russian officials argue that such an oath runs counter to the spirit of the commonwealth, which wants units of the former Soviet military to profess dual loyalty to the organization as a whole and to the republics in which they serve.
With 3 carriers, 6 missile cruisers, about 30 submarines, 235 combat planes and helicopters and scores of support and supply ships, the Black Sea fleet is a crucial component of the former Soviet Navy.
 
A Counter to U.S. Fleet
 Although none of the fleet's submarines are armed with long-range nuclear missiles, Russian and military officials argue that the fleet is strategic by virtue of its position near the straits linking the Black Sea to the Mediterranean. Soviet naval forces have operated continuously in the Mediterranean since the mid-1960's to counter the United States Sixth Fleet.
In an interview published today in the newspaper Sovetskaya Rossiya, Admiral Chernavin criticized the Ukrainian leadership for its "hasty attempts" to lay claim to the Black Sea fleet and warned that the move would only bring "chaos, strife and destabilization." Politicians, he said, should beware of "playing jokes with the army."
Continuing his barnstorming in the city of Nizhny Novgorod, formerly Gorky, Mr. Yeltsin said today that Russia would be the last of the republics to create its own army, and then only if it was forced to.
"We do not want to be provocateurs," he said, "That is why we shall be as patient as we can."
 
Incompatible Claims
 But the arguments over oaths and the status of the fleet have exposed a fundamental crack in the accord on a new commonwealth reached by 11 former Soviet republics. As Russia advances its claim to be the inheritor state of the former Soviet Union, Ukraine is trying to assert equal rights. As one political commentator said recently, the two claims are not only incompatible but unrealistic, and must somehow be resolved for the new commonwealth to survive.
On a two-day tour of several Russian cities, Mr. Yeltsin has addressed the most painful issues now confronting Russia, starting with the removal of most state controls on consumer prices on Jan. 2.
The lifting of controls, which more than tripled the prices of basic foods like bread and milk, has brought wide dismay, particularly among old people and others on fixed incomes. Even before price liberalization, such citizens were having a hard time surviving in the shaky Russian economy.
Mr. Yeltsin has said repeatedly that he expects his own popularity to suffer from the economic shock therapy. He told the crowd in Saratov that it would take another six to eight months for the economy to pick up.
 
Facing Angry Crowds
 By going to cities like Ulyanovsk and Saratov, which have large military industries likely to be hit hard by unemployment, Mr. Yeltsin showed once again he is not hesitant to face hostile audiences. When angry shoppers swirled around him at one stop, he said: "What do you want? To chop me up in pieces and put me on the shelves?"
In Saratov, capital of the former German autonomous region that was dissolved by Stalin after Germany invaded the Soviet Union in 1941, Mr. Yeltsin tackled the painful question of re-establishing a German autonomous republic. Such a move is sought by local ethnic Germans and by the German Government, which wants to stem the flow of German emigrants.
Mr. Yeltsin said Wednesday that he would agree to a new autonomous republic, but only in an area where ethnic Germans made up more than 90 percent of the population and there was "free" land -- for instance, land used as a military testing ground in the Volgograd region, or other land near Saratov.
"Am I crazy to create another state on Russian territory?" he asked local Russians who were protesting Bonn's promises to help in the creation of a new German autonomous region.

HEADLINE: Fed by More Than Slump, Welfare Caseload Soars

BYLINE: By JASON DePARLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
After showing little growth for almost two decades, the nation's welfare rolls now surge to record levels with each passing month.
The initial hope was that the increase in the number of welfare recipients was merely a byproduct of the recession that would disappear when the economy improved. But analysts increasingly suspect that other factors, more enduring than the current economic slump, are adding to the sharp increase. 
 Many now say the nation may witness substantially more cases for the foreseeable future, a trend almost certain to provoke strong cultural and political reactions.
"A lot of people in the beginning were saying it's just due to the economy," said Jo Anne B. Barnhart, the assistant secretary for children and families in the Department of Health and Human Services who oversees the nation's welfare programs. "But this is a very different situation."
Virtually everyone agrees the sagging economy is a main cause of the welfare surge that began two years ago. But other factors also cited by many analysts include increases in the number of households headed by women, changes in the rules governing welfare programs, increased efforts by social workers to expand the Medicaid program and even the amnesty program for illegal immigrants, which has made some of them eligible to receive welfare.
Where experts disagree, often sharply, is over how much weight to give the various factors, and how much the trend can be expected to reverse with an economic recovery.
 
A National Index
 Welfare cases offer an index of national misery, but they are important for other reasons as well. While welfare payments account for only 3.4 percent of an average state's budget, the rise in cases does place financial pressure on state governments desperately seeking to cut deficits.
Welfare has figured prominently in recent elections of governors in Louisiana and Mississippi, as have other problems associated with long-term poverty, including crime, the breakdown of families and frequent failures in school.
The last large welfare increase ended in 1973 after cases tripled in seven years, and politicians have been pointing fingers and apportioning blame ever since.
Understanding a rise in cases is seldom as easy as it seems, since there is a swirl of factors constantly at work, from regional economics to sexual mores, and they often push the numbers in different directions at the same time. Demographics, economics, cultural values and the eligibility rules, which vary in every state, all play a role.
 
Rise Is Steep and Fast
 Those pessimistic about the future note that the number of families receiving welfare has increased more in the last 2 years than it did in the previous 16. And recent studies have found the welfare rolls rising much faster now than in previous recessions. Studies of past recessions have shown that welfare cases decline when the economy recovers, but not to the pre-recession levels.
The number of families receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children, which provides cash benefits to needy families, grew by almost half a million a year in the early 1970's, before leveling off in 1973 at about 3.1 million. Over the next 16 years, the rolls grew by only 600,000 families, to 3.7 million in July 1989.
Then the figures rocketed. By October 1991, the last count available, 4.6 million families were receiving welfare, an increase of 24 percent in a little more than two years. The October figures showed an increase of 57,000 families from September and was the 27th month in which a record was set. While 10.9 million Americans lived in families receiving assistance in 1989, by October that figure had risen to 13.2 million.
A small part of the increase can be explained by a law requiring every state to provide welfare to some two-parent families by the end of 1990. Such programs were previously offered only in some states, and since July 1989 the number of families receiving welfare under that program has risen to 297,000 from 184,000.
 
Trend in All Sections
 A study by the American Public Welfare Association, a professional group in Washington representing social workers and state welfare departments, found cases increasing in all areas of the country, led by a rise of 72 percent in New Hampshire, 41 percent in Arizona, 39 percent in North Carolina, and 37 percent in Kentucky, Florida, and Connecticut. Those figures covered the period from July 1989 to April 1991.
As cases have risen, so have costs. Total spending on the Aid for Families with Dependent Children program, which includes both benefits and administrative expenses and is shared by the state and Federal governments, rose to an estimated $23.1 billion in 1991, from $19.6 billion in 1989. Those costs were offset in small part by collections of delinquent child support payments from parents, which rose to an estimated $1.6 billion in 1991 from $1.3 billion in 1989. The estimates come from the Federal human services department.
These rises reversed what had been a long-term decrease in the welfare program's actual cost when adjusted for inflation. Using constant 1990 dollars and including the offsetting child support collections, the total cost of welfare benefits dropped to $16.7 billion in 1989, from $20.7 billion in 1973. That is mostly because inflation has eroded the average welfare benefit by about 42 percent over the past two decades.
The growth of cases is only one of many measures of the nation's reliance on welfare. A calculation by a staff economist for the House Ways and Means Committee estimated that the percentage of all Americans who receive welfare was 5.1 percent in October, down slightly from the 1975 record of 5.2 percent. Analysts say this is probably because children, who are eligible for the program, make up a smaller proportion of the population.
 
More Children in Poverty
 On the other hand, the estimated percentage of American children who receive welfare had risen to a record level of 13.5 percent, after previously peaking in 1976 at 11.9 percent. This reflects the increasing number of children in poverty.
While some might regard the current rise in cases as evidence that the country is taking care of its needy, most advocates for the poor argue the opposite: that the safety net has eroded. They note that the percentage of children living below the Federal poverty line who receive welfare is now estimated to be about 65 percent, down from its 1973 high of 81 percent.
Not everyone thinks the current case levels are likely to endure.
"If we have strong economic growth in the 1990's, there's no reason why caseloads might not go down even lower than they've been," said June O'Neill, an economist at Baruch College.
 
Rolls May Just Be Cut
 Noting that several states have proposed or enacted welfare cuts, Ms. O'Neill cited another way that cases might decline: states may simply remove people from the rolls.
Those who expect sharp declines in the future also emphasize that the current rise is being exaggerated by program changes in the 1980's that made it harder for working families to receive welfare. In the past, more of those families would have been on welfare before the recession; now they appear on the rolls only when an economic slump throws them from work.
"Presumably they'll be the folks who'll be rehired when the economy picks up," said Richard A. Ferreira, a policy associate at the public welfare association.
Some officials also say new education and training programs will work to reduce cases. Those programs were passed as part of the 1988 Family Support Act but have been implemented only in the past year.
But at least one analyst contends the opposite: that the new benefits provided under the law may be attracting people onto the rolls and keeping them there longer. In 1988, Charles Murray, now a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote an article in The Wall Street Journal predicting the law would cause cases to increase by making the system more attractive.
 
'I Hit the Jackpot'
 "It's the only specific prediction I've ever made in my life, and by God, I hit the jackpot," Mr. Murray said this week in an interview, adding that he expected the higher levels to endure.
Others who are pessimistic about the future argue that the recession has lifted a veil that kept demographic trends from showing up in cases. They say the trends, which have been building for a decade, will continue to increase cases.
In the past decade, the number of households headed by women has continued to rise, as has the percentage of households headed by women who have never been married. Studies show families headed women who have never been married are particularly likely to receive welfare.
In 1980, there were 6.2 million families headed by single women, making up 19.4 percent of all families with children. By 1990, according to Census Bureau figures, the number had risen to 8.4 million families, representing 24.2 percent of the total. In 1980, 17 percent of households headed by women were led by women who had never been married; by 1990 the proportion had risen to 33 percent.
Analysts say those trends were obscured by the economic growth of the 1980's and by restrictions in welfare eligibilty, including those that dropped 300,000 families from the rolls in 1981.
"This leaves many people more vulnerable than they were before," said Robert Reischauer, director of the Congressional Budget Office, which has done the most elaborate analysis of caseload growth.
The budget office report lists other reasons that may also be contributing to the rise in cases. These include changes making unemployment insurance harder to collect, leaving families increasingly reliant on welfare instead.

HEADLINE: Poll Shows Price Bush Pays For Tough Economic Times

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER

 BODY:
Eight of 10 Americans say the economy is in bad shape, and President Bush is paying a clear political price for their discontent, according to the latest New York Times/CBS News Poll. But voters know little about the Democrats who would challenge him.
The telephone survey, conducted Monday through Wednesday, shows an unpredictable terrain at the start of this election year: The President's approval rating is down to 48 percent, and voters are evenly divided when offered a choice between re-electing Mr. Bush or replacing him with a unspecified Democrat. But the real Democratic field has barely penetrated their consciousness, according to the telephone survey of 1,376 adults. 
 Still, the poll reflects the recession's toll on Mr. Bush. Only 18 percent said Mr. Bush cared "a great deal" about the needs and problems of people like themselves, down from 28 percent last March. Thirty-five percent said they thought Mr. Bush did not care much about them, according to the poll, which has a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points.
 
Skepticism Over Asian Trip
 Mindful of the dangers of seeming insensitive in a recession, the White House promoted Mr. Bush's Asian trip as an attempt to produce jobs. But even before Mr. Bush left Japan yesterday with trade pledges denounced by American car makers as woefully inadequate, the public was skeptical:Fewer than a third of those surveyed said they thought Mr. Bush's recent meetings with Asian leaders would increase employment in the United States; 53 percent said they thought the trip was "mainly for show."
About two-thirds, 67 percent, said that Mr. Bush was spending too much time on foreign policy and not enough on domestic affairs. That was up from the 58 percent who said that last October, and the 36 percent who expressed that view the previous year.
Mr. Bush's overall approval rating dropped below 50 percent for the first time in The New York Times/CBS News Poll, a matter of some symbolic note. But at 48 percent it was statistically indistinguishable from the 51 percent registered in November. Moreover, Presidents with similar approval ratings have won re-election.
President Ronald Reagan's approval rating dipped to 41 percent in his first term, and he went on to win 49 states against former Vice President Walter F. Mondale, the Democratic nominee. Still, Mr. Reagan's popularity had stabilized in the mid-50 percent range as he entered his re-election year.
William J. Feltus, deputy campaign manager for communications for the Bush organization, said: "On economic measures, this poll is not appreciably different from others we've seen. And until the Democrat is better known, polls are not going to tell you much about what's going to happen in November."
Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker, acknowledged that the Democratic candidates were still little known, but added: "A year ago, people were saying it doesn't matter what the Democrats do because Bush is invincible. We're not having that conversation anymore."
The poll indicates that the economy is at the heart of Mr. Bush's problems, and underscores the political challenge facing him as he seeks to allay concerns in his State of the Union Message and beyond. Eighty-one percent now say the economy is either "very" or "fairly" bad, up from 74 percent who took that view in November. Nothing came close to the economy when people were asked to cite the most important problem facing the country.
Moreover, Mr. Bush is clearly being held accountable for the current state of affairs: Only 23 percent said they approved of the way he handled the economy, a level last recorded in the Administration of President Jimmy Carter. Fifty-two percent said the recession was something that a President "can do a lot" about.
 
Attitudes Reflect Anxiety
 Economic anxiety is directly linked to current attitudes toward the election: 41 percent of registered voters said that if the election were held today, they would probably vote for Mr. Bush, while 38 percent said they would probably vote for an unspecified Democrat. Those who said the economy was bad were more than twice as likely to prefer the Democratic candidate as were those who said the economy was good.
Still, the election is 11 months off, and these attitudes could change dramatically by then. Moreover, as Republican strategists note, poll takers are now offering people a choice between Mr. Bush and an idealized Democrat. The real Democratic candidates are still struggling to introduce themselves.
Only Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas and former Gov. Edmund G. Brown Jr. of California had support in the double-digits among likely Democratic primary voters nationwide. And while Mr. Brown is the best known Democrat in the field, his critics outnumber his admirers by almost two-to-one in his own party.
 
Gains by Clinton
 Mr. Clinton has clearly made some strides in the past few months: 14 percent of the self-described Democratic primary voters now say they would prefer him as the Democratic nominee, up from 6 percent in November. Mr. Brown was preferred by 13 percent; Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska by 7 percent, Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa by 3 percent and former Senator Paul E. Tsongas by 2 percent. Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia, who dropped out of the race Wednesday night, was the choice of 6 percent.
When all the respondents who said they were registered to vote -- Democrats, Republicans and independents -- were asked their views of the Democratic candidates, the cloudy image of the current field emerges. In the case of every candidate, the vast majority of the respondents said they were either undecided or did not know enough to have an opinion.
More than two-thirds of the respondents were interviewed before Mr. Bush's collapse from a stomach ailment in Japan, but those polled afterwards expressed views that were statistically indistinguishable from the earlier sample.
Those interviewed Wednesday night were asked whether they worried about whether Mr. Bush was healthy enough to serve effectively for a second term: Only 25 percent said they did feel that anxiety.
 
Worrying About Quayle
 Two-thirds of those interviewed Wednesday, however, said they would worry about whether Vice President Dan Quayle would be up to the job of President; this was about the same percentage who voiced those concerns soon after Mr. Bush's thyroid problem last May.
The latest poll indicates Mr. Bush remains the overwhelming favorite of Republicans nationally for renomination: 78 percent said they preferred Mr. Bush, 12 percent favored Patrick J. Buchanan, the conservative commentator, and 3 percent backed David Duke, the former Ku Klux Klan leader and unsuccessful gubernatorial candidate in Louisiana.
The margin of sampling error for smaller subgroups in the poll was larger than the 3 percentage points for the overall poll. For example, it was plus or minus five percentage points for either the Democratic primary voters or the Republican primary voters.

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN;
A Trade Mission Ends in Tension As the 'Big Eight' of Autos Meet

BYLINE: By DAVID E. SANGER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 9

 BODY:
President Bush's hopes of returning home with what he called an "action plan" to help Detroit began to unwind late this afternoon, in one of the most unlikely business meetings in the history of Japanese-American industrial rivalries.
The chief executives of the world's eight largest auto makers -- three American, five Japanese -- gathered face to face in a hotel room in downtown Tokyo, with everyone in the room clearly understanding, and no one saying, that the American industry will probably never gain back the ground it has lost to Japanese imports and to Japanese cars made in American plants.
 
A Tense Hour
 It was apparently the first time executives of General Motors, Ford and Chrysler met directly with their counterparts at Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, and Mazda, which together now control more than a third of the American auto market. After a tense hour, during which the Japanese told their guests that American industry needed to transform itself radically, and the Americans warned that the time was long past when "mere declarations of intent" to open markets would suffice, Lee A. Iacocca, the fiery head of the ailing Chrysler Corporation, finally spoke up. 
 "He said he wasn't satisfied with the figures," Yutaka Kume, the president of the Nissan Motor Company, recalled a few hours later, referring to Japan's plan to double the amount of American-made auto parts that it buys every year and to sell roughly 20,000 American-made cars each year in Japan.
Congress is just a step away from enacting limits on the import and production of Japanese cars in the United States, Mr. Iacocca warned, "and he was not certain he could convince fellow Americans" that that was a bad idea, Mr. Kume said.
Mr. Iacocca left the meeting visibly angry, and immediately flew back to Detroit, the city that has come to symbolize better than any other the enormous transfer of wealth that has taken place in the last decade between the American Midwest and Tokyo.
"Of course you have to remember," said Robert C. Stempel, the chairman of General Motors, trying to put the whole session into perspective a few hours later, "that Lee is always a little hot under the collar."
But the bottom line was that the plan, which Mr. Bush described only a few hours before as a "significant but interim step" in solving the worsening economic relations between the two countries, had already been shot down -- by the executives Mr. Bush brought along on his trip.
"There is no agreement," Harold Poling, the chairman of the Ford Motor Company, said soon after he emerged from the meeting. The Japanese, he said, were willing to talk but unwilling to commit themselves to a schedule to lower their $50 billion trade surplus with the United States, three-quarters of which comes from automobile trade. "The proposals on the table as far as the auto industry is concerned are inadequate," he said.
The confrontation today at the Hotel Okura, for two decades the site of the trade talks that have left both sides increasingly exasperated, seemed to underscore the problem dogging Mr. Bush throughout his trip: Solving the fundamental difficulties on both the American and Japanese sides -- insufficient American investment in Japan, exclusive-sourcing arrangements among Japanese suppliers -- has only the most indirect effect in meeting Mr. Bush's goal of creating "jobs, jobs, jobs" in America.
"We can always buy more parts," a senior Nissan official said. "But that does not address the basic problem of how American cars can compete against Japanese cars, or American parts against Japanese parts." And until those problems are solved, he said, American industry "will not truly recover."
 
An Outspoken Approach
 If Mr. Bush's trip did bring about one big change, however, it is this: Japan seems far less shy than it did even a few months ago about telling America exactly what it thinks is wrong with America. In no sector is that clearer than in autos, an area where the Japanese think they have gained the right to do a little lecturing.
Soon after the meeting among the Big Eight broke up, the leaders of the Japanese companies said they thought the Americans had failed to learn some vital lessons about competitiveness that should have been obvious in the 1980's. And as a result, they said, the goals announced by President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa this afternoon could be met only if Detroit fundamentally changed its ways and learned how to suit Japanese tastes.
"We cannot lower the quality of our cars," said Nobuhiko Kawamoto, the president of the Honda Motor Company. "So to achieve the goals in the plan, we need to request the cooperation of American producers."
Throughout the trip, the American auto executives have complained that the Japanese have tended to treat them like sidewalk beggars, doling out commitments to buy American goods out of some sense of public duty and political self-interest rather than any conviction that Japan needs to buy what America is selling.
 
Concessions Rejected
 "We are not here asking for concessions," Mr. Poling said today. "We don't feel we've been defeated, and we didn't ask for any concessions."
It was Prime Minister Miyazawa himself who first used the word "defeated" the other day, talking about what happened when Detroit met Tokyo, and what kind of shock the United States was facing at the prospect of General Motors' eliminating 70,000 jobs. But today Mr. Kume, who heads Japan's leading organization of automobile manufacturers, said he did not regard American industry as a charity case. "We are not as arrogant as that," he said.
If Mr. Bush had hoped to alleviate some of these tensions, the hodge-podge accord announced today did not seem to do the trick. American executives said it was "the start of a process," and expressed a willingness to meet with their Japanese counterparts regularly.
Despite the flare-ups, Mr. Bush's traveling companions said the trip was a success -- though not because of any concessions wrung from Japan. "For the first time business and Government in the United States are joining together on a serious national problem," Mr. Poling said tonight. "The message has been transmitted to Japan that it must open its markets in the strongest language possible. From the standpoint of the Administration, it was a success."
Mr. Bush's aides, trying to put the best face on the President's accomplishments, pointed to more concrete agreements on specific trade issues, like the sale of computers, glass and paper. His presence also allowed breakthroughs on other nettlesome problems that have bothered American business here for more than a decade, including a cumbersome system of certifying and inspecting foreign cars.
But the most contentious issue, and the one the Bush Administration least wanted to discuss in detail tonight, involved automobile trade. Since long before the trip, Mr. Bush's aides have found themselves in an ideologically uncomfortable position. They are philosophically opposed to "managed trade" -- the setting of quantifiable goals and market shares for each nation's industries. But they also realize that, as recent experience shows, that is the only way to deal with Japan. The most successful trade agreement with Japan yet, the semiconductor accord that was renewed last year, clearly states that American companies are expected to hold at least 20 percent of the Japanese market.
"We knew we had to pattern this agreement after the semiconductor agreement," said an official in the Commerce Department. "But we could not appear to be agreeing to specific numbers."
The Japanese know that, too, and, eager to make Mr. Bush's trip a success, the Government here spent the last few weeks cajoling and arm-twisting to force Japanese auto makers to once again revise plans to increase their imports.
Because the announcements came from the companies, not the Government, the United States was able to argue that such "unilateral" proposals from Japanese companies did not amount to managed trade.
"In no way does it constitute an agreement," said a senior Administration official who briefed reporters this evening, even though President Bush had referred to "the agreements" on autos just hours before.
Whatever they are, the "action plans" adopted by Japan and the United States have a number of provisions and loopholes that may provide the grist for new tensions in months ahead.
For example, American companies hoping to take advantage of Japan's new commitment to import American parts may have to build factories or warehouses in Japan at a time when parts plants are being closed in the United States. Recognizing that few companies will be willing to make that investment, the Japanese said that nearly 80 percent of the parts they buy will be from their "transplant" factories in the United States.
 
Already in the Works
 Over the next two to three years the Japanese are planning to open new manufacturing lines that will increase their output at transplants by roughly 50 percent. That means that even without today's offer Japan's purchases of American parts seemed bound to rise. It is hard to measure whether Japan's commitment to purchase $10 billion more in American parts in 1995 will create new jobs or merely save some positions at American companies that might otherwise be forced into layoffs.
"It is something positive," said John P. Reilly, the president of Tenneco Automotive, who represented parts makers on Mr. Bush's trip, "but probably not enough."
Mr. Bush did little to change the basic attitudes of either side. The American auto executives left Japan convinced that it was still a closed society, barring foreign goods at the gate, offering tokens instead of real trade opportunities. The Japanese saw them off, convinced that the Big Three still don't get it. "We haven't done anything wrong," Mr. Kume said this evening, "so we don't have to rectify our conduct or deeds."

HEADLINE: In the New York Area, Businesses Are Stifled by Cash-Flow Worries

BYLINE: By SARAH BARTLETT

 BODY:
Slowly and with little fanfare, many businesses in the New York City area are being strangled by a lack of cash, raising the prospect that still more companies could succumb to bankruptcy before this recession is over.
Although it is common in the business world for people to talk about profits and the infamous "bottom line," it is cash that dictates the fortunes of many small and medium-sized businesses.
 
Ripple Effect
 Companies can die for lack of sufficient demand for their services, as many in the New York area have discovered during this lengthy and painful recession. But even those that still have a reasonable amount of business can also expire if their customers do not pay promptly and they get caught in a cash stranglehold from which they cannot escape. That appears to be the more common problem now. 
 "For many people, there's enough business to sustain the company, but cash flow is so critical that they're having to go in with their personal money or close down," said Peter D. Colahan, vice president of Colahan-Saunders, a mid-sized printing company in Manhattan. This cash squeeze has forced many companies to search for more creative ways to raise cash or stretch out what they have.
In one example, Jansen & Rogan, a Manhattan-based engineering firm, recently put its employees on a four-day week -- even though the firm still has plenty of work coming across the transom. The move saved the firm 20 percent of its salaries.
Over the last 12 months, many companies have not only suffered a sharp decline in the volume of their business, but the customers they still have left are paying their bills at a much slower rate. That means that those on the receiving end of that slowdown have little choice but to turn around and pay their own creditors and suppliers more slowly. And that is causing a cash crunch to ripple its way through the local economy.
"It's a vicious cycle," said Mr. Colahan. "You're paid slower so you pay slower."
Representatives of small-business groups said although they had not specifically surveyed their members on this issue, they believe the problem is a national one. "Somebody gets squeezed and it's typically small businesses because they don't have the clout to respond," said Kenneth Yancey, executive director of the National Business Association, which is based in Dallas.
In normal times, a company could tide matters over by borrowing from a bank. But bank loans are extremely hard to get these days, even for well-heeled companies.
The recent drop in interest rates is likely to make it easier for more companies to qualify for loans. But many businesses that might be eligible do not want to borrow because that would just make them more of a de facto banker to their customers than they already are. Instead of just "lending" money to a late-paying customer, without charging any interest, they would also be paying a financing charge for the privilege.
Joseph Crapanzano, general manager of the Arzee Mid-state Supply Corporation in East Brunswick, N.J., said he has so many customers who are more than 120 days overdue that he occasionally forgets what business he is in. "Sometimes you think you're really not in the siding business any more, you're just a bank for your customers," he said.
 
If You Lag, I Lag
 The cash crunch has left few businesses or industries in the region untouched. Choice Courier Systems in Manhattan, for instance, used to expect about 65 to 70 percent of its customers to be current on their bills. Today that figure has dropped to 45 percent. And only 7 percent of its customers used to drag out their payments past 90 days, while those laggards now constitute 10 to 11 percent of the company's accounts.
Mike Beck, Choice's vice president of finance and administration, said that in reaction to this turn of events his company has chosen to lag some of its payments, too. Choice is paying its office supply and printing bills after 60 days, instead of the usual 30 to 45. And it is making its lawyers and accountants wait 60 to 75 days for payment, instead of the 30 to 45 days it used to.
"You have to borrow from Peter to pay Paul," said Mr. Beck. It has not helped, he added, that about a dozen of the company's customers have gone bankrupt, leaving unpaid debts to Choice of $150,000. "We can't afford to take it on the chin," he said. "We don't have deep pockets."
Indeed, business executives said this is one of the most worrisome aspects of the cash crunch. Because it affects those without financial staying power, it tends to hurt small businesses the most, and they have traditionally been one of the most dynamic sectors of the New York economy. From 1982 to 1987, small businesses generated 79 percent of all private sector employment growth in New York City.
 
Savings Are Exhausted
 While many small companies had set aside funds for emergency purposes, few expected their cash needs to be so severe for so long. "They can dip into their reserves, but after a year and a half of a depression, those reserves are depleted or just not there any more," said David A. Capodiece, regional coordinator in the Northeast for the National Office Products Association.
According to those in the office-supplies industry, one company that succumbed to these kind of cash-flow problems was Milton Goldhair Associates, which had sales of an estimated $4 million to $5 million and had been in business for about half a century. In early 1991, the company, which competitors said had about 30 employees, filed for bankruptcy protection. Although industry executives said the company got caught in a cash-flow squeeze, Richard Goldhair, the son of the founder, refused to discuss the reasons why the company went out of business.
"Lots of companies have gone out of business," Mr. Capodiece said, and if things continue as they have, "you could see a lot more."
In the first seven months of 1991, Dun & Bradstreet, the business information company, recorded 703 business failures in New York City, more than double the 327 that failed in 1990 and more than 8 times the 83 that failed in 1989. It is impossible to discern from the data what proportion of these failures were caused by cash-flow crises.
 
Creative Dunning
 Of course, anyone who starts a business and survives in New York City's competitive business environment has to be enterprising to begin with. But many owners of small companies now find themselves engaged in a battle that can tax their creative energies even more than their everyday business.
Business executives have had to learn how to dun customers without alienating them so much that they decide to take their business elsewhere, yet these same executives cannot bet so heavily on the value of a client relationship that they are left holding the bag if that client goes out of business. On the other side of the ledger-book, these executives have to try to slow their payments to their own suppliers without spooking them so much that they lose a valued source of inventory.
To arm themselves against deadbeats, executives at many companies said they now generate a list of late-paying customers every one or two weeks instead of once a month. And most said they had assigned members of their staff, or even hired new employees, to spend the day calling delinquent customers and pleading for payment. Many said they had also resorted to using more collection lawyers. One such, Michael Laufer, who is based in Manhattan, says the demand for his services has risen by about a third in the last year.
Harvey J. Krauser, the president of U.S. Coffee/Breaktime Concepts, which supplies offices in the New York area with beverages and snacks from its base in Westbury, L.I., has even taken to visiting some of his customers personally. His goal is to sound them out on their problems and to remind them of their obligations.
Although his approach seems to have worked, Mr. Krauser said, "We're spending a disproportionate amount of time worrying about getting money in, and that's very hard for a small business." It leaves precious little time to go after new customers.
In some extreme cases, executives said they felt they had no choice but to play hardball. With its most unreliable clients, for instance, Choice will refuse to send a messenger to deliver another package until the latest bill has been paid first. When it reaches a point like that, many business people said they had already accepted the likelihood of losing that customer's business.
It is for exactly that reason that Michael Collado, president of the Itex Corporation, an office products company in Stamford, Conn., says he is not accepting any new customer accounts. He figures that if they are coming to him, it is because they have just been cut off by one of his competitors for not paying. "You have to be wary of new business at this time, because, chances are, it won't be good business," said Mr. Collado. He will, however, accept customers who pay by credit card or check.
Surprisingly, several business executives said that some of the worst offenders are large companies. In one case, said Mr. Krauser, it was a bank that suddenly began asking for a second copy of a bill before paying, or suggesting that they call another department. "We're getting more creative excuses," he said, "even from the bigger companies."
Mr. Krauser's son, Steven, who is the company's executive vice president, identified perhaps the only bright side to this cash squeeze. There is at least one group of customers that has shown itself to be desirable in paying on time: Bankruptcy lawyers and "work-out" groups that help companies dig themselves out from debt.

HEADLINE: Coalition Rule in Ethiopia Is Facing Growing Fears of Collapse

BYLINE: By JANE PERLEZ, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia, Jan. 6

 BODY:
Six months after winning control of this war-weary, impoverished nation, the new Ethiopian Government is struggling to keep its people together despite ethnic conflicts, a rock-bottom economy and a dispirited bureaucracy.
There is growing apprehension here in the capital that an experiment to dismantle the traditionally autocratic central government into self-governing regions based on ethnicity will result in the disintegration of the country. This danger is accentuated, Ethiopians and Western donors say, as President Meles Zenawi refuses to shed the Marxist economic ideas of his insurgency movement and pushes the peasants and urban dwellers into even deeper poverty. 
 "I can see a scenario where it goes down the tubes," a Western diplomat said. "It's not hard to imagine a Yugoslavia. But everyone wants to avoid that."
One member of the new Government said, "I can see civil war ahead."
 
U.S. Backs Coalition
 After routing the army of the Marxist Government of Lieut. Col. Mengistu Haile Mariam last May, the insurgent group based in Tigre province in the north and led by Mr. Meles formed a coalition government at a national conference in July. In contrast to its hostile relations with Colonel Mengistu, the United States blessed the Meles Government by sending five State Department officials to the conference, including the Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, Herman J. Cohen.
The main partnership in the Government is between Mr. Meles's Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front and the Oromo Liberation Front, based on the Oromo people of the southern region and the country's largest ethnic group. The Oromo of the south are largely Muslim and the Tigreans of the north are Christians of the Ethiopian Orthodox Church. And they speak different languages.
There have been increasing incidents of fighting between the armed forces of these two ethnic groups as Mr. Meles's forces move into the south as a national army and clash with a rising tide of Oromo nationalism, according to reports from both sides.
In the last several days, units of both forces have clashed in the string of towns from the city of Harar in the east to Awash, about 200 miles west of Addis Ababa. In the last several months, there has also been fighting in the Oromo regions of Arusi, to the south of the capital, and in Wallaga, to the west.
 
War Hurts Farming
 The southern region is agriculturally the most fertile of this chronically food-short country, but the area is now so chaotic that farming has been severely curtailed, agricultural experts said.
In an interview, Mr. Meles, who is 37 years old, acknowledged that while the ethnic clashes were worrisome, "Things have not gone too far, yet."
"Once we have new security in place with a new police force and all armed groups inside camps, there should be no reasons for armed conflicts," he said. Mr. Meles said he was confident that the election of regional assemblies, planned for three months from now, would undercut Oromo or other ethnic secessionist sentiments.
But members of his own Government concede that it will be exceedingly difficult to hold regional elections in a poorly educated country that has never known democracy and with the ethnic tensions that prevail in the south. To keep Ethiopia together, Mr. Meles must prevent in other regions what he has agreed to in Eritrea, the northernmost province, which is already functioning as a separate entity. In mid-1993, the Eritreans are planning a United Nations referendum that will most likely confirm and legalize Eritrean independence.
Here in the Ethiopian capital, a valley of ramshackle iron-roofed houses and some dilapidated high-rises, the most obvious difference since the fall of the Colonel Mengistu is Government-sanctioned debate in coffee shops, on television and in the newspapers. After a 17-year era of Stalinesque fear, people are talking and grumbling, often on ethnic grounds. The previously dormant university is abuzz with students.
 
Rise in Banditry
 But against this backdrop of new-found expression, there is increased banditry in the city and countryside, mostly by destitute members of the demobilized, 500,000-member Mengistu army.
This insecurity will be aggravated, several Ethiopian and Western economists said, by the Government's disappointing economic plan. Announced last month, the long-awaited plan allowed for the privatizing of trading that left the rest of the already barely functioning economy, including the state farms, in the hands of the bankrupt Government.
This failure to make any serious commitment to economic reform may jeopardize much of the promised two-year package of $500 million from the World Bank, an Ethiopian economist familiar with the plan said.
Mr. Meles's case with the World Bank was not helped, Western diplomats said, since his two chief economic advisers, Kasu Ilala and Wanwossen Kebede, two loyalists from the Tigrean insurgency, appeared to be unreconstructed Marxists. Mr. Kasu's professional background is plant science and not finance, they added.

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN;
Excerpts From Bush-Miyazawa Remarks: 'Promoting Prosperity' in Pacific

 BODY:
Following are excerpts from the text of the joint declaration released yesterday by President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan, provided by The Associated Press, and excerpts from their joint news conference, provided by Reuters:
 
Cooperation to Promote World Peace and Prosperity
 The U.S.-Japan alliance provides the foundation for our global partnership. Together both nations pledge to: work together to maintain world peace and security, promote development of the world economy, support the worldwide trend toward democratization and market-oriented economies and meet new transnational challenges. To achieve these goals, the two countries will cooperate to strengthen the GATT multilateral trading system, reinvigorate the U.N. organization, advance arms control and the nonproliferation of weapons of mass destruction, assist the developing world to promote growth and stability, and protect and improve the global environment. 
. . . The United States and Japan are committed to promoting prosperity, reducing tensions, and enhancing political cooperation in the region and to take steps to strengthen the bonds of the Asia-Pacific community while respecting its diversity. . . .
Japan and the United States will also broaden the scope of their cooperation in the rest of the world, including the Middle East, Central and South America, Africa, and Europe, with particular attention to supporting countries that are in transition to democracy and market economies. The two nations will strengthen cooperation in their respective economic assistance programs in the developing world to promote growth and stability, help reduce the developmental gap between industrialized and developing countries, enhance respect for democratic values and human rights, and ameliorate global problems, including environmental degradation, refugees, illicit narcotics, disease and aging.
 
Political and Security Relations
 The U.S. and Japan reaffirm their commitments to the 1960 Treaty of Mutual Cooperation and Security which is central to the U.S.-Japan alliance. . . .
As countries with vital interests in the Asia-Pacific region, Japan and the United States recognize the continuing importance of the defense relationship to the peace and stability of this vast and diverse region. The two governments will work closely with others to reduce tensions and instability in East Asia and build regional political cooperation in the post-cold war environment.
Aware of the need for continuing vigilance as we enter a new era now marked by instability and uncertainty, the United States will maintain the forward-deployed forces necessary to preserve peace and stability in the region.
 
Economic and Trade Relations
 Aware of the high degree of interdependence of their economies and mindful of the need to encourage closer cooperation to promote conditions of sustainable real growth with price stability and employment, the two Governments are resolved to enhance openness and oppose protectionism in their commercial, financial and investment markets. To this end, Japan and the United States will strengthen policy initiatives to reduce structural impediments.
Japan and the United States further pledge to make their economies the most open, productive and competitive in the world, thereby building a sustainable trade and investment relationship. . . .
 
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS
 Q: Mr. President, people all around the world yesterday saw some very disturbing video of you collapsing in apparently very severe distress, that many of us are not accustomed to when we see people with the flu.
Can you describe what you were experiencing there, and also, can you say that your doctors have conclusively ruled out anything other than the flu, or will there be further tests?
PRESIDENT BUSH: No further tests. Totally ruled out anything other than the 24-hour flu. I've had an EKG, perfectly normal. Had blood pressure taken and probing around in all kinds of ways, and it's all going very well indeed. . . . Nothing else to it. And somebody asked me earlier, am I going to slow down my schedule?
I don't think it has anything to do with speed or slowness of a schedule. One of the businessmen who's young and aggressive and eager this morning, a young guy on this trip got it. I understand some of the journalists have had flu, and people in our country have had it, so why isn't the President entitled to 24 hours?
 . . . They've done all the checking in the world, the heart is normal, the thyroid or whatever's left of it is going fine, and I really have no hesitancy or worry at all.
 
Effect on Campaign
 Q: Are you at all concerned that now that you've had two quite sort of public health episodes that your -- some of the Democratic political opponents who are a lot younger than you might make a subtle issue out of the fact that you're somewhat older and perhaps --
PRESIDENT BUSH: Do you think only old people get the flu. . .? . . . I think Democrats get the flu from time to time. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Results of Trade Talks
 Q: Mr. President, American leaders since Nixon have been engaging in trade talks with Japan, emerging claiming great success, and nothing seems to change too much. And some of that, in a more specific sense, has been related to the American auto industry, relief from competition from Japan. And yet they continue to lose market share.
Some Americans feel it's because of bloated salaries in Detroit, because of lack of responsiveness to consumers, and the fact that, or the claim that they make cars that are not competitive. What's different in this round of trade talks and previous ones?
BUSH: . . . I think when you look at the agreements you're going to see that both sides have agreed to more in the way of auto parts, more in the way of autos coming into this country from the United States, and in a couple of other areas as well.
So I think there is some specificity to go with the hope in this case.
Q: Do you feel that the American auto industry has to do more to --
BUSH: Yes. I think we've got to do more as well, and not just in autos. In both the public and the private sector. One of the things that we haven't focused on here today is this economic growth agenda. And there the United States must do something. Japan is growing more than we are. So they should say, well, hey, how about yourselves? And we're saying we're going to submit a growth package, we're going to fight for it, we're going to try to get our interest rates down.
And we've got to do a better job in all industries, on building quality, improving competitiveness, knowledge and understanding of the Japanese market, so we can be vigorous competitors, based on more cultural understanding and background.
 
Attitudes Toward U.S.
 Q: (Inaudible) in your press conference on New Years Day you said you were thinking of America as (inaudible). My dictionary says that these were the feeling of sympathy, feeling of compassion. Why do you feel sympathy for America?
MIYAZAWA (through interpreter): Well, you use the words sympathy or compassion, and I would not claim that these are inaccurate, but what I really tried to say was that we have to understand the other person's position. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	But for various reasons, U.S. society, and I might say I believe the U.S. society is a great society, but there are homeless people, there is a problem of AIDS, and so on, and for various reasons education is not as high as in the past. And U.S. industries are not as competitive in the past for various reasons. Americans are pointing to these problems.
And since Americans themselves are aware of these problems, I am convinced they will overcome these problems. 

 	 	 		. . .	 	
 
Remarks at Pearl Harbor
 Q: (through interpreter) A question for the Prime Minister, you mentioned that we are very much touched by the President's speech at Pearl Harbor. Now bearing that in mind, I wonder how you would respond to the question asked by the President yesterday, Mr. Prime Minister.

 	 	 		. . .	 	MIYAZAWA (through interpreter): In the speech delivered by the President in Honolulu, he said he holds no rancor against Japan or Germany. These former enemies have become best friends for democracy. This is what basically he said.
There are quite a few warships that are sunk in Pearl Harbor with the dead bodies of the soldiers and with veterans in front of him. So I believe it was not easy for the President to say all those things, and that is why I was especially moved by the friendship shown by the President, the sense of trust expressed by the President.
Japan was able to grow this much thanks to the continued support and help by the United States. This again we should not forget. . . .
Now, the President in Honolulu also mentioned that we must fight against, or fight off isolationism and protectionism. And I think these words were uttered with Japan in mind. Now, in discussing economic issues this time, there was concern expressed that the entire world might fall into protectionism, and what can we do in order to prevent that.

HEADLINE: Health Care Battle Flares, Now Over a Disputed Study

BYLINE: By ROBERT PEAR, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Two members of President Bush's Cabinet held a news conference today intended to show conclusively, with a major new study, that Democratic efforts to revamp the nation's health care system would increase taxes and unemployment and saddle employers with huge new costs.
But the chief author of the study, which was performed under Government contract, accused the Secretary of Labor, Lynn Martin, and the Secretary of Health and Human Services, Louis W. Sullivan, of misrepresenting the results of her research. 
 The author, Sheila R. Zedlewski, who has worked for the last 19 years at the Urban Institute, a nonpartisan research center here, said in an interview: "We chose not to go to the press conference today because political officials of the Labor Department presented a very inaccurate, incomplete portrayal of our study and gave only one side of the story. They did not focus on the beneficial aspects of universal access to health care. Our study does not even address the effect of these proposals on jobs."
The clash reflected the way politics pervades the discussion of health care in this Presidential election year. And it provided a textbook example of how Government officials use research to support their policies and objectives.
 
'Devaestating Effect' Predicted
 Ms. Martin, a former United States Representative from Illinois with well-honed political instincts, and Dr. Sullivan, a hematologist with comparatively little political experience, acclaimed the study as proof of their contention that one set of Democratic health care proposals in particular would have "a devastating effect on workers and jobs," as the Labor Department said in a statement today.
The proposals are sponsored by such influential Democrats as George J. Mitchell of Maine, the Senate majority leader, and Dan Rostenkowski of Illinois, who heads the House Ways and Means Committee. They would require all employers to provide private health insurance for their workers or pay an additional payroll tax to help the Government provide such care.
Steven Hofman, a spokesman for Ms. Martin, and Richard P. Hinz, who supervises health policy research at the Labor Department, denied that Federal officials were misrepresenting the results of the study. Mr. Hofman said Ms. Martin was setting forth the "logical implications" of the study.
At the news conference this morning, Dr. Sullivan praised the Urban Institute as "a well-respected organization." He said its research demonstrated that the Democrats' health care proposals "would result in lost jobs, higher employer costs, higher taxes and a huge new Government-run health program."
 
Higher Cost to Taxpayers
 Ms. Martin said the study showed that the Democratic plan "will cost employers an additional $30 billion annually and will also result in a large subsidy, which will cost taxpayers $36 billion a year more than what the Federal Government now spends on health care."
In the later interview, Ms. Zedlewski did not dispute the figures cited by Ms. Martin but said the Secretary had skewed the study's findings by failing to cite the proposals' advantages as well.
The Administration attack comes just five days before nearly 200 Democratic members of the House hold town meetings across the country to hear constituents' complaints about health insurance and health care, widely seen as a politically potent issue in this year's elections.
In the language of the health care debate, the Democratic proposals are known as a "play or pay" program, because employers would have to provide insurance or pay the tax, at rates ranging from 7 to 9 percent of payroll.
Ms. Martin said: "Pay or play is misnamed. It is really pay and pay and pay and pay, by the middle class."
 
Bush's Record Criticized
 Senator Mitchell said the criticism from Ms. Martin and Dr. Sullivan today was consistent with Mr. Bush's record over the last three years. "The Administration has criticized other proposals while offering none of its own," the Senator said.
The President plans to send Congress a package of health care proposals later this month. They include incentives for people to enroll in prepaid group health plans and tax credits for the purchase of health insurance.
The Urban Institute study is an assessment of costs and benefits, including coverage of the more than 34 million Americans who now have no health insurance. The study does not endorse or oppose any specific plan.
The report said "play or pay" proposals would increase insurance costs for many employers. But it also said that under such proposals "all Americans would have access to health care on a more equal basis," and that the burden of medical expenses would be reduced for many families.
Ms. Zedlewski explained: "Many people would have lower out-of-pocket medical costs. Many employers would save money under these proposals because the payroll tax would be less than their current health insurance premiums."
The study said that if the payroll tax rate was set at 7 percent, more than half the nation's nonelderly population -- 112 million people out of 216.6 million under 65 years of age -- would be enrolled by their employers in the Government health plan. The study said that 51.7 million people now insured through employer-sponsored health plans would shift to the public plan.
Dr. Sullivan said the Democratic proposals "would constitute a fatal first step down a slippery slope toward nationalized medicine."
The study did not analyze more sweeping Democratic proposals for national health insurance financed entirely by the Federal Government. Dr. Sullivan has denounced that approach even more forcefully than he criticized the pay or play proposals.

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN: Bush's Painful Trip;
Japanese Feel the Talks Will Not Help U.S. Economy or Rapport With Tokyo

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Friday, Jan. 10

 BODY:
As President Bush's grueling trade mission in Asia ended this morning on a note of confusion and discord, perhaps the reason was that without realizing it, the participants in Japan had given birth to the first summit meeting between rival superpowers in the post-cold-war era.
All the old trappings of past confrontations between the Soviet Union and the United States were in Tokyo this week -- talks that churned past midnight, fact sheets, briefing sessions, dueling news conferences and a chorus of angry assertions and counterassertions of deception and bad faith. 
 But instead of negotiating missile silos and warheads, the disagreements focused on auto parts procurement practices and standards for dashboard warning lights.
"Arms-control negotiators always used to say that 'the devil is in the details,' " said a Japanese diplomat. "Now I know what they meant."
 
Little Gain Expected
 There was no specter of nuclear war, of course. But negotiators seemed to realize that if the huge and growing trade deficit between Japan and the United States was not brought under control, it could drive Tokyo and Washington apart, hurt their economies and damage Mr. Bush's re-election prospects.
It was too early to discern the American political effects of the Tokyo talks. But the widespread view in Japan was that the negotiators' efforts would not help the American economy or Mr. Bush's political fortunes, and indeed that they could lead to even deeper Japanese-American antagonism.
Mr. Bush's hopes for a clear signal of greater Japanese purchases of American automobiles, auto parts and other products were shattered when an accord hammered out on such purchases was criticized by Japanese and American manufacturers as having little force or meaning.
Japan, on the other hand, had hoped to transcend petty trade disputes and take note of Tokyo's leadership in aiding poor nations, refugees and the environment. But no new initiatives were announced in those areas, and trade issues were as prominent as ever and likely to become more bitter.
 
Talk of Insults
 The negative tone of Japanese commentary on the whole United States approach was scathing.
"Is there not a decent individual in the Bush Government who truly understands Japan?" a columnist, Takahiro Oda, said in the Asahi newspaper today, after listing what he said were insults to the Japanese leadership by the White House's hectoring demands for purchases of American products.
As for insults, Americans too chafed today, when Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's pledge to work on trade issues came with a distinct edge to it.
Mentioning AIDS, homelessness and declining education standards as the root of American trade problems, the Prime Minister said, "Since Americans themselves are aware of these problems, I am convinced they will overcome these problems because I believe that the United States is a great country."
 
Error of Summitry
 The scene of Mr. Bush's illness and gallant recovery the next day muted the images of hostility, especially for Mr. Miyazwa, who held the stricken President's head, comforted Mrs. Bush and encouraged her to reassure a dinner banquet frozen in fear over the spectacle Wednesday night.
Barbara Bush was such a hit with the Japanese audiences that her face was immediately spread all over the popular newspapers. The wives and widows of every recent Prime Minister were interviewed, commenting how admiring they were of her graceful and witty television performance.
But in pushing Mr. Bush and Mr. Miyazawa into the arcane matters of trade negotiations, Japan and the United States seemed to have committed a cardinal error of summitry, in that they raised the stakes and involved the principal leaders before the time was ripe for an agreement.
"Japan and the United States should not have committed themselves to negotiating these topics until the talks have reached a more advanced stage," said Yukio Okamoto, a business consultant and former Japanese diplomat. "These are really complicated matters. What I fear now is a backlash."
 
Japan's Criticism
 As his news conference, Mr. Bush seemed uncomfortable with the details of the automobile accord and turned aside all questions about it, asking that they be directed to other specialists. But he said he was convinced that the deals on automobiles would produce jobs for Americans.
For Mr. Bush the whole trip in Asia started inauspiciously early last year, when it was first scheduled and canceled because of the Persian Gulf war. Then it was scheduled for November but canceled because of the President's need to attend to domestic politics.
By the time he got to Japan, he added major new demands for the automobile industry, whose troubles are major issues in the Presidential campaign. But that set off unsparing criticism among the Japanese. Newspapers seem to delight in traditional metaphors, like calling Mr. Bush's party an ominous return of the "black ships" of Commodore Perry in the 19th century that forced Japan to open its borders to trade.
Still others have noted that the anti-American mood in Japan extends to the latest Godzilla movie, in which the famous sea monster defends Japan against marauding foreigners who want the Japanese to adopt a foreign computer standard as a means of subjugation.
 
Sympathy and Symbolism
 The mood reached a crescendo as Mr. Bush arrived but was suddenly dissipated by the sympathy that Japanese showed when the President collapsed at dinner on Wednesday night. But even there some commentators said that it was symbolic that Mr. Bush, like the United States, had run out of energy and needed help from Japan and Mr. Miyazawa.
The summit meeting showed most of all that Japan might have taken a few steps to placate American demands, but Tokyo declined to see the problem as the United States did: a question of a "level playing field" in which outsiders could have more access.
Instead of opening up its markets, Japan simply responded by pledging to purchase enough new imports to defuse anti-Japanese anger in Washington. Aside from revising some of its standardization and inspection procedures, Japan left the basic rules of free trade unchanged, particularly in the case of the auto accords. That was, in fact, a major step in carrying out what the United States has said it opposes: managed trade.
All week, Mr. Miyazawa appealed to Japanese and to Japanese auto companies to make some sacrifice for the United States out of sympathy or compassion. At a news conference at the Shinto shrine of Ise, he tried to stir sympathy for the American condition but sounded, to some Americans, very patronizing.
 
Tokyo's Coming of Age
 "We must appreciate how seriously layoffs are in America," he said. "Imagine a family where the mother has to tell her children, 'Dad no longer goes to work tomorrow.' Layoffs are the kind of thing which throws many families into despair. The President is coming to Japan against the background of such economic and social worries."
What that reflected was itself a coming of age for Japan, in that the country was being asked to respond from a position of strength to help what the Prime Minister called "a friend in need."
The main thing that Japan wanted out of this week's summit meeting was a new burst of credibility for the concept of "global partnership." But Japanese officials had to admit that there was not much new in the extensive statements about all the initiatives between Japan and the United States.

HEADLINE: NETWORKS TO SAVE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE

BYLINE: By JOHN TIERNEY

 BODY:
The three major television networks and CNN have agreed on a money-saving innovation for covering the New Hampshire Presidential primary. Starting Jan. 27, each of them will start sharing some of its videotape with the rest.
"Each of us will donate a crew each day to contribute material to the pool," said Tom Hannon, the political director of CNN. "It's an experiment we're trying for the first time in a primary, although it's not any sort of radical departure. It's the same sort of pool arrangement that we routinely use for covering hearings and other events in Washington." 
 The four news outlets, all under pressure to cut costs this campaign, agreed last week to set up the pool coverage effort through the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18. Their assignment editors will confer daily to deploy four crews, whose producers and technicians will record candidates' speeches and other public events. Videotape will be gathered daily in Manchester, N.H., and fed to the four networks and any other news organization that decides to subscribe.
 
'Just Protective Coverage'
 "The idea is to save time, money and effort by having one camera doing the body watch for everyone," said Hal Bruno, the political director for ABC News. "It's really just protective coverage. We'll still be sending in our own crew with a correspondent when we want to do a piece on a candidate."
The pooling arrangement gives pause to some news-media critics, among them Marvin Kalb, a former network correspondent who is the director of the Joan Shorenstein Barone Center on the Press, Politics and Public Policy at Harvard University.
"There's certainly a potential for this kind of cut to have an impact on the quality of coverage," he said. "It's true that a pool is just as good for routine coverage of speeches, but any arrangement that diminishes the competitive fires of the networks worries me. This is yet another illustration of the power of economics to determine campaign coverage."
Network officials acknowledge that economics are the chief motive for the pooling, but they say the change might produce some benefits beyond cost savings. In the last campaign the networks were criticized for focusing too much effort on staged events, and for televising some less-than-newsworthy eventssimply to justify the money spent covering them.
 
Fewer Crews, More Film
 "This should free up money to spend on more focused coverage of the issues and the candidates' qualifications," said Bill Wheatley, the director of political coverage at NBC News. "And it should expand our reach. Even though individual networks will have fewer crews in New Hampshire than in 1988, each of us will have more overall footage available."
The pool experiment will last until at least the day after the New Hampshire primary. The networks' political directors said they might try a similar arrangements for future primaries and for the general election campaign in the fall. They have also been discussing a proposal to have an outside organization, the Election Satellite Network, provide videotape of all the candidates' daily activities.

HEADLINE: Big Exchange Withdraws From Joint Futures Project

BYLINE: By JAMES BENNET

 BODY:
The board of the New York Mercantile Exchange has withdrawn from a plan to build a joint headquarters with four other futures exchanges, a decision that has stunted the project and may kill it.
As a result, the city is reassessing its commitment to the project, while officials for the consortium of exchanges say they plan to proceed with a smaller building on the same site in TriBeCa. 
 All the exchanges -- the Mercantile, the Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange Inc., the Commodity Exchange Inc., the New York Cotton Exchange and the New York Futures Exchange -- have indicated that they plan to stay in New York, said Carl Weisbrod, president of the New York City Economic Development Corporation.
"We're assessing how best to accomplish that," he said.
The withdrawal of the Mercantile Exchange, by far the largest of the five exchanges, has dealt a serious blow to the project.
"We wanted the exchanges in a position where we can enter the 21st century," said Martin Greenberg, chairman of the Commodity Exchange, the second-largest exchange. The Merc's decision to go it alone, he said, "reduces your competitiveness globally."
 
Changing Conditions Cited
 The new building, originally proposed as a 47-story tower, was to be built on a city-owned lot bounded by Greenwich, Warren, Murray and West Streets.
In explaining his board members' unanimous decision to abandon the project, R. Patrick Thompson, president of the Mercantile Exchange, said that both premises on which the members had originally based their support had "evaporated."
The first was that the building would serve as an "industry center," with space not only for the five exchanges but also for some of their more than 1,000 members. But tumbling rents in lower Manhattan made offices in the new building unattractive to the members.
The second premise was that consolidation of some functions, like computer tracking of trades, would save the exchanges upward of $8 million annually. But the exchanges, which have a long history of squabbling among themselves, could not agree on a new, joint system.
Planning for the center began more than a year ago, when the five exchanges announced that they were unhappy with their cramped trading floor in the World Trade Center and would relocate to northern New Jersey, taking about $160 million in tax dollars and 11,700 jobs with them.
To keep the exchanges, New York City and state promised to pay $100 million toward building the commodities center, and later came up with an additional $42 million in tax breaks and rent subsidies.
From the beginning, the commodities center was dogged by community opposition.
"The fact that the Merc has pulled out really undermines the whole idea of the project," said Nancy Page, a member of Community Board One, which has been fighting the commodities center.
The building as originally proposed was to have two trading floors. The departure of the Merc will lead to a smaller structure, with one trading floor, said David Halperin, president of the Commodity Exchange.
One possibility, city officials said, is that the Merc is bluffing.
A letter dated May 6 from the chairman of the board of directors of the Merc, Z. Lou Guttman, to the board may support that view. Mr. Guttman wrote that he favored dropping out of the project because the move might lead to the merger of the exchanges' functions "that we all want." He said that if the Merc withdrew, the city and the other exchanges "would all be scrambling to put together a merger."
Mr. Thompson said it was "highly, highly, highly unlikely" that the Merc would reverse its decision.

Uncommon Effort Aids Quayle's Common Touch

BYLINE: By ANDREW ROSENTHAL, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: LACONIA, N.H., Jan. 9

 BODY:
He ate milk and cookies by the fire. He dropped his suit coat for a green high school varsity jacket. He ate breakfast at a diner. He shook hands with what seemed like every schoolchild between Littleton and Laconia.
Just in case anyone missed the point after two days of trying to make it, he even dropped into a restaurant called The Common Man this afternoon. 
 In more than three dozen events in 13 towns, Vice President Dan Quayle has offered what might almost have been a conservative Republican's version of a populist message: He said the poor as well as the rich should be given their choice of schools and railed against both the "stupidity" of banks that made bad loans in the 1980's and what he called the timidity of bankers who now put their money in Treasury bonds instead of business loans and mortgages.
For Mr. Quayle, the common touch often seems as elusive as it is for his boss, President Bush, but Mr. Quayle tried hard for it nevertheless on Wednesday and today as he campaigned through snowy mountain country and covered-bridge small towns in New Hampshire.
Do candidates believe they can convince the voters that politicians are just like them? Probably not, but the need to attain that aura of just-plain-folksiness seems to be an unwritten law of campaigning.
Especially when you are campaigning in a state like New Hampshire, which holds the first Presidential primary every four years and expects its candidates to visit them personally. And especially when you are under fire for being too aloof in the first place from the problems of everyday Americans.
So Mr. Quayle stayed overnight at Doc Hill's house in Littleton, telling audiences the next day how he sipped milk and nibbled chocolate chip cookies by the fire. When he appeared on the NBC program "Today" this morning, there he was in the Hill kitchen, a spotless and seemingly empty cup of coffee at his elbow and the good doctor and his wife behind him at another table, eating breakfast.
Mr. Quayle ate his breakfast at the Littleton Diner and he dropped in to places during the day like the Town Hall-cum-theater-cum-basketball court in Lisbon, where the town's entire school-age population screamed and squealed for him like he was a rock star.
In Woodsville, Mr. Quayle put on a team jacket presented by the high school student body president and waved a varsity letter over his head.
And in Ashland, he posed for cameras outside The Common Man, a restaurant whose fare is more nouvelle than homespun.
The theatricality of these touches does not seem to bother Mr. Quayle or his audiences. For Steven Huntington, an unemployed builder who "out of curiosity" attended a Littleton Elks Club breakfast at which Mr. Quayle spoke this morning, the common touches are all just part of politics.
"I'm not sure it accomplishes a heck of a lot, but people at least feel they have some contact with the powers that be," Mr. Huntington said as he patted his 2-week-old daughter, Eliza, as she slept against his shoulder.
Mr. Quayle spied the child as soon as he walked into the room and walked straight over. He did not kiss her. But he put his finger into her tiny fist and then 15 minutes later mentioned her by name as he spoke of the importance of education.
Mr. Huntington, a lifelong Democrat, laughed good-naturedly. "Oh, yeah," he said. "I'm voting for him now. He's locked up my vote."
 
On Liability and Credit
 While Mr. Quayle and Mr. Bush like to say they are aware that the President bears the responsibility when things go wrong (the economy, for instance), they are zealously looking for ways to avoid taking the blame.
For months, the Republican Administration has been blaming the Democratic Congress for not passing the President's legislation. But even Bush campaign advisers have had to admit that is not the best way to approach the re-election debate, and they have been casting about for new methods of framing the "it's not our fault" argument.
Confronted by residents of a state whose construction and real estate industries are, as Mr. Quayle put it today, "in the tank," the Vice President tried blaming the banks. He acknowledged that both private irresponsibility and Government inaction had led to the savings-and-loan crisis, and that some discretion was a good thing in making loans.
But Mr. Quayle said in several campaign appearances today that the time has come for banks to resume lending to home buyers and small-business men, and he insisted there was little the Government could do to compel them in that direction.
"How are you going to regulate stupidity?" he said. "How are you going to regulate mistakes? How are you going to regulate bad judgment?"
Mr. Quayle added: "Now they are going the other way, saying: 'Boy, let's not get risky here. Take the safe way. Take the safe course.' But we're saying, risk is part of the American way. Let's get out and do business."
 
Not All Congress's Fault
 Mr. Quayle concentrated in New Hampshire on countering the challenge to Mr. Bush from a Republican conservative, Patrick J. Buchanan. But he did not entirely forget about Democrats, and he did not entirely forget about Congress.
"I'm not going to say it's all Congress's fault," he said in Woodsville. "Most of it is."
Still trying to counter the notion that Mr. Bush is too engaged in foreign policy and not enough in domestic affairs, Mr. Quayle turned on Congress to explain what he said was the gap between the President's diplomatic prowess and his "frustration in domestic policy."
"In foreign affairs, the President decides what is in the best interests of this country, and he does it," Mr. Quayle said. He added: "He decided it was in the best interest of the country to get Saddam Hussein out of Kuwait. He didn't have to ask Congress when to begin the air war. He didn't have to ask Congress when to begin the ground war."
But Mr. Quayle said, "In domestic policy he needs the total cooperation of the Congress." And Mr. Quayle noted, of course, that Congress is controlled by Democrats.

HEADLINE: December Producer Prices Fell

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Prices received by American producers fell two-tenths of 1 percent in December, another sign that the economy remained weak, Labor Department figures showed today.
Prices also eased, although by the slenderest of margins -- one-tenth of 1 percent -- for 1991 as a whole, the first full-year decline in the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods since 1986, when oil prices collapsed. 
 Inflation by this measure "is basically nonexistent," said Robert T. McGee, an economist at the Tokai Bank in New York, noting that only one category, tobacco products, posted double-digit price increases for the year.
Excluding food and energy, which swing erratically, producer prices rose two-tenths of 1 percent last month, half the average of core inflation for October and November, and 3.1 percent for all of 1991.
In another report showing a sluggish economy, the department said new claims for state jobless benefits rose 22,000 in the week ended Dec. 28, to 458,000, with the biggest increases in Wisconsin, Massachusetts and Pennsylvania. [Page D2.]
 
Bonds Rise and Fall
 The two reports drove bond prices up and interest rates down, but the market subsequently slumped on various rumors involving the President's health, a possible rise in payroll jobs in Friday's labor-market report for December and diplomatic pressure for cuts in German rates. Such cuts would be politically difficult in Germany, where the Government reported inflation last year climbed to 3.5 percent, the highest level in a decade.
The producer-price report provided additional maneuvering room for the Federal Reserve if it is inclined to make another round of cuts in interest rates to spur economic recovery. But it appeared that most analysts thought the Fed, which made a sharp cut on Dec. 20, would await data to be published in the next few weeks.
In this view, the central bank already assumes a weak December job performance, with payrolls down perhaps 75,000 or more.
 
Stronger Profits Expected
 Companies find that the sluggish demand and intensified competition that characterize a poor economy generally act to prevent them from raising prices, even when they are experiencing higher costs. But many businesses have responded vigorously to this squeeze by cutting payroll and other costs, so that corporate profits are expected to rise substantially this year.
In addition to the lower prices for finished goods last month, companion Producer Price Indexes showed prices falling two-tenths of 1 percent at the intermediate stage of production and a hefty 2.2 percent for crude goods. Crude goods had not dropped this much since February and March, when the Iraqi-related run-up in oil prices was reversed.
As examples, a suit of clothes would be a finished product, a bolt of cloth an intermediate product and raw cotton a crude commodity.
Price changes at the producer -- sometimes called wholesale -- level tend to be reflected on store shelves within several months. At 3.1 percent for 1991, core inflation for the Producer Price Index for Finished Goods was significantly less than the 4.5 percent core rate for the Consumer Price Index over the latest 12 months. However, most of this difference is accounted for by the fact that the the consumer price measure includes both imported goods and services while the producer price measures do not, so consumers cannot necessarily expect to see the same low level of inflation as reported at the producer level.
For December, the price of energy goods fell 1.4 percent, the first decline since July, even though the cost of residential electricity turned up and residential gas continued to rise. Food prices fell four-tenths of 1 percent as fresh and dried vegetables, paced by lettuce and tomatoes, tumbled 15.2 percent after jumping 23.6 percent in November. Egg prices rose sharply after falling for three straight months.
 
Tobacco Keeps Rising
 Tobacco rose eight-tenths of 1 percent, ending the year 13.1 percent higher, its fifth consecutive annual rise of over 10 percent
Capital equipment rose two-tenths of 1 percent for the month, despite a 1.2 percent decline for the computer sector.
In intermediate goods, prices turned down for energy, for nondurable factory goods like organic chemicals and wood pulp, and for foods and feeds. The price of flour rose substantially for the fifth straight month.
Durable factory goods, like refined copper and flat glass, were unchanged, the report showed, while construction materials turned up by two-tenths of 1 percent.
"We can expect conditions to remain soft in manufacturing," suggested Alan C. Lerner, a senior economist at the Bankers Trust Company.
 
Big Drop in Energy
 Among crude goods, energy accounted for most of the price drop although feeds also fell, slightly more than in November. Crude petroleum dropped 13.8 percent while coal prices turned down; natural gas rose 5.2 percent but this was somewhat less than in November.
Prices rose for aluminum base scrap and phosphates, while declines slowed for cotton, copper scrap and softwood logs. However, price declines accelerated for iron and steel scrap and for silver ores, while cattle hides and copper ores turned down following increases the month before.
The finished goods index now stands at 121.9, or 21.9 percent higher than its 1982 base. Updated weights, based on 1987 production patterns, will be introduced with the report for January, to be published Feb. 14.

Borg-Warner Names New Chief Executive

BYLINE: By ADAM BRYANT

 BODY:
The Borg-Warner Corporation has named Donald C. Trauscht as its chief executive, the company said yesterday.
Mr. Trauscht, 59 years old, ho had been president and chief operating officer since September, replaces James F. Bere, Borg-Warner's longtime leader, who died after a heart attack last Friday at age 69. 
 Mr. Trauscht said he was not planning large changes for the Chicago-based company's two divisions, automotive parts and protective services. Mr. Trauscht and Mr. Bere had worked closely together to develop strategies during many of Mr. Trauscht's 25 years at Borg-Warner. "Our minds, if you will, were almost joined together in strategy and how operations should be conducted," he said.
Those operations include the company's $800 million automotive parts division, which makes transmissions and drive-train components. Although its business has been hurt by slow sales in the recession-battered automobile industry, Borg-Warner is expanding its operations in Europe and the Far East. For example, it is investing in a $200 million plant in Japan, where Borg-Warner supplies all the auto makers. The company has operated in Japan since the 1950's.
Borg-Warner is also developing new technology, including continuously variable transmissions and variable camshaft timing, to help improve automotive gasoline mileage. Mr. Trauscht predicted that those products would be introduced in about four years.
The Borg-Warner protective services division is more diversified and includes Wells Fargo and Burns guards, Pony Express couriers and Wells Fargo armored car services.
In addition to Mr. Trauscht's appointment, the company named Neal F. Farrell executive vice president for administration. He continues to have responsibility for financial and legal issues.
Mr. Trauscht began his career with Borg-Warner in 1967 as director of corporate planning. In 1978, he was named vice president of business development and acquisitions. Four years later, he was appointed vice president for corporate planning, and in 1987, he was named corporate vice president for finance and strategy. In December 1990, he was also named president of Borg-Warner Automotive.
Mr. Trauscht has a bachelor's degree in physics from St. Mary's College in Winona, Minn., and a master's degree in business from the University of Chicago.
He and his wife, Arlene, have three children and live in Oak Brook, Ill.

HEADLINE: New Jobless-Benefit Claims Up 22,000 in Late December

BYLINE: Reuters

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 9

 BODY:
The number of Americans applying for unemployment benefits climbed by 22,000 in the last full week of December, ending a fourth quarter in which claims steadily crept higher, according to a Government report released today.
The Labor Department said 458,000 people filed new claims for state jobless benefits in the holiday-shortened week that ended Dec. 28, up from the previous week's level of 436,000, as layoffs continued to batter the economy. 
 "It reinforces what we know -- that the economy in the fourth quarter was weak," said Kevin Logan, chief economist for the Swiss Bank Corporation. "This just shows the continuation of the trend,"
The four-week moving average of weekly jobless claims, considered a more accurate gauge of the nation's employment picture than the more volatile weekly figure, rose to 463,500 from 452,500 for the previous four weeks.
"The data show a continuing movement upward in the moving average, which tends to smooth out the week-to-week variations," Mr. Logan said.
Fred Sturm, senior economist at Fuji Securities, said he expected the average weekly rate to "dig in its heels somewhere around 450,000" before possibly moving downward.
He said today's report served as mild evidence supporting his theory that new claims are peaking.
The number of Americans actually receiving unemployment benefits fell by 280,000, to 3.175 million, in the week that ended Dec. 21, the latest period for which data were available.
The latest figures will not be reflected in Friday's report on December unemployment. The data for that report were collected in the week that ended Dec. 12.
But analysts were not expecting the news to be any better. They anticipated a loss of 70,000 jobs in non-farm payrolls and an increase in the unemployment rate to 6.9 percent from 6.8 percent, according to a Reuters survey. That report will reflect conditions before the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates on Dec. 20.

HEADLINE: OUR TOWNS;
Expressway's Good Samaritan Loves His Work

BYLINE: By Andrew H. Malcolm

DATELINE: TARRYTOWN, N.Y.

 BODY:
Here's a job description for you: Up at 5 A.M. to drive off by 5:45. Spend four hours seeking trouble on the expressway. Inhabit traffic jams of grumpy motorists reading, telephoning, fuming, shaving or applying makeup. Find stubborn stalls, fires, accidents, hysterical drivers, women in labor, startled children, men in fistfights. With luck, crawl under a disabled car in the rain with a flashlight in your mouth. Fix a transmission leak. Accept no payments. Perhaps be thanked.
In spare time, monitor six radios and two telephones. Every 30 minutes go on the air to chat smoothly about traffic for miles around. 
 At 3:30 P.M., do it all over again for grumpy homebound commuters.
It's not easy being a good Samaritan these days, especially along the grimy multilane suburban maelstroms that are the modern American expressway. But Matt McGuy loves his work.
"I get to help people and fix things," he said, "and I don't have to get them to pay me."
The job of the 38-year-old Mr. McGuy is to repair disabled vehicles, which gets travelers on their ways quicker, clears the highways safely and sooner and -- who knows? -- maybe earns goodwill for his corporate sponsor, Texaco. "We love the response to Matt," said Joan Gilbert, community relations manager for Texaco's Westchester headquarters.
Mr. McGuy's territory is Interstate 287 in a 20-mile corridor of concrete across Westchester County from Port Chester to Tarrytown that then soars over the Hudson River on the Tappan Zee Bridge to Nyack. His transportation turf is not like the city expressways' crumbling rock walls seemingly held up by generations of graffiti, roving packs of wheeled bandits and burned hulks of yesterday's disabled cars.
But it does have its dangers. His roadway is a well-littered, often high-speed, no-holds-barred no-man's-land where deadly wheels whiz by just a few feet away. That explains why Mr. McGuy never turns his back to oncoming traffic.
Technically, Mr. McGuy works for Samaritania Inc., a Massachusetts company operating do-good vans in a dozen Northeast communities. For about $100,000 a year, a sponsor gets its name on a vehicle and an association with thousands of free favors. All drivers are trained in mechanics, emergency medical techniques, firefighting and a range of social skills to defuse many drivers' often-emotional encounters with cars that dare to fail them. "Some people can make the biggest deal out of a flat tire," Mr. McGuy said in wonder. "I fix it, ba-dee ba-dum, and they're outta here."
With his keen diagnostic eye and ear, Mr. McGuy translates grinding sounds into failed bearings, steam into thirsty radiators and silence into cracked distributor caps. His van carries fuels, oil, fluids, jacks, sprays, plugs, wires, fan belts, fire extinguishers, first-aid kits and even new teddy bears for frightened young passengers. "That was my daughter Paula's idea," he said.
For extra exposure, each van broadcasts regular traffic reports to a local radio station. Mr. McGuy, who doesn't mind the mild local fame accompanying his regular radio appearances, is heard on Westchester's WXPS-FM, billing itself as The Express 107.1.
With their thousands of self-important kilowatts, most of New York City's more powerful stations still seem to think that all roads, tunnels and bridges lead to Manhattan. Their traffic reports sometimes range as distant as Long Island or New Jersey's nearest counties.
But development of outlying office and industrial parks has created new economic, cultural, political and commuting orbits, meaning the one-time suburbs are no longer sub-anything. Thousands of drivers bustling from homes in, say, Rockland County to jobs in Westchester or Fairfield County in Connecticut have been left to fend for themselves anticipating tie-ups. Enter a squad of weak-voiced but aggressive suburban stations. "We're killing 'em with our local traffic reports," said Ira Kleinman, WXPS's general manager, who actually has two local traffic reporters interrupting music with urgent reports on things like "a backup at the 287 split."
Most of the time, however, Mr. McGuy is fixing cars or working the radios to spot traffic trouble. Many truckers, when they can interrupt their CB chatter, supplement Mr. McGuy's information. Many of 287's traffic problems have a familiar pattern: Friday afternoons are the heaviest, Monday mornings the worst for breakdowns and more midweek drivers get lost. "Where's Main?" asked one.
Mr. McGuy himself is fresh from a family trip. The McGuys saw Walt Disney World. The man who commutes 250 miles a day without ever arriving is asked how he traveled there. "Are you kidding?" he said. "Plane."

HEADLINE: Dow Up 5.59; Small Issues Set the Pace

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stocks rose in choppy trading yesterday, with a number of indexes repeating their almost daily feat of reaching new highs. Shrinking interest rates still leave investors with few alternatives to shifting money into equities.l
The Dow Jones industrial average rose 5.59 points, to a new closing high of 3,209.53. Volume on the New York Stock Exchange remained heavy at 292.4 million shares, up from 290.8 million on Wednesday. 
 Gaining issues on the Big Board easily outpaced losers, 1,014 to 783, as the Big Board composite ended unchanged at 230.23.
 
Nasdaq Index at High
 While the market did finish higher, it was up even more earlier in the day. Stocks other than the larger blue- chip issues continued to attract the new money coming into the market, as the Nasdaq composite again closed at a new high of 619.80, up 9.48 points, and the Russell 2,000, a barometer of smaller issues, rose 2.48 points, to 200.58, also a high.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell short for the day and slipped 0.49 point, to 417.61, as the American Stock Exchange index posted a new closing high of 407.57, up 4.09 points.
David Chao, senior vice president for trading at County NatWest Securities, said the market was a little skittish, with the Dow running up and down, then up again. Large professional traders were ready to step out of the market on any kind of news, he said.
"At some point the market has to sell off, since volatility usually comes at the top and bottom of market moves," he said. "We've had good volatility over the past three days along with good volume, an indication that the market may be a little heavy."
The day's rally was assisted by a drop of two-tenths of a percent in producer prices for December and a firm bond market. The selloff in the afternoon may have been started by rumors that information had been leaked showing that employment numbers expected today would be stronger than expected and thus leave little room for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates further, analysts said.
Birinyi Associates, a research firm that also tracks program trading, said there was a fair amount of it yesterday with four buy and four sell programs, which had a net impact of a 0.45-point decline on the Dow.
Elsewhere in the market, JWP Inc. a technical services company, rose by as much as 1 to close up 3/8 at 18 1/4, as David Loeb, an analyst at Oppenmheimer & Company, upgraded his rating on the company to "buy," from "market performer" and raised his 1992 earnings estimates. Mr Loeb said the company's earnings propects for the second half were better than they had been.
Healthtrust Inc., a medical-hospital management and service company, rose by 3 3/4, to 22 1/4, as Lucy Olwell, an analyst with Merrill Lynch, initiated coverage of the company with a "buy" rating.
Adobe Systems , which was among the over-the-counter actives, fell 2 5/8, to 63. Traders said the software company's fourth-quarter earnings of 57 cents a share were below market expectations, as Alex. Brown & Sons lowered its 1992 earnings forecast.

HEADLINE: THE MEDIA BUSINESS: ADVERTISING;
Building a Consumer Economy Amid Communism's Ruins

BYLINE: By Stuart Elliott

 BODY:
AN actor dressed as a dentist, complete with white coat, holds up a package of toothpaste and slowly explains how toothpaste works to make teeth stronger. An American television commercial of the 1950's? No. A 1992 Hungarian television commercial.
A stylishly dressed woman matter-of-factly discusses feminine hygiene. 
 An American television commercial of the 1990's? No. A 1992 Polish television commercial.
Those contrasting spots, for Blend A Med toothpaste and Always sanitary napkins, were both created by the same agency, D'Arcy Masius Benton & Bowles Inc. They typify what American shops are experiencing as part of their embryonic efforts to expand into Eastern Europe.
Preconceived notions about marketing to the former East bloc nations, particularly a belief that what worked in this country after World War II can serve as a primer to turn Eastern Europeans into Western-style consumers, are being disproved almost daily.
"Even calling it 'Eastern Europe,' to the Czechs, Hungarians and Poles, is talking down to them," said Andy Bielanski, D.M.B.& B.'s managing director for Central and Eastern Europe, who supervises the agency's operations in those countries from an office in Budapest. "They'd much rather it be called 'Central Europe.' "
In an interview the other day at D.M.B.& B.'s midtown Manhattan headquarters, Mr. Bielanski, who had returned to this country for the holidays, spoke about the trial-and-error process, sometimes humorous, always instructive, by which the agency is learning about a part of the world where it was thought a primary duty of an advertising agency was, as in Czechoslovakia, to supply mannequins to department stores.
Unlike postwar America, which embraced consumerism with a zeal never before seen, in Eastern Europe "you're dealing with skepticism right from the start," Mr. Bielanski said. "Under Communism, if a product was advertised, it was in oversupply and of poor quality."
That skepticism even extends to something as simple as using percentages in advertisements, he added, because of their previous association with quotas under multiyear centrally planned economies.
"We tested using percentages of cavity reduction in our toothpaste ads," said Arthur Selkowitz, the agency's New York-based executive vice president, international, who joined Mr. Bielanski for the interview. "But it was not credible."
And a disdain for authority figures, intensified over years of Communist rule, affected how the agency presented the actor-cum-dentist in the toothpaste spot. "We picked someone who was very warm," Mr. Bielanski said, "who wasn't beating his chest, because people wouldn't believe that."
Another agency expectation not realized was a theory that "the American experience in product categories would be very relevant," he added -- for instance, emphasizing in advertising for, say, a soap, that it is the best-selling soap in America.
"It turned out that was too far from their daily experience," he continued. "They wanted something closer to their reality." As a result, the ads the agency has produced have focused specifically on the benefits the products being advertised are intended to deliver to Czechoslovaks, Hungarians and Poles.
D.M.B.& B.'s billings in the region for clients like Procter & Gamble, which makes Blend A Med -- the European version of Crest -- and Always, as well as Mars Inc. and Burger King, are expected to approach $10 million this year, Mr. Selkowitz said. That figure, which also includes billings at the agency's Moscow office, is around the level of billings of a D.M.B.& B. office in a country like Greece, India or Malaysia, he added.
But, he continued, the "hope is that growth will be exponential," noting that at this time last year, as the agency's efforts in Eastern Europe were beginning, billings there totaled $1 million to $2 million.
D.M.B.& B. is one of several giant American agencies now operating in Eastern Europe. Others include Backer Spielvogel Bates, Leo Burnett, Ogilvy & Mather and Young & Rubicam.

HEADLINE: BUSH IN JAPAN;
Europeans Ready to Protest if Trade Accord Leaves Them Out

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD, Special to The New York Time

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 9

 BODY:
European officials and auto executives here reacted with concern to a Japanese agreement to increase sharply purchases of American-made autos and auto parts, saying that the accord was unacceptable if it did not open the way for the purchase of more European-made products, too.
If the trade deal hammered out in a week of tough trade talks merely opens Japanese markets to all by removing barriers to imports, European officials said, they would then welcome the measures as an opportunity to compete on equal terms. 
 But some European officials insisted that if it turns out the Japanese offered targets for purchases of American-made goods, as seems to be the case, then European companies will insist on equal treatment for BMW's, Fiats, Volvos and other European autos.
 
Changing the Game
 "If the game we are playing changes from bridge to hockey, then we will want to have a hockey team," said Jean-Pierre Leng, the European Community's Ambassador to Japan.
Added Shunichi Itani, senior vice president with Mercedes-Benz Japan, "We welcome measures that expand the market for foreign-car imports, but we would have trouble accepting them if American auto imports are given any kind of advantage."
The trade deal the United States and Japan announced today, toward the close of President Bush's visit here, seems to have pleased few people, and many Europeans now appear to be in the ranks of the dissatisfied.
"In general terms, any discussions with the Japanese at any level which help improve access to Japanese markets are a good thing," Ambassador Leng said. "The United States is not the only one who has a trade deficit with Japan, however. Anything which would tend to bilateralize the problem is not going to be good. We are watching very carefully everything that is being done."
The European Community nations have a $28 billion trade deficit with Japan -- about 70 percent the size of the United States' $41 billion deficit with Japan. The community has been holding talks about removing barriers to various imports, and officials here said their aim in the negotiations had generally been to free Japan's markets, not seek special treatment.
 
Concerns About Consumers
 One problem created by the approach taken in the new American trade accord with Japan is that it pays little attention to the wishes of Japanese consumers.
"A discussion of the market situation is very helpful," said Siegfried Richter, president of the BMW Japan Corporation. "However, we can't imagine that governments and manufacturers can make consumers' decisions for them. We think the consumer cannot be spoken for."
But the ultimate risk of managed trade is that it could become a form of defense, used selectively by countries to reward their friends. That has been a special concern in Europe, where there is a tradition of greater government involvement in the economy than in the United States.
"Part of the great debate in Europe is over the question of how interventionist the government should be," said Kenneth Courtis, senior economist here with the securities unit of Deutsche Bank. "This agreement announced today sets an example that helps one side of the debate. The Europeans are watching carefully."

HEADLINE: Economic Scene;
Potential Tragedy Of a Global Slump

BYLINE: By Leonard Silk

 BODY:
THE agreement between President Bush and Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa of Japan to try to accelerate world economic growth gives flesh to Mr. Bush's assertion that his mission to Japan was really about "jobs, jobs, jobs."
This bilateral macroeconomic commitment, if Germany and the rest of Europe can be brought aboard, makes far more sense than efforts by the President and his entourage of business executives to squeeze orders out of Japan for more American autos, auto parts, computers, glass, paper, financial services and other goods. 
 America's economic problems stem in part from the general slowdown in the world economy, and would be aggravated if the slump worsens. Last year, according to the World Economic Survey of the United Nations, the global economy's growth rate fell to zero from 1 percent in 1990, 3 percent in 1989 and 4.3 percent in 1988.
The developed market economies grew at a sluggish 1.4 percent in 1991 -- too slow to keep unemployment from rising and real per capita income from falling. The official figure is not yet in, but the United States economy sank by about one-half of 1 percent.
The third world grew at an average rate of 3.5 percent last year. China had the highest rate, 5.5 percent in 1991, after rising 4.8 percent in 1990; the world's worst growth record was in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where output plunged 9.5 percent last year after dropping 6.3 percent the year before.
The contrast of rapid growth in hard-line China and depression in Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, where people are struggling for democracy and economic freedom, could not have been lost on Chinese leaders. Last week China rudely expelled a group of Canadian legislators seeking to call world attention to the plight of China's dissidents and political prisoners.
Washington is not underestimating the historic importance of a successful move by Russia and the other ex-Communist states to democracy and market-oriented economies.
A world economic slump would not only aggravate the economic problems of the United States and the West but would threaten a tragedy for Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.
With President Bush off on his mission to Australia, Singapore, South Korea and Japan, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d has been pushing ahead with plans for a conference in Washington to help Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of Independent States. The date has been set for Jan. 22-23, but the list of countries that will attend has not yet been released.
The State Department's spokesman, Margaret Tutweiler, said this week that the conference aims to organize an effort to provide urgently needed "humanitarian" aid. It will not be an American-led effort to create a long-term multinational Marshall Plan for the ex-Communist countries.
The aid will include these elements: food, medicine, energy, shelter, technical assistance and logistics. The conference will not be a "pledging session," Miss Tutweiler said, but rather an effort to "help people help themselves" to prevent mass hunger and disease this winter. The intention is to keep working into the summer, to improve the situation for next winter as well.
The Administration sees this as the start of a continuing effort to help the republics create "democratic and market-based economic institutions." Despite its strong free-enterprise ideology, the Administration has no intention of trying to press for rapid privatization and "overnight" capitalism, for fear that if the republics move too fast, they could be courting disaster.
Small and newly established businesses can privatize quickly, but not the gargantuan state enterprises. And the bigger the state-owned industries, the more difficult they are to privatize, especially because of the huge imbedded real capital stock of plant and equipment, power systems, transportation, residential structures and transportation.
As Joseph Berliner, a research fellow at the Russian Research Center at Harvard University, writes in "Perspectives, 1992," just published by Brandeis University: "The capital stock built up under decades of non-market planning is grossly out of sync with the structure of capital that the market would call for.
"The massive size of enterprises, their location, their concentration in heavy industry and defense production, and their neglect of esthetic and environmental considerations, distinguishes the Soviet scene from that of capitalist countries. Because of the durability of capital, Soviet capitalism will bear the marks of its Communist past for a long time."
The conversion of the former Soviet economy into an effective, market-based system is likely to take 10 or 15 years, at least. The slower the growth of the world economy, the longer it will take.
Conversely, the stronger the global growth, the easier it will be for the United States and other Western countries to aid the reconstruction of Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar Advances Sharply On Growing Recovery Hope

BYLINE: Reuters

 BODY:
The dollar closed sharply higher yesterday on a bout of buying linked to rising hopes about the United States economy.
The dollar gained nearly 6 German pfennigs, closing at 1.5605 marks, against 1.5075 Wednesday. Most of the action occurred in a single round of buying at midday. 
 "I left my desk to pick up lunch when the dollar was at 1.5460 marks," said Betsy Reetz of the Union Bank of Switzerland. "When I came back 10 minutes later, it was at 1.5700 marks."
The dollar also rose to 125.80 Japanese yen, up from 124.45 Wednesday.
The dollar opened in New York on a strong note, helped by a report in the Japanese newspaper Nihon Keizai Shimbun that European nations would put pressure on the United States to push the dollar higher at the group's meeting Jan. 25 in New York.
Speculation that the American economy will soon recover, while Germany's weakens, helped the dollar, traders said. A rising United States economy would make American investments more attractive, raising the dollar's value.
The conflict between Russia and Ukraine over the Black Sea naval fleet added to the market's political jitters and helped the dollar, traders said. Many traders also said short-covering was a major factor, as dealers bought dollars in fear of being left out of a big jump.
"This is nothing more than dollar short-covering," said Charles Spence, corporate foreign exchange manager at the First Interstate Bank.
Some traders, including Mr. Spence, look for the dollar to drop back down today after the Labor Department releases employment figures for December. Economists on average forecast a rise in the jobless rate to 6.9 percent from 6.8 percent.
But others think the dollar has turned around and is ready for a sustained move upward. "I've turned bullish," Ms. Reetz of Union Bank said. "Bad employment numbers are largely factored in" to exchange rates already.
In other trading, the British pound closed at $1.8160, down from $1.8790 Wednesday.
The dollar ended at 1.3925 Swiss francs, up from 1.3450, and at 1.1490 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1425 Wednesday. It also ended at 5.3235 French francs, up from 5.1495 Wednesday.

Gold Leads Precious Metals In a Rally Termed Technical

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
Heavy buying of gold futures early yesterday set off what analysts called a technical rally that overwhelmed the influence of a stronger dollar and gave a sharp gain to precious metals in general.
The gold rally on the Commodity Exchange in New York resulted from the oversold condition of the market, said Peter Cardillo, director of research at Westfalia Investments in New York. 
 "Generally a strong dollar smothers a gold rally," said an analyst, James Steel of Refco Inc. in New York. "Gold ignored the dollar move because the rally by the market was so technical in nature."
Gold futures for delivery in February settled $6 higher at $356.60 a troy ounce; March silver was 18.3 cents higher at $4.153 a troy ounce.
Silver edged higher on the gold increase, then took off when it hit several buy stops.
 
Drop in Producer Prices
 Traders also took solace from the drop in the Producer Price Index, with the idea that stagnant inflation might encourage investment and lead to greater industrial demand, Mr. Steel said.
Platinum futures on the New York Mercantile Exchange showed a modest gain, with prices held back by disappointment over trade talks in Tokyo. There is doubt the talks will result in increased sales of American autos, Mr. Steel said. Platinum is used to make catalytic converters used in cars.
A strike at the Impala platinum mine in South Africa had little effect on the market, with views expressed that the 10,000 striking miners will be back to work in a few days.
Platinum for delivery in January rose $2.70, to $339.50 a troy ounce.
Energy futures were mixed in trading on the New York Mercantile Exchange, with oil prices fluctuating sharply as traders waited to see whether Iraq could get back into the market. Concerns over the possibility of a world oil glut continued to weigh on the market.
Light sweet crude for delivery in February was a cent lower at $17.86 a barrel. February heating oil was 0.49 cent higher at 49.85 cents a gallon. February unleaded gasoline was 0.65 cent lower at 50.34 cents a gallon and February natural gas was 3.1 cent lower at $1.259 for 1,000 cubic feet.
Wheat for delivery in March settled 3 3/4 cents lower at $4.00 3/4 a bushel. March corn was a 1/4 cent lower at $2.52 3/4 a bushel. March oats were 3/4 cent lower at $1.37 1/4 a bushel and January soybeans were a cent lower at $5.63 3/4 a bushel.

HEADLINE: Critic's Notebook;
Political Premonitions Born of 30's Despair

BYLINE: By VINCENT CANBY

 BODY:
THE Archangel Gabriel is said to have foretold the birth of John the Baptist and, a little later, to have made the Annunciation to the Virgin Mary. It is the gospel according to Gregory LaCava, in his astonishing 1933 film, "Gabriel Over the White House," that, a couple of milleniums later, Gabriel takes command of the United States during the darkest months of the Great Depression.
The conceit of this woozily prescient neo-fascist Hollywood movie is that God, funneling His wishes through an off-screen Gabriel, transforms the fictitious Judd Hammond (Walter Huston), the party hack just elected President, into an iron-fisted if benevolent dictator who saves America from the worst economic crisis in its history. 
 You might say, "It can't happen here," which is what you're supposed to say. "It Can't Happen Here" is the title of the Lincoln Center Film Society's richly provocative films-of-the-Depression retrospective, which begins today at the Walter Reade Theater and runs through March 2.
Chief among the retrospective's odd-ball glories is "Gabriel Over the White House," which will be shown today, tomorrow and Monday.
The society will present a total of 29 programs of features, documentaries and short subjects, all made either during the Depression or, later, about the Depression. Three separate programs will be shown once each day. Each program will be screened at least twice, sometimes as many as four times, each day at a different hour.
This weekend's other selections, all equally important in their own way: Frank Capra's "American Madness" (1932), a buoyant forerunner of the terminally sentimental "It's a Wonderful Life"; Mervyn LeRoy's "Gold Diggers of 1933" (1933), in which chorus girls dressed in over-sized gold coins sing "We're in the Money," and King Vidor's "Our Daily Bread" (1934), in which collective action on a farm triumphs over drought and other adversities.
Scheduled for the weeks ahead: Mervyn LeRoy's "Hard to Handle" (1933), which features a smashingly funny James Cagney performance; LaCava's screwball take on Depression manners, "My Man Godfrey" (1936); Preston Sturges's "Sullivan's Travels" (1942), a satire of films like "Our Daily Bread" and of the people who make them, and Sydney Pollack's "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" (1969), an extraordinarily effective tale of existential despair, set in the depressed 1930's, though the sensibility is of the Vietnam era.
Good or bad, these films are never indifferent. They are history in the raw, history before the historians have squeezed the life out of it. They are unself-conscious reports from the winter of our heritage.
"Gabriel Over the White House," one of the retrospective's most significant artifacts, is not ineffective movie making. It is technically slick, and Huston is fine as both the initially bumbling President, a character seemingly inspired by Warren Harding, and as the born-again Judd Hammond, the demonic, undead White House presence whose will is that of his creator.
As politics, "Gabriel Over the White House" is an informed scream. It is hilarious in its naivete. At the same time, it is appalling for the casual way in which it glorifies Presidential death squads, the possibly permanent dismissal of Congress and the suspension of all Constitutionally guaranteed civil liberties.
"Gabriel Over the White House" was no fringe movie. It was a mass-market entertainment, produced by William Randolph Heart's Cosmopolitan Pictures and released by M-G-M. It was even a hit. As much as any film in the retrospective, "Gabriel Over the White House" reflects the degree of American bewilderment at the time it was made.
After the 1929 stock market crash, and after one brief bull market in 1930, the business of this country, which Calvin Coolidge so sagely said was business, had slipped into chaos. Wall Street was discredited. Brokers were seen to be crooks.
By the middle of 1932, American industry was operating at less than half of its 1929 volume. The market economy was stalled. Banks were failing. Hobo jungles and so-called "Hoovervilles" sheltered a huge floating population of the economically disenfranchised. The number of unemployed, which had been 5 million in 1931, rose to 13.7 million in 1932, about one-quarter of the work force. The pop anthem of the day: E. Y. Harburg's "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?"
The desperate measures required in desperate times were frontally addressed by "Gabriel Over the White House." Though it opened at the Capitol Theater here on March 31, 1933, less than four weeks after Franklin D. Roosevelt had been inaugurated as this country's 32d President, the movie seems to predict the kind of programs Roosevelt would push through Congress in his first 100 days in office.
Huston's President Hammond starts a Federally sponsored work corps called the Constructionist Army, and anticipates the repeal of Prohibition by opening Government-run liquor stores. When bootleggers object by staging a drive-by shoot-out at the White House, the President has them lined up against a wall and shot.
At the time of its release, the movie fulfilled a lot of dreams. It also confirmed the worst nightmares of those who saw Roosevelt as a would-be dictator, the sort of President who, a few years later, would brazenly attempt to "pack" the Supreme Court, that is, to enlarge it with additional appointees to ensure approval of his legislation.
The "It Can't Happen Here" show is clearly intended to draw parallels between yesterday's Depression and today's recession and, one supposes, to sound a warning. Yet parallels are often superficial. They are deceiving.
Though angry, most of the characters in these films are remarkably trusting. They are idealists. They exalt the possibilities of the future even in retrospect, as in "Union Maids" (1976). In this fine Julia Reichert-James Klein documentary, three women look back with satisfaction and pride at their activities as militant trade-union organizers. The times, being grim, gave their lives brilliant focus.
As in the documentaries, the people in the fiction films earnestly want to believe in something, which is usually collective action. The men who organize the farm cooperative in "Our Daily Bread" agree to form a socialist government. Says one man, "The Government must control everything, even the profits."
William Wellman's "Wild Boys of the Road" (1933) is about three "nice" teen-agers who run away from home to spare their hard-pressed familiies the cost of their upkeep. They become hobos, bums. They see life in the raw: a young woman is raped in a box car, a young man loses his leg under the wheels of a freight train. At the end, the kids are arrested and brought into court on charges of attempting a holdup.
The judge turns out to be a Roosevelt surrogate. Robert Barratt, the actor who plays the judge, wears Rooseveltian pince-nez, talks in Roosevelt's cadences and promises them, in effect, a New Deal.
Roosevelt's first inaugural address ("The only thing we have to fear is fear itself") is quoted in the final sequence of a second 1933 Wellman movie, "Heroes for Sale." This is a crazy mixture of bitterness and hope about a man unjustly deprived of his war medals, falsely accused of being "a Red," whose wife is killed in a labor demonstration and whose invention (a combined washing machine and mangle) is stolen by a Communist agitator, who then becomes a rich capitalistic pig.
One can't go too fast in synopsizing this plot. The story makes no sense except for the desperation of its politics. In 1933, people wanted a savior and Roosevelt was their man. No other American President has ever been so quickly beatified.
For all of their talk of joint action, the 1930's films are never very militant in their liberalism. With the exception of the right-wing "Gabriel," none of the films seek to change the system. In Capra's "American Madness," Walter Huston plays an idealistic bank president who alienates his board of directors by making loans to people without collateral. The profit motive is not questioned.
"We've got to get the money back in circulation," he tells the stingy directors. He says that "a man's character is his collateral," which turns out to be true when there is a run on his bank and all of the little guys he ever helped rush over to deposit their money with him. Sound familiar?
The retrospective does have its moments of deadly uplift and pre-fabricated social conscience, especially in William Wyler's "Dead End" (1937), whose faults lie not in Wyler's direction but in the stylized source material (the Sidney Kingsley play adapted by Lillian Hellman) that doesn't fit easily on the screen.
There is also something sort of phony about John Ford's adaptation of John Steinbeck's "Grapes of Wrath" (1940). Though beautifully photographed, the movie reeks of self-importance, which Frank Galatti managed to avoid in his recent Broadway stage adaptation.
The most successful films in this show are either insistently downbeat or comic. "Gold Diggers of 1933," with its kaleidescopic Busby Berkeley production numbers, is a nonstop delight. The seldom-seen "Hard to Handle," in which Cagney plays a hustling public-relations genius, is laugh-out-loud funny. Like Cagney, the film has immense spirit. In "Sullivan's Travels," Sturges acknowledges the realities of the Depression while sending himself and Hollywood sky-high.
Also worth seeing are Robert Altman's "Thieves Like Us" (1974) and Nicholas Ray's "They Live by Night" (1949), both adapted from the same Edward Anderson novel. The Altman has the tougher edge. The Ray is more romantic. "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?" remains a stunner. The dance marathon, which is a joke as viewed in the 1933 "Hard to Handle," becomes a bleak, merciless evocation of Depression America in the Pollack movie.
Equally clear-eyed is Ken Burns's "Huey Long" (1985), a superior documentary about the assassinated Louisiana politician. In this retrospective, Huey Long represents all of the fast-talking, panacea-promoting hustlers who enriched the 1930's landscape.
The Depression is said to have begun with the market crash of 1929. Though conditions improved somewhat as the 30's went on, the Depression was never really conquered. Instead, World War II came along and magically removed the conditions that had paralyzed the economy. That may be the grimmest lesson to be learned from "It Can't Happen Here."

Big Deal for Nichols
Whenever Mike Nichols is back in town working on a show, all anyone can talk about is his paycheck. Superstar directors are rare commodities in the theater, especially in the non-musical theater. No star is bigger than Mr. Nichols, and no deal is sweeter than his. He is now directing "Death and the Maiden," a new play by Ariel Dorfman, starring Glenn Close, Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss, which is to open in late March. And the deal helps to explain the ticket price of $50, the premium for non-musicals on Broadway. 
 Not that Mr. Nichols alone is expensive. The three stars don't come cheap either. Here are the figures circulating among producers and potential investors and confirmed by Roger Berlind, the show's co-producer: The production will cost $1.3 million and will have to run for 16 weeks making a minimum of $325,000 each of those weeks (out of a potential $388,000) to pay back that investment. The 3 stars are signed for 26 weeks. While the show is still recouping, Mr. Nichols will be paid 6 points, or roughly one-third, of the royalty pool, which is the percentage of the weekly profits allotted to the creative team, which also includes the playwright, the designers and the producers. If we use the hypothetical gross figure of $300,000 a week, his share will come to about $13,000 a week. After recoupment, Mr. Nichols will receive a clean 20 percent of profits off the top in addition to his points. Using the $300,000 figure, expected profits would be $100,000 a week, which makes his share $20,000, plus $13,000 for a total of $33,000 a week. Ever feel like you're in the wrong business?
Just for some perspective, consider two other front-rank directors, Gene Saks and Jerry Zaks. Producers who have worked on shows with both men verify that they are paid roughly 3 points of the royalty pool, which may then increase half a point after recoupment. Neither gets a share of profits. That, says one producer, makes Mr. Nichols the highest-paid director in the history of the American theater.
But every theater executive canvassed agrees that Mr. Nichols is worth it. "Look at the cast he put together," says the producer James B. Freydberg. "Where do you ever see Gene Hackman on the stage? And this is a play by a serious writer going to Broadway. If the public pre-buys it based on the names and makes it critic-proof, it takes the risk out. And if the show doesn't bring in big money, then he doesn't get very much, does he?"
Phone sales began on Sunday when the first ad ran and already total more than $300,000. And even when these stars leave, producers say, with Mr. Nichols's connections in Hollywood, their replacements should be just as interesting, which insures its future life. "We could make better deals with lesser directors," Mr. Berlind says. "But in the end, you get what you pay for."
 
'Secret' vs. 'Will Rogers'

With the January attendance slump in full swing, senses of humor are a bit short, judging from the sniping going on between "The Secret Garden" and "The Will Rogers Follies." For months, "The Secret Garden" has been using the slogan "It Won the Awards. It Will Win Your Heart" in its ads. That's true, since the Broadway show won 3 of the 10 Tonys it was nominated for -- best supporting actress, best scenic design and best book of a musical, but it did not win best musical, as the ad seems to imply. "Will Rogers" did, and members of its creative staff say they have not been happy with the "Secret Garden" campaign.
Recently, the "Secret Garden" ads have also included the claim "Best American Musical of the Season," which is a quote from William A. Henry 3d in Time magazine. "Will Rogers" retaliated with an ad proclaiming "The Best Musical of the Year Is No Secret." Nancy Coyne, the president of Serino, Coyne Inc., the advertising agency for "Will Rogers," says: "It was meant to be tongue in cheek. There was no animosity intended."
Heidi Landesman, a co-producer of "The Secret Garden," says: "We're trying to sell tickets, not disparage anyone else. The whole thing is silly."
 
Unabashed Discount
 The ad that ran in last Sunday's New York Times for "Lost in Yonkers" has raised quite a few eyebrows among Broadway producers. It was taken by American Express and offered its card members the exclusive opportunity to save 25 percent off the regular ticket price for performances through Feb. 13.
What's so unusual? Well, Broadway has its little idiosyncrasies just like any other business, and one of them is to never offer discounts directly to the public, even in bad times, or you risk looking as if you're selling damaged goods. But, like any other business in a recession, some little idiosyncrasies are best left unindulged until times get better.
Gail Wasserman, a spokeswoman for American Express, says the company is sponsoring the national tour of "Lost in Yonkers" "so this particular offer is an outgrowth of our relationship with them." Sponsoring the tour means that the company assumes a lot of advertising and promotion costs, and in return promotes itself successfully in its major markets. That's why it's willing to extend itself in tough times back in New York.
Michael David, a veteran Broadway producer and general manager who is among the more progressive in the business, is currently represented on Broadway with "The Secret Garden." He says: "Everyone discounts their shows in bad months, just in a more private way, through mailings, groups and parties. Unlike a normal discount, those which are selective are better, and this is the Rolls-Royce of public discounting. It doesn't feed the big fear that twofers for your show will end up on every dry cleaners' counter in New York."
Emanuel Azenberg, the producer of "Lost in Yonkers," refused to comment.
 
Time Out for 'Forbidden'
 "Forbidden Broadway" will close on Sunday at Theater East, says its producer, Jonathan Scharer. But after what he calls a "vacation," the musical spoof of Broadway shows that changes periodically to incorporate new material is to re-open on March 17. "Even though the show's Christmas edition went well, I didn't want to put the 'Forbidden Broadway 1991 1/2' back on in 1992 since there had been a lack of business. These editions usually last about nine months. But in March, we will open our big 10th anniversary edition, which will be a 'best of' everything, plus material on new shows. So we have the luxury of being able to take the break, keep the theater and recast the new show."


GRAPHIC: Bo Diddley, above, will appear in "Return to the Forbidden Planet" on Jan. 18, kicking off a series of weekend guest appearances by pop stars that is to include Lesley Gore, Chubby Checker, the Shirelles, Platters, Drifters, Chiffons and Marvelettes. They will perform at the finale of the show, which is loosely based on Shakespeare's "Tempest" and has a score of golden oldies.

The Pursuit of Pleasure
By Lionel Tiger
330 pages. Little, Brown & Company. $22.95.
Pleasure -- the subject of the latest book by the anthropologist and social critic Lionel Tiger -- is one of those huge, sprawling topics that can easily elude systematic examination. Indeed, "The Pursuit of Pleasure" bounces erratically around the map of human experience like a ball in a pinball machine, touching, fleetingly, on such varied phenomena as sex, food, drugs, art, music, sports, conversation and the enjoyment people get from gardening, pets, cooking and travel. "I have tried to find a link," writes Mr. Tiger, "between campfires, Judy Garland, the Place Vendome, playing patty-cake with a baby, the scent of gardenias, kisses and a good read. I've sought a law of pleasure that might unite such an array of phenomena and more besides." 
 A result of this vague but grandiose ambition is a messy hodgepodge of a book, a book filled with both insightful observations and hackneyed statements of the obvious, interesting facts and self-indulgent prattling, provocative questions and unsatisfying answers.
It is Mr. Tiger's contention that the things people find pleasurable today are rooted in the evolutionary history of the human species and our prehistoric past: "the behavior that yielded survival advantages in the past was translated into forms of pleasure: from sex, food, warmth, comfortable sleep, conviviality and so on." Because of social and economic changes, some of these old pleasures and preferences now result in problems.
People's taste for animal fat, for instance, was once a healthy survival mechanism. Our hunter-gatherer ancestors who lived some 10,000 years ago worked hard to catch their supper, and fat provided a rich source of energy in times of uncertain food supply. Nowadays, in rich countries where food is readily available and many people live sedentary lives, heart disease and other cholesterol-related problems are a major cause of premature death. People consequently worry about indulging in the pleasures of rich, fatty foods, even as they subject themselves to rigorous exercise routines to maintain their bodies and ease their guilt.
While this example of Mr. Tiger's thesis seems plausible enough, his eagerness to use biological determinism as an explanation for human behavior leads to some other highly questionable assertions. He argues that many contemporary Americans have chosen to live in suburbs, rather than in cities, because these "near rural" communities "are sensually more like the savanna in Africa in which we evolved and in which we developed the sensorium that appreciated a certain landscape, temperature, sense of place, access to potential resources, and scent and movement of air." He suggests that the color of the most popular prepared drinks -- the light brown of tea, coffee, colas, beer, whisky, brandy, rum and cocoa -- might reflect "a prehistoric enthusiasm for the liquid in small and precious bodies of water found in the sere tan savannas of our mother Africa." And he says modern man's penchant for travel and tourism "recaptures and reminds us of our ability to master interesting and unusual places to live," the ability of human beings to migrate nearly all over the world.
Such bizarre examples -- which selectively ignore whole sections of the population and their tastes -- make Mr. Tiger's thesis seem strained and precarious; in fact, much of this volume feels arbitrary in nature. Although Mr. Tiger goes on at great length about the conflict human beings feel between pleasure and austerity (Dionysus and Apollo), he ignores Freud's writings about the id and superego, ignores the psychology of desire. The question of the attempts by churches and governments to control people's private pleasures is raised but never explored in a rigorous manner. Instead Mr. Tiger simply states his own views: on one hand, he believes that drugs should not be legalized (he argues that "expanding the range of legal drugs available to consumers will also expand the market and the corps of victims"); on the other hand, he makes an impassioned argument for a sexuality unconstrained by old-fashioned morality.
His other suggestions for increasing the pleasure quotient in modern life tend to be obvious, sentimental or unrealistic. He exhorts people to take more pleasure in their work (something difficult for individuals trapped in dead-end, menial jobs), and encourages everyone to achieve a "daily celebration" by savoring the little things in life (like pulling the cork from a bottle of Champagne). He seems to feel that modern man perversely denies himself many of the pleasures to which he is entitled, and that "an emerging agenda of human rights must expand to include pleasure more explicitly than heretofore."
Such statements fail to take into account the more implacable facts of human existence like death, illness and poverty, and at a time when many people around the world are finding it difficult to make ends meet, they sound callous and Pollyanna-ish at the same time.

HEADLINE: Lost in Tokyo

 BODY:
Personal diplomacy is one of George Bush's great strengths as President. Car salesmanship obviously is not. His three-and-a-half-day visit to Japan, interrupted by a frightening bout of stomach flu, was a fiasco.
For domestic political reasons, Mr. Bush recast the goals of this trip from designing a new "global partnership" to demanding that the Japanese quickly lower import barriers to bring America "jobs, jobs, jobs." 
 Lowering protectionist barriers is a worthy exercise. But the President sometimes blurred the distinction between artificial barriers and legitimate consumer preferences. More fundamentally, he refused to recognize that America's current economic problems weren't made in Japan and cannot be cured there.
Not even the auto executives Mr. Bush brought along with him were much impressed with the "voluntary" import targets he persuaded the Japanese Government to extort in their behalf. And the agreement on coordinating the two countries' fiscal policies to speed global growth contained little new or specific.
The main thing lost in Tokyo was a chance to lay strong personal foundations for a more equitable relationship. Japan now possesses the world's second-largest and most dynamic economy. With the cold war no longer defining world politics, Washington and Tokyo urgently need to reapportion their contributions to international security and development.
Japan's new Prime Minister, Kiichi Miyazawa, was eager to cooperate with his old friend in the White House. But Mr. Bush unwisely asked him for high-profile concessions he had no power to deliver. And the President soft-pedaled important issues on which Mr. Miyazawa might have been able to offer constructive responses.
To take one obvious example, Japan has benefited mightily from the reduction of global trading barriers since World War II, negotiated mainly through the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Tokyo is now honor-bound to give other countries the same opportunity by helping to lower barriers in agriculture and services.
Instead, Japan continues to hold out against imports of foreign-grown rice, jeopardizing the nearly completed Uruguay Round trade talks. Japan's rice-growing lobby is small but powerful. There's reason to think Mr. Miyazawa would have been willing to risk some political capital by standing up to the rice farmers. Mr. Bush's focus on autos, however, gave him little incentive to try.
Mr. Bush also lost an opportunity to help shape Japan's plans to assume a more active international role. The Persian Gulf war last year dramatically underscored the imbalance between Japan the economic superpower and Japan the geopolitical featherweight. Tokyo contributed $13 billion to allied efforts, but avoided significant diplomatic or military involvement.
Secretary of State Baker recently made headlines in Tokyo by declaring that Japan owed the new international order more than just "checkbook diplomacy." Many Japanese agree, Prime Minister Miyazawa among them.
But there's sharp debate about what form Japan's new global role should take. Asian neighbors fear a return to the militarism of the 1930's and 1940's. The U.S. is well placed to help design an appropriate international division of labor.
As it turned out, the only Bush who gained anything from the trip was Barbara, who impressed Japanese and Americans alike with her extemporaneous good grace.

10 Choices, 10 Errors

BYLINE: By A. M. ROSENTHAL

 BODY:
One year ago next week George Bush took one of the most important, risk-filled and courageous steps ever ventured by a President of the United States -- to do battle against an aggressor who had not directly attacked the United States.
In the last half-century two other Presidents had gone to war against marauding dictatorships -- President Roosevelt against Japan and President Truman against North Korea. But in both cases American armed forces or a dependent ally had already been attacked. And at the time there were few who mounted protest. 
 President Bush welded together agreement from a country and Congress that had deep misgivings. He had to convince both that moving against a powerful dictatorship in support of a weak dictatorship was in this case worth risking the lives of American men and women. He had to make the country understand that the aggressor was armed not only with a potent arsenal but a concept and intent of combining military and political power into domination of a region essential to American interests.
He did. And five days after he ordered the beginning of the ground war it was all over, Saddam Hussein defeated. No leader stood higher in the esteem of the world and his countrymen than George Bush.
Then, at the moment of victory, began the slide -- that sad series of errors, misjudgments, switches and distancing from friendship and principle, around the world.
1. President Bush permitted Saddam Hussein to remain in power, his killer squads around him. If he was a Hitler, as Mr. Bush said, it was like permitting Hitler to remain in command of Germany -- also Goebbels, Goring, Himmler, the Nazi Party and the Wehrmacht high command.
2. President Bush permitted Saddam Hussein to use the substantial air and ground forces that the coalition left him. He used them well -- to drive hundreds of thousands of Kurds and other Iraqis who had trusted America into the cold and death of mountain refuge.
3. President Bush thought he could help Mikhail Gorbachev patch together a free-market economy within the Soviet system. That was like trying to marry a hedgehog and a garden snake. The man who was to say that was treated scornfully by the Bush Administration -- until he became President of Russia and handed Mr. Gorbachev his pension papers.
4. President Bush hedged on the American pledge of support to Baltic independence and stalled almost to the point of -- what's a more respectful word than betrayal?
5. President Bush in Kiev delivered a lecture on the dangers of independence when that was what Ukrainians and all other inmates of the Soviet system so plainly lusted for.
6. President Bush presides over the American Government while political leadership in Europe goes rapidly to Germany, and says not a word.
7. President Bush has made the free, democratic United States the main supporter of the Syrian dictator, discernible from the Iraqi variety only by the difference in mustaches.
8. President Bush weakens the Mideast peace talks. He permits the Administration to show stunning contempt for Israel by voting for viciously strong language denouncing the deportation of 12 Palestinians -- stronger than the condemnation of Iraq for conquering Kuwait.
What else does he have in mind for Israel to break its will and destroy the name of the nation the U.S. once called its only and cherished Mideast democratic ally? When was that -- yesterday?
9. President Bush clings to his peculiar taste for Chinese Communist leaders, using his power to block minimal Congressional economic steps to protest the brutality of the world's biggest gulag.
10. And now President Bush leads a sales pitch to Japan -- surely one of the most embarrassing expeditions in the history of either country. Great salesmanship: buy or else.
What happened to George Bush? Nothing much, I suspect. Time and again after the gulf fighting he had his choice between consistent democratic idealism, which from the Baltics to Beijing has proved itself the most powerful political instrument in the world, and opportunism -- which looks smart, for a minute, and then turns out to be too smart by half.
President Bush just made his choices for opportunism, is all. That's sad. But he did rise to the moment, that once a year ago.

HEADLINE: A Look at the City;
Call Me Juror

BYLINE: By LESLIE H. GELB

 BODY:
Two thousand two hundred twenty-four potential jurors trudged into the courthouses of lower Manhattan on Monday. I, armed with bagel and low expectations, was one of them.
There was no disappointment for those who expected filth in every room (part of the city's master plan to cut working hours without reducing costs), three armed guards dozing in each courtroom (part of the state's employment plan), and endless hours of waiting (a specialty of all governments). 
 For at least 12 of us, however, something extraordinary was in store as we entered the courtroom of Judge Michael Corriero of New York State's Supreme Court to hear The People v. a young man accused of selling cocaine to an undercover policeman. Called upon to sit in judgment, we were touched by that divine spark of common sense and decency.
But before partaking of that spark, we had to be selected -- which was harder than getting into Harvard. Of the 45 who sought admission, only 12, plus 3 alternates, could be accepted.
The judge, prosecutor and defense attorney took longer to pick the jury than to try the case. The process is termed "voir dire," French for speaking the truth. It should be called "oy vay," Yiddish for oh, pain.
The first batch of 16 prospects looked and sounded the same as the second and third batches -- and as the final jury. But with all three court officers exercising a veto, heads rolled. Those who said "I love New York" were dismissed, apparently on grounds of insanity. So were any who admitted ever having talked to a lawyer.
When the judge said "Tell me about yourself," life histories poured out, as if unplugged. One Wall Street type hanged himself by saying he worked for "a world-renowned economist." But a lady who tossed in that she had spent a year as an "intern at the Harvard School of Nutrition" passed muster. The prosecutor, a 24-year-old Asian-American, bounced all Asian-Americans. The defense attorney, who might have been Hispanic, cashiered the Hispanics.
Hope surged in me. I was going to get into Harvard -- I mean, on the jury.
My turn. Number 40. I was ready. "I'm a native New Yorker who left and returned and now lives on the West Side, who's never knowingly talked to a lawyer, who likes New York" (all the picked jurors actually loved New York, but had figured out the code), "who would be impartial and even Solomonic, but who never gets chosen for juries because I'm a journalist."
The court officers were on the defensive. The crowd was on my side. Oppressed journalist. Always rejected. But not this time.
The trial was on. The accused, a young Hispanic, did not speak English and required a translator. The Egyptian-born lab technician who testified that the powder allegedly sold to the undercover cop was cocaine didn't speak English very well, but loved to speak it. One detective did not know right from left.
The issue came down to the undercover cop's credibility. He had no "ghost" or "shadow" on the street with him the day of the arrest, so no one else saw the supposed sale. The 10-plus officers in the arresting-backup team apparently weren't qualified to be ghosts. The marked money was not found on the accused. The cops either forgot to take a picture of the accused at the station house right after the arrest, or lost it.
And so on.
Judge Corriero, a man of considerable civility and disciplined intelligence, spelled out the law with superb clarity and sensitivity, and sent us to deliberate.
Never in my life have I seen a group of people so attentive for two days. Never have I seen people put aside self-absorption so completely. Never more respect for one another -- the bus driver, the banker, the security guard, Nancy, Larry, Sabrina, Lauren, all.
To each, the accused was more important than any of us and all of us.
With pain, with doubt about sloppy police work but not with "reasonable doubt," we found the man who never looked at us guilty.
Our jury experience, I am told, was not unusual. Something in our government actually works. People can be called to public responsibility. For a fleeting moment, I couldn't help but feel that perhaps one day a political leader would summon that spark.

HEADLINE: Bush Returns, Hailing Gains in Japan Agreement

BYLINE: By MICHAEL WINES, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
From the moment President Bush stepped off Air Force One this morning, he and his advisers plunged into an effort to put an optimistic gloss on what automobile industry officials and Democratic Congressmen were calling a disastrous trade meeting with Japan's leaders.
In a speech at Andrews Air Force Base, Mr. Bush promised that his four-day visit to Japan would produce "clear and measurable" gains in American exports and the jobs they create. 
 But Mr. Bush's main claim, that the trip would create more jobs, was quickly overshadowed by the Government's announcement that unemployment rose to 7.1 percent in December, the highest rate in six years.
Mr. Bush's chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, said the figures were "not good news," and added, "That's why this trip was more important than ever."
Lee A. Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, was more blunt on the trip's importance. In an address today before Detroit's business elite, he unleashed his most vitriolic attack yet on Japan, and predicted that President Bush's trade mission would not budge the trade deficit or salve the auto industry's wounds.
And while the Japanese told the American delegation more boldly than ever that they should look within their own society for ways to revive a sagging industrial base, Mr. Iacocca would have none of that. "I for one am fed up hearing from the Japanese, and I might say some Americans, too, that all our problems in this industry, all our problems, are our own damn fault," he told a gathering of about 5,000 business executives at the Detroit Economic Club. "We do not have idiots running General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler, or our suppliers. And our workers are not lazy and stupid." [Page 33]
Earlier, speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One, Mr. Bush contended that the most visible fruits of his trip, a Japanese pledge to buy an additional $10 billion in American auto parts each year by 1995, would create 200,000 new jobs over that period.
The new unemployment data showed that the economy lost 300,000 jobs in December alone. With the 275,000 jobs lost in November, that makes a total of 2.3 million jobs that have vanished since the recession began in May 1990.
 
Bracing for Criticism
 As Mr. Bush returned, White House officials seemed to be bracing for a flood of criticism at home about their roles in a trip that sometimes had Mr. Bush looking more like a Chamber of Commerce official on an unsuccessful trade mission than a world leader.
Much of the criticism was directed at Mr. Bush's new re-election campaign chairman, Commerce Secretary Robert A. Mosbacher, and Mr. Skinner, who conceived or approved some of the most flawed aspects of the 12-day journey to Asia and Australia.
Chief among the charges was that Mr. Mosbacher, the departing Commerce Secretary, had erred by recruiting the heads of Detroit's three major auto makers to accompany Mr. Bush to Tokyo to press for Japanese concessions on automobile imports.
Auto-related goods comprise three-fourths of Japan's $41 billion annual trade surplus with the United States, and a primary goal of Mr. Bush's mission was to pry open Japan's domestic markets to American automobiles and and auto parts.
But the decision to bring Detroit executives was questioned on the first day of Mr. Bush's trip. For instance, The Wall Street Journal published a front-page article contrasting the seven-figure salaries and the miserable sales records of Detroit's auto executives with the smaller salaries and sparkling performance of their counterparts in Japan.
The Administration contends that Japan has employed that country's safety regulations, and technical specifications and restrictions on auto dealerships to keep out American cars. But many auto industry experts say American cars sell poorly in Japan because they are less well made than those of Japan and are not designed for the needs of Japanese drivers.
As Mr. Bush moved majestically through Australia and Southeast Asia, accounts piled up of the Detroit executives' efforts to restrict Japanese auto sales in the United States, and their refusal to make even the most obvious changes -- like moving the steering wheel from the left side to the right -- to make their cars more appealing to Japanese drivers.
By the time Mr. Bush reached Tokyo, the auto makers' salaries and the design and quality of their cars had long supplanted Japan's trade practices as the focus of debate in Tokyo.
 
'Careful of Company'
 "The lesson here," a Republican strategist said, "is that you've got to be careful of the company you keep."
Mr. Skinner and the President's political advisers were faulted by others for recasting the theme of the President's Pacific trip along political lines, scuttling its diplomatic aspects in favor of the one issue that could threaten Mr. Bush's re-election chances: "jobs, jobs, jobs."
The object was to quiet Democratic criticism that Mr. Bush was neglecting the economy in concentrating on foreign affairs. But the effect was to make the President look like a salesman, not a statesman, and to deeply offend Japanese leaders. They saw Mr. Mosbacher and Mr. Bush effectively blame them for the recession and unemployment woes in the United States only days before the trade mission began.
"The themes just didn't sell," a Republican Congressional strategist said. "The whole rearrangement was for political reasons, and it was transparent, and it didn't work."
Mr. Skinner said he was "concerned" about negative accounts of Mr. Bush's trip, the first major international undertaking since he took over as chief of staff. At Andrews today he tried to persuade reporters that they were holding Mr. Bush's trade mission to unrealistically high standards of success. But the President himself said the trip had accelerated the opening of Japan's markets to American exports.
Mr. Skinner said in an interview this evening that news organizations' "overcoverage" of the Detroit executives had overshadowed the 15 other executives on the trip, most of whom had high praise for its accomplishments. "I do think we got some significant commitments on auto parts, and that got overshadowed too," he said. Mr. Skinner also said he believed most Americans saw Mr. Bush's journey as a sincere effort to help American industry and the economy. But he agreed that American concerns must improve their quality if they are to triumph in Japan's competitive markets.
"It's obvious that if we get access to a market, we're going to have to make products that meet the market needs," he said. "That's why we've made progress on paper, on purchases by their government of computers, and on glass" -- three areas where Japan agreed this week to allow more competition from American-made goods.
Even so, he said, "This is a long-term effort; it's not a short-term effort."
Yet other Republican political strategists said today that from a political standpoint, that is precisely why Mr. Bush's trip should never have been cast as a political event. The new unemployment figures, they said, underscore the fact that whatever successes Mr. Bush scored in Tokyo this week, they will be too meager and too slow in arriving to help the President in his re-election campaign.
On Capitol Hill, Democrats pointed out on the juxtaposition of the mixed success of Mr. Bush's trade mission and the rise in unemployment.
"The surge in unemployment shows why the President cannot pose for photo-opportunities with the Japanese and cut the capital gains tax for the rich if he wants to get the economy moving again," said Representative Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri, the House majority leader.
By contrast, Republicans on Capitol Hill were largely silent about Mr. Bush's Japan visit.
"The feeling up here," said an adviser to a leading Republican Senator, who spoke on condition of anonymity, "is that this is best put behind us."

HEADLINE: New Jersey Fair-Housing Plan Goes Awry

BYLINE: By CHARLES STRUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERKELEY HEIGHTS, N.J., Jan. 10

 BODY:
A bright idea flashed through this woodsy suburb in the Watchung Mountains four years ago, promising significant relief from the state-imposed obligation to provide affordable housing for low- and moderate-income people.
With the prospect of being forced to rezone a 50-acre tract for such housing, leaders of the Township Committee approached the property owner, a well-known developer in Union County, with what seemed to be a mutually beneficial deal.
 
Exporting Fair Housing
 The Township Committee would approve an office park with two 10-story towers, two five-story parking garages and a helicopter pad, changing the zoning to allow the larger project. In return, the developer would pick up the cost of half the township's obligation under the Mount Laurel housing doctrine: $3.8 million for 129 units. The money would be paid to Berkeley Heights, then transferred to Newark under a legal but much criticized arrangement that permits suburbs to export part of their "fair share" housing mandate to depressed urban areas. 
 That was more than two years ago. On Dec. 30, after 32 hearings, the Planning Board approved the project, but with conditions that the developer, Connell Realty and Development Company of Westfield, found onerous and costly. Exasperated, Connell accused the township of reneging on the deal and demanded a refund with interest: $4.6 million. The developer has set Monday as the deadline.
But repayment, if it happens, will not be easy. The money has been paid to Newark, and Newark has spent it to repair 39 apartments and build 90 three-bedroom town houses.
"I don't believe they have a leg to stand on," said Mayor John G. Regit, referring to Connell's complaints. But Mr. Regit, who became Mayor two weeks ago, said the Connell dispute had caused some hard feelings around town, with allegations that the original agreement failed to receive sufficient public hearing. As a result, he said, his adminstration would "go back to the people" with special Saturday meetings at the town hall.
 
Not One Housing Unit
 The outcome of what both sides say is certain to become a court battle is far from clear. But the demand for a refund marks a new phase in the struggle of this town of 11,000 to comply with a housing mandate that has affected all of New Jersey's 567 communities and for which there is little public enthusiasm.
In the five years since a lawsuit forced Berkeley Heights to confront rezoning for low-income housing, the township's political life has been dominated by Mount Laurel concerns. The doctrine, named after the Burlington County township that was the defendant in several major fair-housing cases, forbids municipalities to use their zoning laws to block low- and moderate-income housing. Control of the Township Committee has flip-flopped several times since 1988, with Mount Laurel, Connell and related zoning and development matters as the major campaign issues. But still not one unit of affordable housing has been built here. The recession makes it unlikely that any will be built soon.
"We acted very diligently to provide site plan reviews for all the developers so they could get started on it," said Eugene Allen, the Planning Board chairman. "But the simple fact is that because of the economic conditions, there's no market for this type of speculative housing."
Through the regional contribution agreement with Newark and by the act of rezoning, Berkeley Heights has met its legal obligation under Mount Laurel, as have other communities. But the relatively modest number of new or rehabilitated housing units generated under Mount Laurel is troubling to those who oversee the program, and they say it is hardly unique to Berkeley Heights.
According to the Council on Affordable Housing, an agency set up in 1987 to enforce the Mount Laurel doctrine and its later amendments, well over 200 communities have approved plans for low- and moderate-income housing. The council's goal is 145,707 units by 1993, said Douglas V. Opalski, the council's executive director, but realistically, he said, the most the market could have accommodated since 1987 was about 25,000 new units, and perhaps a quarter of that has been built.
 
Millions Spent on Park
 So far there has been no formal response from Berkeley Heights to the demand for a refund, said Robert Spalteholz, vice president of Connell Realty. He said Connell had already spent $3 million on plans for the office park, the former site of a geriatric center, which Connell bought from Union County for $13.5 million in 1985.
Connell's lawyer, Dean Gaver, of the firm of Hannoch Weisman in Roseland, said the issue for his client was fairly simple. Connell, he said, signed an agreement to help finance the township's Mount Laurel housing, and in return the town was obligated to accept Connell's plan for the office towers, the garages and the helipad. Connell also agreed to some road improvements to allow 3,700 more cars a day on one of the township's main avenues, Plainfield Avenue.
"In fact," he said, "the Planning Board asked for major improvements to ramps off I-78 and the redesign of an overpass entrance to the park. The developer's agreement contemplated no such thing.
"They came to us and said, 'Would you be willing to advance these moneys under certain terms and conditions?' and we would file an application. We never said the Planning Board couldn't carry out its function. But the agreement was approval without conditions, or else we get the money back."
Mr. Gaver said that while the dispute had held up the project, Connell could conceivably follow through on it, perhaps even with the improvements. But not without a refund first.
The town's lawyer, Donald T. DiFrancesco, a Union County Republican who is the incoming State Senate President, said: "It's obviously going to be litigated. It's an unreasonable request, after all. Even to collect that much woney would take some time."
"They gave us the money; we changed the zoning," Mr. DiFrancesco said. "They participated in the site plan process. If his position is correct, why did he participate?"

HEADLINE: U.S. UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASES TO 7.1%, WORST IN 5 1/2 YEARS

BYLINE: By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The nation's unemployment rate climbed to a five-and-a-half-year high of 7.1 percent in December, with the bulk of the rise occurring among people discharged from their latest job with little prospect of recall, the Labor Department reported today.
Long-term unemployment also rose substantially as the ranks of those out of work swelled by 289,000, to 8.9 million, the highest in nearly eight years. 
 As discouraging as much of the report was, however, many private analysts said it did not point to significant fresh deterioration in the economy last month but mainly reflected a continued lack of growth.
"What it tells you is that the economy is stagnant," said Neal M. Soss, chief economist for the First Boston Corporation. "There's no sense of improvement."
 
Some Bright Spots
 One relative bright spot in the report was a modest but unexpected rise in payrolls, which grew 31,000 after being expected to shrink by more than twice that amount. All of the gain, however, was in government rather than private payrolls, which would more accurately reflect economic conditions.
Other pluses were a slight increase in the length of the average workweek, an increase in the proportion of industries adding workers rather than shedding them and a rise in the index of production working hours.
Over all, today's figures appear to have reduced pressure on the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further, or at least not to have intensified the Fed's concern. In fact, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Fed, told Congress this afternoon that he expected the steep cut in interest rates the Fed ordered last month to be sufficient to get an economic recovery started and that he did not foresee a need for further rate cuts or for budgetary stimulus. [Page 33.]
 
Democrats Ask Action
 President Bush, returning from his business-oriented trip to the Far East, called the December results disappointing, and Congressional Democrats pounced on the report to assert Administration mismanagement.
"It is alarming that joblessness is still rising so sharply in the second year of this Republican recession," said Richard A. Gephardt, Democrat of Missouri, the House majority leader. "The surge in unemployment shows why the President cannot pose for photo opportunities with the Japanese and cut the capital gains tax for the rich if he wants to get the economy moving again. We need a far-reaching program to revive the economy and help middle-income Americans."
Representative David R. Obey, a Democrat from Wisconsin, said the higher jobless rate showed that extended unemployment benefits should continue at least until autumn.
Today's was the first monthly labor-market tally taken since enactment of legislation under which benefits for about 3.1 million people who have exhausted them since last March have been extended for up to 20 weeks. Normally, the jobless are covered for no more than 26 weeks.
Thomas J. Plewes, an associate Labor Department commissioner, said he could find no visible effect, such as an increase in workers re-entering the work force or a decline in so-called discouraged workers, that could be traced to the extension. Although extending benefits may reduce pressure on the jobless to find a job, the existence of the benefits acts as a lure for people to collect them, which requires statements that one is looking for work. Those who are not searching for work are not counted as unemployed.
The new job hunters increased the labor force by 245,000 in December, while 44,000 workers lost their jobs or quit, raising the ranks of the unemployed by 289,000. At 8,891,000, the jobless total is the highest since January 1984, when it was 9,008,000.
Before last month, the unemployment rate had held at about 6.8 percent from May through September before edging up to a revised 6.9 percent in October and November. Various indicators show that a recovery from the recession that began in July 1990 has now stalled, despite rising gross domestic output for both the second and third quarters of 1991.
 
Number Out of Work
 Since the onset of the recession, the jobless rate has increased 1.7 points and the number of people out of work has risen by 2.1 million.
The December increase in the unemployment rate was the first clear rise since May, since changes of one-tenth of a percent are considered statistically insignificant.
As part of the usual annual recalculation at this time of year, November's rate was revised up to 6.9 percent from the 6.8 percent initially reported. The rates for September and October were also raised one-tenth of a point but there were offsetting one-tenth-point declines for March, May and June.
The number of people who were laid off or discharged from their last jobs -- as opposed to having quit them -- rose nearly 300,000 in December, to 4,990,000, the report showed. Layoffs accounted for only 20 percent of these. Those who left jobs voluntarily fell to 913,000 from 987,000.
Last month, 56.2 percent of idled workers were job "losers," compared with 50.4 percent a year earlier.
 
'Some Stabilization'
 The number of people jobless more than six months rose by 148,000, to 1,471,000, while the average duration of jobless spells rose to 15.3 weeks from 14.9 weeks. But the proportion -- though not the total -- of people out of work five weeks or less shrank to 37.1 percent, contracting for the fourth straight month.
This, according to Michael P. Niemira, economist at the Mitsubishi Bank, indicates that while it may be hard to find work quickly, "there appears to be some stabilization in the labor markets."
 
Ohio's Big Rise
 Geographically, Ohio had the worst performance of the 11 biggest states last month, its jobless rate rising to 6.6 percent from 5.6. The rate for Illinois rose to 9.3 percent from 8.5. New York and New Jersey had insignificant increases. New York rose to 8.1 percent from 8 percent and New Jersey increased to 7.4 percent from 7.1 percent.
Regionally, unadjusted figures showed the Northeast had the highest rate, at 7.4 percent, while the Midwest had the lowest, at 6.5 percent.
The 31,000-job increase uncovered by the payroll survey of workers fell far short of making up for November's 265,000 loss -- a revision that was worse than the initially reported 241,000 loss -- and was mainly the result of a probably unsustainable increase for local governments, many of which are experiencing severe budget problems.
Factory jobs dropped 32,000 last month after falling 39,000 in November while construction rebounded 13,000 from a weather-related dive in November. Retail trade lost a modest 16,000 -- after two months of decline totaling 140,000 -- but health services, one of the few robust fields, added an additional 45,000 jobs last month.
 
Fewer Holiday Jobs
 Retailers hired less than half as many holiday employees this season as in the preceding decade, William G. Barron Jr., Acting Commissioner of Labor Statistics, told the Joint Economic Committee. Afterward, he described the current overall state of the labor market as "flat."
The transportation sector lost 13,000 jobs last month, mainly because of the shutdown of two airlines -- Pan American and Midway, the Labor Department reported.
The length of the workweek rose six minutes both over all (to 34.5 hours) and in factories (to 41.1). Factory overtime also rose by that amount.
The index of aggregate production hours -- a proxy for industrial production to be reported next Friday -- rose to 121.7 from 121.4, while the proportion of industries expanding payrolls rose to 47.2 from 44.5.

HEADLINE: To the Presidential Hopefuls, The Middle Class Is Royalty

BYLINE: By ROBIN TONER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The vast group of voters known as "middle-class America" is about to be courted with a vengeance as the 1992 Presidential campaign gets under way.
Both parties are trying to calibrate their language, their policy proposals and their messages to show their concern for the middle-income American with a family, a house in the suburbs, a sense of economic alarm and a feeling that the politicians don't care. 
 To be sure, the invocation of "middle-class values" and economic concerns is a standard feature of political campaigns; to paraphrase Willie Sutton's explanation of why he robbed banks, that is where the votes are. What is striking this year is the recognition, in both parties, that these voters feel an especially sharp sense of betrayal and anger.
 
Scramble Among Democrats
 Four years ago, strategists for Michael S. Dukakis, the Democratic nominee, had to struggle to make the case for "a middle-class squeeze." The candidate hit that theme consistently only in the final weeks of the campaign, with the slogan, "We're on your side."
Today, as the recession drags on, the plight of "the middle class," a loosely defined term based partly on income and partly on attitudes, is the starting point for the Presidential campaign. And Democrats are campaigning for that support far more relentlessly and explicitly than they did in 1988.
The five major candidates for the Democratic nomination are scrambling to cast themselves as the candidates best able to restore the American dream to "the forgotten middle class," as Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas describes it in his new television commercial in New Hampshire.
The Democratic candidates are talking about national health care plans, tax cuts for the mid-income group, expanded college loan programs and a host of other measures aimed at a broad swath of people squeezed by the recession.
For his part, President Bush is apparently preparing a new budget that will offer tax credits to help people buy health insurance, tax benefits for first-time home buyers and a flurry of other measures aimed at showing his concern for working families.
Republican strategists say they will not make the mistakes their party made in losing last year's Pennsylvania Senate race, when the Democrats hammered at the health care issue, a principal concern of many voters, and the Republicans responded only in the final days.
Many Republicans say it would be dangerous for the White House to look disengaged on such issues in this campaign.
"Bush has a long way to go here domestically, and step one is to reconnect, to show that he understands reality here at home, to let people know that he's aware of what they're going through," said one Republican strategist close to the Bush campaign organization.
 
Other Issues Seen
 Still, that strategist argued: "If you look at the middle class as just this monolithic group driven by economic self-interest, I think that's wrong. And I think that's what the Democrats are doing right now, and I think they'll get blind-sided by a whole set of values and other issues that will appeal to these voters."
Many strategists shy away from defining the term middle class, noting that income guidelines fail to take into account such variables as the number of children in a family or the local cost of living. Moreover, part of the political magic of the term is that most Americans, black and white, consider themselves part of the middle class, according to some public opinion polls.
But Paul Tully, political director of the Democratic National Committee, speaks of a critical middle-class voter as a suburbanite, in a household with about $35,000 income, younger than 45, with a child or two, and in a marriage in which both partners work. James Carville, a Democratic strategist working for Mr. Clinton and an architect of the Democratic victory in Pennsylvania, talks of a "32-year-old with two kids in day care who works in some suburban office building."
Robert D. Reischauer, head of the Congressional Budget Office, views the middle class as the middle 60 percent of Americans by income, which for a family of four would be from $19,000 to $78,000. He adds, however, that attitudes can be as telling as income: "Most people think of the life style they can afford, the amount of discretionary income."
 
Baggage to Unload
 In this struggle for the middle-income voter, each party has some baggage to unload. The Republicans have to fight the perception that they care most about the rich; the Democrats have to make the case that they are ready to lead again, and counter a decade of charges that they are addicted to big-spending Government programs and care most about the poor.
In 1984, when the Democratic nominee, Walter F. Mondale, campaigned for "fairness," many middle-income voters heard it as a plea for the poor, not for them, says Stan Greenberg, a poll taker for Mr. Clinton.
Today, some poll takers say, the middle class feels neglected by the entire system.
"Probably the single biggest point of consensus among voters today is that the middle class is ignored by the political system and paying a steep economic price for it," said Geoffrey Garin, a Democratic poll taker. Some Democratic strategists assert that this anger results from a fundamental reassessment of the Reagan years, about who prospered and who did not. As a result, they argue, the anger will outlive the recession.
 
'Something Wrong'
 "Even if we have 3 percent economic growth by Election Day, I still think the right Democrat with the right economic message can win," says Mr. Carville. "I think people understand there is something wrong with Republican leadership that goes beyond expansions and contractions."
Robert M. Teeter, the campaign chairman for Mr. Bush, says that middle-class voters will not simply respond to a laundry list of Government programs. "The reason we've done well with the middle class over the past 10 years is we've been for the things that helped them, whether it's on tax policies, family values or national security. We've been closer to them than the Democrats have, and I don't think that's changed."
Still, many Democratic strategists say they have learned from their mistakes in the 1980's, when middle-class voters defected in droves as Republicans portrayed the Democrats, again and again, as a party outside the American mainstream. Values were an important part of the Republicans' appeal to middle-income voters, many strategists say. This year, in addition to their economic promises, the Democratic candidates talk often of their party's commitment to the traditional values of hard work, personal responsibility and patriotism.
 
Small-Town Roots
 Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa, for example, talks of his small-town roots and the values it gave him; Senator Bob Kerrey of Nebraska talks of the yearning of parents that their children surpass them. Mr. Clinton talks of the need for greater personal responsibility in welfare programs and corporate suites.
From a policy perspective, the Democrats are focusing on issues with similarly broad constituencies: better schools, affordable health care, middle-income tax cuts.
"A lot of Democratic policy thinking used to be directed toward lower-income people," said Mr. Garin. "Now, there's a recognition that we've got to be fighting for the middle-class people who are the backbone of the country and the heart of the electorate."
Tim Raftis, campaign manager for Mr. Harkin, says: "The Democrats need to do a much better job, and I think in this campaign they have, in communicating and talking to the ordinary concerns of working people. Most people have a deep and abiding concern for the homeless and the less fortunate in our society, but it's hard to lend a helping hand when your own footing is pretty slippery."
Many Democrats see this new middle-class politics as a striking change in their party. Mr. Greenberg said he used to encounter resistance from some of his fellow Democrats about explicit appeals to the middle class; they worried, Mr. Greenberg said, that it might seem to exclude the poor or lower-income groups. "But it's an inclusive concept," the poll taker said.
Still, Mr. Teeter asserts that the Democrats may be congratulating themselves too soon. "They can get up and say middle class four times in each paragraph, but if they enunciate policies that the middle class don't think will help them, it won't do any good."
Mr. Teeter argued that the middle class still worries about Government spending and still has doubts about the effectiveness of using Federal programs to solve many of the nation's problems, two concerns that hampered the Democrats throughout the 1980's.

HEADLINE: For Nonviolent Legacy, A Violent Rap Message

BYLINE: By SETH MYDANS, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: PHOENIX, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Portraying violence against the only state not to honor the nonviolent legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. or civil rights, a rap music video has aroused anger and fascination here.
Depicting the assassination of local politicians, the video, "By the Time I Get to Arizona," by the rap group Public Enemy, has been played repeatedly on news programs here. Discussion of the video has appeared on the front pages and editorial columns of Arizona newspapers and on radio talk shows. 
 A spokesman for Grant Woods, the State Attorney General, said that the state would take no legal action and that the rappers have a right to express their views, no matter how repugnant.
 
Music as Shock Treatment
 The video's debut this week on MTV is the latest instance in which violent words or images in rap music have shocked audiences outside the culture of hip-hop music.
Momentarily, the video has united most Arizonans, who rejected the holiday in a vote last year and remain sharply divided over the issue, which will be on the ballot again in November.
The national holiday, the third Monday in January, will fall on Jan. 20 this year and will be observed in every state except New Hampshire and Arizona. New Hampshire will hold a civil rights holiday, but it is a "floating" day, and the measure creating the holiday does not mention Dr. King.
The Rev. Warren Stewart, a leading black campaigner for adoption of the King holiday, said Public Enemy's violent message "does a disservice to the legacy of Dr. King."
 
Comment by Ex-Governor
 Mr. Stewart's view was echoed by Evan Mecham, the former Governor who canceled a plan for a statewide holiday in 1987 before he was impeached on charges of corruption. "It sounds like someone trying to make money with trash," he said.
The video depicts the group's lead singer, Chuck D., leading a paramilitary charge, and ends with an actor portraying an Arizona senator dying from poisoned candy and another portraying an Arizona governor being killed by a car bomb.
These scenes are interspersed with depictions of civil rights marches and re-enactments of the assassination of Dr. King, who was slain in Memphis on April 4, 1968.
The song is part of an album entitled "Apocalypse 91: The Enemy Strikes Black," which is one of five nominees for a Grammy Award for best rap performance by a duo or group. The album was released last November, but its video had its first nationwide showing this week.
 
'Respect to the Black Fist'
 Violent rap lyrics most recently drew a shocked reaction in Los Angeles late last year in the song "Death Certificate," by the rapper Ice Cube, which threatens violence against Korean shopkeepers. "Pay respect to the black fist or we'll burn your store right down to a crisp," the song says.
In October 1990, the rap group 2-Live Crew was acquitted of an obscenity charge in a Florida court for music that contained images of violent sexual behavior. But in a separate trial the same month, a video store owner who sold their album was convicted of selling obscene material.
While its video images are strong, the lyrics of the Arizona rap song are vague and generally unremarkable. The strongest lines are:
Call me the trigger man
Looki-lookin' for the governor.
Another line goes:
I'm on the one mission
To get a politician.
At one point Chuck D. asks:
What's a smilin' face
When the whole state's racist?
At a news conference in New York earlier this week Chuck D. defended his composition, saying: "It's a trip into the fantasy world of Public Enemy. You know, the big payback."
 
It's Chuck D.'s Version
 In a telephone interview the group's publicist, Ursula Smith, said: "What Chuck D. was trying to get across was that Martin Luther King did not just die; he was brutally murdered. Public Enemy is saying, 'This is how it looks on the other foot.' "
She added: "Oliver Stone has his version in 'J.F.K.' Now Chuck D. has added his movie about Martin Luther King. And what his movie is saying is, if Martin Luther King could see himself after his assassination, he would have had a different view."
Or, as Chuck D. puts it in his song, referring to today's politicians:
He try to keep it yesteryear,
The good ol' days,
The same ol' ways
That keep us dyin' --
Yes, you-me-myself, and indeed
What he need is a nosebleed.
Ms. Smith said that like the director Oliver Stone, Chuck D. was intent on educating audiences that remained largely ignorant of essential moments in history. She said his music is just one part of his "black awareness program" in which he visits high schools to talk about black issues.
Dr. King's widow, Coretta Scott King, said in Atlanta today that she had not seen the video, but added, "We do not subscribe to violence as a way to achieve any social or economic ends; we condemn violence in any form."
Long before Public Enemy's attack, Arizona has felt an economic and political backlash over its failure to adopt a statewide holiday honoring Dr. King.
The state has lost millions of dollars in canceled conventions, and lost both financially and in prestige last year when the National Football League canceled plans to hold the 1993 Superbowl in Phoenix.
Moreover, the shock aroused here by Public Enemy's message illustrates the gulf between the harsh world that has nurtured the rappers and the political establishment of this desert state.
Douglas Cole, a spokesman for Gov. Fife Symington, called the video "repugnant" and "extremely misinformed," noting that the Governor favors a King holiday.
And Mayor Paul Johnson of Phoenix, which will honor Dr. King with a cityholiday this month, said, "The violence in the video is contrary to everything Dr. King lived for and died for."
Mr. Stewart tried to find something positive in the video, saying, "The message is unfortunate, but it put the issue back on the front pages."
But few Arizonans seemed impressed by that notion. John Mathews, a 21-year-old college student, said the video amounted to "the wrong kind of pressure" and might even backfire in its effect on voters.
The Arizona Republic defended the state in an editorial that said: "No matter what view of Dr. King the Arizona public might take, there can be no doubt that his message was always one of peace and nonviolence. However, the message sent by the rappers is one of political bigotry, ignorance and hatred."

HEADLINE: In Spite of Hardship, I.M.F. Urges Russia To Raise Price of Oil

BYLINE: By LOUIS UCHITELLE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MOSCOW, Jan. 10

 BODY:
After a week of rising consumer prices and sporadic protests from angry shoppers, a team from the International Monetary Fund, acting with the endorsement of the United States, is pressing Russia for drastic additional steps, chief among them a sharp increase in oil prices.
The I.M.F. wants President Boris N. Yeltsin of Russia, where most of the commonwealth's oil is produced, to raise petroleum prices to 10 to 15 times their present level, and they have already quadrupled in the last week. 
 Such a rise would increase gasoline and heating-oil supplies by pricing them beyond the reach of many people -- a measure not tried in the old Soviet Union. Russians now pay the equivalent of 4 cents a gallon for gasoline.
 
Why Raise Prices?
 The I.M.F. insists that higher oil prices would increase the revenues of the Russian Government, helping to balance the budget and thus increase the value of the ruble, an I.M.F. goal. And with higher prices reducing consumption at home, more oil would be available for export, thus earning Russia hard currency to repay $65 billion in foreign debt, another I.M.F. goal.
The I.M.F., whose policies usually represent the views of the Western industrial powers, is also pressing the members of the Commonwealth of Independent States to accept Russia's ruble as their common currency.
The new pressure in effect undercuts Ukraine's move to create its own currency, and it gives Mr. Yeltsin a Western stamp of approval as the leader in shaping economic policy for the entire commonwealth.
"We are agnostic on the issue of separate national currencies, but establishing them is like a divorce," said an I.M.F. official who spoke on condition of anonymity. "If people build something together, separation destroys that something and reduces the energy level."
The unfolding Western approach to resolving the commonwealth's economic crisis was evident in interviews this week with officials of the Bush Administration, Mr. Yeltsin's Government and the I.M.F.
 
A Week of Talks
 An eight-member I.M.F. team, the first to visit since the Soviet Union was dissolved last month, arrived on Tuesday night for a week of negotiations with Yegor T. Gaidar, Mr. Yeltsin's top economic adviser.
The I.M.F., established after World War II, serves the industrial nations as their arbiter of which nations are creditworthy, and deserving of foreign loans and investment, both now sought by the former Soviet republics.
Various republics are applying for I.M.F. membership. The Bush Administration recently endorsed membership for Russia and five other former Soviet republics, and said it was prepared to support applications by the rest. But even before the republics' formal entry, probably later this year, the I.M.F. is maneuvering to influence their economic policies, an influence exercised this week to press the Yeltsin Government to raise oil prices and also to cut Government spending, which would reduce employment and social programs in the process.
The Yeltsin team says oil prices will be raised again, but right now Mr. Yeltsin is holding out for a $6 billion stabilization fund, a sum he has formally requested from the industrial nations. Among other things, the money would pay for consumer imports to ease tensions.
"We want to go forward with the I.M.F. program and we will go forward, even without the stabilization fund," said Konstantin Kagalovsky, a Gaidar deputy leading the negotiations with the I.M.F. team. "But the program might not succeed without the money."
Robert S. Strauss, the United States Ambassador to Moscow, favors the stabilization fund, and also the I.M.F.'s various demands, including higher oil prices, but with the caveat that public unrest might change the strategy.
"What is happening here is all too new," Mr. Strauss said. "There is no model, no precedent for this kind of program in a country like this. But if you don't get me too specific, there is a general consensus that we need to do various things."
 
Pennies Per Barrel
 Above all, the West is pressuring the Russian Government, which owns and supplies 90 percent of the oil consumed in the commonwealth, to stop selling it under a huge subsidy at the equivalent of less than 70 cents a barrel in American currency, even after the fourfold price increase in the last week.
That makes the pump price of a gallon of gasoline about 5 rubles, or 4 cents in United States currency, up from one ruble, or about one cent, a week ago. Gasoline in the United States, by comparison, averages more than $1 a gallon at the pump, and the world price of crude oil is more than $18 a barrel.
Moving oil toward world price levels, I.M.F. officials acknowledge, would be a blow to thousands of commuters and truckers. Millions of families get a break on heating oil, but I.M.F. officials argue that once heating-oil prices rise, the various republic governments could provide subsidies for those most in need, rather than the entire population.

The Economy
The U.S. unemployment rate climbed to a 5 1/2-year high of 7.1 percent in December, with the bulk of the rise among people discharged from their latest job with little prospect of recall, the Labor Dept. said. Long-term unemployment also rose substantially as the ranks of those out of work swelled by 289,000, to 8.9 million, the highest in nearly eight years. As discouraging as much of the report was, many private analysts said it did not point to significant fresh deterioration in the economy last month, but mainly reflected a continued lack of growth. [Page 1.] 
 Greenspan told Congress that he expected the steep cut in interest rates the Fed ordered last month to be sufficient to get an economic recovery started and that he did not foresee a need for further rate cuts or for budgetary stimulus. [33.]
 
International
On his return, President Bush tried to put an optimistic gloss on what critics called a disastrous trade meeting with Japan's leaders. [1.]
Lee Iacocca unleashed his most vitriolic attack yet on Japan, predicting that Bush's trade mission wouldn't budge the trade deficit or salve Detroit's wounds. But other executives said that although the trip may eventually help narrow the trade gap, Bush focused too much on the auto industry's relations with Japan. [33.]
A trade agreement reached during Bush's trip could result in as much as $2 billion a year in extra sales of American computers in Japan. [33.]
A Chinese negotiating team made a new proposal as a final round of talks began on patents, copyrights and trademarks, but a U.S. official said the proposal did not go far enough. [33.]

HEADLINE: Kohl Seeks to Fend Off Criticism Of His Assertive German Policies

BYLINE: By JOHN TAGLIABUE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: BERLIN, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Chancellor Helmut Kohl sought today to defuse accusations of a fresh assertiveness on the part of reunited Germany, arguing that Germany is now a nation of 80 million in the heart of Europe and its leading economic power, and has had to shoulder fresh responsibilities, particularly toward its neighbors in Eastern Europe.
He also dismissed suggestions that Bonn would seek changes in the United Nations structure allowing it a permanent Security Council seat. 
 The remarks come at a time of growing disquiet over the assertive style of German policy. On Tuesday, Mr. Kohl's close European ally, President Francois Mitterrand of France, chided Germany for offending the spirit of European unity by its vigorous support in December of recognition for Slovenia and Croatia, the breakaway Yugoslav republics, and by raising interest rates in a display of financial power and political independence that put pressure on Britain, France and Italy. American officials have expressed similar distress.
 
Disarming Critics
 Since Germany reunified in October 1990, Mr. Kohl has been at pains to emphasize Germany's continued commitment to its Atlantic allies and to deepening European economic and political unity. But the Chancellor declared that the "new Germany" could not overlook that it "plays a strong part in the fate of others."
But in seeking to disarm his critics, Mr. Kohl at times appeared to display the kind of righteousness that has prompted the criticism of Germany in the first place.
At a news conference in Bonn that addressed the full range of domestic and foreign policy isues, Mr. Kohl cited Germany's financial and humanitarian aid for Eastern European countries, most notably the old Soviet Union, and suggested that that newly expanded role stemmed from reunited Germany's size and its position as "No. 1 in Europe in economic might."
Mr. Kohl, who shows himself to be unusually unflappable in the face of outside criticism, has found himself nonetheless drawn into the debate. Showing no sign of irritation, he has sought to disarm critics by insisting that Germany's energies will be exhausted for the near future with the task of rebuilding its eastern territories and assisting the battered economies of its newly democratic neighbors to the east.
 
Security Council Seat
 Mr. Kohl vowed to press for changes in Germany's Constitution allowing its defense forces to take part in United Nations peacekeeping missions, a step that is opposed by the Social Democrats. But he dismissed suggestions that Bonn would seek a Security Council seat.
"We have enough to do at home," he said.
A close aide to Mr. Kohl, noting the absence of public debate on the issue in Germany, said Bonn was satisfied that Britain and France, who are permanent Security Council members, adequately represented European interests.
"If a seat did come free, we would be in favor of it going to the European Community," he said.

Layoffs Are Seen For Chevron Unit

 BODY:
A union official said Chevron U.S.A. was considering laying off hundreds of workers at the local refinery because of the recession. "If we don't have a layoff, it's going to be a miracle," Keith Guidry, vice chairman of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers' workmen's committee, said. 
 Chevron officials in Houston did not immediately return a telephone call seeking comment. But published reports said Chevron was looking at all operations as it worked to become more efficient and meet tougher environmental standards. Mr. Guidry said it would be at least two months before any layoffs since the union had an agreement with management for a 60-day notice.

HEADLINE: In the End, Wilder Realized The Numbers All Fell Short

BYLINE: By B. DRUMMOND AYRES Jr., Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: RICHMOND, Jan. 10

 BODY:
As is almost always the case in failed Presidential campaigns, in the end the numbers were not there for Gov. L. Douglas Wilder of Virginia.
He did not have enough money. His staff was too small. And worst of all for a politician, he did not have enough votes. 
 So on Wednesday night, more than a month before votes are cast in New Hampshire, in the first primary of the 1992 Presidential election season, he cut his losses and became the first candidate to drop out of the Democratic field. The five remaining contestants were left to scramble for the pivotal black vote that Mr. Wilder had unsuccessfully tried to lock up.
 
Unaccustomed to Defeat
 Never before in more than 20 years of politics had Mr. Wilder suffered a campaign defeat. True, it was not a defeat at the polls for this descendant of slaves, who was born in segregation and poverty on Richmond's Church Hill and rose to become the first black ever elected governor of one of the states. But it was the next closest thing to defeat at the polls.
In his surprising retreat from the fray, Mr. Wilder, normally the most combative and unyielding of politicians, said he did not have the time to run for President and also to run the State of Virginia, which is struggling with the worst economic recession in more than half a century.
"He had to face that hard fact," Edward Elson, an Atlanta businessman who was the Governor's chief fund-raiser, said Thursday in analyzing the aborted Presidential quest. "The campaign was truly going well. The problem was that things just got so bad in the state that he was up against a huge budget deficit and he had to turn his attention away from the campaign."
But that was only part of the story.
"The other part is that he never got his campaign sea legs," said Thomas E. Donilon, a Democratic strategist who so far is sitting out the 1992 campaign. "He's a better candidate than his brief run indicated, and we haven't seen the last of him in American politics. But he never raised enough money to stay in this race all the way or, for that matter, long enough to overcome his inexperience in running at a national level -- how to avoid verbal gaffes, how to debate effectively, how to convey the message."
The Governor has refused to elaborate on his decision to pull out of the race. He told reporters who trailed him today to Williamsburg, Va., where he spoke to a gathering of prominent black students from colleges all over the country, that there was nothing to add.
Asked the morning after his withdrawal when he had first concluded he would have to pull out of the contest, he called back over his shoulder to pursuing reporters, "It was before last night."
But some of his campaign workers are more forthcoming in analyzing the aborted race.
As Mame Reiley, the Wilder campaign coordinator in New Hampshire, sees matters, the Governor's poor showing in the polls there was due in good measure to a slow start.
"I know he had problems back home," she said. "But we could have done a lot better if we could have gotten decisions sooner out of headquarters, if we could have gotten more commitment, gotten his story and his message out. It was hard to get headquarters to get the Governor on the phone to talk to potential contributors, little things like that."
In the end, the Governor's campaign message proved to be a particular problem. Many political professionals as well as potential voters believe that the message never crystallized.
A politician often enamored more of political process than political issues, Mr. Wilder spoke mainly in generalities while on the campaign trail, saying he was a "fiscal conservative with a social conscience" but not elaborating.
Asked what he would do about soaring health care costs, a hot campaign issue, he sometimes answered with a vignette about how shocked he was to learn that a little girl in Virginia had died because her family could not afford medical care.
"We can't afford that," he would say.
Once during a debate when the Governor used such language in reply to a question about how he would deal with health care problems, a campaign rival, former Senator Paul E. Tsongas of Massachusetts, quipped dismissively, "Doug, you're running for President now."
There was another problem with the message, too, as the Governor began learning shortly after declaring his candidacy in mid-September. In many ways, it was the most serious problem of all.
In his 1989 campaign for governor, Mr. Wilder was able to win over black voters and liberals by proclaiming social consciousness, and he won moderate white voters by promising fiscal conservatism. Then, he got the final winning edge -- the margin that overcame the drag of the racial issue, many political experts say -- by declaring himself in favor of abortion rights.
But when he tried to forge that combination on the national political stage, he failed.
 
Hesitation Among Blacks
 Black voters, and especially prominent blacks, have been hesitant so far to commit themselves to any candidate. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, a powerful and influential Wilder rival, has suggested that black voters ponder long before choosing a candidate. Moreover, he has pointed out that Mr. Wilder is among the most conservative of the country's major black figures.
As for moderate white voters, Mr. Wilder had to compete for their support with, among others, the apparent front-runner in the young campaign, Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. Mr. Clinton also preaches fiscal responsibility and social consciousness, though in considerably more detail.
Finally, the abortion issue, for all its potential effect on the campaign, has not yet become a hot, exploitable topic.
By the time Mr. Wilder withdrew from the race, a decision even his campaign manager said he did not learn about until the final hour, he was primarily chasing black voters. He had given up attracting many white votes, in part because in-depth interviews in New Hampshire by his campaign consultants had found whites were not moved by his candidacy.
In particular, Mr. Wilder focused on the heavy black vote in the South. His hope was that a good showing there would give his flagging campaign a lift, or at least provide him with enough delegates to have some say at the Democratic National Convention in New York in July.
Some members of his campaign staff were upset by this approach, even after polls indicated the Governor might pull significant black votes in several Southern states. They argued that it would mark the Governor in any future political endeavors as solely a "black candidate" rather than as a "candidate who happens to be black," the latter being his approach in his successful, history-making Virginia campaigns.
What of Mr. Wilder's political future?
"I'm not running for anything -- now," the Governor replied Thursday.
That answer immediately touched off renewed speculation that Mr. Wilder, who cannot succeed himself under Virginia law, has his eye on a United States Senate seat. His chief Democratic political rival in the state, Senator Charles S. Robb, will be up for re-election in 1994, a year after Mr. Wilder leaves the Governor's office.
Mr. Wilder's popularity in Virginia slumped when he entered the Presidential contest, less than half way through his four-year term as Governor. Many state residents felt slighted and some sported "Wilder for Resident" buttons.
But now that he has withdrawn from the 1992 contest, there is a hint of a turnaround in his state standing.
State Senator Hunter B. Andrews of Hampton, the Senate Democratic leader, the Governor's principal antagonist in the Virginia General Assembly, was among the first to commend Mr. Wilder for pulling out.
"Now he'll be here," Mr. Andrews said, "working with us."

HEADLINE: Greenspan Asks Pause In Stimulus

BYLINE: By DAVID E. ROSENBAUM, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 10

 BODY:
Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, told Congress today that he expected the steep cut in interest rates that the Fed ordered last month to be sufficient to get an economic recovery started and that he did not foresee a need for further rate cuts or for budgetary stimulus.
"That is my expectation; that is my best judgment," Mr. Greenspan said in answer to questions from sharply critical Democratic senators. 
 But he said the economic circumstances today were extraordinary, unlike any he had witnessed in his four decades as an economist, so he could not be sure he would not have to change his mind as the year wore on.
 
Unusually Large Cuts
 This was the first time Mr. Greenspan was questioned in public since the Federal Reserve reduced the interest rates it controls on Dec. 20. The unusually large one-day steps pushed the rates to their lowest levels since the 1960's.
A one-percentage-point cut in the discount rate to 3 1/2 percent and a half-point drop in the Federal funds rate to 4 percent were possible, Mr. Greenspan said, because inflation was under control. The discount rate, largely symbolic, is what the Fed charges banks for loans. The Federal funds rate, the benchmark for other short-term rates, is what banks charge each other for overnight loans.
The Fed chairman said he believed the new low rates, as they worked their way through the economy -- "the pipeline," as he called it -- would lead to new stock offerings and lower bond rates. That would mean individuals and companies were working down their debts and should mean a sustained recovery this year, he added.
Mr. Greenspan testified before a joint session of the Senate Banking and Budget Committees. Congress is in recess, and only a few senators, mostly Democrats, showed up.
 
Attack White House Efforts
 But the Democrats who did -- Donald W. Riegle Jr. of Michigan, Jim Sasser of Tennessee, Paul S. Sarbanes of Maryland and Alan J. Dixon of Illinois -- used Mr. Greenspan as a prop for another public attack on the Bush Administration's economic policies.
The Democrats are advocating tax cuts and spending increases to give the economy a quick jolt. Mr. Greenspan said such steps would be unwise because once budgetary discipline was breached, it would be difficult to "rein in" and would "create problems for the economy over the longer term."
Mr. Greenspan is held in high regard in Congress because of his economic expertise and his patient and respectful temperament. But today, for one of the first times in his more than four years as head of the central bank, he was under fire from the lawmakers.
Senator Sasser blamed the Fed for causing the recession, saying it had kept interest rates too high for too long, and declared, "I think it's time for the Fed to be at least as forthright in fighting recession as it has been in fighting inflation."
Senator Riegle said that it was fine to worry about the long term but that "people have to survive in the short term."
And Senator Sarbanes declared, "The Fed has not moved quickly enough and far enough in monetary policy to address the short-term problem."
 
Bobs and Weaves
 In his characteristically pedagogic manner, Mr. Greenspan responded softly to each wave of attack, saying that there was "an awful lot of monetary stimulus in the pipeline," that stimulative fiscal measures were "premature" and that interest rates were already "down to the lowest level in a generation."
Repeatedly, as the senators tried to pin him down about whether further interest rate cuts would be necessary, Mr. Greenspan bobbed and weaved to avoid a direct response. "I try to be as oblique as possible," he said, grinning, at one point.
But eventually, he had this exchange with Senator Dixon:
Q. I take it that you believe that the modest drops in the rate of the discount window finally culminating in the 1 percent reduction you authorized in December of this year should bear fruit in the near future?
A. Yes, sir.
Q. In other words, I take it then that you are saying to us that you believe that that series of modest discounts ultimately culminating in the 1 percent drop will show fruit without any additional imposition of . . .?
A. No, I said should; I didn't say will.
Q. At least you expect it to?
A. I think that is my expectation at this point, but I wish to emphasize that these are very unusual circumstances, and one has to be very chary about one getting a conviction and locking it into cement at this stage because we do not have a rational capability of holding a conviction in this type of environment.
 
Economy Clearly 'Struggling'
 Mr. Greenspan's assessment of the economy was the same as the one he gave the House Ways and Means Committee three weeks ago. Basically it is that last spring the economy began pulling out of the recession, which began in the summer of 1990. But by last fall, the recovery had stalled, and now it is clearly "struggling."
The reason, he said, was that the economy was left so badly out of shape by the corporate mergers and buyouts, the overbuilding of commercial real estate and the household borrowing and spending boom of the 1980's that the recovery could not gain normal momentum.
Still, Mr. Greenspan added, the data today were not so bad compared with other recessions since World War II. But he said today, as he did three weeks ago, that consumer worries about the long-range health of the economy were the worst he had ever experienced.
 
Exchange Over Inflation
 An exchange between Mr. Greenspan and Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum, Republican of Kansas, was a prime illustration of how politicians and central bankers view the world differently.
Mr. Greenspan, whose contact with the public is minimal, said he was surprised that the mail the Federal Reserve received about interest rates was not so much from those who wanted further rate cuts as it was from retired people who live on the interest earned on savings and had seen their incomes pared by the lower rates. He said that he was sympathetic to their problem but that he hoped the slowing of the rate of inflation would help them retain their purchasing power.
Maybe so for some people, Senator Kassebaum said. But for her elderly constituents, medical costs are continuing to rise at an abnormal pace, and that offsets any other benefits from lower rates of inflation.

HEADLINE: Dow Off by 10.07 for Day and 2.02 in Week

BYLINE: By ROBERT HURTADO

 BODY:
Stock prices fell moderately across the market yesterday, canceling out the small gains that had nudged blue chips to two records this week. The Dow Jones industrial average dropped 10.07 points, to 3,199.46, ending the week 2.02 short of where it began.
The drop followed a stronger-than-expected rise in the non-farm payroll numbers for last month. This was seen by investors as bad for the market, because it dimmed hopes of further interest-rate cuts by the Federal Reserve. Low rates have done much to fuel the recent rally, because they give investors few good alternatives to putting their cash into equities. 
 Blue chips rallied briefly in the afternoon, as the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, said in Congressional testimony that the central bank stood ready to take whatever steps were necessary to keep the economy growing. But it fell back and then recovered only part of the earlier losses.
Action was heavy on the New York Stock Exchange, with 236.1 million shares traded, down from 292.4 million on Thursday. Losing issues outpaced gaining ones, 1,093 to 669, as the Big Board's composite index slipped 1.28, to 228.95.
The Standard & Poor's index of 500 stocks fell 2.51, to 415.10, while the American Stock Exchange index slipped 1.93, to 405.64. Other barometers, which hit records all week, were also off. The Nasdaq composite declined by 4.10, to 615.70, while the Russell 2,000, an index of small-company issues, was off by 1.27, to 199.31.
Bernard Spilko, the senior vice president of the New York branch of Bank Julius Baer, said, "The unusual strength in the U.S. dollar frightened foreign investors," adding that the job data "did not provide stocks with the support it looks for from the credit market."
"This created temporary uncertainty in the market, and when investors are uncertain the market normally goes down," Mr. Spilko added.
Birinyi Associates, a research firm that tracks program trading, said that yesterday was fairly busy. It tracked four buying programs and six selling ones, whose combined effect pulled the Dow down by 8.91. But traders said strong underlying buying pressures helped to counter much of the selling pressures.
The stock of Employee Benefit Plans lost about 50 percent of its value after the health-care and management services company said it would report disappointing earnings for its fiscal second quarter. The stock closed down 30 1/8, to 30 3/8.
The big mover among the Dow and S.& P. indexes was Merck, which declined 3 1/2, to 163. International Paper and Philip Morris were each down 1, to 69 3/4 and 79 7/8, respectively.
Goodyear rose 1 1/4, to 55 1/2, as Wendy Needham of Smith Barney, Harris Upham began her coverage with a "buy" rating and a target price of $70 to $75 a share, traders said.

HEADLINE: FUTURES/OPTIONS;
Venezuela in Step to Raise Oil Price

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
Reacting to the recent tumble in oil prices, Venezuela cut its production by about 2 percent yesterday and said it hoped others would follow.
The move pushed the price of oil up slightly on the New York Mercantile Exchange, but analysts said that the price in coming weeks would depend on two bigger factors: the outcome of negotiations between the United Nations and Iraq on conditions for Iraq to resume exports, and the position of Saudi Arabia at a meeting next month of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries. 
 In New York trading, oil for delivery next month settled at $18.23 a barrel, up 37 cents. In contrast, the average price as recently as October was $23.23.
Announcing the cut, the Venezuelan Minister of Energy and Mines, Celestino Armas, said the intent was to send the market a signal, and added that it was likely other countries would take similar actions. If others follow it may create an atmosphere conducive to production when OPEC meets, on Feb. 12, experts said.
 
Unrestrained Oil Production
 Since Iraq invaded Kuwait 18 months ago, the other OPEC members have produced virtually without restraint. The cut by Venezuela brings that country's production back to about 2.3 million barrels a day, a level just above its old OPEC quota and about equal to two-tenths of 1 percent of total OPEC production.
Peter C. Beutel, a petroleum expert at Pegasus Econometric Group of Hoboken, N.J., said: "They're making this cut to send a message to the market, but it's not much of a message. What has gotten the market a little bit spooked is the feeling that maybe this is going to ignite a trend among all the other OPEC producers."
 But the big issue, he said, is what Saudi Arabia will do. The Venezuelan move, he said, "is like putting quarters in a church dish and hoping the big guy is going to drop a hundred dollar bill."
 The other question is when Iraq will return to the market. Representatives from Baghdad met with United Nations officials in Vienna on Thursday, and John H. Lichtblau of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation said the meeting represented a step forward in that "it wasn't negative."
 If Iraqi exports are allowed to resume, they could reach a million barrels a day within weeks, Mr. Licht blau said. Iraq's prewar OPEC quota was 3.14 million barrels.
 In Mr. Lichtblau's view, Iraq may be becoming more flexible in its negotiations with the United Nations. "Iraq has seen they no longer have a bargaining position," he said. "The world doesn't need the oil." If the United Nations stands firm on precisely how it wants the oil exported and Iraq does not go along, "all of OPEC will say thank you very much to the U.N.," he added.
 The Oil Daily Energy Compass, a London-based faxed newsletter, said earlier this week that it had surveyed members of the Security Council and found the basis for a compromise with Iraq over exports. Issues include whether the oil would be exported to the Persian Gulf as well as to the Mediterranean, and who will control the distribution of food that is bought with the oil money.
 New Iraqi exports would add pressure on OPEC to cut back, but the war changed the political alignment within the organization. Mr. Lichtblau suggested that the Saudis would be willing to cut production, but probably only for commercial reasons, and not because of an OPEC agreement.

COCOA RISES SHARPLY
By The Associated Press
Cocoa futures were sharply higher yesterday, grains and soybean futures were mostly lower, and livestock and pork futures gained.
Cocoa futures rose sharply on New York's Coffee, Sugar and Cocoa Exchange. The gain was a response to data that indicate an increase in demand. The fourth-quarter grind report was released yesterday by the Chocolate Manufacturers Institute.
Cocoa for delivery in March was $22 higher at $1,205 a ton.
Grain and soybean futures were mostly lower on the Chicago Board of Trade as dealers squared positions in advance of quarterly crop reports.
After the close of trading, the Agriculture Department released data showing winter wheat seedings totaled 50.2 million acres, much lower than traders' estimates of 54.05 million acres.
On the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, cattle futures advanced on strong cash prices, while pork futures were under pressure as a result of steep cash hog prices. Pork futures received some support from forecasts of severe winter weather.

HEADLINE: Views of Bush's Trip From Corner Offices

 BODY:
American executives from many areas of industry were asked yesterday what they thought President Bush's trip to Asia would accomplish. Following are excerpts from their interviews and statements:
 
Dexter F. Baker
 Chairman and chief executive, Air Products and Chemicals, an industrial-gas producer in Allentown, Pa., and one of the executives accompanying the President on the trip.
We didn't just go to Japan. The Pacific Basin is very important to America. It's our largest trading relationship, with two-way trade of about $300 billion. We are pretty close to balance or slightly positive with most of the countries. The economies in that part of the world, outside of Australia, are booming. It's a very strategically important part of the American economic scene.
Some market-opening initiatives were achieved. I think it was a very positive trip. This wasn't tokenism on the President's part. I think he performed magnificently. The key thing is that the President has created a really positive environment for American investment and trade to flow to Japan.
I'm convinced they genuinely want to improve the commercial relationships with the U.S. We talked about the tremendous opportunity to work together in dealing with markets opening up in Central and Eastern Europe. Now, American industry has got to get off its duff and start investing in those parts of the world. The President has done his job. The American business community now has to go to work to tranform that to the bottom line and jobs.
 
Fred W. Lyons Jr.
 President and chief executive, Marion Merrell Dow Inc., a pharmaceutical company in Kansas City, Mo.
We're a little different from the auto industry. We're very pleased with the relationship we have with the Japanese. We introduced our Seldane antihistamine over there a year and a half ago and we did $100 million of business in 1991.
We go through a similar process in terms of drug registration in any country and the same kinds of marketing challenges. The problems we deal with are not unique to Japan.
We are very strongly in favor of free trade.
 
Wilfred J. Corrigan
 Chairman and chief executive, LSI Logic Corporation, a semiconductor manufacturer in Milpitas, Calif:
I can see how they reached the conclusion that they should take predominantly the automobile guys, but I don't approve of it. Either the President should have gone on his own, or, if he was making it into a trade mission, I think there should have been more businesses represented.
The message that gives to Japan is "Aha! What America is concerned about is automobiles." As far as the Japanese are concerned the automobile battle is over. It's just a mopping-up operation. Their concern is more on the industries of the future. Electronics is going to be the manufacturing industry of the 21st century.
There should have been significant representation from the computer industry and the semiconductor industry, and I'm sure there's a dozen other strategic industries. The message to give is: "We're really interested in the strategic-industry balance of trade."
 
George Hatsopoulos
 Chairman and chief executive, Thermo Electron Corporation, a high-technology and industrial-products company in Waltham, Mass.
I think the trip was ill conceived. Looking at the trade deficit as a bilateral problem with Japan is inconsistent with a healthy world economy. They may need a surplus from us in cars if they buy oil from other countries that buy things from us.
We have an overall trade deficit, but the problem is primarily economic policy in the U.S. We do have problems with high-tech products, communications, and certain financial services in Japan. President Bush focused on the wrong industry. Focusing on autos is taking on Japan where they have a good story to tell.
I think the White House knows better. Outside of politics, the only justification for looking at things bilaterally is to put pressure on them to remove invisible barriers.
 
James S. Davis
 Chairman and chief Executive, New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. of Boston.
Japan is our strongest trading partner so it was important for the President to go to maintain good political and personal relations. It's good for chief executives to get to know each other because we are so interdependent. Greater understanding comes from sitting down face to face. We just wanted to remind everybody with our ad thatyou can still compete effectively in foreign markets. I have got to feel that there were other people there who are doing reasonably well. We just didn't hear about it because it's not controversial.
 
Don L. Gevirtz
 Chairman and chief executive, the Foothill Group, a financial-services company in Agoura Hills, Calif.
As a Democrat, I think the handling of the Japan trip provides the first glimmer that someone like Bill Clinton could defeat Bush.
Bush is focusing on dying industries rather than focusing on newer entrepreneurial industries that are creating most of the new jobs and many of the new innovations. It was a disastrous trip to Japan in terms of where our emphasis should be.
The major problem we have is that industries like autos have become completely non-competitive and at the same time we have a banking industry that is illiquid and not able to provide credit to smaller companies that are still growing.
 
Reginald Lewis
 Chairman and chief executive, TLC Beatrice International Holdings Inc., a food company based in New York.
I don't think it was the wrong thing to do. The trade imbalance with the Japanese can't be ignored. The auto industry wanted his help, and he can't be criticized for trying to give it. The American consumer is now more aware of the impact on the general economy of selecting a Japanese product over the American product. It might encourage them to examine whether there is a real difference rather than a perceived difference.
Some of the strident aspects of the dialogue might be unfortunate. The negatives probably couldn't be avoided because it was a media event. Some of these problems have been with us for a long time and defy easy solution.
 
James Koontz
 President and chief executive, Kingsbury Machine Tool Company of Keene, N.H., and chairman of the National Center for Manufacturing Sciences in Ann Arbor, Mich.
I think the trip created recognition that there is a problem. The fact that we focused on the Japanese trade problem may have gotten some of the Japanese transplants to realize that they have to work more with American vendors. Our company has been promised several orders in the near future.
On the other hand, our problems are not really with the Japanese. They are at home. The major companies and unions have to sit down and agree to make our plants more flexible and productive. The whole trip was a bit of an embarrassment. The Japanese are 90 percent right in saying our problems are here.
 
Richard B. Madden
 Chairman and chief executive, Potlatch Corporation, a forest-products company in San Francisco:
I believe he should have made the trip. The President and Prime Minister Miyazawa agreed the two nations would reach an agreement by the end of March that would substantially increase access to the Japanese paper market.
I don't know if this would have been achieved in anywhere near that time frame if the President hadn't made the trip.

HEADLINE: Blunt Talk by Iacocca, Just Back From Japan

BYLINE: By BARNABY J. FEDER

 BODY:
Lee A. Iacocca, the outspoken chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, in an address before Detroit's business elite, unleashed his most vitriolic attack yet on Japan yesterday, predicting that President Bush's trade mission would not budge the trade deficit or salve the auto industry's wounds.
Other executives said yesterday that while the President's trip might eventually help narrow the trade deficit, Mr. Bush focused too much attention on the conflict between Japan and America's auto makers, who, they said, have only themselves to blame for their woes. 
 Such views reflect the widespread belief outside Detroit that the industry's troubles result not so much from Japanese trade barriers as from the American auto makers' failure to match Japan's efficiency and reputation for quality.
"I know many companies do have problems with Japan, but focusing on autos is taking on the Japanese where they have a good story to tell," said George Hatsopoulos, the chairman and chief executive of the Thermo Electron Corporation, a high-technology and industrial-products company based in Waltham, Mass. "I think the trip was ill conceived."
Mr. Iacocca, however, would have none of that. "I for one am fed up hearing from the Japanese, and I might say some Americans, too, that all our problems in this industry, all our problems, are our own damn fault," he told a gathering of about 5,000 business executives at the Detroit Economic Club. "We do not have idiots running General Motors, Ford and Chrysler, or our suppliers. And our workers are not lazy and stupid."
He said that Japanese auto makers benefited from having "a closed sanctuary" in their home market; "a huge, wide-open market like the United States to sell into"; a friendly Japanese Government, and "company unions and sweetheart deals with banks and suppliers."
Still, Mr. Iacocca said that Mr. Bush's trip, with 18 American business executives in tow, made an important diplomatic point. "What's changed is that economics finally made it to the front of the plane along with the generals and the admirals and all the Foggy Bottom types from the State Department," he said.
"Their leaders have always taken business people on missions like this, because they've always put economics and business first," he said of the Japanese. "Now we're doing that."
He added: "Seeing American government and business arm in arm for the first time ever sent the Japanese a clear message; and I think -- I think -- the Japanese got it. They didn't like it. They fought it. Oh boy, did they fight it. And they made a start in dealing with it, but only a start. Frankly, from a Detroit perspective, it was weak, but it was a start."
The lunchtime speech was vintage Iacocca, crammed with hyberbole, statistics, his trademark expletives and folk wisdom: "I used to believe the Oriental long view was a great virtue and something we could learn from the Japanese. I was wrong. It's not a virtue at all, it's a weapon, and we have to disarm them. We need to use our own weapon: good old-fashioned American impatience. That means demanding a solution to the problem now."
 
Some Blunt Words
 Looking wan from having crossed the Pacific twice since Monday, Mr. Iacocca reiterated his preference for free trade, but accused the Japanese of exercising "predatory trade" and "insidious Japanese economic and political power within the United States."
He also rejected the notion that part of the reason for the large trade deficit is that American vehicles are unpopular in Japan. "They say it's because our stuff is junk," he said. "I wonder if there's another reason. Like maybe because my Jeep Cherokee costs $12,000 more in Japan than it does here because they don't accept our certification, and everything has to be inspected, and there's a maze of red tape not designed to protect the Japanese consumer, but to keep us out."
The business contingent with Mr. Bush included executives from financial-service and industrial companies who spent most of their time outside of Japan, visiting other trading partners. But the presence of the top executives of the Big Three auto companies and several makers of auto parts emphasized the auto industry's needs to the point that they overshadowed other topics.
 
A Different Perspective
 The talks in Japan actually put far less emphasis on the auto industry's concerns than the news reports suggested, said Dexter F. Baker, chief executive of Air Products and Chemicals Inc. of Allentown, Pa., and one of the executives on the Bush trip. He also said the visits to Australia, Singapore and South Korea would have long-range benefits for business that have been underestimated.
"I think it was a very positive trip," Mr. Baker said. "President Bush is the first President to focus for an extended period of time on the international trade issue, and he performed magnificently."
But other executives said yesterday that many Americans were probably misled about Japan's role in the challenges the economy faces and about which industries they should be counting on most for improving trade balances with Asia.
One company, New Balance Athletic Shoe Inc. of Boston, went so far as to run a pointed full-page advertisement in The New York Times yesterday saying that its running shoes were "one American-made vehicle that has had no problem competing in Japan" and concluding: "It only goes to prove, Mr. President, that when you build a product people really, truly need, something amazing happens. People buy it."

HEADLINE: Rates Move Up on U.S. Jobs Report

BYLINE: By KENNETH N. GILPIN

 BODY:
Prices of Treasury securities fell and interest rates moved higher yesterday after the Government reported a modest improvement in payroll jobs in December.
The 31,000 increase in non-farm payrolls came as something of a surprise to most analysts. Many had expected a decline of about 75,000. 
 The nation's overall unemployment rate, which rose two-tenths of a percentage point, to 7.1 percent, was largely ignored by participants in the credit market.
 
Interest-Rate Implications
 Traders and analysts said the negative reaction was not to the numbers themselves, but to the fact that they strongly implied that the Federal Reserve Board would not move soon to lower short-term interest rates again.
Others said the price drop was merely a correction after the recent strong run-up.
"This has nothing to do with fundamentals," said William Brachfeld, an executive vice president at Daiwa Securities America Inc. "There has been a big run-up, and now people are just taking some profits."
Another Government securities trader, who insisted on anonymity, said that Thursday's selloff had created a lot of concern. "There has been a lot of buying over the last two weeks, and some of that had to come back out of the market," the trader said. "People were poised to sell no matter what the number was."
 
Fed Has Bought Bonds
 Comments by the Fed chairman, Alan Greenspan, helped to lift the bond market off its lows late in the session.
In remarks before a joint meeting of the Senate Banking and Budget Committees, Mr. Greenspan said the Fed had recently bought bonds as part of its open-market operations, and would consider doing so again if conditions warranted. He also lent his support to the Treasury Department's study of whether the department should alter its current financing strategy and sell fewer long-term bonds.
Some credit market participants have urged the Treasury to take advantage of the current wide differential between bond yields and yields on shorter-term securities by selling fewer bonds. Aside from lowering financing costs, a smaller supply of long-term bonds would probably help to bring down long-term interest rates, adherents of this position argue.
The Federal Reserve Board could help accomplish this latter objective by doing exactly what Mr. Greenspan said the Fed had been doing recently.
 
'Testimony Was Friendly'
 There was little reaction to Mr. Greenspan's remarks about the economy, but analysts said the gist of his comments was not surprising, or threatening, to the fixed-income market.
"On balance, his testimony was friendly," said William V. Sullivan Jr., a senior vice president at Dean Witter Reynolds. "He clearly kept the door open for further accommodation on monetary policy."
By late in the day, the Treasury's 8 percent 30-year bonds of 2021 were offered at a price of 10614/32, down 19/32, to yield 7.45 percent, compared with 7.41 percent late Thursday and 7.47 percent on Jan. 3.
Among Treasury note issues, the 7.50 percent 10-year notes were offered at 10422/32, down half a basis point, or hundredths of a percentage point, to yield 6.83 percent. The new 6 3/8 percent seven-year notes were offered on a when-issued basis at a price to yield 6.35 percent. And the 5 percent two-year notes were offered at 10010/32, down 7/32, to yield 4.83 percent.
 
 
Short-Term Rates Up
 The flickering chances of another quick reduction in short-term rates by the Fed caused short-term Treasury bill rates to rise.
Three-month bills were offered at a discount rate of 3.80 percent late yesterday, up 5 basis points. Rates on six-month bills rose by 6 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.86 percent. And one-year bill rates rose by 10 basis points, to a late offered rate of 3.92 percent.

HEADLINE: Ad Drop Forces Closing of New York Woman

BYLINE: By DEIRDRE CARMODY

 BODY:
New York Woman, a lively life-style magazine for young urban sophisticates, ceased publication yesterday, a victim of the decline in local retail advertising.
"It breaks my heart," said Thomas Ryder, president of the American Express Publishing Corporation, the magazine's parent. "It's one of the best magazines I have ever been associated with." 
 The magazine, which had a circulation of 90,000, had been for sale since November. Its advertising pages were down 34 percent for 1991, and in its five-and-a-half-year existence it never made a profit.
 
Appeal to Quirkiness
 New York Woman was the creation of its editor in chief, Betsy Carter, who thought up the idea as editorial director at Esquire. She saw the need for a magazine that would appeal to the quirkiness and urban survival qualities that she felt differentiated women in New York City from others.
"New York Woman was meant to be a type of woman; it was meant to suggest smart, urban, sophisticated women," Ms. Carter said yesterday. "The vision for this magazine and the voice of this magazine have always been very, very clear and have never changed."
But the very title that helped define the readership might have worked against the magazine, making it sound too local for national advertisers. It was left with an advertising base of local retail establishments that were among the hardest hit in the recession.
"It was originally to be sent to women trend-setters and influence brokers, but that concept dissipated pretty quickly," said Claude Fromm, executive vice president and media director for TBWA, the advertising agency. "It turned out to be a life-style publication, but it was never perceived as a service publication. There was too much other competition in the New York market."
The 18 staff members assembled in Ms. Carter's office yesterday morning for a tearful meeting with Mr. Ryder, who told them the company would absorb as many of them as possible in other positions.
Mr. Ryder said the magazine had been on "a good growth track" and came close to breaking even in 1989. He said that in the attempt to sell the magazine he had talked to "virtually everyone in the business" but could find no takers.

HEADLINE: CURRENCY MARKETS;
Dollar's Advance Continues, Helped by U.S. Jobs Report

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

 BODY:
The dollar extended its recent advance yesterday against other leading currencies after a report on December employment in the United States showed more strength than had been expected even though the unemployment rate rose.
Gold prices slipped in domestic trading after rising overseas. The Republic National Bank in New York quoted a late bid of $356.25 an ounce, down 75 cents from Thursday. 
 Dealers said the dollar got a lift from an unexpected rise in non-farm payrolls in December, even though the unemployment rate rose to 7.1 percent from a revised 6.9 percent in November.
Frank Pusateri, vice president of corporate foreign exchange at the Bank of Boston, said news of the growth in payrolls enabled the dollar to solidify the even bigger advance it had made on Thursday.
The dollar dipped at midafternoon when Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, said the Fed stood ready to take steps to stimulate the economy if necessary.
That kind of talk could suggest the Fed is ready to lower interest rates some more, a development that could hurt the dollar.
But Karen Gibbs, a senior financial analyst at Dean Witter Reynolds in Chicago, said the dollar bounced back as traders examined Mr. Greenspan's remarks.
"He was being nebulous," she said. "He said there was room for easing, but he might not do anything right away. He said there was plenty of easing in the pipeline already."
Ms. Gibbs said the dollar resumed its climb amid growing expectations that European central bankers would express support for the dollar at a meeting of leading industrial nations later this month.
In addition, she said the dollar gained from buying by professional traders who needed the currency to complete earlier deals in which they promised to sell dollars they did not own, a situation called short-covering.
Mr. Pusateri of the Bank of Boston said demand for dollars was up because foreign money managers also appeared to be getting ready to buy American stocks and bonds in anticpation of further rises in those markets.
The dollar finished at 126.90 Japanese yen in New York, up from 125.80 late Thursday. Earlier in Tokyo, the dollar rose to 125.85 yen, from 124.65 late Thursday, and it rose to 126.95 yen in London.
The dollar also gained ground against the British pound. In New York, the pound fell to $1.7885, from $1.8160 late Thursday. Earlier in London, the pound fell to $1.7925, from $1.8130 late Thursday.
Other dollar rates in New York included: 1.5850 German marks, up from 1.5590; 1.4120 Swiss francs, up from 1.3945; 5.4090 French francs, up from 5.3325; 1,197 Italian lire, up from 1,181, and 1.15475 Canadian dollars, up from 1.14865.
On the Commodity Exchange in New York, gold for current delivery fell 40 cents an ounce, to $356.20. Earlier, gold rose in London to $357.60, from $351.75 late Thursday. Gold in Zurich climbed to $357.40 an ounce, from $351.85 late Thursday. In Hong Kong, gold rose $4.42 to close at $357.29.

HEADLINE: Your Taxes;
Home Buyers Win on Points

BYLINE: By Robert D. Hershey Jr.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
The long-clouded issue of deducting the prepaid interest, or points, that borrowers must often pay to obtain a mortgage is becoming clearer -- to the financial benefit of many borrowers -- as a result of a recent, little-publicized ruling by the Internal Revenue Service.
Although home buyers have largely ignored the distinction, the agency until now had held that points deducted at closing must be only those payments clearly identifiable as compensation for the "use or forbearance of money," or interest, and not fees for related services. This seemed to bar deduction of points paid to a mortgage broker, either directly or through a bank. 
 Under the new ruling, which implicitly acknowledges that the lender, not the home buyer, pays the broker, the points are fully deductible no matter what route the money takes. And people who stretched the law and hoped for the best can stop worrying, said James O'Connor, tax counsel for the National Council of Community Bankers. The trade group feared for the competitive position of members not big enough to maintain full in-house mortgage departments.
Still, to be deductible under the new ruling the points must be calculated as a percentage of the loan; items like appraisal fees that have traditionally been stated separately cannot be recast into percentage terms.
The latest ruling follows a 1990 I.R.S. decision effecively to abandon the distinction it had made between points that were financed -- deducted from the loan amount -- and those the borrower paid with cash brought to the closing.
Taxpayers need to keep in mind, however, that points paid to refinance existing mortgages -- a popular current practice prompted by tumbling interest rates -- are not deductible at closing. These must be amortized annually over the life of the mortgage.
 
New Texas Tax
 Texans may still be proud that their state remains one of the few with no income tax, but the "earned surplus" levy on corporations that took effect on Jan. 1 is doing quite a realistic imitation in the eyes of many.
The new tax, based on net corporate earnings, supplements -- and for most taxpayers replaces -- the traditional annual corporate franchise tax assessed on net worth. Companies must pay either the franchise tax, which has been reduced, or 4 1/2 percent of earnings, whichever is higher.
Late in the year, moreover, the state's Controller effectively voided the numerous corporate mergers and restructurings made to minimize taxes after the law was passed.
And this probably is not the end, said James Trester, manager of state and local taxes in the Dallas office of Grant Thornton, the accounting firm. He complained that the state used the strategy of introducing unacknowledged taxes gradually, and he predicted passage of a personal income tax within a few years.
 
Footnotes
 * The Treasury, responding to a complaint by the sponsor of a private-sector investment program for college expenses, agrees to give more prominence to qualifications on the tax-advantaged use of Series EE savings bonds for this purpose. It will no longer promote savings bonds as "tax free for college" without noting that limitations apply, one of which is that the benefit is phased out for upper-middle and upper-income people. For 1992, the threshold for a married couple is $66,200 of taxable income.
* The I.R.S. has raised the standard deduction for business use of personal cars -- also used by many companies to reimburse employees -- to 28 cents a mile for 1992, from 27 1/2 cents last year. The deductions for charitable and medical uses stay at 12 cents and 9 cents, respectively.
* The $1 tax checkoff that helps finance Presidential elections generated about $32 million in 1991, continuing a steady decline from a peak of $41 million 10 years earlier. The Federal Election Commission, whose payments are indexed to inflation, warns that a financing shortfall is certain by 1996. A bill sponsored by Al Swift, a Washington Democrat, to raise the checkoff to $3 has bogged down in the Senate.

HEADLINE: BUSINESS PEOPLE;
The Chief at Ratners Resigns as Chairman

BYLINE: By STEVEN PROKESCH

 BODY:
Gerald I. Ratner, who built Ratners Group P.L.C. into the largest jewelry retailer in Britain and No. 2 in the United States, resigned yesterday as chairman but remained chief executive.
The new chairman is James McAdam, 61 years old, who retired in June as deputy chairman and chief operating officer of Coats Viyella P.L.C., a textile and apparel manufacturer and retailer. Described by one banker as "a down-to-earth Scot," Mr. McAdam has broad experience in finance and retailing. 
 The change came in the face of the company's mounting financial problems and plunging stock price. Ratners Group accumulated a bank debt of 217 million ($389.7 million) and issued an estimated 200 million to 250 million worth of preferred stock to finance a number of acquisitions and then got hit by recession. Analysts predicted that the company would have to be recapitalized.
The company said it would probably have to eliminate the dividend on its common stock. John Smith, an analyst at UBS Phillips & Drew, a brokerage, said he did not think dividends on preferred stock would be paid either.
The company has 1,135 stores in Britain, where its chains include Ratners, H. Samuel, Ernest Jones, Salisburys and Watches of Switzerland. In the United States, the company has 1,009 outlets and has been No. 2 to the Zale Corporation. Ratners chain stores include Sterling, Kay Jewelers, JB Robinson, Westhall, Osterman, Le Roy's, Weisfield's and Friedlander's.
Mr. Ratner, 42, took control of Ratners Group in 1984, when he muscled aside his father, the company's founder. He then transformed the company and the way jewelry was sold in Britain, pursuing a strategy of selling jewelry at cut-rate prices, which vastly increased jewelry purchases by Britons. He also expanded aggressively through acquisitions.
The company's image was not helped when Mr. Ratner joked about how junky his products were in a speech to a business group in April and British newspapers publicized the remarks. He said a pair of Ratners gold earrings cost no more than a 99-pence prawn sandwich sold by Marks & Spencer, the department store, "but they probably would not last as long."
Nicholas Bubb, an analyst at Morgan Stanley & Company, said: "Their problems are largely self-inflicted. Overexpansion is the basic cause." Some analysts also said the market for cheap jewelry had matured.
In an interview, Mr. McAdam, the new chairman, said his "strong financial background was a necessary attribute at the moment." His skills, he added, complement those of Mr. Ratner, who "is very much a retailing entrepreneur" and will focus on "driving the sales."

HEADLINE: Savings Depositors to Be Paid More Interest (and Attention)

BYLINE: By LEONARD SLOANE

 BODY:
Millions of consumers who put their savings in commercial banks, savings banks and savings and loan associations are expected to benefit from a provision that was part of the bank bailout bill passed by Congress late last year. The overall measure increased the borrowing power of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation by about $70 billion.
Under the law's "truth in savings" section, financial institutions will be required to provide a great deal more information to their depositors. Among other things, the measure calls for these moves by banks: 
 *Disclosing more data about the yields on their accounts.
*Paying interest on the entire balance in interest-bearing accounts.
*Giving the public more facts about changes in rates and fees.
 
The Aim Is Informed Choice

The overall objective is to help depositors understand exactly what an institution is offering so they can make more informed choices.
Consumers will not feel the full effects of the new law for nearly 15 months: the Federal Reserve Board won't issue final regulations to enforce the act until September. Banks will have another six months before compliance becomes mandatory.
"This is a core of the consumer protection package," said Edmund Mierzwinski, a consumer advocate for the United States Public Interest Research Group, an organization that has long lobbied for such legislation. "It will let you compare apples with apples, rather than apples with rotten apples."
Until the provisions of the act take effect, consumer advocates advise depositors to ask their banks specific questions about the yields on their accounts and watch for lower interest rates that might be imposed to compensate for the changes.
The American Bankers Association, the major trade association, says that it is pleased with the new law, even though it tried to have mutual funds included in the legislation.
"A lot of us are doing this already, but it will bring consistency to the industry," said Henry C. Riley, executive vice president of Bay Bank in Boston and chairman of the branch administration executive committee of the bankers' group. "It provides what a consumer should expect and deserve," Mr. Riley added.
 
Understandable Language
 One key provision of the law calls for listing specific data in understandable language in all advertisements and solicitations for savings accounts, certificates of deposit and interest-bearing checking accounts.
Among items that must now be included for comparison purposes are: the annual percentage yield, the period when the yield is in effect, the minimum account balance to receive the yield, and the minimum initial deposit to open the account.
"It has actually been three and a half to four years that there has been some work on this particular matter," said Representative Bruce F. Vento, a Minnesota Democrat on the House Banking Committee. "Banks had been ducking the responsibility in providing the information."
Another part of the truth-in-savings section prohibits methods of calculation meant to keep consumers from obtaining daily interest on an account's full principal. The result will be a substantive change for those banks that do not now calculate interest on the entire amount, and will also increase yields to the depositors.
Some banks, principally in the Southeast, now pay the advertised interest only on a portion of the account -- typically, on 88 percent -- so that the rate on the whole balance is lower than the depositor believes. Those banks' rationale is that since they are required by the Government to keep part of all deposits on hand to cover possible withdrawals, they cannot reinvest that amount. Thus they don't pay interest on a substantial segment of an account to depositors.
Here's how this method works: a bank advertises a rate of 4 percent, but pays that rate on just 88 percent of the amount in the account. As a result, the actual rate on the entire balance is 3.52 percent.
"It's a right of the consumer who is not an expert in the banking areas to know what he or she will be getting from the institutions he or she does business in," said Representative Gerald D. Kleczka, a Wisconsin Democrat.
Kim Shafer, staff director of the Senate Banking Committee's consumer subcommittee, said, "Now banks will be required to make public disclosure on each statement of the method of calculating interest that they use."
Still another provision calls for more disclosure about fees imposed on bank accounts -- a monthly maintenance fee, a charge per check or a charge for using an automated teller machine. In addition, if the terms of an account are modified to the disadvantage of a depositor, he or she must be notified 30 days before such change is made.
 
Some Proposals Didn't Make It
 The theory behind the new law's provision is that a depositor who has been informed in advance about additional costs can close an account before the changes are authorized. And restrictions have been placed on what can be called a free or no-cost account.
Certain truth-in-savings provisions did not make it through the Senate-House conference on the measure. For example, the Public Interest Research Group campaigned unsuccessfully for two services for households with annual incomes of less than $20,000: "basic banking" and cashing of Government checks.
Basic banking would have required banks to provide basic transaction accounts so that low-income families could write checks at low cost. A bank would have been required to cash Government checks whether or not the holder had an account there.

Rangers Break the Ice On a Deal for Lindros

BYLINE: By JOE LAPOINTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: QUEBEC, Jan. 10

 BODY:
The stalemate between Eric Lindros and the Quebec Nordiques continues, but there are signs that the Nordiques may soon be willing to trade their reluctant top draft choice.
Pierre Page, coach and general manager of the Nordiques, said today that he had several conversations about Lindros this week with Neil Smith, general manager of the Rangers, when the two were in Florida for league meetings. Page said the Rangers made an offer that Page considered inadequate. Their two teams are to play here Saturday night, although Smith isn't expected to make the trip. 
 In addition, reports in major Canadian newspapers today said that the Nordiques had changed their position on Lindros and would now entertain serious, written offers for the 18-year-old superstar who has refused to play in Quebec.
Until now, the Nordiques' owner, Marcel Aubut, has said his team will not trade Lindros, who has refused to report for social, cultural, linguistic and economic reasons. Lindros has frequently said he wants to play for a high-profile team in a major city. New York, Toronto, Detroit and Chicago have all been mentioned.
Page said he had talked to several other National Hockey League clubs about Lindros. Page declined to discuss names of specific players he would be interested in.
 
Misconstrued Remarks
 Page said the Nordiques had not really changed their position and that his recent remarks, in French to French-Canadian reporters, were misconstrued by English-language newspaper editors, who read a translated version distributed by a news agency. Page said he would consider written offers only because he is tired of listening to whispers in hallways before games.
But he compared a possible trade for Lindros to a real-estate deal by a homeowner who doesn't have his house on the market.
"You don't want to sell it," Page said, "but someone knocks on the door and says 'Will you take this for your house?' and you say 'Well, geez, I didn't expect anyone to offer this.' "
Asked specifically about his conversations with Smith, Page replied: "Yes, I talked to Neil quite a few times. He keeps asking about Lindros."
Lindros was in Detroit tonight to play an Olympic exhibition with the Canadian team against the United States. Barry Watkins, a Rangers spokesman, said tonight that Smith had acknowledged discussing Lindros with Page this week. Smith is not preparing a formal, written offer, Watkins said.
Lindros's father, his agent and his lawyer all expressed cautious, guarded optimism that a breakthrough may be near. "Quebec controls the time frame," the agent, Rick Curran, told The Toronto Globe and Mail. "If the Nordiques decide they want to move ahead and do things, they can do it."
 
Back into Draft Pool
 If the Nordiques don't sign Lindros by June 1993, he would go back into the draft pool, at the age of 20, to be selected again. Quebec, last in the Adams division with 27 points, trails Buffalo by 8 in the chase for the fourth and final playoff berth in that group. A trade could bring enough good players to put the Nordiques in the tournament.
Although Lindros excelled in the Canada Cup in September, he was a disappointment in the junior tournament that ended last week in Germany with Canada out of medal contention. Page said Lindros's hectic schedule is taking its toll. Lindros also plays occasionally for the Oshawa Generals junior team and he is expected to play on the Canadian Olympic team next month in France.
"A lot of adjustments, a lot of systems, a lot of coaches, a lot of levels," Page said. "I don't think you are seeing the real Eric Lindros right now. The guy is trying to fly too many horses. You don't want to wish all that in one year on too many people. He's got his negotiating hat on and he's got his poker face on. It takes its toll, expecially on a young guy like that. He's not saying what he really wants to say, he's not doing what he really wants to do. Somebody's got to take the pressure off him."

HEADLINE: New Arts School for Bard

BYLINE: By CAROL VOGEL

 BODY:
Bard College is growing beyond its campus at Annandale-on-Hudson, N.Y. The institution has announced plans for a new graduate program in the decorative arts based in Manhattan at 18 West 86th Street.
The Bard Graduate Center for Studies in the Decorative Arts, scheduled to open in the fall of 1993, will offer a master of arts degree, which will take about two years to earn. The center will also offer adult education courses and will hold exhibitions. 
 "Decorative arts is a field of great interest to us," said Leon Botstein, the president of Bard. "Not only in terms of connoisseurship but in an interdisciplinary way -- in the context of social and cultural history."
The project, including the purchase and renovation of the building, will cost about $8 million over the next five years, Mr. Botstein said. The money will come in part from a gift from the Iris Foundation, a private New York City organization dedicated to research, exhibitions and education in the decorative arts.
The center, which will occupy a six-story 15,400-square-foot Beaux Arts town house, is to include a research library, two floors of exhibition space, classrooms and offices. There are also plans to publish an interdisciplinary quarterly journal and other publications, including scholarly catalogues. The center will hold semi-annual exhibitions and regular seminars.
Susan Weber Soros, a specialist in 18th- and 19th-century decorative arts and publisher of the quarterly journal "Sources: Notes in the History of Art," has been named the director. Derek E. Ostegard, a decorative arts scholar, will be the academic dean.
"This has been in the works for a long time," Mr. Botstein said. "The college has been developing a strategy to start satellite institutions. This is our second off-site program."
The first occurred when the college took over Simon's Rock, a liberal-arts college for students of high school age in Great Barrington, Mass., in 1979. Bard has long been known for developing innovative graduate programs and research institutes like the Milton Avery Graduate School of the Arts on its campus, a master's program in environmental studies and the Jerome Levy Economics Institute. In April, Bard is opening a Black Center for Curatorial Studies in Annandale-on-Hudson.

HEADLINE: Miami Emerges as Latin Art Center

BYLINE: By LARRY ROHTER, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: MIAMI, Jan. 9

 BODY:
Aided by a surge of interest in the painting and sculpture of Latin America and by a growing community of artists, galleries and dealers, Miami is rapidly emerging as an important center for the creation, display and marketing of Latin American art.
New galleries specializing in such art are opening and some existing galleries are beginning to display works from the Caribbean and South America. Latin American artists and collectors are also arriving in increasing numbers, hoping to benefit from their involvement with one of the few bright spots in the depressed international art market. 
 More than a year ago, Impressionist works and other traditional segments of the art market plunged into a deep slump from which they have yet to recover. But a Diego Rivera painting brought a record $2.9 million at Christie's auction house in New York in November, and works by Frida Kahlo and Fernando Botero broke the million-dollar mark for the first time in 1991.
Last year, collectors also paid record prices for works by Wilfredo Lam, Roberto Matta, Fernando de Szyszlo, Armando Morales and Rufino Tamayo, and this has stimulated interest in the work of younger, less-celebrated Latin American artists.
 
High Quality, Low Prices
 "The overall art market went so high that most people simply couldn't afford it," said Virginia Miller, owner of a Coral Gables gallery, which bears her name. "But the Latin American market offers both very high quality and low prices. You can buy the work of an emerging Latin American artist for $5,000 or less. Many times you can even buy that work here for less than you would pay in Latin America, especially if the artist is only known in his or her own country."
Perhaps more than any other city in North or South America, Miami is poised to take advantage of these developments. Half the population is of Hispanic descent, and the hundreds of thousands of Latin Americans who vacation and do business here each year have gradually found that Miami is also a good place to shed narrow, nationalistic conceptions of culture.
"In Latin America, each country has a strong market for its own artists," said Fernando Gutierrez of Marta Gutierrez Fine Arts, a Key Biscayne gallery that specializes in Latin American art. "Mexicans buy Mexicans, Colombians buy Colombians, and so on. In Miami, though, we show works from all over the place to buyers from all over the place."
One sign of the increased sophistication and importance of Miami as a center for Latin American art is the Art Miami '92 exhibition, which opened in Miami Beach on Wednesday with more than 6,000 works of art on sale and which runs through tomorrow. More than 125 dealers from 28 countries are taking part in the annual show, which emphasizes Latin American art and was first held last year.
Of equal significance are indications that Miami is emerging as a regional center for artists, not just for the dealers and collectors who buy and sell their works. "A fundamental requirement of being an artist in Latin America today is being able to participate in what goes on in Miami," said Ernesto Leon, a 35-year-old Venezuelan painter who has lived in Manhattan and Mexico City but now spends much of his time here.
"I believe that Miami is going to become for Latin American artists what Paris was in the 50's," Mr. Leon continued. "There is not only a whole infrastructure of Latin American food, brands and culture here to make us feel comfortable, but there is an availability of information in Miami that exists nowhere else. This is really the only place you can meet with other Latin American artists to see their work and find out what is happening in each of their countries."
Capitalizing on that trend, many Latin American artists are seeking to establish footholds for themselves in Miami. Some, like the Chilean painter Ernesto Barreda, have bought or rented houses, apartments or studios in Key Biscayne, in Miami Beach's South Beach district or in Coral Gables and now shuttle back and forth between their homelands and Florida.
"These are artists who have gotten support and recognition from their own governments and their people," said Diana Torre de Alba of Opus Gallery, which represents innovative artists from several Latin American countries. "But they want more. They want to be part of the world art market, and they see Miami as their logical point of entry."
Latin American art dealers have apparently begun thinking along the same lines. El Centro de Arte Euro americano, a leading Venezuelan gallery, opened a branch in Coral Gables called Ambrosino Gallery last month.
"We want people to know that they don't have to go to Caracas to get this kind of art," said Richard Goihman, who runs the gallery for its Venezuelan owners. "We talked about doing this in New York or Chicago, but decided that Miami was the best place because of its demographics. Over the last five years, Miami has become the prime art market for all Hispanics, from wealthy South Americans to local Cuban collectors."
 
Life Under a Shadow
 The newcomers join established galleries like Elite Fine Art, whose owner, Jose Martinez Canas, is widely regarded as the most astute of the dealers who specialize in Latin American art here. Though gallery owners complain about the depressed American economy and its impact on the art market, some say they are at least partly insulated because their clientele includes foreign as well as local collectors.
"Latin Americans are accustomed to living under a shadow," said Mr. Gutierrez of the Gutierrez gallery. "They buy art regardless of conditions. They are used to political turmoil and hyperinflation, and so are not intimidated by a recession."
In fact, recent stock market booms in Mexico and Argentina have swelled the ranks of art collectors in those countries, while worsening economic conditions in countries like Brazil and Peru have encouraged people there to invest their money in tangible assets, preferably abroad. There is also a large group of local collectors, mostly Cuban immigrants and their children, whose interest in Latin American art is both longstanding and logical.
"The Cubans who came here in the 60's and 70's, whether businessmen, doctors or architects, are now in a financial position that allows them to purchase art," said Richard Shack, a well-known local collector who is on the print acquisition committee of the Whitney Museum of Art in New York City. "They are partial to Latin American art, specifically Cuban art, and they are making a great impact."
 
A Lagging Market
 But veterans of the Latin American art scene here say that Miami has not been completely exempted from the economic downturn. There is considerable intellectual ferment and excitement going on, they say, but sales are another story.
"All the artists want to come here because the perception from Latin America is that Miami is a teeming international marketplace," said Fredric Snitzer, owner of Opus Gallery in Coral Gables. "But that still has to be translated into dollars. We're on the edge of this big thing happening, but it has not happened yet."
But at the very least, said Dora Valdes-Fauli of the Americas Collection, "a seed has been planted."
"The art market is cyclical, no question about it," she said, "but things have moved to a different level. A lot of people didn't know anything about Latin American art before all this began, and now they do."

HEADLINE: American Abdication in Europe

 BODY:
Given the collapse of the Soviet Union, Washington is right to withdraw most of its military might from Western Europe. But Washington is wrong to walk away from its political and economic role in Europe, especially in Eastern Europe and the Balkans.
The U.S. is largely conceding the urgent responsibility of Eastern European economic reconstruction to Germany. That's a mistake. It allows a fear of German domination to spread among anxious neighbors. And even the robust German economy will not be able to meet the vast development needs. Washington needs to provide more economic assistance and spur greater private investment, in cooperation with Germany. 
 In the political realm, the U.S. has been too diffident. If the current United Nations cease-fire effort in Yugoslavia fails, the Bush Administration can no longer stand aside and snipe at European initiatives to quell the strife. There, too, it would be better to act in partnership with Germany.
Washington's most conspicuous response to the collapse of Soviet power has been to extend NATO's reach to Eastern Europe by inviting Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland to join a new North Atlantic Cooperation Council. But the economic problems facing these countries are greater than their security needs. And they're likely to turn to the European Community, not NATO, for help. That means dealing with German businesses and banks. Washington can ill afford to stand aloof. Economic recovery is the best antidote to insecurity in the center of Europe. And America's aid, and presence, would be welcome along with Germany's. Yet the Administration, compared with its allies, is providing precious little direct aid to Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland.
The Administration claims empty pockets. But what it really lacks isn't money; it's the wisdom and the will to reallocate resources from a bloated defense budget.
The consequences of American abdication are clear in Yugoslavia. Washington tried to hold Yugoslavia together long after it had fallen apart. The U.S. disparaged German peacemaking initiatives and deferred to Britain. In so doing, it slowed formulation of a common policy to halt the aggression by the Serb-led Yugoslav Army.
In frustration, Germany moved to recognize Croatia and Slovenia. That divided the allies and sowed anti-German antagonism in Europe. The German initiative may yet facilitate the cease-fire just brokered by the U.N. But once Croatia is recognized, arms are likely to flow into the new state, and that could re-ignite the civil war.
In that event, Washington will have to map out a political course in Yugoslavia by working with Germany to bring about a cessation of the brutal war. How much better it would be to join forces, economically and politically, from the start.

HEADLINE: End the Horror in Haiti

 BODY:
By ratifying the compromise choice of Rene Theodore as prime minister next week, Haiti's Parliament can halt the country's steep slide into catastrophe. But it will require many months to repair the brutal damage done to democratic institutions in the three and a half months since soldiers ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Haiti's people cannot afford further delay.
The nomination of Mr. Theodore, a Communist, is the result of mediation efforts by the Organization of American States in which Washington played a constructive role. Despite his Communist label, U.S. diplomats see him as a principled moderate. 
 President Aristide has accepted the nominee, even though Mr. Theodore has called the President a dictator in the past. Mr. Theodore's name was put forward by parliamentary opponents of Mr. Aristide. They appreciated the nominee's stand against mob violence; they also recognized that compromise was the only alternative to the economic destruction threatened by an embargo imposed by the O.A.S. after the coup. But the full Parliament still must ratify the nomination.
Since the Sept. 30 coup, terror has returned to Haiti's streets. The isolated military has tried to intimidate President Aristide's supporters into silent submission. Duvalierist thugs have been released from prison and gone back on the attack. Press freedom has been stifled, peaceful assembly made impossible.
This reign of terror and the embargo have sent thousands of Haitians searching for temporary refuge abroad. The Bush Administration has been wrong to exclude these desperate people. But the long-term answer to the refugee problem is for Haiti to return to democratic rule.
The confirmation of Mr. Theodore can only be a beginning. His political base is tiny, and the army has little interest in restoring civilian authority. If the new Prime Minister is truly to manage daily affairs he will need a reliable security force at his disposal. An O.A.S. force may be required for as long as a year while Haiti's own forces are rendered safe for democracy.
Meanwhile, the embargo can be quickly eased, beginning with supplies for labor-intensive assembly operations. These companies provide vital jobs and their mainly foreign owners have had little to do with the recent political abuses. The remaining elements of the embargo can be conditionally lifted as soon as freedom of the press and assembly are reasonably secure.
Time and again the Haitian people have refused to bow to renewed dictatorship. Their courage has been inspiring, their suffering enormous. But the construction of a democratic society is a fragile enterprise. The work of months can be destroyed in just hours. This time the international community will have to stay on the scene until the project is strong enough to stand on its own.

HEADLINE: Link Economic Aid to Military Limits

BYLINE: By Nicole Ball and Robert S. McNamara; Nicole Ball is a visiting fellow at the Overseas Development Council. Robert S. McNamara was Secretary of Defense from 1961 to 1968 and president of the World Bank from 1968 to 1981.

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
When some 60 countries meet here later this month to discuss aid for the former Soviet republics, they should link long-term economic and technical assistance to progress in shifting priorities from the military to economic development. This demand would not be unprecedented: lenders to some third-world countries have started to put such conditions on their aid.
Although 11 of the new republics agreed last month as members of the Commonwealth of Independent States to a unified nuclear command and a timetable for destroying or removing nuclear weapons from Belarus (the former Byelorussia) and Ukraine, substantial uncertainties remain. 
 Kazakhstan has said it intends to remain a nuclear power as long as Russia does. Neither the Start treaty, which would reduce strategic weapons by about 25 percent, nor the treaty on conventional forces in Europe, has been ratified. Ukraine, Azerbaijan and Moldova are setting up independent armies. Ukraine alone has plans for a standing force of 450,000 troops. And Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, is challenging Ukraine's claim that it should control the Black Sea fleet of the defunct Soviet Union.
All this suggests that the republics may continue to devote substantial resources to the military. Not only would this run counter to American and European efforts to shrink military budgets, it would also absorb funds the republics urgently need to stabilize their chaotic economies.
Over the last year, international lenders have grown increasingly impatient with the high military spending of many developing countries. The money spent on the military exceeds the combined spending on health and education in some 20 developing countries. The heads of the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund recently warned that such expenditures are causing them to question whether their funds are being put to the best use.
Germany said in September that it would cut aid to India by nearly 25 percent in 1992 unless New Delhi reduced its military budget. Pakistan and China are expected to receive similar warnings. In October, Japan told North Korea that to obtain diplomatic recognition and aid it must halt construction of the Yongbyon plutonium plant. A similar strategy should be applied to the former Soviet republics.
Last month, Secretary of State James Baker outlined security measures the U.S. hopes the republics will adopt. He called on the new states to maintain the unified nuclear command, adhere to the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty without creating new nuclear weapons, carry out the conventional forces treaty, limit arms buildups and convert military industries to civilian use.
At the conference on aid in Washington, the U.S. and other donors should begin discussing how to make economic and technical assistance contingent on these and similar policies, like ratifying the Start treaty and reducing military expenditures.
Moreover, in line with the mandate received from its board last fall, the I.M.F. should review the republics' military budgets and make its findings available to the World Bank, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. That way, all aid decisions will be based on the same information.
Tying economic assistance to limits on military spending is a sensitive issue that has at times led to charges of foreign meddling. Nonetheless, many lenders argue that when military budgets undermine development efforts, aid should be reduced.
By making it clear that the military cannot take precedence over development, the U.S., the other donor countries and the world's lending institutions can insure that the $50 billion to $60 billion they provide annually will help, not hinder, the creation of a more peaceful world.

HEADLINE: Give the City's Riders a Break

BYLINE: By Barbara J. Fife; Barbara J. Fife, Deputy Mayor for Planning and Development, is a member of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board.

 BODY:
The choice the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board faced on Dec. 31 -- to raise subway and bus fares from $1.15 to $1.25 or risk serious financial and operating difficulties for the Transit Authority -- highlights the need for long-term changes in how our mass-transit system is financed.
The Transit Authority's continuing financial difficulties can be substantially solved by a more equitable distribution of the surplus toll revenues of the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, which, like the Transit Authority, is a division of the M.T.A. The Triborough Authority operates seven toll bridges and two tunnels in New York City, and a portion of the toll revenues from them have supported mass transit since 1967. 
 In October, city representatives on the M.T.A. board proposed such a redistribution, but the Legislature has not yet acted.
In a Dec. 2 letter to Assemblyman Thomas Catapano describing the Transit Authority's problems, Peter E. Stangl, chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said, "The greatest revenue loss is due to a fall-off in subsidies, the financial assistance authorized by the State Legislature to balance the T.A.'s budget." He added, "Rather than raising the fare, I would much prefer to see the lost subsidies replaced."
Mass transit in the region is dominated by the city Transit Authority's subways and buses, which carry nine of every 10 M.T.A. passengers. Assuring financial equity in that system, which is vital to the regional economy, is a tough balancing act.
While the greatest inequities originate from Federal and state policies that shortchange mass transit in our region, the allocation of financial subsidies within the region is basically unfair.
Although Transit Authority riders' fares paid for almost 60 percent of the operating expenses of New York City subways and buses in 1990, riders on the Long Island Railroad and Metro-North -- the M.T.A.'s two suburban lines -- only had to finance about 48 percent and 54 percent, respectively, of the cost of their rides.
Nowhere is the unfairness more apparent than in the way the Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority's surplus tolls are distributed. Originally, those tolls were earmarked exclusively for the Transit Authority. But in 1971 the city and Legislature agreed to give part of the surplus to the two commuter railroads to alleviate their financial problems.
The formula gave the Transit Authority the first $24 million for each year and divided the remainder equally between the Transit Authority and the commuter railroads.
The surplus has grown, and the $24 million has become a smaller share of the total. It was about 33 percent of the total $79 million surplus in 1972 but only 5 percent of the $458 million surplus in 1991. As a result, the Transit Authority's share of the surplus has declined from two-thirds in 1972 to slightly over half in 1991.
Today, city residents pay about 67 percent of the bridge and tunnel tolls. The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority's origin and destination surveys suggest that about two-thirds of the bridge and tunnel users live in New York City while only 15 percent to 20 percent live in Westchester and Long Island. Thus, the share of revenue that city residents pay is substantially higher than the share of the benefits they get from the subsidy.
New York City residents are providing increasing subsidies to suburban commuters. These city residents have done their share to help the Transit Authority maintain financial stability. Now it is up to the Legislature to revise the outdated 20-year-old formula so that a fairer allocation of surplus revenues can create greater equity in the regional transit system.

That Stands for Car

BYLINE: By RUSSELL BAKER

 BODY:
We are adapting Meredith Willson's splendid show "The Music Man" for modern audiences. As you remember, it starts something like this:
Ever hear about a salesman name of Bush? 
 Knew a Bush once, line was brushes, worked New England. Yankee territory. Pal of Loman's. Willy Loman. Name was Andy. Andy Bush. Andy Bush the brush man. Had a scandal up there. Up in Maine. Farmer's daughter . . .
That's not my Bush.
Not your Bush?
Bush I mean is George.
Bush named George? Bush named George? What's his line? Is it pickles?
Is it crackers? Knew a George once. Anvil salesman. Your Bush an anvil salesman?
The Bush I mean sells cars.
What's he sell? Model T? Reo roadster? Big weigh-a-ton German Duesenberg? Packard? LaSalle? Studebaker? Henry J? Hudson? Ford V-8? Four-holer Buick?
Sells 'em all, sells 'em all. Except for Duesenberg. If it ain't American, he don't sell it.
His line's American?
Hundred percent, true-blue, these-colors-don't-run (and-sometimes-the-cars-don't-either) American. It ain't American, Bush don't sell it.
What's his territory, this fellow Bush?
That's what I mean: his territory. Anybody can sell American in Hamtramck, Custer's Bend, Washington's Gap, Wheeling West By God Virginia, Union Deposit Pennsylvania, Orrinhatch Utah . . .
So what's his territory?
Japan.
Japan?
Japan!
Isn't that Japanese territory?
Japan's his territory?
Fellow works that old Nippon territory. Don't try telling him. Not him. No sir. Not him. Not George. Don't try telling him nobody sold a Henry J in that Nippon territory, not in that Japan territory, not since Willy Loman passed out while driving to Sapporo, drifted off the road and wiped out a noodle restaurant owned by a family named Toyota, thus forcing them to start all over in a new line of work.
Doesn't he know that Japan territory is even meaner than New England under Republican governors?
Doesn't know the territory. Doesn't care. Not this Bush. Not George Bush. He just wades, by gum and Jim Dandy, right into that Nippon territory, ready to sell American.
How's he do it? How's he sell 'em?
That's where this Bush is clever, boys. He brings the top managers of the American car companies along with him.
Top brass?
Detroit's biggest.
The two-million, four-million-a-year salary guys before bonuses, stock plans and super pension upgrades?
What's his pitch? What's his pitch?
Simple, boys. He shows the Japanese territory how much money Detroit's biggests get for running companies that make the cars he's selling. Tells 'em, "Look at these fellas, Nipponese, and eat your liver because they're drawing down ten, fifteen times what your own home-grown car tycoons are taking home."
How's that work? How's that sell 'em?
Use your head. Don't you see? "Ah so," think Nipponese. "Ten times as much for American bosses. American cars must be ten times better than Nipponese."
Brings the bosses? That's his secret?
Brings Iacocca.
Great Iacocca?
Father of the Leemobile.
Father of the far-stretched Leemousine?
Brings General Motors Stempel.
G.M.'s dynamic Stempel? The Father of Mass Unemployment? What's Bush's thinking? Trying to scare 'em? Trying to scare the Japanese? Demonstrating the terrifying job-destruction know-how America has at its disposal?
When you've got the muscle, a good salesman doesn't hesitate to use it. But what you've got to like about this Bush is, he's got gall.
Bush's got gall?
Sure. Look at that car he's selling. Look real close. Notice it's got the steering wheel on the wrong side? That's a salesman, boys. A whole bunch of salesmen. And when the market fails everybody who doesn't get fired gets his pay raised.
Yes, it still needs work.

HEADLINE: Hong Kong Had to Return Vietnam Refugees

 BODY:
To the Editor
As members of the Hong Kong Students Association studying in the United States at Princeton University, we are concerned that readers may not have gotten the full picture from your coverage in "Hong Kong Ousts More Boat People" (news article, Dec. 11). 
 Since the end of the Vietnam War in 1975, Hong Kong, along with other Southeast Asian countries, has agreed to act as a first port of asylum for political refugees fleeing Vietnam, with the understanding that they would eventually be granted permission to settle in the West. Yet, the speed with which Western countries resettled the refugees failed to keep up with the Vietnamese exodus.
As a growing sign of frustration, a few states, such as Malaysia and Thailand, have rescinded the policy of first port of asylum. Hong Kong has offered refuge to more than 175,000 Vietnamese, 63,000 of whom are still stranded in the territory. Over the last 15 years, the tide of new arrivals flooding Hong Kong shores has shown no sign of receding: 32,611 Vietnamese landed in the territory in the first 10 months of 1989, compared with 6,788 in 1980.
No Western country, including the United States, has taken the lead in solving the problem. The West warns Hong Kong not to revoke the asylum policy, while claiming it cannot accept so many boat people. The United States, with 5,000 times the area of Hong Kong, has absorbed only 15 times more people. Present policy strands the unsettled boat people in Hong Kong and other first ports of asylum to await a better solution. But no real efforts have been made to find a solution. As the situation worsens, Hong Kong has been left to find alternative remedies.
With an area of 1,000 square kilometers -- roughly the size of New York City -- Hong Kong supports a population of 6 million. Accommodating 63,000 boat people has put a strain on Hong Kong's limited resources. Critics have castigated Hong Kong for the "appalling" conditions in refugee camps. To accommodate these boat people, camps have been built, food and necessities provided, education, recreation, medical care and legal aid offered. Hong Kong has contributed $340 million, while reimbursement from the United Nations amounts to a mere $80 million.
Nonetheless, our efforts often go unrecognized. Critics have reprimanded Hong Kong for using batons to disperse factional riots among the Vietnamese; however, they often ignore that rioting Vietnamese make weapons and Molotov cocktails from wire fences, drainage pipes and bottles -- simple weapons but lethal. Police, armed with self-defense gear, are only called in to break up fights and protect the boat people.
The United States has been repatriating Haitians, whom it classifies as economic migrants, but when Hong Kong is condemned for sending back economic migrants from Vietnam, no one questions that a double standard is being used.

HEADLINE: Rensselaer County Economy Makes Comeback

 BODY:
To the Editor:
Re "Rensselaer County Doesn't Need a Third Exit" by Francis W. Rodgers (letter, Dec. 14): 
 In the 19th century, the Rensselaer gateway region of New York State gave birth to this country's industrial revolution. The Erie Canal, the New York Central and Delaware & Hudson Railroads, the Watervliet Arsenal, Burden Iron, Cluett Peabody and the other industrial giants that made our region and indeed the United States strong are today either gone or faded.
However, over the last decade, as the Rust Belt rusted, we made the investment in emerging technology industries. Today, our region is a vital part of the Northeast's Brain Belt. As the country languishes in the midst of this lingering recession, the flower of economic vitality has begun to grow again here in Rensselaer County.
In what were once fallow fields, Rensselaer Technology Park is home to 1,200 jobs, as companies like Nynex and Metropolitan thrive. What Mr. Rodgers calls a "boondoggle" will be a link from Interstate 90 to Rensselaer Technology Park, Hudson Valley Community College, a growing, nationally prominent two-year college, and on into a regenerating Troy.
We are fortunate that people of vision embraced the I-90 connector to assist in our region's economic rebirth.

HEADLINE: Sowing the Killing Fields

BYLINE: By Henry Kamm; Henry Kamm, a longtime foreign correspondent for The Times, has covered Cambodia periodically since 1970.

 BODY:
THE TRAGEDY OF CAMBODIAN HISTORY
Politics, War, and Revolution Since 1945.
By David P. Chandler.
Illustrated. 396 pp. New Haven:
Yale University Press. $35. 
 THE name "Cambodia," like "Auschwitz," has become synonymous with modern barbarism in its ultimate dimension. In public opinion, Pol Pot ranks with Hitler as evil personified. Yet Cambodia's remoteness and isolation, its small size and economic weakness, its role as object rather than subject in foreign relations have left its high symbolic stature largely unsupported by knowledge of what really happened and why.
Cambodia was the most fortunate country in Indochina until 1970, because it avoided being drawn more than marginally into the wars that were ravaging Vietnam and Laos. But it stumbled out of its neutrality after the 1970 coup that overthrew Prince Norodom Sihanouk. This ushered in the tragedy, not yet ended, that David P. Chandler, a former American diplomat in Cambodia and now the research director of the Center of Southeast Asian Studies at Monash University in Australia, has taken for the title of his instructive book.
Mr. Chandler's spadework in French, American and British archives, the multitude of interviews he conducted with participants and observers of many nationalities, and his readings in the largely French-language Cambodian press going back to colonial days have enabled him to construct as complete a historical narrative as has ever been compiled.
He has enriched "The Tragedy of Cambodian History" with judicious appraisals of the major figures, such as Prince Sihanouk, the key actor. Mr. Chandler is generous in recognizing the immense diplomatic skill by which the Prince gained early independence from France and limited the selfish intentions on his country of North and South Vietnam, the United States and Thailand. At the same time, he is justly critical of the Prince's cruelty to opponents, his highhandedness with critics and suspected rivals, his tolerance of corruption by his family and courtiers, and his self-indulgence in his wayward hobbies, like making and starring in feature films -- all of which led to his overthrow.
The author sheds light on the student years of Pol Pot and other Communist leaders in France, where gifted scholarship students were turned into incipient revolutionaries. (One is left to wonder whether the shaping of those who made their country a killing field was the final gift of colonial power.)
Mr. Chandler is also evenhanded in apportioning responsibility for the tragedy to the various foreign powers who interjected themselves. But he disappoints the high hopes that his title awakens. His evenhandedness has kept him from writing the tragedy he promised; as a historian he fails to infuse his narrative with the moral imagination that discerns and defines the nature of tragedy.
Mr. Chandler no doubt disapproves of the two Vietnams exporting their war to their neighbor. He surely does not condone the United States' policy of financing and arming the anti-Communist Lon Nol Government and spurring it into continuing a long-lost war beyond its people's endurance, although Washington considered the regime incompetent in all respects. He cannot approve of the massive, indiscriminate American bombing of the countryside to delay a Communist victory the United States knew to be inevitable.
And clearly he feels as the rest of the world does about the Pol Pot regime's lunatic project in social engineering, which in the name of Revolution took, according to Mr. Chandler, the lives of one million Cambodians.
But such attitudes do not come alive in Mr. Chandler's discussion. In an evenhandedness that approaches impartiality between oppressors and oppressed, he denies himself the passion that makes the writing of history literature, a passion that should stimulate in the reader of this book outrage at everyone's cruel use of a nation of farmers and fishermen.
"A million Cambodians, or one in eight, died from warfare, starvation, overwork, misdiagnosed diseases, and executions," Mr. Chandler writes on his first page. "Most of these deaths, however, were never intended by [Democratic Kampuchea, the Pol Pot regime]."
The author concedes that such lack of evil intent does not "alleviate the horror" or relieve the leadership of responsibility. But his concession does not take the curse off that unfortunate "however."
 
 
 
POL POT'S OBSESSION
 Pol Pot and his colleagues believed in the necessity of revolution. Some of them, by 1975, had spent over 20 years attempting to bring one to fruition. Being a revolutionary was a full-time, lifelong occupation. In describing Pol Pot, a former companion of his appropriated the celebrated remark made by Axelrod about Lenin: that he was "the only man who had no thoughts but thoughts about the revolution, and who in his sleep dreamt of revolution." Others . . . had similarly incandescent views. They were not prepared to abandon them in the wake of their victory because they discovered that preconditions, social analyses, or human resources for a revolution in Cambodia were lacking or in short supply. . . .
The [Communist] leadership's choosing to wage revolution everywhere in Cambodia did not spring from a study of Cambodian social conditions or from consultation with others but from a conviction on the part of the . . . leaders that a recognizably Communist revolution needed to be waged. If the right preconditions did not exist, that problem could be overcome by revolutionary fervor. The absence of a proletariat in Cambodia, for example, was not seen as an impediment to progress. An industrial labor force could be created from poor peasants and young children operating en masse. Cambodia soon became a gigantic prison farm.

HEADLINE: Wilder's Flier

BYLINE: BY B. DRUMMOND AYRES JR.; B. Drummond Ayres Jr. is a national correspondent covering the mid-Atlantic region for The Times.

 BODY:
Lawrence Douglas Wilder, Governor of Virginia and candidate for President, is in Philadelphia to sell his political wares. His first stop is a news conference at the Four Seasons Hotel.
"Where do you stand on the political spectrum?" a television reporter wants to know. 
 "I don't consider myself liberal, conservative or moderate," Wilder replies.
Under further questioning, the 60-year-old Democrat, his voice Southern soft as cheese grits, yields a bit and describes himself as "a fiscal conservative with a social conscience and a deep concern for the country's middle class." But essentially, he reiterates, he does not attach any particular label to himself.
Which raises another question: Can a black Democratic Presidential candidate who often sounds like a white, Republican plutocrat be taken seriously by his own party's leaders and voters?
"I expect to be elected President of the United States," he answers dismissively.
Then Wilder, a surprisingly slight man, barely 5 feet 9 inches, with a shining silver coif and an elegant bespoke suit, plunges into the lobby of the hotel, to work the front-desk crew, the bellhops and, finally, the doorman.
"Wasn't that the Governor from Virginia?" one desk clerk asks another as Wilder exits.
"Yeah," the other clerk replies, turning quickly to the next check-in.
DOUG WILDER -- A GRANDSON OF slaves who grew up in the midst of segregation and what he calls the "gentle poverty" of the predominantly black Church Hill section of Richmond, and then scratched and battled his way to the top, first becoming a millionaire defense lawyer and later the first black ever elected Governor of an American state -- is having trouble making an impression on the 1992 Presidential campaign. Among the six major announced Democratic candidates, he is clearly one of the also-rans in raising money, organizing a campaign staff, and, perhaps most significantly, honing a sharp message.
Wilder has been called a political chameleon, a man with no fixed ideological address. In his home state, he has a reputation both for opportunistically switching sides on issues and for coldly turning on his friends. Those who know him say he is so consumed with politics -- politics as process rather than politics as ideas -- that he seldom talks about anything else.
He can fly from Richmond, his state capital, to Concord, N.H., a one-hour trip on his Commonwealth of Virginia jet, and never look out the window, not even when the dome of the Capitol of the United States looms on the horizon, nor when the towers of Manhattan suddenly jut up directly below. He is too busy talking politics, holding forth from his special seat embroidered with the state's golden seal. But there is no talk here of programs or reforms, nothing about how to house the homeless or how to deal with Boris Yeltsin -- only about how the political game is played.
"Now you take my friend Bill Fears," he says, referring to a veteran Virginia State Senator who failed to win re-election last fall. "He's always loved to run that mouth. It finally caught up with him when he made that quip about how some new drunk-driver law would take all the fun out of driving. Killed him. Just killed him. He didn't really mean it. But when you're a public figure. . . ."
The words are still tumbling out when the plane taxis up to a waiting limousine in Concord.
Politics is more than Doug Wilder's one true love. Politics is his best friend.
OVER MORE THAN TWO DECADES in politics, Doug Wilder has never lost an election. In Virginia, voters have succumbed time after time to the man's considerable charms, his quick wit and his easy courtliness, a trait that moves him, even as Governor, to hold open doors for others and to bow from the waist when greeting women. True, Virginians are disenchanted with Wilder now, angry that he is running for President after only two years in the Governor's mansion and at a time when the state faces its worst economic crisis in half a century. But over the years, they have habitually forgiven Wilder his flaws, and have rewritten political and racial history by making him the first black since Reconstruction to serve in the State Senate (from 1970 to 1986) and then by electing him Lieutenant Governor in 1985 and Governor in 1989.
Now the question is whether the kind of politics that has worked for Wilder for nearly 25 years in Virginia will play beyond the state's borders. With the Feb. 18 primary in New Hampshire only five weeks away, the smart money says Wilder's candidacy is in trouble, that he has a lot of catching up to do if he is to execute his game plan: to stay alive through New Hampshire and then to try to make a strong showing in early March in the Southern primaries, where he hopes to be able to attract large blocs of black voters.
The Governor, the conventional political wisdom says, is out of his depth, politically adrift with no real campaign organization (what strategizing there is comes almost exclusively from Wilder himself and his longtime political adviser, Paul Goldman) and no real money (as of late December, he'd raised only $198,315, which put him dead last in the Democratic field). But Wilder's supporters point out that the Governor has always been a slow starter; his Virginia campaigns were all plagued in the early going by loose organization and vague message. By the end, however, he has consistently managed to find a symbol or issue that not only draws donors and energizes his campaign organization but also powerfully connects with voters. In his 1985 campaign for Lieutenant Governor, for instance, he grabbed the attention of Virginia's electorate with a marathon 1,500-mile trek back and forth across the state in a modest station wagon.
If Wilder can find a way to capture a significant portion of black voters in the early primaries -- to fill the void created by the Rev. Jesse Jackson's absence -- he could go to the Democratic convention in New York City next summer with some leverage. His campaign has begun to focus more and more on racial issues, but Wilder, whose speeches tend to drone on and on rather than soar soulfully, is no Jesse Jackson when it comes to galvanizing the black electorate.
While conceding that his candidacy is "the longest of long shots," Wilder insists nonetheless that he is electable. Over and over he repeats what has become a kind of personal mantra: "I expect to be elected President of the United States."
Still, there is little evidence so far that predominantly liberal Democratic voters are ready to nominate a card-carrying fiscal conservative, and even less evidence that a black man can be elected President should he somehow be nominated. So why is Doug Wilder -- barely halfway through his four-year term as Governor of a state with more than its share of knotty financial problems -- embarking on this seemingly hopeless political quest?
The quick answer is that he has nothing to lose. Under the Virginia Constitution, no governor can succeed himself, a rare prohibition in state politics. Beyond that, Wilder no doubt hopes to emerge from the nominating season if not with the nomination itself, then at least with some national clout in his own party, specifically as the pre-eminent power broker of black votes. Should Wilder succeed in becoming even a partial heir to Jesse Jackson's constituency, he could be in position for another Presidential bid in 1996 or, alternatively, for a run in 1994 or 1996 at one of Virginia's Senate seats.
Then there is the possibility, often bruited about in political circles, that Wilder is really after a spot on the 1992 ticket as the Vice Presidential nominee. Though few give this much chance of happening, Wilder's supporters are forever toying aloud with this idea, arguing that their candidate could bring much-needed ideological and racial balance to the Democratic ticket.
"People who sell a possibility like this short do it at their own risk," warns Paul Goldman, the tart ex-New Yorker who is chairman of Virginia's Democratic Party and has been the Governor's chief political schemer and dreamer since 1984. "Wilder is the most underestimated politician in America today."
Though Wilder insists his sole goal is the Presidency, more likely he is simply seeing how far he can take his candidacy. His philosophy of public life, he has often said, is to "get a little bit today and come back for the rest tomorrow."
WILDER HAS BEEN DAMAGED by the growing perception that he is prone to sudden about-faces on issues and to displays of temper with friends and foes alike.
"Well, these are things I have to deal with," he admits. "They are perceptions that don't help."
The sharp edges of Wilder's personality were clearly on display one day last fall, when Jesse Jackson came to the Governor's mansion to discuss the 1992 campaign. At the top of Jackson's agenda was a complaint; a number of Virginia school districts had taken the Wilder administration to court in an effort to get more funds. Wilder was obviously irked by having to listen to a lecture from the man who remains perhaps the chief obstacle to his national political ambitions.
After conferring in private for about an hour, the two men emerged from the mansion and walked over to a clutch of waiting reporters and television cameras. Wilder, his arm around Jackson's shoulder, spoke glowingly of his rival.
"And, oh, yes, Jesse," Wilder concluded abruptly, his tone changing. "Don't come down here again talking about schools unless you bring money."
Jackson took a half-step back, struggling to crack a smile. Wilder then turned his back on Jackson and began to chat with bystanders, leaving his rival to make an unceremonious exit.
This is the way Wilder plays the political game. Courteous as he customarily is, he comes at those who cross him, or those he believes have crossed him, with a quick vengeance, political fist balled.
Last spring, his longtime feud with Senator Charles S. Robb, his major Democratic rival in Virginia, bubbled up again in the open, becoming so rancorous it made news from coast to coast. Party leaders in and out of the state warned that both men risked their political futures if they continued to squabble like petulant children over the Governor's charge that the Senator had tapped his phone and the Senator's countercharge that the Governor had ordered a police investigation of his private life. But the animosity between Wilder and Robb is virtually certain to flare up again. There is little political or personal chemistry between the two, and in the background lurks the possibility that Wilder will challenge Robb for his Senate seat two years from now.
Wilder also came off less than well in the surprise departure of his press secretary of the last two years, Laura Dillard. Asked to explain what happened, the Governor initially refused to comment. Meanwhile, several Wilder aides began calling reporters around the state, suggesting that Dillard had been forced to leave over a series of anti-Semitic and anti-black remarks. But later, investigations by several Virginia newspapers revealed that Dillard's sin had been to dare question whether Wilder ought to be running for President before completing his term as Governor.
"You can be with Doug 99 times in a row, but if you're against him the 100th time, he'll say, 'He was never with me,' " the Governor's chief of staff, J. T. Shropshire, once said. In spite of this oft-repeated observation, Shropshire has not lost his position.
Wilder's contentiousness comes through even in everyday conversation. He sees all politics -- and most of life -- as a bruising contact sport. "Let me tell you why Jesse Jackson has been such a success," he says. "Jesse makes people cower politically. I don't blame him."
From the start, Wilder's basic campaign theme has been that the Democrats will never recapture the Presidency until they stop nominating liberal tax-and-spend candidates. Instead, he argues, the party must put a new kind of politician on the national stage, a realist who blends social compassion with balanced budgets -- not by raising taxes, but by eliminating "niceties" in favor of "necessities." That's the way, Wilder boasts, he has always run and won in Virginia.
But lately the Governor has begun to shift more than a little on the tax issue. "I wouldn't automatically veto a tax increase in Virginia," he now says. "But it would have to be bipartisan."
Wilder, however, has pinned his Presidential hopes on the claim that he successfully balanced Virginia's budget without raising taxes. Does this mean he is now backing off?
"Not at all, not at all," he insists. "It would be irresponsible to flatly rule out any increase, especially one with bipartisan support."
Then he chuckles. "Clever, though," he says, slapping his knee for effect. "Damn clever way to handle those Republicans."
WILDER GREW UP IN A LARGE, deeply religious Baptist family. His father, Robert, was an insurance salesman and his mother, Beulah, worked as a maid. The second-youngest of eight children, he put himself through the predominantly black Virginia Union University in Richmond, won a Bronze Star as an infantryman in the Korean War, and under the G.I. bill went through Howard University Law School in Washington. While in law school, he married a Howard undergraduate, Eunice Montgomery. Before divorcing in 1978, the couple had three children: two daughters, Lynn, 32, and Loren, 28, and a son, Lawrence Jr., 29.
It might come as a surprise to Wilder-watchers today that in his political youth, he positioned himself as a liberal, and a confrontational one at that. After entering the State Senate, he began to sport a bushy Afro and to press demands for fair-housing legislation, more minority hiring in business and making the death penalty unconstitutional. In his maiden speech, he charged that the state of Virginia, including its Legislature, was racist to the core, and called heretically for dropping the official state song, "Carry Me Back to Old Virginia," which contained the words "massah" and "darkie."
Wilder made little progress on his demands, and his career seemed headed in the same direction. But then he abruptly changed course. He became one of the Legislature's great compromisers, a man who would drop a demand here to gain a concession there, who would do a favor to get a favor. Thereafter, he ascended steadily through the ranks of the Senate, eventually becoming chairman of the powerful committee that oversees state appointments. In 1984, when he could not persuade his fellow senators to designate a holiday in memory of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he engineered the ultimate compromise: he persuaded them to set aside a day on which Dr. King would be remembered -- the same day that honored Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson.
Wilder's strong suit has always been his ability to take the political pulse of the electorate, rather than the everyday details of governing. His speeches are packed not with facts and specific proposals but with symbolically charged rhetoric, telling vignettes and sharp digs -- the mention of David Duke and George Bush in the same sentence, the heart-tugging tale of a sick child who died because her poor family could not afford health care, the flat promise that in the first few weeks of his Presidency he will eliminate $50 billion in Government programs, military spending and bureaucratic waste.
"He's positioning and repositioning himself all the time," says Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist who has followed the Governor's career closely. "My guess is that by the end of this campaign, he'll try to be the broker of the black vote, which would give him the kind of clout Jesse had. He'll demand that the party not ignore him, because he's the only black candidate in a party that has to have the black vote to win. That's his kind of positioning. He may not pull it off. But you'll hear the noise."
In the 1989 gubernatorial race in Virginia, Wilder won by putting together an unusual coalition of black and middle-class white voters. Running against J. Marshall Coleman, a Republican former state attorney general, Wilder managed, in a single ideological mouthful, to support, among other things, both abortion rights and the death penalty (he'd flip-flopped on that issue since his early State Senate days). His abortion-rights stand proved critical, drawing big support from women and those in the state's heavily liberal Washington suburbs, and enabled him to squeeze out a 0.3 percent margin of victory.
The Governor says he intends to replicate that election feat nationally, that he can assemble the same coalition from coast to coast. "If it can happen in Virginia," he argues, "it can happen anywhere."
Increasingly in his Presidential campaign, however, Wilder appears to be concentrating less on putting together a black-white coalition than on an all-out pursuit of black voters. He has hired some of Jackson's former aides -- among them Joe Johnson, a top Jackson operative who has become Wilder's campaign manager -- and his speeches contain ever more criticisms of President Bush's handling of civil rights issues. "The Bush Administration's resistance to strong civil rights measures helps produce the David Dukes," he says.
Meanwhile, black politiciansaround the country have adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Mayor W. Wilson Goode of Philadelphia is typical. "If Doug delivers the message," he says, "he'll get the vote."
While Jesse Jackson's aides are urging black officials to withhold their commitments until the race is further along, Jackson himself will say only that if "the Honorable Governor of Virginia" expects to inherit the votes of his Rainbow Coalition, he will have to "earn them the old-fashioned way, by working for them."
IN 1984, WHEN DOUG WILDER announced his candidacy for Lieutenant Governor, he stood in the State Capitol beneath a large oil portrait of Harry F. Byrd Sr., the former United States Senator whose name is virtually synonymous with old-style Southern segregation. That gesture would have been impossible for many blacks in politics, but for Wilder it was just part of the process. Coming from a senate district that was predominantly black, Wilder knew that to win a statewide office in Virginia he would need to reach out for white votes, and there was no more revered political figure in the Old Dominion than Byrd, who led the "massive resistance," Virginia's abortive struggle against desegregation in the 50's.
But Wilder did not stop there. Later in the campaign, he permitted himself to be photographed in front of Confederate flags and ran a television ad in which a burly white rural sheriff endorsed him. But when backers of his Republican opponent, State Senator John H. Chichester, tried to tag him as a liberal, Wilder played the other side of the race card. "That's a code word for racism," he declared.
Wilder was never a major figure in the civil rights movement. In the 60's, when many of his peers were in the streets demonstrating for racial equality, he was focusing his energies on building a career in law, primarily as a defense attorney and the founder of his own firm, and later a career in politics. "During the days of the movement, I figured I could be more effective behind the scenes than up on the barricades," Wilder explains. "I worked on making myself the best lawyer and politician possible on the theory that I could best serve not by being a demonstrator in handcuffs but by seeking to get the handcuffs off the demonstrator and the repressive laws changed. I have no second thoughts about that."
And there is no denying the historic achievement of his successful campaigns in Virginia, where no black had held high elective office for more than a century.
For all of his triumphs in Virginia politics, however, Wilder has amassed an unusually wide array of enemies and detractors within the state. His feuds and switchbacks, his decision to run for President in Virginia's hour of economic need and, yes, the fact that as a divorced man for almost 15 years, he sometimes dates white women, among them Patricia Kluge, the former wife of the billionaire John Kluge -- all have pushed down his statewide approval rating to an embarrassing 23 percent in mid-December, the lowest figure for a Virginia governor in history.
"Those of us who've dealt with him can tell people around the country that Doug Wilder is not always a nice man," says Steve Haner, the director of the Republican caucus in the Virginia Legislature. "In last fall's state elections, our candidates ran as much against him as their real opponents, and we made the biggest gains in a century. How's he going to explain that?"
Wilder's answer: "Incumbents were the targets of voter discontent, and that discontent can be blamed on the Bush Administration."
ON A RAW DECEMBER DAY, Wilder has come to the State Capitol at Concord, N.H., braving 10-degree temperatures to hand the New Hampshire Secretary of State a check for $1,000, the entry fee for the Feb. 18 primary. The dozen reporters on hand to chronicle the moment want to know -- given the Governor's low standing in the polls and equally low standing on the fund-raising front -- whether Wilder is serious about his candidacy. Does he really have a shot, or is he angling for the Vice Presidential spot?
But all the reporters get is another recitation of the mantra. "I tell you I expect to be elected President of the United States," Wilder says.
Outside the filing office, the Governor bumps into an old acquaintance, Eugene J. McCarthy, the former Senator from Minnesota. Back in 1968, McCarthy ran a legendary race in the New Hampshire primary against the Vietnam War and all but destroyed Lyndon Johnson's hopes for re-election. Now McCarthy makes the Presidential run nearly every four years, evidently just for the nostalgia of it.
"Doug," McCarthy says, grasping the Governor's hand. "All you have to do is beat the spread."
Wilder gives out a hearty laugh. He likes the spread in New Hampshire, where the morning line has him as the biggest long shot in the race -- sixth in a field of six. To beat it, he figures, all he has to do is run better than only one of his opponents.
"I'm dead serious about staying in this race," Wilder declares, as he exits the Capitol building. "But if I don't do well in the Southern primaries, it's all over for me."
But after watching the Governor on the campaign trail for several months, most Democratic officials remain skeptical. "He's relying too much on generalities about what he's done in the past and not offering enough vision for the future," says George Bruno, a Democratic National Committeeman from New Hampshire who has aligned himself with Gov. Bill Clinton of Arkansas. "It's hard to figure out what he really stands for. He was one of the first to announce his candidacy, but he's been slow getting his team on the ground, slow winning commitments. He'd better keep in mind that he's running for President, not Governor."
Wilder himself may be starting to realize how different politics is in the national arena. Near the end of his news conference at the Four Seasons Hotel, he appeared to hedge his promise to fight to the end, and he gave himself a possible out. Almost as an aside, he allowed that if the economic situation in Virginia continued to get worse, requiring more of his attention, he might be forced to reassess whether to continue his candidacy.
But a few hours later, during a campaign appearance at a black church center, the old Wilder bluster was back. Looking directly into a television news camera, he proclaimed, his voice keening with confidence: "I am a lion. The slaughterhouse of failure is not my destiny."

Quick, Henry, the Fix

BYLINE: By William Safire

 BODY:
QUICK FIX STILL LIKELY to tempt Bush, Congress," headlined The Washington Times, despite the advice of sobersided pundits that went, "Don't just do something, stand there."
Lawrence A. Kudlow, chief economist of Bear, Stearns & Company, argued that "the wrong tax cut is a temporary quick fix that puts money into people's pockets." 
 In a diplomatic context, Secretary of State James A. Baker 3d told Russians that "there are not quick fixes and there are no simple solutions."
And President Bush, commenting on indictments filed against Libyan terrorists, pointed out that the charges were not "some quick hit, quick fix on trying to find the answer."
Perhaps subconsciously, the President stumbled on the derivation of the phrase being used to decry a panacea for cure-alls. A hit, now widely used as slang for "assassination," has also been used since 1949 to describe the sensation of instant satisfaction experienced by the narcotics user; in "The Man With the Golden Arm," Nelson Algren wrote about the way an injection "hit the heart like a runaway locomotive, it hit like a falling wall." Long before that, a shot of dope was called a fix-up, a compound first used in 1867 by the British historian William Hepworth Dixon, who wrote in his book "New America" about an "eye-opener, fix-ups, or any other Yankee deception in the shape of liquor." To get a fix-up changed to get fixed in the 1930's, and reverted to a shortened noun -- to get a fix -- a generation later.
The first use of quick fix has not been located, but in the mid-1970's Newsweek began applying the drug term to tax cuts. Soon it lost its drug sense; in 1986, the Canadian Labor Congress denounced drug testing as "a quick-fix solution," apparently unaware of the aptness of its choice of words.
The sense of fix in quick fix meaning "cure-all that cures nothing" is in competition with the slang sense of the verb fix as "to influence the outcome corruptly," as in the race was fixed, or in noun form, the fix is in. Curious, how the standard verb fix, meaning "set, fasten, make firm or permanent," has been so often associated with corruption (Mr. Fix-it is an influence-peddler, and price fixers go to jail). The most voguish sense of quick fix is "any slapped-together solution doomed to failure." Word junkies pushing narco-derivations are freaked out because it's hard to get a quick fix on why.
 
 
PHRASEDICK ALERT

 
HERE'S A FLASH FROM THE campaign to find the origin of the classic if-by-whisky speech, a parody of a politician taking both sides of an issue. Coinage goes to Judge Noah S. (Soggy) Sweat Jr. of Corinth, Miss. (the nickname "Soggy" based not on his last name but on "Sorghum Top," referring to the way his hair resembled the tassel that grows atop sugar cane).
In 1952, as wets and drys were debating local prohibition of booze, Judge Sweat, now 69 years old, copyrighted his speech: "If when you say whisky you mean the Devil's brew . . . but if when you say whisky you mean the oil of conversation. . . ." His nephew Tom, a lawyer, informs me he sells copies suitable for framing out of his office at 612 1/2 Waldron Street, Corinth, Miss. 38834.
On another etymological front, it was reported here that the coiner of the now-ubiquitous phrase the peace process was Henry A. Kissinger, then Secretary of State, in the mid-1970's. To double-check, I sent a note with the citation to my old friend Henry in New York, who replies: "I honestly don't know if I coined the phrase peace process. But have I ever refused credit for anything?"
 
 
LYING LOW

 
TAR-BABY DID ME IN; I SHOULD have listened to Brer Fox.
Beginning a pusillanimous apology in a political harangue, I wrote, "Another reason I laid low was. . . ."
"You have committed the most common grammatical error in the English language," retorted Marian Mumford Brown of Orleans, Mass., "using laid as the past tense of the verb lie. The proper conjugation of lie, meaning 'recline,' is lie, lay, lain."
Elizabeth Baird Saenger of Mamaroneck, N.Y., picks it up from there: "You meant and should have said, 'Another reason I lay low. . . .' Lay is the simple past tense of lie, an intransitive verb (I lie low today, I lay low yesterday, I have lain low for weeks now)."
Lie, I am instructed, when it is a verb meaning "to recline," is intransitive; that is, when you lie in the weeds, you are not committing any action against the weeds. My recent prediction on television that Mikhail S. Gorbachev will "lay there in the weeds, and he'll try to make a comeback," was a repetition of my error -- he'll lie there in the weeds.
An entirely different verb is lay, meaning "to put, place," and it is transitive, as when you lay your hands on a villain, or lay odds on the unlikelihood that a language maven has a blind spot.
Now here's the point of confusion: as we have seen, when you change the present tense of lie to the past tense, you get lay ("I lay low yesterday"). But that same word lay is the present tense of the verb meaning "to put"; as Ms Saenger (I use no period) writes: "I lay down the newspaper now in order to write. I laid it down yesterday. I have laid it in the same place for weeks."
When I asked my grammatical aide, Jeffrey McQuain, how to get out of this without looking like a sap, he suggested, "If you were a hen, you could lay low in the nest, meaning lay the eggs low." I am not a hen. "Or you could say you were misled by Uncle Remus."
That's it: "Tar-Baby stay still, en Brer Fox, he lay low." The author, Joel Chandler Harris, misled generations of Americans with his dialect idiom; if the present tense for Tar-Baby was given as stay, then the present tense for Brer Fox should have been lie. Only if Tar-Baby stayed still -- past tense -- could Brer Fox lay low.
However, let's face it, "Brer Fox lay low" is the memorable phrase, and it is grammatically impeccable. The word I used, laid, can best be used in the past tense of lay, as in "I have just laid my cards on the table." And that's no lie.

HEADLINE: The State of the Art of Travel

BYLINE: By TERRY TRUCCO; TERRY TRUCCO writes about travel frequently.

 BODY:
IN "Dodsworth," Sinclair Lewis's novel about a retired automobile magnate, Samuel Dodsworth sails to Europe for a Grand Tour and is dazzled by the ship. It is state of the art, for the late 1920's, with a swimming pool, a wireless room and "ventilators like giant saxophones."
"I love this ship," Dodsworth tells his wife. "It's so -- Man certainly has put it over Nature for once!" 
 Dodsworth's miraculous ship has been a museum piece for decades. Today you can cruise on a ship that uses a computer to raise and lower its sails, or make a telephone call while flying over the Pacific. Come springtime, you'll be hearing live all-news radio broadcasts on planes flying over the United States (stay tuned for the '92 World Series). And before too long, you can expect voice mail in most hotel rooms, individual seatback or armrest video screens on most airplanes and airphones that promise to end forever the splendid isolation of air travel. (You'll be able to call anywhere in the world, take incoming calls, send and receive faxes, hold conference calls and even chat with passengers flying in other planes).
Cost, not surprisingly, is a big factor in the type of high-tech accouterments a hotel or transportation company chooses these days. Amtrak's plan to test armrest video screens on its Florida-bound trains this summer fell through for lack of funds. And a move to equip rooms at Hyatt hotels with elaborate Compact Disk stereo systems has been tabled, for now, because of expense.
"The guest rooms will evolve as technology brings costs down," said John Nicholls, Hyatt senior vice president for architecture and design. In the meantime, the company is replacing old-style clock radios with tabletop AM/FM stereo systems at selected hotels.
Traveler preference will also determine the kind of advances you'll see. A big surprise at Sheraton has been the tepid reception of its video checkout system, introduced more than five years ago. Fewer than 25 percent of the guests use it, according to Tom Faust, vice president in charge of rooms. "What happens, we believe, is a lot of people don't realize a receipt is available at the front desk when they leave," he said.
Sheraton plans to continue the system and, apparently undeterred, is experimenting with a roboticized vacuum cleaner for use in large hallways and ballrooms. (It has a mechanical eye so it won't bump into pillars or people.)
Just don't expect robots to replace porters or flight attendants soon. "From our point of view, the human element in our service is something we stress," said Richard Gomez, a Singapore Airlines vice president.
Unfortunately, what no one seems to have discovered yet is a cure for jet lag. But one way to avoid it in the not-too-foggy future may be to experience a faraway land without switching time zones, through the high-tech magic (or mischief, depending on your sentiments) of virtual reality. This eerie technology, still being developed, will allow you to experience the scenes, sounds and sensations of another place. The process promises to be cumbersome and costly, at least at first. Requisite equipment may include wrap-around screens, audio sensors, goggles with video display terminals and computerized gloves. Still, it's one way to try an afternoon in the Andes, have an evening in Paris, then spend midnight in Moscow.
Here's a look at some more likely innovations you can expect before too long.
 
Airplanes and Airports
 Airlines are experimenting with technology to improve in-flight entertainment, airplane telephones and on-the-ground services. Most have either introduced or tested individual video screens, usually in first class and business class cabins. British Airways and American have a library of films first-class passengers can insert into armrest videos. Japan Airlines offers movies on both big screen and armrest units in first class and business. But Virgin Atlantic, which flies from New York to London, has screens for every passenger -- three-inch diagonal seatback screens in economy, six-inch armrest screens for upper class. At present Virgin offers six entertainment channels. But as many as 100 choices may be available within the next 18 months, according to Christopher Moss, Virgin vice president for marketing and new product development. Among them may be a channel showing views of the ground, taken from cameras installed on wing or tail. "It's great if there aren't any clouds," Mr. Moss said.
Live radio is another possibility. Virgin is considering an FM radio system that would seek out the strongest station as the plane flies overhead. "You'll get a flavor of each place, from Newfoundland to Boston, as you fly into New York," Mr. Moss said.
Live radio broadcasts will begin on Delta's domestic flights sometime this spring -- and should be available on other American carriers within the year. USA Today Sky Radio, a new all-news station modeled after New York's WCBS-AM, will broadcast exclusively to airplanes flying over the United States, via satellite. Eventually, planes and cruise ships throughout the world could get the station, according to Richard Cooperman, president of USA Today Sky Radio. (The new airplane antenna was developed by Rantec, which built the Patriot Missile antenna. This is its first civilian project.) USA Today Sky Radio, featuring news, sports, business and weather reports from the Gannett News Service, will initially broadcast 18 hours a day, featuring two segments each hour, peppered with commercials. During evenings and weekends, passengers can tune into live sports events, from baseball and basketball to Olympic highlights. And yes, the service will broadcast Superbowl XXVII in 1993.
Trans-Pacific telephone service is now available, via Inmarsat, on selected flights by Singapore Airlines ($8.80 a minute) and Japan Airlines ($10 a minute). And before too long air-to-ground Airfones, first installed in 1984, may seem obsolete. G.T.E. Airfone's new generation of digital communications, called Genstar, will allow passengers the luxury of international two-way faxes and calls, including conference calls. Passengers will also be to communicate, via modem, from personal computers. The new system, which could eventually mean a telephone and screen at every seat, should also increase the types of on-screen entertainment and information services available. You could play video games with a passenger a few rows away, then check on your gate connections, make a hotel reservation and do a little shopping, all on your screen. Weather and stock market reports will also be available. All this it should begin coming your way by the spring of 1993.
The airlines are also refining check-in systems. British Airways recently introduced, at Newark International Airport in New Jersey, the Brick, a portable computer to check in passengers when lines are long. And high-tech touches are improving airport waiting rooms throughout the country, though these are usually limited to first and business class lounges. Lufthansa's new lounge at Kennedy Airport, for example, features televisions with individual headsets, fax machines, photocopiers and computers.
This brings us to the 21st century and a new generation of supersonic aircraft that, if all goes according to plan, will handily surpass Concorde. The new supersonics will be bigger, fly longer distances, be less costly to fly and go faster (you'll get from New York to Tokyo in just over four hours). Both Boeing and the team of British Aerospace and France's Aerospatiale, which designed Concorde, have competing designs on their drawing boards. The big aircraft companies are also working on a new plane to replace the 747. Boeing's N.L.A., or New Large Airplane, will seat 600 to 650.
What won't be coming anytime soon is the hypersonic plane, the much balleyhooed Star Trek contraption that would fly four or more times the speed of sound -- or more than 4,000 miles per hour. The hypersonic would simply fly too high and too fast for this planet, according to a Boeing spokesman. It would accelerate so quickly, passengers would need to wear space suits.
 
Trains
 American trains for years have lagged behind those in Europe and Japan, which can travel up to 200 miles an hour. Things won't change much in 1992. Still, Amtrak announced in November that it plans to test Sweden's X2000, a high-speed "tilt" train that can travel on existing track, later this year. If the 125-m.p.h. train successfully negotiates the winding Boston-New York run, passengers may be riding it by the end of the year. The new train would reduce the time of the fastest train between the two cities from four hours to just around three.
Discussion of faster, all-new trains continues elsewhere, notably in California and Florida where there's long been talk of building superfast magnetic levitation, or maglev, trains. Last May, a group of private investors launched the Texas T.G.V., a $2.1 billion project designed to link Houston and Dallas by 1998 with a version of France's high-speed T.G.V. But a United States Department of Transportation report in November said high-speed trains would be financially impractical for much of the country. And the Railway Technical Research Institute in Japan plans to develop a low-noise superexpress that can travel as fast at 219 miles an hour, according to a report about a week ago from the Kyodo News Service that was carried by The Associated Press. The report could not be immediately confirmed.
 
Hotels
 The big news for movie fans is a sophisticated new system that replaces the old Spectravision, with its limited selection of recent films. Guests can now choose from a menu of 75 movies, and they can watch any time they wish. The old-fashioned box that appeared on top of the hotel television set has also been eliminated. And the cost to watch is the same.
"Viewership is way up at our hotels that have it," said John Nicholls, Hyatt's senior vice president for architecture and design. Other improvements in room entertainment include CD systems and disks at hotels such as the new Hotel Nikko in Beverly Hills, with VCRs in the suites.
Voice mail is gradually replacing standard message-taking services at a number of hotels. And some hotel companies are looking into ways to maximize use of the television screen. "In the not too distant future, you may be able to reserve a ticket for the theater or order an in-room pizza from Domino's," according to Trevor Jones, Holiday Inn senior vice president for corporate development.
The Nikko in Beverly Hills, which opened last month, is the first hotel anywhere to have a special chandelier, in the Imperial Ballroom, programmed to present a 10-minute thunder-and-lightning show. The simulated dark-and-stormy-night was developed as a way to grab the attention of blase businesspeople, The new hotel, which goes out of its way to be high tech, also has a restaurant, called Matrixx, where waiters take orders on palm-size computers. Requests for food reach the kitchen in a twinkling.
The Nikko in Beverly Hills is also one of a sprinkling of new luxury hotels, including the Peninsula, Nikko Essex House and St. Regis in New York, equipped with sophisticated bedside control panels connected with the telephones. With a touch of a screen above the phone, which can be programmed in six languages, guests can control lighting, temperature, television and stereo. And the system notifies the front desk if a light bulb burns out. Still, America's most opulent hotels aren't routinely equipped with bedside buttons to open and close the curtains, a near-standard luxury feature in Asia.
For the big hotel chains, like Sheraton, Hyatt and Hilton International, new technology has made it possible to keep extensive records of customer preferences and speed up check-in. "It isn't meant to be intrusive," said Mr. Jones. "Rather, the information is on the kind of room you prefer, whether you like room service or not, or if you want a king-size bed." Beginning in February, Hyatt will have a nationwide 800 number, enabling customers to check-in and receive a room assignment over the phone; Sheraton is introducing a similar program for frequent guests. This will still entail a stop at the concierge's desk to pick up a key. But at some future date, your personal credit card may serve as your room key, according to Mr. Nicholls of Hyatt.

HEADLINE: FILM;
Filming Life, He Found His Own

BYLINE: By MICHAEL APTED; Michael Apted is the director, most recently, of the documentary "35 Up," opening on Wednesday at Film Forum 3.

DATELINE: LOS ANGELES

 BODY:
"Thirty-five Up," the latest installment in the documentary series about the lives of 14 Britons, is the culmination of 28 years' work, and as far as I know is the longest-running project in the history of film. It started in 1964 with "7 Up," a documentary produced by Granada Television that looked at Britain through the eyes of these individuals as 7-year-olds. I was 22, had just left Cambridge University with a law degree and had been hired to find the children from as diverse backgrounds as possible and, with the director Paul Almond, to get their opinions on money, love, God, sex, race, school and one another. We also wanted to know what they had in mind for their futures. These were the politicians, managers, union leaders and parents of the year 2000, so what kind of England could we look forward to?
We used the Jesuit idea "give me a child until he is 7 and I will show you the man," but, frankly, our underlying concept was political. Granada was a left-wing company, and in the heady days of 1964 when England was the pop-cultural center of the world, we wanted to see whether the dynamics that gave fame and fortune to the Beatles, the Stones and other icons had permeated our class system. Did everybody have a fair chance, or did the accident of birth bring power, wealth and success? Were children made into winners or losers by class divisions, or was the old order changing forever? 
 The film became an instant classic, for out of the mouths of those babes came some fairly alarming truths about the inequality and unfairness that still existed at the very heart of our society. The arguments that emerged were so provocative that I decided to go back every seven years to record what was happening to these children as they grew up.
Over 28 years and five films, their lives have become a road map for a kind of social history of the last three decades. The series has also been a marker for me, as it has engaged my entire working life. I have married, had children and moved to America, and wondered whether the choices I have made have been as preordained as some of those in "7 Up." I've brought up my own children, mindful of those I have filmed growing up burdened by so much parental ambition that their lives have gone seriously awry. You can see the charm of a 7-year-old become stress at 14 and disappointment at 21. I look at Nick, at 7 a farmer's son from rural Yorkshire, at 35 an associate professor of physics at the University of Wisconsin, in the process of relocating his family to America, much as I did, homesick for England and trying to identify and hang on to those of his roots that would give him his strength.
Professionally, I don't know what I've learned from the films except maybe that truth is more extraordinary than fiction, that real-life stories can be more unbelievable, more daring and more vivid than invention. My best movies, "Agatha," "Coal Miner's Daughter" and "Gorillas in the Mist," were all the more powerful for being based on truth.
Back in 1971 with the second film, "14 Up," it seemed unlikely that the series would survive. The interviews were like a struggle (they lacked, you might say, a warm glow), but once we put it all together, we knew we were onto something. The politics were as strong as ever, but now we had the excitement of juxtaposing two generations. We had turned a page in the family album.
But there were shortcomings that I've never really surmounted. We didn't have enough women, and the four we had all left school and married early; so we missed out on one of the most powerful political upheavals of my lifetime -- the changing role of women in the home and workplace. I think I also shortchanged my own roots -- the lower middle class. In my generation that class overcame modest beginnings by luck and hard work, but in the "7 Up" generation it found a world where the economy was collapsing and jobs in the arts, teaching, medicine and the like, were in short supply.
By "21 Up" it was hard enough putting the film together without bemoaning what might have been if we'd had a crystal ball. The awkwardness of the 14-year-olds had evaporated and interviewing had become much easier. I was having to condense a life into 15 minutes or so and make value judgments as to what was important and what wasn't.
Sometimes I was way off, with Tony, for example. At 7 he was the playground fighter who wanted to be a jockey, but I felt he'd never had a real chance in life. High spirits and quick wit weren't going to be enough. So I filmed him at 21 driving around the hot crime spots of the East End of London in his taxicab, conducting a tour of underworld highlights past and present. I supposed I was planning ahead, second-guessing what was lying in wait for him, but I had misjudged him completely. As Tony would often say to me, "Michael, you can't judge a book by its cover." The wildness of his early years had softened, and the energy was channeled into his marriage and children. His working-class roots became a real source of strength, and by his 20's he'd begun to make something of himself.
Our process is hardly scientific, more a complicated and sometimes bewildering array of private moments set against the cultural and social background of the times. Every seven years I do an exhaustive interview with each person, with very little preparation, looking for the spontaneous rather than the prepared response. We use a fraction of what we shoot (the ratio of film shot to film used is 30:1), so we stockpile an enormous amount of footage. With each new edition of the series, we start from scratch and sometimes go back into unused interview footage if it has become unexpectedly relevant.
By 1984 and "28 Up," the series had changed dramatically -- the politics were now unspoken and the class distinctions self-evident. Individual drama moved to the foreground, and the human element began to dominate. I brought the film to America and showed it at the Los Angeles and New York Film Festivals, seriously doubting that people would make sense of it unless they were well versed in the English school and class systems.
I was wrong. It found a huge audience of people who were responding not to a thinly disguised political polemic but to something universal. Success, failure, promise and disappointment -- these had become the new currency of the film. Images would stay in the mind -- Neil, the bright-eyed Liverpudlian who at 7 wanted to be an astronaut, at 28 hitchhiking forlornly around Scotland, his life in pieces; Suzy, bitter and nervous at 21, blossoming into motherhood; Bruce teaching Bengali children, the ambition of a 7-year-old to be a missionary realized; Tony, alone with his jockey pictures, a dream abandoned.
I doubt that "28 Up" achieved the magical quality of the original -- maybe that's the prerogative of 7-year-old children -- but according to the critics, it had power and resonance. Commitments had been made at the work place and at home, the decisions we all have to make at some time or another. This is what caught the audience's imagination, making it possible to identify with and relate to the people in the film. The public's response was as gratifying to me as anything in my professional life.
The major difficulty in mounting "35 Up" has been to keep as many of the subjects as possible. For most of them, the whole enterprise has become a major invasion of privacy, and three have dropped out. Inevitably the piece is weakened if it doesn't have a full cast -- you lose the contrasts and comparisons, and there's a feeling of extended family. Also, some of us have become close, though I'm sure they all dread the seven-yearly knock at the door.
Without giving away what has happened over the last seven years, what seems unique this time is the strong sense of mortality that pervades the film. Many of the subjects have recently lost parents; a number now have children around 7 years old. They are teaching their children what I filmed them learning, so you see knowledge and wisdom handed on from generation to generation -- a circle being closed.
There are as many surprises now as there were with "28 Up," and I'm hopeful that the films get richer as the people get older. Someone wrote of "35 Up" that it contained the heartening message that age makes people nicer, which bodes well for "42 Up," "49 Up" and on, but the excitement of each step is not knowing what to expect. I fear for the participants' safety, as with family and friends; and although life is hard for most of them, it is reassuring to observe the resilience and enterprise of the human spirit.
Other films have come out of my project. Last year CBS and Granada produced Phil Joanou's American "7 Up" (as yet not broadcast), and Granada financed Sergei Miroshnichenko's Russian version, and maybe there will be more. The new films have a great advantage over the original -- they know they're in for the long haul, whereas "7 Up" was only supposed to be a one-shot.
So, as I served as a producer on the American film and consultant on the Russian one, we were able to plan ahead, to anticipate what may be important in America over the next decades -- the breakdown of the inner cities, the widening of the gap between rich and poor and the redrawing of the ethnic map -- and respond to that in our choice of children. We filmed in the Soviet Union last autumn, just before the Baltic states broke away and well before the whole country fell apart. If we can keep track of our Russian 7-year-olds, their lives could provide astonishing insight into the future of the new commonwealth.
I suppose my greatest contribution to the whole project has been to hang in and give it continuity. I remember sitting with Mike Scott, then Granada's head of programming, in Los Angeles and saying wasn't it about time for "28 Up," and him responding that it would never happen because I wouldn't leave Hollywood.
He couldn't guess the power the films have in my life and how I doubt whether I'll ever have the chance to do anything as original as this again.

HEADLINE: IN THIS CORNER

 BODY:
Michael Specter's article "In This Corner" (Dec. 15) portrayed Lowell Weicker as a tough, independent leader, trying to do the right thing, but it failed to express Connecticut's worst fears -- namely, that Weicker is simply using the state's desperate problems to further his ambition to repackage himself as a leader of national prominence. Weicker worked hard during his campaign to create the impression that he was against an income tax. When elected, he used strong-arm tactics on legislators to swing their votes to gain a huge tax increase.
Weicker wants a quick Connecticut miracle that can propel him to renewed national prestige. It's too late. The depression and economic collapse that started in New England is spreading, and so is the fury of the middle class, who have nothing left to give.

HEADLINE: Perspectives: Developing in Brooklyn;
Putting the Cleveland Connection in Play

BYLINE: By ALAN S. OSER

 BODY:
DEVELOPMENT has its ups and downs. The 42-year-old Bruce Ratner, who has become the chief developer of major projects in Brooklyn, has had some of both.
The ups are to be found at Metrotech, the office center on a 16-acre site adjoining Polytechnic University, which contributed the land and is getting major building and grounds improvements. With four completed office buildings, a fifth far advanced in construction and two or three more in prospect, Metrotech is easily New York City's leading phased office development project, second in scale only to Olympia & York's World Financial Center at Battery Park City. 
 But now Mr. Ratner finds it necessary to digest a reverse. He and his company -- Forest City Enterprises of Cleveland, whose New York City affiliates, Forest City Ratner Companies, he heads -- have been obliged to withdraw as developer of the ambitious Arverne waterfront redevelopment plan for 308 acres of the Rockaway Peninsula in Queens.
The intention was to build 7,000 to 10,000 housing units on a platform above covered parking, with Park Tower Realty as joint-venture partner. The downturn in the market has made the economic planning obsolete.
None of which leaves Mr. Ratner discouraged. On the contrary, he buzzes with enthusiasm about Brooklyn and his company's decision to make it the base of its development activities. That gave the city in the late 80's an essential assist in its efforts to hold large office tenants who were relocating with thousands of jobs to newly built lower-cost space across the Hudson River. Through Forest City, a counterattack was mounted.
"Brooklyn is different," said Mr. Ratner, notably in the lengths to which its officials go to support office growth. A supportive attitude by borough officials in the face of local resistance to the dislocations of urban redevelopment is not the norm in New York City. But that and more came at crucial times from the office of Borough President Howard Golden when Mr. Ratner and the city's Economic Development Administration were seeking to clear land in time to capture New Jersey-minded tenants.
Metrotech lies between Jay Street and Flatbush Avenue, off Willoughby Street, near Brooklyn's major civic buildings. Myrtle Avenue, now closed within the area, is becoming a grand pedestrian walkway between the offices and the revived Polytechnic campus.
Through the project Forest City Enterprises has become involved as developer, builder or co-venturer in a widening spectrum of projects. Mr. Ratner's older cousin, Albert, is the chief executive officer of Forest City, one of the country's largest publicly owned development companies. With their backing, Mr. Ratner has been able to bring millions of dollars of private risk capital to bear in Brooklyn.
The Arverne reversal was not surprising, given the decline in the housing market. The notion of putting so large a tract in the hands of a single developer -- even one who agreed to pay $90 million -- never appealed to top housing officials of Mayor David N. Dinkins. And with the decline in the housing market, there was no realistic prospect of a sales success that would justify the costs.
"We went through the land-use review process for the first 7,500 units," said Mr. Ratner. "It was a lovely plan for market-rate housing. But with the economy as it is, it's not possible to build it." Condominiums would have been offered at an average price of $170,000. "Even at $150,000 we couldn't have sold it," Mr. Ratner said.
IN the new approach to Arverne foreseen by Felice Michetti, New York City's Housing Commissioner, the city will parcel out sites to developers as the Battery Park City Authority does in its long-term land-development program. The development must be able to span real-estate cycles, Commissioner Michetti said. "We don't want to be stuck with a cash bid made at the height of a real-estate market," she said.
"We never fight with the city," Mr. Ratner said. "We said, 'What would you like us to do?' " The answer was yes.
Now the question is when and whether the city will be able or willing to undertake the initial infrastructure costs that its current approach implies. Then the city would sell buildable parcels in stages. The administration of former Mayor Edward I. Koch had looked to a long-term developer to pay the infrastructure costs, getting in return the benefit of the increased land value it was creating.
With that setback behind it, Forest City is continuing to undertake new development projects in Brooklyn. It has become a joint-venture partner with Rose Associates in the Atlantic Terminal urban renewal project, where 440 units of housing and 4.5 million square feet of office and retail space is envisioned. It has bought the 155,000-square-foot Albee Square Mall along the Fulton Street mall at Gold Street with a view toward improving it. It still has additional sites for Metrotech buildings.
Mr. Ratner's route to real-estate development led through public service. He worked in the Consumer Affairs Department for former Mayor John V. Lindsay after finishing at Columbia Law School in 1970. Later he served for four years as Mayor Koch's Consumer Affairs Commissioner.
He left in 1982 to start investing -- with the purchase of the former Herald-Tribune building, at 230 West 41st Street, which was 85 percent occupied by the city's Health and Hospitals Corporation.
"We could buy buildings at $50 or $60 a square foot that had rents of about $6 a square foot," he said. "We thought that rents would go up to about $18 a square foot." They did. Another purchase was the 550,000-square-foot 80 Maiden Lane, former home of Continental Insurance. It was leased from 1985 to 1987 after a $20 million renovation.
In time, Mr. Ratner was shown Polytechnic's blighted Brooklyn land by another former city official, Michael Bailkin, who was representing the university. The Metrotech concept had been promoted for years by Polytechnic's administrators as a 1.7-million-square-foot "technology park." It was an idea in search of a deep-pockets development partner.
FOREST CITY was interested but the density was deemed too low. After a two-year land-use review that began in 1984, the property was rezoned to accommodate 3.7 million square feet on six large sites. Forest City saw the potential mainly as back-office space for financial firms. The Koch administration used tax abatements and other financial devices to keep occupancy costs for the initial prime tenants competitive with developments in New Jersey.
Credibility on Wall Street for both Brooklyn and Forest City was won by the successful completion of One Pierrepont Plaza, a 650,000-square-foot building mainly occupied by the operations group and data center of Morgan-Stanley, at Pierrepont Street and Cadman Plaza West.
The breakthrough for Metrotech came with the city's ability, working with Forest City, to clear a site for a Securities Industry Automation Corporation building. It took a marathon session with holdout business and residential tenants and their lawyers, and a $29 million commitment for relocation costs.
"We would have lost S.I.A.C. -- even Brooklyn Union -- if we hadn't moved fast," Mr. Ratner said.
No less dramatic was the last-ditch campaign to hold Chase Manhattan Bank's back-office operations in New york City. An economic package concocted by Deputy Mayor Alair Ane Townsend was decisive.
Now the term "Metrotech" is omnipresent in the emerging campus-like office community, which blends into the also-emerging landscaped courtyard of the Polytechnic campus. Completed are One Metrotech Center (900,000 square feet) for Brooklyn Union Gas (with Bear Stearns & Company as a major tenant); Two Metrotech Center (550,000 square feet) for the Securities Industry Automation Corporation; and Three Metrotech Center, part of the Chase Financial Services Center (500,000 square feet); and 10 Metrotech Center (400,000 square feet), a gut rehabilitation of 625 Fulton Street.
Back at the center, Four Metrotech Center (one million square feet), another section of Chase's project, is well advanced in construction. Chase is handling the construction of its buildings and will own its site. Forest City built the other Metrotech office buildings, and continues to own them.
Other projects named "Metrotech" have come along independent of Forest City: Five Metrotech Center is the name given to a new library for the university. Six Metrotech Center is a New York Telephone Company learning center. Seven Metrotech Center is another phone company building.
At the height of its Metrotech activity, Forest City Ratner employed 80 people. Today it is down to 40. But it began in 1985 with three people. Its stamp on Brooklyn is indelible.

HEADLINE: Commercial Property: New Hotels;
Staying the Course, Despite the Gloom of Recession

BYLINE: By DAVID W. DUNLAP

 BODY:
THE FUTURE envisioned by the builders of the Regent New York Hotel at 57 East 57th Street is one that stretches well into the coming decades. It is the coming months that may pose the greatest challenge.
The 54-story, limestone-clad hotel -- soaring over the neighboring Fuller Building -- is being finished at a time when the real-estate empire of its developer, Harunori Takahashi, is being restructured by Japanese banks. 
 It is also being built into a market that has changed since the late 80's, when the Regent was conceived. There may no longer be quite so much of an appetite for the kind of luxury that the hotel plans to offer, at prices in the neighborhood of $400 a night.
Undaunted, however, executives in the hotel's ownership and management said the $370 million, 372-room project will stay the course and open, as planned, next January.
The Mercer, another new hotel in which Japanese and Hong Kong investors figure, is scheduled to open in SoHo this summer. And a downtown hotel project, by a group from Hong Kong, is now under city review.
But the Regent cuts the highest profile; one that is not going to be lowered. "The hotel, from the beginning, was planned as a five-star luxury hotel," said Wilfried N. Wagner, the general manager. "And it is going to be opened as a five-star luxury hotel.
"The valley that the whole hotel business is going through has not given us any reason to make a change in our approach," he added.
The hotel is owned through a partnership that is ultimately controlled by Mr. Takahashi's EIE International Corporation, whose headquarters are in Tokyo. It is to be managed by Regent International Hotels of Hong Kong, in which EIE International has a 30 percent interest. (Robert H. Burns, the chairman of Regent, owns 65 percent of the company and the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation owns 5 percent.)
Construction is being financed by a loan from a consortium of six Japanese banks, led by the Long-Term Credit Bank. The others are the Ashikaga Bank, Mitsubishi Trust and Banking Corporation, Mitsui Trust and Banking Company, Nippon Credit Bank and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Company.
Five of those six banks have formed a separate consortium, also led by the Long-Term Credit Bank, to "select and evaluate all projects" undertaken by Mr. Takahashi, said Toru Ogahara, president of EIE Regent Avenue Corporation, a subsidiary of EIE International, based in Manhattan.
"EIE is no exception in the suddenly changing financial situation surrounding real estate and development projects," Mr. Ogahara said. "Mr. Takahashi is discussing with lenders how best to realistically adapt EIE to these changes." Those discussions, he said, began early last year.
"Some projects are on the list to sell off," Mr. Ogahara said. "Some projects are on the 'go-ahead' list.
"From the very beginning," he continued, "the New York project has been given top priority on the 'go-ahead' list. We have consumed more than 50 percent of the budget. We are sure there will be no change in the policy of our headquarters, as well as by the consortium, to keep going."
FUMIYO OKUDA, the manager of EIE Regent Avenue, said: "Maybe the operation of EIE International will be affected. But as far as each project is concerned, they shouldn't be affected. We have to make sure -- even more than before -- that it comes in under budget. But what has happened in Tokyo has not affected our budget."
Because five of the lenders are also involved in restructuring EIE International, Mr. Ogahara noted, "the distinction between construction financing and equity financing is becoming more and more fluid."
That is not the only complicated aspect of the project, whose complexity runs from the ground up. For one thing, the L-shaped development site between Park and Madison Avenues, from 57th to 58th Street, is composed of five parcels. Two are owned outright by 57-57th Associates, a partnership controlled by EIE Regent Avenue. The other three parcels are leased to 57-57th Associates on terms ranging from 50 to 200 years. The owners were identified by Ms. Okuda as Blackstone Holdings, successor to the Blackstone Hotel, a 200-room structure that once stood at 50 East 58th Street; the Baccarat crystal firm, whose showroom occupied the base of the five-story town house that once stood at 55 East 57th Street and the Rubin family.
The assemblage was bought in January 1989 from William Zeckendorf Jr., who remains connected to the Regent as a "development adviser," Ms. Okuda said, with no "active financial interest" in the property.
When the hotel was announced in January 1989, it was to have a main tower of 46 stories and a smaller tower of some 20 stories, with a total of 400 rooms. Completion was planned for late 1991. The architects -- then and now -- were I. M. Pei & Partners (whose practice continues as Pei, Cobb, Freed & Partners) and Frank Williams & Associates, both of Manhattan. The interiors were to be designed by John F. Saladino, who has been replaced by Chhada, Siembieda & Associates. The Tishman Construction Corporation was and is the construction manager.
Before building could start, the developers eliminated the smaller tower and increased the larger one to 54 stories. The structure, with some 530,000 square feet of space, was built as of right under zoning rules, the developers said.
Since then, construction has stayed on track, the EIE and Regent executives said. So has the decision to keep the Regent in its stratospheric category. "From a design and construction point of view, we reached the point of no return long before the slump started," Mr. Wagner said. "You can't switch the theory in the middle."
"The economic condition of New York has not affected the hotel," he said. "We're building a hotel for the next 30, 40, 50 years."
GUESTS can expect to find rooms ranging from 570 to 1,200 square feet, with ceilings more than 10 feet high. In the 120-square-foot bathrooms are sunken tubs, separate shower stalls and color television sets. There are to be stewards on every floor.
The Regent, Mr. Wagner said, is meant for a clientele that is "not so rate-sensitive." And, he added, "If there is a shortage, we'll have to adjust our marketing accordingly."
The Mercer Hotel, at Mercer and Prince Streets, is being created out of a 104-year-old commercial structure. It is to have 78 guest rooms, costing an average of more than $200 a night; a health club, restaurant, pharmacy and florist. The developers are Andre T. Balazs and Campion A. Platt. The architectural and design team is composed of Harman Jablin Architects, Serge Becker and Tsao & McKown Architects.
Financing for the $33 million project has come from a Japanese bank called F.A.D., Mr. Balazs said, as well as investments by the developers themselves and a group they described as a Japanese real estate developer and financier, a Japanese retail and clothing executive, a Japanese architect and a Hong Kong hotelier.
Mr. Platt said that even in today's distressed market, the Mercer had several things going for it: the weekend business in SoHo, the absence of nearby competition, an intimate scale and competitive rates.
Another hotel is being planned at Platt and Gold Streets in lower Manhattan. This is being developed by a group of Hong Kong investors through the Barleda Development Corporation, whose location is given in city records as Livingston, N.J. The design is by Alan Lapidus Architects of Manhattan.
According to an application at the Buildings Department, the hotel would have 19 stories, with a restaurant on the ground floor and a meeting room on the second floor. There would be a total of 144 guest rooms.
Nelson Yeung, the president of Barleda, said the hotel would cater to domestic and Asian business travelers. But nothing is going to happen in the immediate future. The owners, he said, will wait for signs of a healthier market before they begin.

HEADLINE: Streetscapes: The Office of the Astor Estate;
A 'Frankly Modern' Addition

BYLINE: By CHRISTOPHER GRAY

 BODY:
ONCE the administrative center for the greatest of New York's family fortunes, the jewel-like, two-story Office of the Astor Estate at 21 West 26th Street is not a landmark and is ignored by guidebooks and New York histories.
Miraculously, the exterior of the Victorian Gothic building has survived unchanged since 1881 -- but now construction is proceeding on a "frankly modern" rooftop addition. 
 John Jacob Astor, who arrived in the United States from London in 1784, amassed a fortune of $20 million, most of it in real estate, by his death in 1848. His son, William Backhouse Astor, retained his father's Doric style, temple-fronted office at 81 Prince Street.
By the time William died in 1875, the fortune exceeded $100 million and it went to his two sons, John Jacob Astor 3d and William Astor. In 1881, they demolished the Prince Street office for the present 575 Broadway and the two brothers built a pair of matching buildings at 21 and 23 West 26th Street.
Thomas Stent, the family's regular architect at the time, designed two-story buildings as close as New York ever got to the work of the great Philadelphia architect Frank Furness. Above the ground floor -- barred like a treasure house -- rises a facade of brick, granite and terra cotta.
In approved Victorian fashion, materials, colors and finishes fight and strain against each other: polished gray granite, raw orange terra cotta and curved red brick. Above this the cornice is corbeled out on brick work, but the attic pediment slopes back in ribbons of granite. Heavy lintels, like droopy eyebrows, weigh down the second-floor windows and ostensibly protect a richly carved terra cotta panel -- which needs no protection at all.
Some carved ornament seems to imitate Chinese sculpture, but most is patterned after the naturalistic designs of William Morris. The whole building has the blocky, brusque quality of Frank Furness's 1879 masterpiece, the Provident Life and Trust Company in Philadelphia.
John Jacob Astor 3d occupied No. 21 and William occupied No. 23; from these buildings issued the most sustained record of private architectural patronage ever seen in New York.
From 21 West 26th Street, the John Jacob Astor 3d line built the old Waldorf, Netherland and Astor Hotels (all now demolished) and the Graham Court and Apthorp apartments. From 23 West 26th, the William Astor line built the St. Regis and Knickerbocker Hotels and, under Vincent Astor, the Astor Court apartments at 90th Street and Broadway, the old Astor Market at 95th Street and Broadway and 120 East End Avenue.
Along with these came scores of other works -- rowhouses, commercial buildings, apartments -- all by leading architects of the day, among them Henry Hardenbergh, Trowbridge & Livingston, Clinton & Russell and Charles Platt.
A 1905 account in McClure's Magazine estimated the estate's income at $10 million a year.
In 1922, Vincent Astor hired Peabody, Wilson & Brown to redo the facade of No. 23 in a chaste, neo-Federal style, but No. 21 has remained untouched. Both were sold by the Astors after 1940, by which time their real estate interests were winding down. Today the buildings are surrounded by tall loft buildings.
Albert Zuckerman, a literary agent, bought No. 21 in 1979 for his firm, Writers House, and he has stripped and restored the interior. Its Minton-style tiled floors, Japonesque iron stair, paneled walls and office dividers and Aesthetic Movement fireplaces and even door hardware are all intact.
DESPITE the troubled economy, the building is chock-a-block with agents negotiating deals and newly published books, so Mr. Zuckerman hired Peter Moore, a designer, and David Mandl, an architect, to design a roof addition that is now almost complete.
After discarding various plans for a more historical look, Mr. Zuckerman says, "we're making a frankly modern addition, without masking the fact."
Indeed, no one will ever think the extra floor will "look as if it's always been there" -- an oft-stated goal of architects these days.
Whereas a Victorian architect would probably have kept the addition low and covered it in multicolored slate around tiny dormers, the new design has tall plate-glass windows topped by a big, sloping copper roof, with a square, off-center window.
Nothing of the original front is being changed and the finished work will speak to two quite different business successes, over a century apart.

HEADLINE: DINING OUT;
Style of a Men's Club in a Hotel Setting

BYLINE: By PATRICIA BROOKS

 BODY:
WHEN we reviewed the stylish restaurant in the new Hotel Sheraton Stamford in the summer of 1986, it was called Magnificent J's, after a class of sailboats that raced across the Atlantic in the 1930's. The restaurant featured seafood, prepared with a panache that rated a Very Good, in a setting that resembled a ship's cabin. Following a trend of the time, the hotel seemed to be making its restaurant a culinary flagship instead of the ordinary and predictable hotel dining room of decades past.
Alas, much that distinguished the small, handsome Stamford restaurant has disappeared, including most of its name, menu and wine cellar. The new name, J's Bar and Grill, says it all. The small menu, which is printed daily (though only a small category called "captain's choice" changes), offers several types of steak, a few seafood and chicken dishes and several currently popular appetizers. 
 J's dining areas are essentially the same -- small and intimate, more like a men's club than a bar and grill, with only a few tables, regally spaced for privacy. The two very cozy areas are separated into smoking and nonsmoking sections and are on either side of a serving well. A roomy bar, with ship motif, has been carved out of a portion of the former dining space.
One can only speculate as to why the hotel has jettisoned its notable restaurant. Was it the economy, the business-oriented clientele, the somewhat hard-to-find location, all or none of the above? What remains is a fine place physically and decent if not memorable food. The stunning all-American wine list, which included wines from more than 20 states, is also gone, replaced by a limited list, mostly California and French vintages. The one noticeable improvement is the service, smooth, professional and extremely accommodating.
The food is good but not pace setting. Best of the limited number of appetizers offered were the Cajun swordfish medallions -- two small blackened steaks with no-holds-barred spicing accompanied by a freshly made marinara sauce spiked with green pepper strips and chunks of fresh tomatoes. Buffalo mozzarella, another commendable first course, was almost a light meal -- four large slabs of soft cheese and sliced tomatoes. Smoked salmon with dill cream was a generous serving of high-quality salmon, enhanced by aromatic dill cream.
Less satisfactory was a skimpy serving of fried calamari, though its marinara sauce was light, sassy and fresh. Also a letdown were the crab cakes with tartar sauce. The crab meat was fresh-flavored, but the two little cakes, flecked with bits of green and red pepper, were smooshed and compressed into flat patties, lacking the loose texture and lightness that is usually preferable in a crab cake.
A stir-fry dish of Gulf shrimp and sea scallops contained a wide variety of crisp, fresh vegetables -- cauliflower, zucchini, celery, scallions, cabbage, broccoli and red and green peppers -- which added a panoply of flavors, though there was barely a whisper of sesame-ginger sauce. An enormous blackened New York strip steak was a fine value at $14.95, though it could have been more richly spiced.
A tender broiled filet mignon, topped with Burgundy butter, would have been perfect, except it was medium-rare instead of rare as ordered. Swordfish steak, grilled with Burgundy butter, was moist in parts, dry in others, with minimal butter.
The fresh vegetables served with each entree change from night to night. One night we had a delicious broiled tomato provencal and corn on the cob, another night sauteed red and yellow pepper strips.
We ran through the dessert list but found each item, from the New York cheesecake and apple pie to carrot cake and four-layer chocolate cake, unexcitingly commercial.
In converting Magnificent J's to J's Bar and Grill, the management has controlled the prices (no mean achievement), which are as low or lower than they once were, though the dishes are less ambitious now. A three-course dinner for two came to $53 before tax, tip and drinks. The bar at J's has a taco bar buffet between 4:30 and 7 P.M., with garlicky guacamole, a respectably spicy red salsa, ground beef, melted cheese, crunchy chips and other accouterments. If you dine early, the taco bar makes a first course unnecessary. This can slice $11 off your tab, making J's Bar and Grill an even better value.

HEADLINE: Recession Tempers Casino Revenue

BYLINE: By The Associated Press

DATELINE: ATLANTIC CITY

 BODY:
THE recession tempered gross gaming revenue growth in the casino industry last year to 1.35 percent, according to recently released unofficial figures.
But analysts said the gambling halls had improved their profitability by cutting costs and renegotiating debt. The 12 casinos reported gross gambling revenue of $2.99 billion, compared with $2.95 billion for 1990. 
 "Considering all the economic news, it's not bad," said Al Glasgow, publisher and editor of Atlantic City Action, a gaming newsletter.
He said that revenues were flat, but that casinos were improving their bottom lines by spending less. For example, he said, in the third quarter of 1991, the casinos cut expenses by $4 million.
 
Legislative Changes
 The gaming halls benefited last year from legislative changes that permitted 24-hour gambling on weekends and holidays, more floor space devoted to slot machines and the introduction of new games.
The city's largest casino, the Trump Taj Mahal Casino Resort, generated the most gross revenue -- $383.7 million, Mr. Glasgow said. The casino recorded 1990 revenue of $304.9 million but was not open until April 1990.
The biggest gainers last year were Merv Griffin's Resorts Casino Hotel, up 7.4 percent, to $220.1 million from $205 million, and Caesars Hotel and Casino, up 6.4 percent, to $309.1 million from $290.4 million.
The biggest declines occurred with the Trump Castle Casino Resort, down 16 percent, to $196.5 million from $233.9 million, and the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino, down 15.7 percent, to $235 million from $278.7 million.
Marvin Roffman, a casino analyst with Roffman Miller Associates in Philadelphia, said industry revenue would remain level as long as the recession lingered.
"Consumers have less disposable income to spend and put in those slot machines," Mr. Roffman said. "I see sluggish growth for the economy. I don't think 1992 will be a banner year for Atlantic City from the standpoint of revenue growth. The bottom line numbers should get better."
He attributed his optimism on profitability to debt-heavy casinos' refinancing hundreds of millions of dollars in bonds, which have absorbed much of their revenue.
 
Changes at Trump Casinos
 Last year, the Taj Mahal restructured its debt as part of a bankruptcy under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code. The Trump Castle is planning a similar restructuring, and the Trump Plaza is pursuing a bond exchange.
The other casinos, their 1991 results, their 1990 figures and the percentage change are as follows:
*TropWorld Casino and Entertainment Resort, $287.1 million, $278.5 million, up 3.1 percent.
*Harrah's Casino Hotel, $283.9 million, $279.7 million, up 1.5 percent.
*Bally's Park Place Casino Hotel, $267.1 million, $268.0 million, down 0.3 percent.
*Sands Hotel and Casino, $242 million, $230.4 million, up 5 percent.
*Showboat Hotel and Casino, $239.8 million, $247.8 million, down 3.2 percent.
*Bally's Grand Hotel and Casino, $191.5 million, $199.6 million, down 4.1 percent.
*Claridge Hotel and Casino, $135.4 million, $134.7 million, up 0.5 percent.
For December, the 12 casinos recorded revenue of $203.8 million, a 3.1 percent decline compared with $210.4 million in December 1990.

DOMESTIC WORKSHOP
 Wives and mothers going back to school, back to work -- or both -- often leave behind a trail of mismatched socks, burned dinners, abused appliances, hostile husbands and confused children. 
 Dr. Barbara Smukler, a teacher, writer and director of academic recources at Mount St. Vincent College in Riverdale, went through it when she returned to school as a wife and mother of two children. What she learned she now teaches in workshops designed to make life easier by forestalling domestic calamities with advanced planning. The next session, which is free, is Tuesday at 7 P.M. in the college's administration building.
She focuses on things that cookbooks leave out -- like how to turn on the oven. Detailed instructions for house cleaning, laundry sorting and spending time with each family member to explain his or her chores are spelled out. She also includes some tips on readjusting to the academic world, like taking notes and tests, understanding the difference between studying and reading and taking emergency measures when there is no tutor to rely on.
The college is at 263d Street and Riverdale Avenue. The phone number for more information is (212) 549-8000.
 
WORLD TRADE CLUB LUNCH
 "Doing Business With the 'New' U.S.S.R." is the subject of a talk to be delivered Wednesday in White Plains by Vladimir N. Checklin, deputy president of the U.S.-U.S.S.R. Trade and Economic Council in Manhattan.
Mr. Checklin is a graduate of the Moscow State Institute of International Relations, and he once headed a division of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Trade. He has written many books and articles on Soviet economic relations with the West, published in the Soviet Union and in the international press.
His talk will follow a reception at 11:30 A.M. and luncheon at 12:15 P.M., held by the World Trade Club of Westchester at the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza, 66 Hale Avenue. Reservations at $40 may be made by calling 948-6444.
 
PHOTOS LIKE PAINTINGS
 Betsy Imershein's photographs have the look of paintings in the school of photorealism. Minutely detailed, colored, focused and composed, the picture-perfect subjects are super-real. Capturing them on film is what she considers her challenge -- to find the ideal subject under ideal photographic conditions.
Her pictures are in a two-artist show called "Double Vision" at the Upstream Gallery in Hastings-on-Hudson through Feb. 2. Sharing the spotlight with her is Amelia de Neergard, who works in oil stick and pastels on handmade paper. She uses signs, symbols, abstract shapes and color in provocative combinations for the viewer to interpret.
The gallery, at 495 Warburton Avenue, is open Wednesdays through Sundays from 1 to 6 P.M. and Thursdays from 3 to 8 P.M. Call 478-0407 for more information.
 
ADIRONDACK CENTENNIAL
 The official area kickoff for the centennial celebration of the Adirondack State Park will take place from 4 to 6 P.M. today at the Katonah Museum of Art, where an exhibition of Adirondack-inspired furniture, fine art, decorative arts, architecture and utilitarian objects is on display through Jan. 26.
Among those attending today's event will be Barbara McMartin, chairwoman of the park's Centennial Committee; Craig Gilborn, director of the Adirondack Museum, and John Cronin, Keeper of the Hudson River. Christopher Shaw will entertain with folk songs.
A weekend at the Point, one of the Adirondack Great Camps, formerly owned by the Rockefeller family, will be raffled off at $100 a ticket. A limit of 200 tickets will be sold.
Establishment of the park 100 years ago in a constitutional amendment was an unusual legislative step at that time. More than twice the size of Yellowstone National Park and half the size of Switzerland, the park has six million acres that are supposed to remain "forever wild."
Admission and refreshments are free. [A review of the exhibition appears on page 22.]
 
HONEGGER'S 'KING DAVID'
 Arthur Honegger's "King David" will be performed today at 3 P.M. in the Ossining High School Auditorium by the Choral Arts Society of Briarcliff Manor and the Westchester Boys' Choir, accompanied by a full orchestra.
The Swiss-born composer wrote the work in Paris in 1921 as a dramatic psalm for the theater, but it will be presented today in concert form, conducted by Timothy Vernon, who is the year-round director of both the adult and boys' choral groups.
The boys will sing the parts of angels. Barrett Clark will be the narrator, and the chorus will take the roles of warriors, priests, seers and Israelites. Soloists include Mary Kay McGarvey, soprano; Kathleen Shimeta, mezzo-soprano, and Vincent DiBenedetto, tenor.
Tickets are $12, $6 for students and people 65 and older. For more information, call 962-3218 or 723-2336.
 
PLAY ON FITZGERALD
 Before it moves to Manhattan in February, "The Other Side of Paradise" will have a limited run at the Westport Country Playhouse this month. Written by John Kane of the Royal Shakespeare Company in London and directed by Susie Fuller, a British actress and director, the play is about a famous American: F. Scott Fitzgerald.
Keir Dullea has the leading role of the writer during his promising years in Hollywood, when he was in his early 30's and his fame was on the rise but his wife's mental illness was beginning to undermine the marriage. The work had its premiere last summer at Lucille Lortel's White Barn Theater in Westport.
Performances, which begin this Wednesday and run through Jan. 26, are Wednesdays at 2 and 8 P.M, Thursdays and Fridays at 8 P.M., Saturdays at 5 and 9 P.M. and Sundays at 3 P.M. Tickets are $17 and $19 and can be charged by calling (203) 227-1072. The theater is at 25 Powers Court, off Route 1.
 
ENVIRONMENT LECTURES
 A five-part lecture series titled "Earth in Rebellion: New Visions for a Fragile Planet" is scheduled by the New York Botanical Garden of the Bronx, beginning Thursday at 6 P.M. at 270 Park Avenue (47th Street) in Manhattan. At each session, a leading activist will present his or her view of solutions to environmental problems.
Dr. Wes Jackson, president of the Land Institute in Salina, Kan., will lead off the series with a talk on "Agriculture That Respects the Land." On Jan. 23 Dr. Christine Padoch's topic will be "The Forest Is the Garden." Dr. Padoch is a botanical scientist at the New York Botanical Garden.
"Making Peace With the Planet" is to be discussed on Jan. 30 by Dr. Barry Commoner, founder and director of the Center for the Biology of Natural Systems at Queens College.
The final sessions on Feb. 13 and 27 will be conducted, respectively, by Dr. Carolyn Merchant, professor of environmental history at the University of California at Berkeley, and Dr. David Ehrenfeld, professor of biology at Rutgers University. Dr. Merchant will speak about "The Death of Nature" and Dr. Ehrenfeld's talk is titled "Losing Our Way: Conservation in a World Without Landmarks." Admission to each session will be $14. For more information or to make reservations, call (212) 220-8747.

HEADLINE: Bedford School Plans Program on Parenting

BYLINE: By ROBERTA HERSHENSON

DATELINE: BEDFORD

 BODY:
BLAME the recession or the stresses felt by working couples. Whatever the reason, parenting seems to have hit hard times. "People have forgotten how to enjoy their children," a psychologist was overheard saying at a recent holiday party in Scarsdale. A local school administrator agreed. "Parents today feel a lot of insecurity," she said.
In a recent report stating that many American 5-year-olds were not ready for kindergarten, the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching recommended parent-education programs as one way to help get families on track. The Rippowam Cisqua School, an independent day school here for prekindergarten through ninth grade, was ahead of the game in planning just such a program to help celebrate its 75th anniversary. 
 "Getting Through the Thicket: How Schools and Families Can Nurture Children in the 90's" will be held Jan. 25 from 8:30 A.M. to 1 P.M. at the Rippowam campus of the school on Route 22 and Bedford Center Road. The fee for the morning is $35 a person and includes lunch.
The program will offer workshops on such topics as disciplining and motivating children, helping children through a divorce, handling anger constructively, recognizing childhood stress, charting a healthy course through adolescence and evaluating testing.
A group of 19 psychiatrists, counselors, teachers and authors of books about parenting will lead the workshops. State Senator Mary B. Goodhue, a member of Governor Cuomo's Early Childhood Task Force and head of the Senate Standing Committee on Child Care, will also lead a workshop on Early Childhood Education and Day Care.
 
A Talk and Q&A Session Planned
 Before tackling these issues in individual workshops, conference participants will hear a talk by the psychologist and author Dr. Lee Salk, who will also conduct a question and answer session.
Dr. Salk is a clinical professor of psychology at the Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan. He is an attending psychologist at the New York Hospital-Cornell Medical Center in White Plains and also serves as both a consulting psychologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan and as an adjunct professor of child development at Brown University.
Dr. Salk's best-selling books, including "What Every Child Would Like His Parents to Know," "How to Raise a Human Being" and "Dear Dr. Salk," have been published worldwide in many languages.
In a reassuring way, the 65-year-old psychologist delivers a pointed message to parents. As providers of the primary environment in which children live, parents -- and educators and pediatricians -- have the greatest impact on children's lives, despite the prevalence of television, media advertising and peer group pressures, he said in an interview.
Speaking in a spacious Manhattan apartment, Dr. Salk named what are for him the three most important human needs: to be loved, to feel some control over our lives and to feel accepted because of our individuality. Parents should respect virtues that are often overlooked, he suggested, like a child's ability to relate to his grandparents. Such qualities are often not appreciated, he said, yet they reflect values that should be nurtured to instill a sense of confidence and caring in children.
 
'Indulge Babies in Their First Year'
 The psychologist said his own philosophy of child-rearing was to "indulge babies in the first year of life." This makes them happy children who want "to learn, to love and be loved," he said. He said he discourages the idea of "showing the child who's boss" or an "I have rights, too" attitude.
"That's like ignoring the foundation of the building and worrying about what it's going to look like on top, then discovering it has some structural weakness because no one was around," Dr. Salk said.
Economic hardship is not an excuse for poor parenting, because children can "learn to build on adversity," the psychologist said. Families with homes and enough to eat "can pull together and do some really wonderful things in tough times," Dr. Salk said. "Re-examine your values -- learn that money isn't everything. This is no time to be competitive but to be humble."
Dr. Salk said he often speaks of his own adversities -- like not being accepted into the high school or college of his choice as well as becoming ill with a usually fatal form of cancer -- in his talks to school groups. He ascribes his own positive attitude -- "If it has never been done before, that's all I have to hear" -- to a mother who "never took no for an answer."
Schools can also play a positive role in children's lives by responding to youngsters' talents and interests, focusing on what students do right rather than on learning disabilities, Dr. Salk said. In fact, Dr. Salk doesn't like the term "learning disabilities." He would rather ask whether the teacher has "a teaching disability."
 
'Remediation Can Knock Confidence'
 Schools should also "help identify problems and be flexible in how they are dealt with," because "remediation can knock confidence," Dr. Salk said.
The psychologist added that in his talk he would stress the family "as a functional rather than a structural thing -- the function is more important than the structure." He speaks freely of his own family: his mother, a Russian immigrant, his father, who was in the garment business, and the two brothers with whom he grew up in Manhattan.
The oldest, Dr. Jonas Salk, discovered the vaccine for polio and conducts research at his Salk Institute in La Jolla, Calif. His other brother, Dr. Herman Salk, is a veterinarian whose projects include teaching cattle-raising techniques in third-world countries.
Dr. Lee Salk's wife, Mary Jane, is a writer whose first novel will soon be published by Ballantine Books. His son is a medical student, and his daughter is doing graduate work in psychology, Dr. Salk said.

HEADLINE: A Crusade to Save the Soul of Arlington

BYLINE: By THOMAS C. HAYES

DATELINE: ARLINGTON, Tex.

 BODY:
A master at civic boosterism, Tom Vandergriff lured the Senators baseball team, now the Texas Rangers, away from Washington in 1971 and coaxed millions of dollars from voters for a stadium, a convention center, libraries, schools, lakes and roads.
But no triumph during his 26 years as Mayor here, until 1977, compares with the surprise choice by the General Motors Corporation 41 years ago to pass up Dallas and Fort Worth to build an assembly plant in Arlington, then a small farm town of 7,800 people and four square miles. 
 "It's been a Rock of Gibraltar for us that gave us the confidence to do some great things," said Mr. Vandergriff, whose family has sold thousands of General Motors cars since 1926 through its Buick and Chevrolet dealerships. "You simply couldn't imagine in your worst nightmare losing an entity like General Motors."
Yet, suddenly and unexpectedly, Arlington is in exactly that predicament -- confronting the prospect of losing its largest private employer and local tax provider as G.M. considers it for closure as part of a sweeping cost-cutting plan. The soul-searching and campaigns to save the plant that have preoccupied Arlington, now the seventh-largest city in Texas, are not unlike those in scores of cities and towns whose own factories have been threatened by America's stagnating industrial power.
But as many towns, including Arlington, fight to keep manufacturers, some economists worry that the tax concessions they are offering are unfairly benefiting business at a growing cost to other taxpayers. "It might be a good deal for Texas if they end up winning the plant, but collectively for the nation it doesn't do a thing," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution in Washington. "We end up with a distorted tax system for financing unemployment insurance benefits. It just continues this very warped taxing system we have in this country."
In Arlington, city and state officials are in a frenzied, secretive competition with Ypsilanti, Mich., to keep their G.M. plant open. The auto giant's chief executive, Robert C. Stempel, said last month that, as part of a plan to shed 74,000 jobs and close 21 plants, G.M. would soon choose where to consolidate production of its two rear-wheel car plants: in Arlington or at the Willow Run plant in Ypsilanti.
For Arlington, success could mean keeping nearly 3,800 plant jobs, plus at least 4,000 jobs of local suppliers, retailers and others that economists say depend on General Motors and its local work force.
Arlington would also retain what until now has been a crucial taxpayer. The G.M. plant contributed nearly $4 million in local taxes last year, including $2.1 million for schools. Already this year, the district has had to increase class sizes because it lost $16 million in state and local money, mostly to poorer districts, even as 1,700 new students pushed enrollments to 47,000. The threat of losing G.M. from the tax rolls "is probably the most challenging situation the school district has faced," said Rick Berry, superintendent.
Invariably, a plant closing would also lower property values, further depleting property-tax receipts, as the houses of furloughed or transferred workers flood a glutted housing market and businesses close. Some 1,100 G.M. employees live in Arlington.
It is a scenario being played out in dozens of communities across the country. The post-World War II industrial and military buildup that turned towns into cities in the 50's and 60's fizzled in the 80's and 90's as the economy weakened, the Pentagon budget narrowed and companies struggled to compete with stronger foreign rivals, while at the same time having to pay down the heavy debt taken on for acquisitions, stock buybacks and other financial maneuverings in the 1980's.
Robert B. Reich, who teaches political economy at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government, said prospects for workers and communities are worse than in previous decades. Since the 80's, executives have come under increasing pressure from raiders and shareholder activists to bolster short-term profits. But all too often, said Professor Reich, they have relied on cutting jobs rather than looking for other ways to pare costs.
 
Sharing the Burdens
 "The great benefits that were achieved in the golden age of mass production in this factory were the direct results of investments made by the public as well as by G.M. and its shareholders," he said. "Now that times are tough, what is the appropriate allocation of burdens?"
Part of Professor Reich's answer, developed in his recent book, "The Work of Nations," is that American corporations and big labor unions must do more to preserve jobs -- following the example of competitors in Germany, Japan and elsewhere -- by reducing wages, if necessary, training workers in more modern and efficient techniques and investing in advanced production equipment. Workers and communities, as well as creditors, shareholders and management, would share in a recovery.
Like hundreds of manufacturers, General Motors spent heavily on new technology and acquisitions during the 80's, but lagged other auto makers in training workers, he said. Making matters worse, the United Automobile Workers union has blocked attempts, most recently by G.M., to reduce wages as a measure to cushion workers against layoffs, effectively preserving the jobs and pay of older workers at the expense of younger ones, Professor Reich said.
In this Presidential election year, the White House and Congress prefer fixing the blame for the auto makers's troubles on their Japanese rivals, Professor Reich said. President Bush's trip to Japan last week, he added, was "a clever political ploy" that obscured how productive the more than 50,000 Americans have become at the Japanese auto factories in the United States. "Japan has absolutely nothing to do with this recession," he asserted.
Other analysts, especially on Wall Street, believe G.M. delayed far too long in paring its work force as its share of domestic auto sales fell below 35 percent and its production capacity held at 45 percent. Along the way, it became the producer with the steepest costs in the auto industry, a recipe for disaster.
The cutbacks that could ensnare Arlington are "part of the transformation of our industrial enterprise," said David E. Cole, director of the Office for the Study of Automotive Transportation at the University of Michigan. "In the long term, it's a lot worse to fail to make these changes. We have to do these things to preserve the integrity of our manufacturing capability in America."
Yet since Mr. Stempel's announcement, schoolchildren in Arlington have hoisted banners praising their local plant and workers have cruised the streets here in cars bearing bumper stickers saying, "Keep GM: The Heartbeat of Arlington." Elected leaders of the city and state have been huddling almost daily to decide how best to save the plant. Lloyd Reuss, G.M.'s president, told reporters last week in Detroit that the company could make a decision before the end of March.
Under pressure from debt-rating agencies and investors shocked by losses of $15 million a day at G.M. late in the year, Mr. Stempel told reporters last month that he revealed details of the retrenchment to quell rumors about plant closings. He said he did not delay a verdict on the Arlington and Ypsilanti plants as a ploy to wring concessions from each side.
Yet some plant workers believe G.M. has already made a decision. "I don't know if they have or not," said Fred Rattan, 63. "I've always said that trying to predict what G.M. is going to do is like predicting the weather."
 
Holding Out Incentives
 Yet Arlington officials plan to complete an incentive package by Wednesday that includes a smorgasbord of tax breaks and investment incentives. The tax breaks would amount to between $7 million and $10 million over 10 years, depending on the level of G.M.'s investment in the plant.
The creation of an enterprise zone, approved last week by the Texas Department of Commerce and including the plant and businesses within a three-mile radius, could potentially save G.M. millions in state and county tax dollars when money is spent to expand or upgrade production, said Mr. Vandergriff, now the chief administrator of Tarrant County, which includes Arlington and Fort Worth.
"G.M. has taken a very solid position that they are not going to whipsaw the communities or the two states," said Richard Greene, Arlington's Republican mayor. "They are not asking for any concessions. We're telling them what it would be worth."
But Arlington and Texas officials say they do not expect these incentives to be much different from proposals by Ypsilanti and Michigan officials. "These sorts of incentives are generally the lay of the land throughout the country" Mr. Greene said.
Governor Ann Richards's office declined to elaborate on her strategy for keeping G.M. in Texas. "The first people to see it will be General Motors," said Cathy Bonner, executive director of the Texas Commerce Department.
But disclosing one detail at a Friday news conference in the Arlington city council chamber, the Governor pledged that the state would buy from G.M. all of the natural-gas powered vehicles for its fleet if the Arlington plant remained open. A Texas law passed two years ago ordered the state, local governments and owners of private fleets to convert 30 percent of their vehicles to compressed natural gas by 1994. Texas state agencies must have 11,400 such vehicles by then.
Flanked by two dozen local politicians and union officials, Governor Richards said, "I'm real serious about the Texas commitment" to the Arlington plant. "The only automobile company we have in Texas is G.M. And I firmly believe that compressed natural gas is the fuel of the future."
A Democratic Representative, Martin Frost, whose recently redrawn district will soon include the Arlington plant, said he thought G.M. would favor the site over Ypsilanti if only to preserve its influence with powerful Texas lawmakers in Washington. "I don't believe that General Motors, if they go back to Congress, can rely solely on the Michigan delegation, so it would make some sense politically for them to actively involve the Texas delegation," he said.
 
The Washington Card
 Texans now head powerful rule-making panels in Congress, including the House banking committee and the Senate finance and judicial committees, each of which might be in a position to aid General Motors in the years ahead on tax, antitrust and other issues, Mr. Frost said.
Governor Richards met informally with some high-level G.M. executives a week ago during the Dallas Cowboys-Detroit Lions football game in Pontiac, Mich., and said Friday that she intended to meet with Mr. Stempel, along with other state officials and plant executives.
The manager of the Arlington plant, Art Hester, is the arbiter of what G.M. executives in Detroit hear about the Texas plant. A spokeswoman in Detroit, Nettie Seabrooks, said Mr. Hester is not speaking with reporters, and another spokesman, John Mueller, said he was unaware of any meetings that Mr. Stempel would hold with delegations from either Texas or Ypsilanti.
Mr. Stempel has said that the damage to the Texas economy of closing the state's lone car-assembly plant would be a factor in the decision. The state estimates that the plant, with a payroll of $121.5 million, last year contributed more than $1 billion in total economic activity in Texas.
For the county, closing Arlington "would make a bad situation that much worse," said Bernard L. Weinstein, an economist who is preparing a report on Arlington for G.M. and is director of the Center for Economic Development at the University of North Texas, in Denton.
The flush years of the roaring Texas economy disappeared when oil prices collapsed in 1986 and depressions in banking and real estate followed. That year was also the last time G.M. laid off Arlington workers; more than 1,000 people left the payroll.
The harshest setback for the area since then came last year, when cuts in military spending and manufacturing slashed more than 15,000 jobs in Tarrant County, which includes Fort Worth and is the weakest region in the slowly growing Texas economy. The cutbacks, at General Dynamics, Carswell Air Force Base, Bell Helicopter and LTV Aerospace, have made it nearly impossible to find jobs that pay as well as those at the G.M. plant, where hourly wages are $15 to $20 or more.
 
Chasing G.M.
 Many Arlington workers said, provided the choice, they would move to Ypsilanti if assembly work for the Chevrolet Caprice, Cadillac Brougham and Buick Roadmaster were shifted to the larger Michigan plant. Offers go first to workers with the most seniority.
But the assembly work added in Willow Run probably would not provide work for all the Arlington employees, and hundreds, if not thousands could be furloughed, with uncertain severance benefits. The current U.A.W. contract with G.M. assures laid-off workers unemployment benefits, from both government and company funds, of about 65 percent of pay for 36 weeks, according to the U.A.W. But the contract expires Sept. 14, 1993, or within a few months of when local officials expect that the Arlington plant would close.
Randy Philpot, a worker with 20 years at the Arlington plant, has already decided to move to Ypsilanti if Arlington loses. "I'd have to go," he said. Mr. Philpot, 44, said he needs to stay with the auto maker 10 more years to qualify for a full pension and early retirement. His wife, Debby, a nurse, and two high-school-aged children would remain in Arlington, where the mortgage on their house has been retired and expenses are low, he said.
"I could be laid off in a year at Ypsilanti and the whole family would be disrupted," he said. "So it would be a lot easier if I just went by myself."
 
The Halcyon Days
 Birthplace of more than five million cars under nameplates like Pontiac Chieftain, Oldsmobile Starfire, Chevrolet Monte Carlo and Cadillac Brougham, the G.M. plant propeled Arlington into a storybook era that, while it lasted, showed off the rising prosperity and optimism of postwar America.
A suburban "city" today of 96 square miles that has expanded beyond two interstate highways spanning the 34 miles between Dallas and Fort Worth, Arlington now has a population of 261,000. It beat back Dallas's bid last year to capture the Texas Rangers, but Mr. Greene cautioned that even if the city succeeds again with General Motors, it will not secure the plant's future.
"Great corporate citizens and benefactors of this community don't come with a guarantee to stay forever," he said. "Whether it's here or Ypsilanti, whoever is chosen, we'd all better keep hoping for a better car market."
Mr. Vandergriff, who sold his stake in Arlington's Vandergriff Chevrolet GEO dealership three years ago to a partnership including his son, Victor, and Mr. Greene, said he no longer owns General Motors stock. Yet he and his father had rejected offers from Japanese companies during the 1970's to add other dealerships.
Now 65, Mr. Vandergriff said he is shaken as much by the corporation's financial troubles as by its threat to pull up stakes. "I would agree that dramatic steps have to be taken," he said. "But it's hard medicine to take. When I think about it, I just shudder."
"Their people are just interwoven into the fabric of the community," he said. "The taxes that plant has paid have been enough to build city hall, libraries, parks and schools. If the plant closes, it will be devastating."
 
 
 
YPSILANTI PLANS TO RESIST A WAR OF INCENTIVES
 In Ypsilanti, Mich., 20 miles west of Detroit, the community's stake in the auto industry is far bigger than in Arlington. General Motors has a parts plant in addition to the Willow Run assembly plant and Ford Motor operates two parts plants.
Still, losing Willow Run would inflict deep wounds. The annual payroll of $178.8 million, when two shifts operated during 1990, slipped last year when the plant slowed to one shift, with 2,400 hourly workers and an additional 200 salaried employees. The plant makes Chevrolet Caprice sedans and station wagons, Oldsmobile Custom Cruiser wagons and Buick Roadmaster Estate wagons.
The Michigan Department of Commerce estimates that another 10,000 workers in the state could lose their jobs if Willow Run were closed. Personal income in Ypsilanti would fall by $50 million and retail sales by $35 million, according to estimates by the Ypsilanti Chamber of Commerce.
Since 1982, the township has granted G.M. 11 tax breaks through tax abatements, earned by spending for new equipment and other improvements at Willow Run. Township officials said the abatements save G.M. $1.9 million a year.
Unlike their competitors in Arlington, Ypsilanti's town leaders have not framed any potential new tax breaks before G.M.'s verdict. At the state Capitol in Lansing, the posture is also reserved.
"We are committed to fighting for jobs at Willow Run," said Rusty Hills, a spokesman for John Engler, the Republican Governor. "What we are not going to do is get into an incentives war to pay them to work here."

HEADLINE: World Markets;
The Year of the Foreign Bond

BYLINE: By Jonathan Fuerbringer

 BODY:
Bonds were generally more friendly than stocks for Americans investing abroad last year. High interest rates in some countries, like Italy, and strong capital gains combined with high interest rates in others, like Australia, all helped to outpace average foreign stock returns by more than six percentage points.
Overall, bonds in the 11 foreign markets included in the J. P. Morgan government bond index were up 15.9 percent for 1991, compared to a 9.4 percent return for the stock markets in the same countries, according to the Financial Times index of world markets. The 1991 return for foreign bonds matched that of 1990, when bond markets far outpaced stock markets, which tumbled because of the threat of the Persian Gulf war. 
 But still, to do well, it was necessary to pick the right bond market. The total returns ranged from 24.3 percent in Australia to 9.6 percent in the Netherlands.
Australian bonds ended the year in such spectacular form because all the pieces came together. In the bond market, capital gains were up 13.1 percent as interest rates fell. But the rates still remained high enough to produce a return of 11.7 percent, according to the J. P. Morgan index. So with only a slight fall in the Australian dollar, the total return topped 24 percent for the year.
As a bonus for those in both Australian stocks and bonds, the stock market was up 27.8 percent in dollar terms, finishing first in the same group of countries in the Financial Times index. The rest of the top five bond markets were Japan, up 23.4 percent; Canada, up 21.5 percent; Spain up 16.6 percent, and Italy, up 15.1 percent. In all four, the bond markets outperformed the stock markets. Japan and Canada, where interest rates were falling, had strong capital gains and interest rate returns. But in Italy and Spain, most of the return was from interest rates because rates in Europe have been kept high by Germany's monetary policy.
The United States was the sixth-best bond market performer, with a return of 14.8 percent. It was followed by Denmark, 13.5 percent; France, 13.4 percent; Britain, 12.8 percent; Belgium, 12.0 percent; Germany, 9.8 percent; and the Netherlands, 9.6 percent.
Among these markets, the stock market outperformed the bond market in the United States, where it rose 27.4 percent, and the Netherlands, where the stock market was up 14 percent. In Germany, the bond market performance was weak, but still better than the 4.8 percent rise in the stock market.
In the remaining markets the performance of bonds and stocks was even: in Denmark, bonds rose 13.5 percent, stocks 14.8 percent; in France, bonds were up 13.4 percent, stocks 14.2 percent; in Britain, bonds 12.8 percent, stocks 11.9 percent; and in Belgium, bonds 9.6 percent, stocks 9.2 percent. In Belgium, Germany, the Netherlands and Britain, interest return was much higher than capital gains. In France and Denmark, there was a close balance between returns on capital gains and interest.
Investing in foreign stock and bond markets was further complicated by a volatile dollar. By the end of the year, the dollar was back close to where it started. But there were several points during the year when dollar-based investors making trades were caught short. The sudden rally in the dollar at the end of last week should remind investors that the dollar is fickle, unpredictable and can quickly wipe out unhedged investments
During the two-day rally, the dollar jumped 5.1 percent against the German mark and 2.2 percent against the Japanese yen. Currency traders were leery of predicting a continued rally because they have yet to see real signs that the United States economy is recovering or that interest rates in Germany are going to fall soon. But several traders said that they detected a change in sentiment about the dollar and economic recovery that could keep the dollar at these new levels for a little while.
The impact of the dollar on foreign investments can easily be seen in movement of the J. P. Morgan index through the year. Last January, with the dollar still falling and adding to foreign bond returns, total return from non-United States bond markets was up 3.8 percent. Then in February, the dollar began to rally. And it quickly wiped out all the bond market returns.
By the end of March, investors who hadn't put hedges in place ended up with the poorest foreign bond market performance since November 1978, with non-United States bond returns off 7.5 percent. After six months, with the dollar still rising, non-United States bond markets were off 2.96 percent since the beginning of the year.
The dollar peaked on July 2, and by September the tumble provided most of the 5.8 percent return for foreign bonds. The pattern was repeated again in December.
According to the J. P. Morgan calculations, the dollar rally against the German mark cut 18.9 percent from returns before the peak on July 2. The subsequent fall gave almost all of that loss back. The dollar ended the year just 1.2 percent higher against the mark. While not identical, this same pattern held in the other European bond markets.
As for the yen, the dollar story was even better. At its peak June 10, the dollar rally cut 4.6 percent from Japanese bond returns. But in the decline that ensued, all this, and more, was given back. The dollar ended the year down 8.5 percent against the yen.

HEADLINE: MARKET WATCH;
Waiting for the Capital Gains Shoe to Drop

BYLINE: By Floyd Norris

 BODY:
Nothing, it is wrongly said, is certain except death and taxes. In reality, taxes are not a sure thing, and in that fact may lie a partial explanation for the soaring stock market.
Just now, chances seem better that the Government's desperate effort to revive the economy will produce a cut in the capital gains tax rate, a move that would be a boon to shareholders. 
 "As long as things are going well, who will take a gain if there is a possibility of a cut in the capital gains tax?" asks C. Fraser Evans, senior economist at Colonial Mutual Funds, arguing that hopes for such a cut have caused potential sellers to wait.
Perhaps even better for stocks would be an end to the double taxation of dividends, as was suggested by a Treasury study last week. Companies now get tax deductions when they pay interest on borrowing, but do not save on taxes when they pay dividends, which is one reason that corporations went deeply into debt in the 1980's, a miscalculation that is still damaging the economy. It remains hard to see how that idea could get through Congress, but even the talk may be helping.
But what will happen when the tax situation eventually is clarified? A decision to cut the capital gains rate would provide a reason for nervous investors to take profits, but it might also encourage buyers. On the other hand, if it becomes clear that capital gains taxes will not be cut, that fact could promote a sell off. The Oct. 13, 1989, mini-crash came in the same week it became clear that that year's campaign to cut capital gains taxes, which had seemed promising, was doomed to failure.
One new tax development is unfavorable for stocks. Foreign pension funds that own American stocks have long found ways around the withholding tax on dividend income that is normally paid by foreigners. But Bob Gordon, the president of Twenty-First Securities, notes that the Internal Revenue Service last week proposed regulations to close one loophole, involving the lending of stocks around the time of the dividend, and said it was thinking about trying to close another, a wonderfully complicated strategy involving what are known as equity swap contracts. If the I.R.S. succeeds, foreign pension funds will find owning American stocks less profitable and less desirable.
While some big stocks slipped last week, the explosive rise in smaller stocks continued. The Nasdaq composite, up 3.9 percent last week, has gained 13.2 percent over the last three weeks. More and more individuals are concluding they have to find alternatives to the low interest rates offered by banks.
That kind of soaring market rarely dies quickly, but share prices are almost certainly closer to a top than a bottom. "People who have never been in the U.S. stock market are pouring money into it," says Jorg H. Schwarzenbach, who runs private banking for Credit Suisse in New York. "This is a very dangerous sign."

HEADLINE: Wall Street;
A Dubious California Play

BYLINE: By Diana B. Henriques

 BODY:
As an investment concept, CleanAir Transit is pure California, right up there with wind chimes and chardonnay. Based in Santa Barbara, this newly hatched company aims to design and sell nonpolluting electric buses to environmentally correct towns and cities everywhere. No more diesel fumes, just a benign trace or two from the natural-gas generator that runs the air conditioner and heater.
This ahead-of-the-curve idea is outlined in a private placement memorandum now making the rounds among the very wealthy set out West. (The minimum outlay is $25,000, so none but the wealthy need apply.) By privately selling $2 million worth of preferred and common shares, CleanAir Transit hopes to grow enough to sell more shares to the general public in a year or so. 
 But the financial wizard behind CleanAir is Larry H. Welch -- a wealthy Santa Barbara resident who is either the company's former chief executive and chairman, or simply a director, depending on which documents you inspect. And, as many people across the country have already discovered, doing business with Mr. Welch can sometimes become a very disagreeable experience.
Mr. Welch is a newcomer to the antipollution scene. But he is known in the limited partnership world, which is still buzzing over the recent bankruptcy court filing by Alert Holdings, a Denver-based security alarm monitoring service founded by Mr. Welch. Nor is Alert the first company on Mr. Welch's resume to have stumbled into bankruptcy.
David Vallone, a spokesman for CleanAir, said on Friday that Mr. Welch does not take questions from the press. And although CleanAir identified Mr. Welch in early November as its chief executive, and discloses in more recent documents that it will pay him a substantial royalty on future sales, Mr. Vallone said that Mr. Welch "is just one of six directors." He continued, "As far as his past activities are concerned, he has invested in approximately 30 companies over the years. Some did well and some did not."
And the Alert bankruptcy? "That story is just unfolding," Mr. Vallone said, "so it is inappropriate to pass judgment on that."
Alert Holdings, founded by Mr. Welch in 1985, is in the business of electronically monitoring the security alarm systems installed in homes and businesses around the country and calling the appropriate emergency services when necessary.
Under Mr. Welch's chairmanship, Alert raised more than $250 million through the sale of limited partnerships and used the money to finance the purchase of new business accounts from smaller rivals across the company. Alert would identify an acquisition and the partnerships would buy it, with Alert getting a hefty up-front fee for arranging the deal. Alert would also collect continuing fees from the partnerships for providing security monitoring services to the new accounts. The revenue left over went to the partnership investors, who had been promised annual returns as high as 15 percent.
But despite those handsome promises, some of the leading figures in the partnership marketplace avoided the Alert Holdings deals. "We never liked what we saw there," said Brent Donaldson, president of the Liquidity Fund in Emeryville, Calif., which invests in limited partnerships across the country. "We just had fundamental problems with the underlying economics. We could never figure out how they could be sustained long-term."
As it happened, "long-term" didn't last very long. With the company's business faltering and both the Rocky Mountain News in Denver and Forbes magazine poking into its problems, a major investor forced Mr. Welch out last summer. In November, a new management informed Alert's limited partners that quarterly payments due in September would not be made. Since then, a host of investor lawsuits have been filed against the company and its former management, charging mismanagement and fraud in the sale of the limited partnerships.
"There are literally thousands of investors affected," said David J. Bershad, the New York lawyer who is heading the legal team representing the plaintiffs in those lawsuits. The defendants include Mr. Welch and most of his management team, including Roy A. Webley, who is now listed as executive vice president at CleanAir.
Dana Woodbury, the vice president for compliance at Multi-Financial Securities Corporation in Englewood, Colo., was an early critic of the Alert partnerships and refused to approve them for his firm's clients. Why? "The management," Mr. Woodbury said last week. "Larry Welch was very key. When we looked at his prior business dealings, we found that several of the firms for whom he raised money, and for whom he was a director, had gone bankrupt. That reflects poorly on his judgment and his management."
Before the Alert saga began, Mr. Welch's previous experience had been in consumer home-electronics stores. In the early 1980's, he built up one chain, sold it at a considerable premium and was promptly fired by the new owner. He sued for wrongful dismissal and lost the case in 1984. In 1985, he landed in yet another legal squabble arising from his investment in Schaak Electronics, an electronics retailing chain in St. Paul. He served briefly as Schaak's chairman, promising to find new capital for the struggling company. The financing never materialized, and he was ousted by the chain's founder. More lawsuits followed, and Schaak wound up in bankruptcy court -- as did Connecting Point, another electronics retailing chain he founded and attempted to merge with Schaak during his brief tenure there.
But Mr. Vallone in Santa Barbara said that Mr. Welch's background has so far not been a problem for CleanAir Transit. "Investors who are looking at putting money into the company, or who had already put money in, have asked those questions and have had their questions answered," he said. "It simply is not an issue."

HEADLINE: MAKING A DIFFERENCE;
A Believer in Liberal Arts Tackles Worker Education

BYLINE: By BARBARA PRESLEY NOBLE

 BODY:
Since 1983, when the Government released a stinging critique of the nation's schools, educational reform has been high on corporate America's list of priorities. But even before that report, titled "A Nation at Risk," the National Alliance of Business, a coalition of some 3,500 businesses, was intent on raising the quality of the country's work force by improving education and employment opportunities.
Recently, the organization, founded in 1968, appointed Joseph A. Pichler, president and chief executive of the Kroger Company, a Cincinnati-based supermarket chain, as its chairman. 
 Mr. Pichler is a former labor economist and business school dean who once helped organize a conference on the morality of capitalism. He was lured away from academia in 1980 after serving on the board of Dillon, a supermarket company that subsequently merged with Kroger. He became Kroger's chief in 1990.
"Teaching students, working with young people, has to be the most intrinsically satisfying thing you could do," he said during a break from an N.A.B. meeting in Washington.
Mr. Pichler, 52 years old, said that like most executives, he believes the country is dependent on the quality of the work force and its ability to produce goods and services. "The welfare of the nation depends on improved schools," he said. The N.A.B. sponsors several types of job-training and school programs.
Despite his advanced degree in economics and his years teaching business, Mr. Pichler is a hard-shell believer in the liberal arts as training for a life at work, an attitude that began with his Jesuit education in high school. "Two years of Latin, two years of Greek," he said. "At the end, you either have a liberal education or you're dead."
The work force, he says, needs people literate in geography, history and cultural diversity: "We need people with esthetic and social interests. We need good citizens."

ECONOMY
 
In Tokyo, Just Squabbling Among the Motorcar Moguls 

President Bush did not get much from the trade talks in Tokyo other than a case of the flu. So when America's Big Three automakers met their Japanese counterparts for a breakfast chat in Tokyo, the atmosphere was stormy, to say the least. The Americans were miffed at the vagueness of Japanese buying pledges. Somehow, 20,000 more cars "did not sound like a lot," said an angry Lee A. Iacocca, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation. And who would they buy from, anyway? Detroit or Japanese transplants? They never said. "There is no agreement," said Harold Poling, chairman of the Ford Motor Company, calling the pledges "inadequate." For their part, the Japanese lectured the Americans, telling them to improve the quality of their products and reform their industry. "We haven't done anything wrong," said Yutake Kume, president of Nissan. "We don't need to rectify our conduct or our deeds."
 
The Candidates Slip Away
 
In an election year, when the economy is in a slump, it usually signals trouble for the incumbent. Sure enough, last week's New York Times/CBS News Poll showed President Bush's approval rating slipping to just 48 percent because of the weakness of the economy. But the sluggish economy also seems to be working against the challengers. First, the effects of the slump caused Gov. Mario Cuomo of New York -- the Democratic front-runner -- to renounce his Presidential aspirations and concentrate on New York's economic woes. And last week, Virginia's Governor, L. Douglas Wilder, said he would drop out of the race to work on Virginia's economy. If the economy turned around, would they run?
 
First the Good News
 
In economics, all blessings are mixed. The Labor Department said last week its producer price index, which charts inflation at the producer level, had fallen by 0.2 percent in December. Such a tumble means inflation is virtually licked. "Inflation at the producer level is likely to be about 2 percent or so overall for the year, with consumer prices rising only about 4 percent for the year," said Samuel D. Kahan, chief economist at Fuji Securities in Chicago. But the reason for the decline in prices "is decreased demand," he said.
 
The Fall-Off's No Fallacy
 
For individuals, its best to pinch pennies in a recession since job prospects are uncertain. But to get the economy going, the country needs people who spend. That is the problem economists call the "fallacy of composition." According to the Federal Reserve, that's what the country is facing now. The Fed reported that consumer credit expanded by a minuscule $27 million in November -- about 25 cents a worker. The reason for the fall-off in borrowing is Detroit. More people are paying off auto loans than taking out new ones.
 
Another Prod for Washington?
 
There was more gloomy news on unemployment last week. According to the Labor Department, 300,000 more people became unemployed in December. That brought the unemployment rate to 7.1 percent, two-tenths of 1 percent higher than the month before. "Seven percent is an important political number," said Allen Sinai, chief economist of the Boston Company. "If the Administration isn't galvanized already into acting, this will do it." Such actions could include tax cuts and further drops in the discount rate, he said.
 
Selling Health-Care to Doctors
 
Last week, the White House chief of staff, Samuel K. Skinner, invited a group of doctors to the White House (they still make White House calls) to sound them out on President Bush's plans for fixing the nation's health-care crisis. America spends more than any country on medical care -- 14 percent of gross national product -- yet 34 million Americans have no coverage at all. President Bush wants more than a Band-Aid, Mr. Skinner told the doctors, including Dr. James S. Todd, executive vice president of the American Medical Association. The Administration wants to provide incentives for enrolling in prepaid group plans which buy group care at a discount from providers. It also wants to include tax credits for purchasing medical insurance and, for the doctors, it wants to limit awards in malpractice lawsuits. The doctors seemed pleased. Tax credits alone, said Dr. Todd, won't solve the crisis.
 
Bristol-Myers Squibb said it would reduce its prices to the Government by $80 million.
 
 
 
COMPANIES

 
Woolworth's Pulling Back
 
America has been sipping sodas at Woolworth's fountains since 1879. But lately, the fountains -- and the stores -- haven't been doing so well. The Woolworth Corporation, which operates 6,500 stores in the United States and had sales of $9.8 billion in 1991, said last week it would close or reformat 900 stores that lost about $50 million from January last year through October. About half of the 10,000 employees at those stores would lose their jobs. The closings will lead to a charge of $250 million.
 
A Sand Trap for the Japanese
 
Minoru Isutani, the reclusive Japanese golf entrepreneur, paid $840 million for the Pebble Beach Company and its golf links on the California coast in Monterey. His plan was to sell memberships for as much as $1 million, the way they do in Japan. That would would help him pay off the $450 million he borrowed to buy the resort. But last week the Monterey County supervisors drove his plans into the rough. They rescinded an agreement permitting the sale of memberships guarantying tee times and room reservations at the resort because it would limit the public's access to the course. "Even though it costs about $200 a round, it's the only one of the top three courses the public can play," said Chris Hodenfield, senior editor of Golf Digest magazine. Two hundred dollars? "Its an awe-inspiring course," he said. "There's the spray off the ocean, sea lions on the rocks. Playing it is like opium."
 
More Service in the Skies
 
Last week, American Airlines said it would offer business-class service on its flights between New York and Los Angeles. For an extra $200, you'll get wider seats, better service and meals you can both identify and eat.
 
A Detroit-Style Solution
 
When Detroit's manufacturing moguls touched down in Tokyo last week with President Bush, they arrived complaining about Japan's reluctance to buy American cars and car parts. They had a case when it came to car parts, but cars? Japan drives on the left, after all, and no American manufacturer produces a domestically built right-hand-drive car. Last week, the Ford Motor Company said it would solve that problem, building a right-hand version of its sporty Probe in Flint Rock, Mich. -- in about 20 months. Not only is that an inordinate amount of time to make the changes, but Flint Rock is run by Japan's Mazda Motor Corporation, in which Ford owns a stake. The new Probe should feel at home in Japan. That's where its engine, transmission and drive-train are made.
 
A Surprise Downgrading
 
While Lee A. Iacocco, chairman of the Chrysler Corporation, and Robert Stempel, chairman of the General Motors Corporation, were in Japan trying to drum up business, $100 billion worth of their debt was downgraded. Moody's Investor's Service knocked $75 billion worth of G.M.'s debt to A2 from A1 while Standard & Poor's pushed about $20 billion of Chrysler's debt to B+, from BB-. The downgrading will make it more costly for them to borrow. "We didn't expect it," said Robert Lutz, Chrysler's president. It's back to the drawing boards for the financial planners.
 
Overtrading
 
Paine Webber Inc. was ordered by the New York Stock Echange last week to pay $900,000 in fines for recommending investments to its retail customers that were often too risky and for buying and selling stocks merely to generate fees. In one case, the exchange said, trading was so excessive that $300,000 in commissions was generated in two and half years on five accounts with a combined value of less than $1 million.

British Rate Rise Likely
 
The snake (the European system of relatively fixed exchange rates) is wrapping itself around Britain, python-style. Since Germany's central bank raised its key interest rates point last month, other European central banks have been forced to follow suit. France made its moves last month. Now the problem is Britain. Its currency is falling against the Spanish peseta. "There is a trend toward high rates in Spain, versus a perception of lower rates in Britain," said Carl Weinberg, chief economist of High Frequency Economics. That suggests British rates may move up.
 
The dollar, meanwhile, is doing just fine, thank you. It's at its highest level in two months. "Technical factors are moving the market," said Madis Senner, of Sunray Securities. "With the mark a high-yield currency,it climbs then viciously corrects," he said.

HEADLINE: ABOUT CARS;
On the Road With Oldsmobile's Tourer

BYLINE: By Marshall Schuon

 BODY:
I REMEMBER, once, trying to rent a summer place in Nantasket, Mass. This was in the mid-60's, and the prospective landlord was a nasty guy. But I wanted the place, and my family was counting on me, no matter that this grouch thought us too inferior to spend a week in his rental house.
He didn't like my name. Didn't like that I had two little kids. But, most of all, I remember that in the middle of my stammering interview, he asked imperiously what kind of car I drove "over the road." It was a test. 
 His wife said, "Oh, Har-old," or some such thing to indicate that she, too, thought the question a bit odd, that maybe he'd gone too far, and to hint that she was on my side.
Even then, though, I thought his phrasing as weird as the timing of his question. I mean, how does a regular car differ from one that you use to go "over the road?"
It happened that I owned an almost-new Cadillac, so he was mollified on that score at least, but the notion of a "road car" has puzzled me ever since. Not that it is something I dwell on, but it does come to mind now and then, as it did this week when I was driving Oldsmobile's new 98 "Touring Sedan."
I mean, how does a touring sedan differ from a regular sedan? Is it a road car, or what?
Surprisingly, Webster's New World Dictionary has a few thoughts on the matter, noting that "touring car" is an Americanism that refers to "an early type of open automobile, often with a folding top, seating five or more passengers."
Other than the seating, though, those words seem to have little to do with 1992's Touring Sedan, a giant four-door Olds that possesses a supercharged V6 engine, gobs of leather and real wood trim, and a stiff suspension that is indeed fine for touring -- as long as you stay off potholed city streets.
The tester was dark blue, almost black, with vinyl cladding on the lower body, gray pinstriping, a sleek profile, alloy wheels carrying fat 16-inch tires, and most of the comforts known to Detroit and points far east. Antilock brakes are standard, as is an automatic transmission with its shifter in the console.
As befits its size, the car weighs in at 3,700 pounds, but fuel economy is reasonable, with a rating of 17, city, and 27, highway. All the same, economy is not what this behemoth is about, and the sedan is one of the pricier Oldsmobiles, with a base of $28,995 and a delivered sticker of $31,083.
Luxury, heft and size are all part of this road-car thing, of course, and the buckets up front add a nice sporting touch, while the roomy back bench offers comfort for three fellow tourers.
For the driver, there is full analog instrumentation, along with more gadgetry than can be dealt with safely at speed. The upper center of the dash is incredibly confusing, with (by actual count) 55 buttons to control such things as interior temperature, the sound system and an information display.
To compensate slightly for all that complexity, the leather-wrapped steering wheel offers simple remote rocker switches for climate control and the radio. The hub also incorporates a standard air bag for safety, but tiny buttons in the top two of the four spokes have to suffice for the horn.
The tester had a compact-disk player neatly hidden under the radio where it would be less likely to be stolen, and the rest of the front compartment showed similar thought. Below the CD player, dual cupholders fold into the dash, and controls for the power seats and windows are in both front armrests, where they are easy to use.
The ashtray is tiny and impossible, however, and it is unlighted at night. Like cigarette packs, it should carry a warning. And another unfortunate example of thoughtlessness can be found in the back seat, where the windows go down less than half way, an unforgiveable lapse of design in a car this large.
Out back, there is a trunk that is the biggest thing this side of a '59 Lincoln, and its power pulldown is a welcome addition. The central locking system also can be operated remotely from the driver's keychain, a particularly neat idea that Olds shares with some other General Motors cars.
On the road (remember the road?) the Touring Sedan is smooth and quick, and the supercharger helps to pull 205 horsepower out of the 3.8-liter V6, which is mounted crossways under the hood and drives the front wheels.
Acceleration from zero to 60 takes a mere 8.7 seconds, and the Olds cruises so effortlessly at high speed that you need at least three eyes, one for the gauge, one for the rearview mirror, and a third for the road. This thing is as fast as it is big.
Up there in Nantasket, Harold would have been impressed. We didn't take his house, by the way. We rented a place right on the beach and it rained all week.
 
 
 
SECURITY AT THE PUSH OF A BUTTON
 One of the things you get with Oldsmobile's Touring Sedan is the remote-control keychain that is now common to a lot of General Motors vehicles. Push a button and you lock all the doors. Push another, the locks pop up. And still a third will open the trunk's power lid. Neat, particularly at night.
But you don't have to shell out big bucks for a keychain that works magic. Kraco Enterprises of Compton, Calif., is marketing a remote fob and add-on domelight for $29.95. It will illuminate your car from as far as 50 feet away.
The light draws its power from the automobile's cigarette lighter, and it needs no installation. You simply plug it in, turn the switch to "remote" and mount it on the dash or sun visor. The light turns itself off 60 seconds after the keychain button is pushed, allowing adequate time to get into the car.
The unit also has an on-off switch for use as a flashlight or reading lamp.

HEADLINE: Quayle Fills Bush's Irregular Regulation Shoes

 BODY:
To the Editor:
I must disagree with a statement in "Mr. Quayle's Irregular Regulation" (editorial, Dec. 15): "The Task Force on Regulatory Relief didn't amount to much when George Bush headed it as Vice President." All of the criticisms made of Vice President Quayle's Council on Competitiveness -- it is a "powerful force for watering down regulation," it operates "in secrecy," and it has a "pro-business slant" -- apply with equal force to Mr. Bush's task force. 
 Environmentalists and other public-interest groups complained throughout the 1980's about Mr. Bush's role in delaying, diluting and quashing health and safety rules. For some reason, they just could not get the press interested in the story.
In an effort to bring President Bush's role in sabotaging health and safety regulations to the attention of the public during the 1988 Presidential campaign, Public Citizen published a report ("Risking America's Health and Safety: George Bush and the Task Force on Regulatory Relief"), of which I was principal author, detailing 20 incidents of the task force in action.
These included its interference with Food and Drug Administration rules to protect children from the dangers of Reye's Syndrome and unsafe infant formula; its meddling with Occupational Safety and Health Administration rules to protect workers from the severe hazards of ethylene oxide, grain dust and other highly toxic substances; its delay of Department of Transportation standards for air bags and bumpers, and its interference with Environmental Protection Agency regulations to reduce lead in gasoline and asbestos in a range of consumer products.
In each case, the task force or the Office of Management and Budget -- whose regulatory functions it supervised -- countermanded the scientific judgments made by the expert agencies entrusted by Congress to protect the public and did so at the behest of the regulated industries that were unsuccessful in making their arguments to the agencies. In each case, like Mr. Quayle's Competitiveness Council, Mr. Bush's task force operated behind closed doors with no public accountability.
Though task force interference was widely complained of for years, and though Public Citizen's report was released by Senators Albert Gore Jr. and Edward M. Kennedy at a well-attended press conference in October 1988, there was little coverage of the issue in the news media. The lack of press attention was particularly baffling because President Reagan hailed leadership of the task force as Mr. Bush's "greatest service to the nation" while Vice President.
The public was entitled to know that under the guise of "eliminating needless government regulations," George Bush consistently placed the profits and interests of big business above the health and safety of the country and its children.
It's not too late. George Bush is running for re-election. The public is still entitled to know about his role in preventing health and safety regulations from taking effect. This effort may be helped by a recent court ruling that task force records are subject to disclosure under the Freedom of Information Act. Perhaps now that you have highlighted Mr. Quayle's irregular regulation, you will next insure the public's right to know about President Bush's similar activities.

HEADLINE: SLOW BURN;
The Middle Class Feels Betrayed, But Maybe Not Enough to Rebel

BYLINE: By PETER T. KILBORN

DATELINE: WASHINGTON

 BODY:
IF the 150-or-so million people who are loosely called the middle class are so steamed up about stagnant wages and big debts, about rising taxes and medical bills, about the bosses of floundering corporations who collect multimillion-dollar salaries while firing thousands of workers, will they take it any more?
Indeed they might. 
 In America's unpedigreed, denim-and-sneaker society, most people say they're middle class. In terms economists use, the middle class is about 60 percent of the population. It is people who have high school diplomas and sometimes some college, family incomes of $20,000 to $60,000, a little more in cities like New York and Los Angeles, and in recent years, an equivalent amount of consumer debt. They have a house in a suburb, two vehicles, and one or two family members who work full time.
"Middle class is where you can live in a decent neighborhood, drive a decent car and can get all your necessities," said Carolyn Milini, 37 years old, of Canton, Ohio, a home health aide whose husband, Tony, is a steelworker. For the middle class, a living room carpet is a sizable expense and a family boat is a 12-foot skiff with an outboard motor. In the three-bedroom house where she and her husband have been raising five children from two marriages, there is a microwave oven. "But that's a luxury," she said.
Michael S. Dukakis tried with some success too late in 1988 to court the middle class as an economic bloc, but Democratic Presidential candidates usually fear alienating the affluent voters who vote in greater proportions and contribute more to campaigns. For the five top Democrats in the New Hampshire primary on Feb. 18, the issue is more tempting. The economic condition of the middle class has deteriorated throughout two decades of four Republican Presidents and one Democrat, and today's teetering economy, with the highest unemployment rate in more than four years, has made it worse.
Over nearly two decades, nonsupervisory workers enjoyed handsomely rising wages, from an average of $136 a week in 1972 to $359 by late last year. But it was all an illusion because prices rose much more. Real wages, adjusted for inflation, have actually fallen 19 percent, so workers can buy that much less with what they earn. They've kept abreast of prices only because so many wives have gone to work.
Harp on that hard enough, advises Victor Fingerhut, a pollster and political consultant to labor unions, and Mr. Bush is out: "When working and middle-income people vote against poor people and blacks, Republicans win. When they vote against the super-rich and big corporations, the Democrats win." But even on economic issues, it might be harder for the Democrats to capture middle-class votes than people like Mr. Fingerhut presume. American voters may be miffed now, but the patterns of previous election years show they have short memories and are easily seduced.
The Federal Reserve Board's giant pre-Christmas cut in interest rates, making it easier for everyone to borrow and buy, driving rates for home mortgages to the lowest levels in almost two decades, could help to revive the economy by early summer. If the past is a precedent and the bullish stock market an oracle, that's time enough for voters to think kindly again of incumbent politicians.
And to reinforce the Fed's help, Mr. Bush is expected to offer middle-class voters tax breaks. That could drive this year's record $350 billion budget deficit higher, spelling more economic woe later and sticking future taxpayers with even bigger payments on the national debt. But as President Ronald Reagan demonstrated, there's no surer election-year aphrodisiac than a promise to cut taxes.
There are indications, too, that the middle class may not feel as rebellious as polls and the state of its incomes suggest. Although wages of individual workers have plunged, the surge of women into the work force has raised family living standards, if just a bit. The Census Bureau reports that after taking account of inflation, the median family in 1990 earned $35,353, about $2,000 more than in 1970.
Going back another decade, family incomes are also 23 percent higher than the average of the 1960's, belying the view that today's middle-class family cannot live as well as its middle-class parents. And even though they save less and borrow more, today's families seem no more strapped than those of the 1960's and 1970's in how they spend their money.
A Bureau of Labor Statistics study shows that at the start of those decades, a family whose principal breadwinner was 35 to 44 years old spent about 20 percent of its income after taxes on housing and utilities. In 1987 and 1988, a family of the same age spent considerably more -- 26 percent. But partly because today's family has fewer children, spending for food and clothing dropped from 34 percent of its income 30 years ago to 19 percent. As a result, the family of the late 1980's spent considerably less on the necessities of food, clothing and shelter.
And because most middle-class families still have employer health insurance, their own spending for medical care, while rising lately, is only about 5 percent of their incomes.
For the money-strapped family, recreation would seem a likely target of cutbacks. But the family of the late 1980's spent more for recreation than the family of the 1960's. "In their spending," said Gary Burtless, an economist at the Brookings Institution, "it doesn't look like people are suffering."
Americans, more than most nationalities, also live on escalators, accepting the risk of moving down in the economy with the opportunity to move up. Much as people might worry about a stagnant standard of living, they support a system that makes room for their sons and daughters to become richly paid executives, doctors and lawyers.
"What's interesting about our society is that we are, in our perceptions if not reality, a classless society," said Fabian Linden, consumer economist at the Conference Board in New York. "There's no resentment of the guy at the bottom of the totem pole toward the guy at the top."
 
Suffering in Silence
 If the middle class is hurting, it has not been showing it in some other ways. Even as their incomes have stalled, middle-class Americans have become more reluctant to join unions, which were strongest in the 1950's and 1960's when real wages jumped almost 50 percent and helped insure their members a place in the middle class.
Voting patterns imply that much of the middle class is alienated, apathetic or content with Government policies. Only 57 percent of all adults voted for President four years ago -- fewer than in the elections of the prior two decades. The economy's losers voted even less. Only 39 percent of the unemployed voted four years ago, compared with 44 percent in 1984. Among skilled factory workers, core members of the middle class, 47 percent voted in 1988.
The heaviest voters -- people who gave Mr. Bush his edge over Mr. Dukakis, people whose incomes actually rose -- were big winners in the 80's. Seventy-two percent of all executives and 78 percent of all professionals voted four years ago. Among retirees, whose Social Security benefits rose in the decade and whose poverty rate fell, 69 percent voted. Of those 64 to 75 years old with incomes over $50,000, 89 percent voted.
In this election, the Democrats' opportunity may lie in perceptions, fanned by the recession, that someone is not playing fair with the middle class. Business Week magazine calculated that in the 1980's, chief executives gave themselves four times more in pay increases than they gave their average factory worker. Executives who preside over ailing industries typically take generous pension or severance payments when their jobs fold, but their workers fare worse. F. Ross Johnson left the chairmanship of RJR Nabisco three years ago with a $53 million personal "golden parachute" after losing a takeover battle for the company. Because of the debt incurred in the battle, 2,600 employees were dumped.
Last August, Roger B. Smith, the chairman of General Motors who presided over the company's decline in the 1980's, rode into retirement with an annual pension of $1.2 million that the company raised four months earlier from an originally scheduled $700,000. Last month, the company announced the layoffs of 74,000 workers over the next four years and canceled the $600 Christmas bonuses of 100,000 middle-level managers.
The old compact that workers made with G.M., A.T.& T., DuPont or Sears -- the promise of a lifetime of loyal labor in exchange for ever-rising wages, a pension and medical care -- is breaking down. Companies that long provided free health insurance now demand that workers share the cost. In this recession, unlike those of the past, many lost jobs will not return when the economy rebounds. In past recessions, blue-collar factory workers suffered most, and now there is the additional stress of some of their jobs going south of the border. But this time around layoffs are reaching well into the ranks of white-collar workers -- auditors, analysts, executive assistants, computer technicians and supervisors.
 
The Social Escalator Shifts
 People feel betrayed. Gary Castellan, 41, lost his job in an LTV Corporation steel mill in the early 1980's, a few months before he would have qualified for a pension. "They made sure we didn't get it," said Mr. Castellan, who now earns $9.65 an hour as a supermarket baker in Pittsburgh, about $2 less than he earned at LTV. "And there was nothing I could do about it."
Alan Machado, a 44-year-old computer technician and college graduate in New Bedford, Mass., said that there used to be an inviolate understanding: "They'd take care of you, you'd take care of them. And you'd be all set." But Mr. Machado's employer, A.T.& T., closed his plant last year and let him go after seven years with the company. He is left with $307 a week in unemployment benefits, about $220 less than he earned.
The middle class also has reason to fear that the American social escalator is running against it. Greg Duncan, an economist at the Survey Research Center at the University of Michigan, said that from 1968 to 1980, 6.3 percent of middle-income workers moved into the upper-income levels and 6.2 percent moved down. But from 1980 to 1987, the escalator accelerated, and 7.5 percent moved up while more, 8.5 percent, moved down.
Inequities show up in family finances. The Census Bureau reported last year that the 20 percent of families with the highest incomes captured 44 percent of all family income in 1990, up from 42 percent in 1980. The top 5 percent, with an average income in 1990 of nearly $150,000, raised its share from 15 percent to 17 percent. Everyone else, 80 percent of families, lost ground.
The search is on for whom to blame. In Mr. Machado's view, "It's American industry's fault for not being competitive, for not investing in new plants." Many others see a political problem. One old Republican ally, the 1.5 million-member Teamsters union, will oppose Mr. Bush's re-election. "This time you're going to see a strong, strong swing completely in the other direction," said Larry F. Landwehr, president of a big teamsters local in Wichita.
Some others doubt that politicians have all that much to do with the condition of the middle class. Lawrence Kline, a psychiatrist in white-collar, middle-class Bethesda, Md., picks up some of the frustration. "But the people I see are more likely to blame themselves," he said.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
It's Not Just Some Cars, It's the Future

BYLINE: By JAMES STERNGOLD

DATELINE: TOKYO

 BODY:
NOBORU HATAKEYAMA, Japan's vice minister for international trade and industry, emerged from the bruising negotiations over auto imports that dominated President Bush's visit last week in an uncharacteristically reflective mood. Now that the President had finally followed Japan's example and put economics at the top of his international agenda, Mr. Hatakeyama admitted to a certain ambivalence.
A United States focused on competing economically with Japan as vigorously as it once waged the cold war is not a prospect the Japanese relish. On the other hand, a weak United States could be just as troublesome. And what ails America, Mr. Hatakeyama said, is not too few Jeep Cherokees in Japanese showrooms or even the recession, but America's industrial future. 
 If there is one thing the legendary bureaucrats of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry understand it is how to build a successful auto industry. And Mr. Hatakeyama said that what he heard on the subject from President Bush and his entourage of auto company executives was not encouraging. "They have not faced reality yet," he said.
His remarks underscored the sharp differences in how many Japanese and Americans viewed the purposes of this messy summit. While Japan seemed to be taking an unwelcome interest in America's decline as a world industrial power, some American critics, perhaps nostalgic for the days when superpower encounters meant debating the arcana of nuclear annihilation, seemed more worried about how it looked to have the President of the United States traveling around with Lee Iacocca and the other chairmen of the Big Three trying to get people to buy more Chryslers, Fords and Chevrolets.
 
A New Kind of President
 President Bush seemed to feel that it was important to show the Japanese that trade issues were now too important to be left to trade negotiators alone, that they were now a Presidential priority. But he may have more difficulty convincing his own people that they have to get used to a new kind of President -- and perhaps a new self-image -- in this era of diminishing expectations and battered industrial competitiveness.
In the long run, that may have been the importance of this summit -- showing in its shortcomings that America needs a better balance in designing policies to cope with its industrial ills. It is important to tackle at the highest levels Japan's many remaining barriers to trade, but not to use them as scapegoats, while ignoring the work that can only be done at home.
The summit demonstrated that the balance has not been struck. While some critics complained that the President was using the Japanese trade surplus as a smoke screen for America's troubles at home, others, led by the bellicose auto executives Mr. Bush had in tow, complained that the President settled for too few concessions. By contradicting Mr. Bush's assertions that he had accomplished much here, they created a level of discord within the President's party that was more embarrassing than his sudden illness at a formal dinner.
"I really don't want Mr. Miyazawa's sympathy," said Robert C. Stempel, chairman of General Motors, referring to Prime Minister Kiichi Miyazawa's comment that Japan ought to offer concessions out of compassion for the American automakers. "The reason that we could come to Japan this time is not because we come from a position of weakness, but because we come from a position of strength." Coming from a leader of an industry that is losing billions of dollars and laying off tens of thousands of workers, these expressions of resentment were hard for Japanese competitors to understand.
Just as puzzling was President Bush's willingness to abandon under election year pressure his professed commitment to free trade and effectively demand that Japan set targets for the purchase of American-made autos and auto parts. Treasury Secretary Nicholas F. Brady attempted to refute this interpretation by insisting that the Japanese companies offered the targets voluntarily. But not everyone found the argument convincing. "This agreement amounted to the world's biggest and second biggest economic powers formally approving government-managed trade," Nihon Keizai Shimbun, Japan's leading business newspaper, said in an editorial. "It is sure to set a bad precedent."
The President and his policymakers devoted little time to the other side of the coin -- preparing measures that might be taken to rebuild the crumbling structure of the auto industry back in Detroit.
 
Declaring Victory
 One faction within the Bush Administration that has been struggling to get these issues on the President's agenda did declare victory in the summit. "We are approaching the Japan issue in a much more comprehensive way than ever before," a senior Administration official said. "Remember that just 18 months ago MITI wouldn't even agree to have Japanese companies come up with a plan to increase purchases of American auto parts." However, when asked what measures the Administration was taking to insure that American companies take advantage of the opening, or to insure that they invest more to improve their quality and efficiency, the official said, "I don't have an answer to that."
Some Japanese remember all too well a similar exercise a decade ago. The Reagan Administration fought for and received what were known as "voluntary export restraints." The agreement capped the number of autos the Japanese could ship to the American market. In Detroit, profits soared, but a decade later the Big Three are struggling again.
Mr. Hatakeyama offered his own quick list of the kinds of policies a Japanese bureaucrat would think of instituting. He mentioned changing the reporting period for the big American auto companies from a quarterly to an annual basis, so they could focus on longer-term planning. He suggested that a special tax incentive might encourage investments in new equipment and technology, and that a gasoline tax might encourage the design of more fuel-efficient cars.
Some frustrated American government officials respond that it may take a crisis in the relationship with Japan to achieve those objectives, rather than policy initiatives by President Bush. "A real crisis makes people act, it galvanizes people, and that is what we need to get corporate America out of the gate," a senior Administration official said. "People need to feel some emotion."
Japanese officials dismiss this idea as a poor substitute for a real policy. "By definition, a crisis is something out of control, and that is too big a risk," said Makoto Utsumi, a former vice minister of international affairs at the Finance Ministry. "It is better to work with the things we can control, to make wise policies."

HEADLINE: THE REGION;
The Rules Change, the Problems Don't

BYLINE: By SAM ROBERTS

 BODY:
IN last year's State of the City speech, Mayor David N. Dinkins promised "a new beginning." This year he invoked the poet Georgia Douglas Johnson as he wistfully envisioned a city government that would allow New Yorkers "to call our dreams." Instead, his beleaguered constituents seem more likely to get a jarring wake-up call shortly, as escalating financial and political pressures converge.
Next week, Gov. Mario M. Cuomo is scheduled to unveil a $52 billion state budget, in which he promised no new taxes. He held out no such hope regarding new pain, which the recession is likely to inflict on consumers of state services and on recipients of state aid -- including New York City. Mr. Dinkins's own financial plan was due this week, but he asked the City Council for a delay until Jan. 30 so he can factor the precise dimensions of that pain in projecting the city's own budget deficit. 
 Acquiescence from the reconstituted Council inaugurated last week cannot be taken for granted by the Mayor anymore. Speaker Peter F. Vallone appears likely to press his own agenda even more vigorously than he did last year.
 
The New Minority
 At the same time, the lopsided majorities to which he has guided virtually every measure before the Council can no longer be guaranteed. The minority of two who routinely dissented on the old 35-member Council has grown on the new 51-member body to a core of 16 -- 15 of whom, led by Ronnie M. Eldridge of Manhattan, declared victory after Mr. Vallone agreed last week to modestly relax the rules allowing the Speaker and the committee chairmen he appoints to control legislation.
The potential for more spontaneity within the Council and in its dealings with Mr. Dinkins still pale compared with the contentiousness between Mr. Cuomo and the Legislature, which has already led to costly delay in bridging a projected deficit in the fiscal year ending March 31. Common to both Albany and City Hall, though, is the skepticism of private credit-rating agencies whose verdict on the budget can vastly increase the cost of borrowing. Last week one agency reduced its rating on most New York State debt to the second-lowest rating among the 50 states.
Also peering over Mr. Dinkins's shoulder will be state watchdogs who hold the city to a higher accounting standard than the state imposes on itself. The four-year plan, including a $30 billion budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1, is expected to be unusually specific in an effort to meet the monitors' demands for significant reductions in the city's work force, for the shift of some services to private industry and for other economies -- including, perhaps, the shuttering of some superfluous jail cells. City officials also hope to win approval for a complicated debt refinancing and are even holding out hope for concessions from organized labor.
But if Mr. Dinkins's "new beginning" never got off the ground last year, the Mayor, at mid-term, is being forced to confront grim fiscal reality as never before. "This," said Deputy Mayor Bill Lynch, "is show time."

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Soviet Aftershocks Include a Global Commodities Glut

BYLINE: By MATTHEW L. WALD

 BODY:
WHEN your chief competitor goes out of business, that is supposed to be good news for your bottom line. But when the Soviet Union died, a lot of the commercial victors around the world caught a bad cold at the funeral.
The reason is a flood of exports from the former union that has severely depressed commodity prices. From over there, the export activity of the last few months probably looked like a desperate effort to keep bread on the table. But for competitors in uranium, aluminum, platinum, fertilizer and gold, it was an ironic reprise of the cold war threat of Nikita Khrushchev, to "bury you." Bruce L. Kaplan, who owns a precious metals consulting firm in Santa Monica, Calif., called it "dis-hoarding." The effects, which have been felt each year since 1989, have been dramatic, with the major exception to the pattern being oil, which Russia produces in abundance but is difficult to stockpile. 
 Reliable statistics about commodity exports were hard enough to assemble in the good old days of Communism, when the transactions were centrally controlled by Soviet authorities. In recent months, as the number of players has multiplied, tracking it has become even more complicated. So the clearest indication of the new activity is the effect on prices.
Platinum, for example, fell from $500 an ounce in 1989 to about $340 on Friday -- less even than gold. "It's an enormous problem," said Nina Lipton, vice president of the Platinum Guild International, a trade association in New York. The Soviets -- the Russians, mainly -- were the world's second-largest producers, after the South Africans, and centralized their sales, she said, but now new entities have popped up in the former union to sell platinum and they sometimes undercut each other.
Gold, meanwhile, was at about $358 on Friday, down from $500 in 1987. Because of a glut of Russian exports, the world scares that used to push up the price of gold, like the Persian Gulf war, now seem only to raise the blood pressure.
Aluminum ended 1992 at 51 cents a pound, down from 70 cents a year earlier. Robert Regan, an aluminum expert at American Metal Markets, a New York-based daily newspaper, said no one knows when the flood will abate, but without a Red Army to soak up production, it may be quite a while.
Urea fertilizer seems to have become even more chaotic. At Sovlink American Corporation, a company with American, British and former Soviet concerns as shareholders, the president, Terry English, described the situation as the union declined last year: "You'd be out there negotiating for $150 a ton, and out of nowhere, you'd get an offer for $120. They didn't know the value and they didn't care; they just wanted to make sure they were paid in dollars."
American uranium producers filed an anti-dumping complaint against the Soviets on Nov. 8, after watching the price of a pound of yellowcake, a lightly processed ore, drop to $7. It was nearly $12 in the summer of 1990.
 
Immense Stockpiles of Uranium
 "They have immense stockpiles they have built up since the end of World War II," said James C. Cornell of the Stamford, Conn., office of Nukem, a German trading firm. The price the Russians get now, he said, is far below cost for even the most efficient producer.
For nearly all these commodities, several other factors were at work. The international market for cars, which use platinum in catalytic converters, is down. Aluminum demand is down because of the recession and a slump in construction. Gold demand is down because inflation is dormant.
While exact numbers with which to measure the influence from the former Soviet Union are hard to come by, Mr. Regan put the increase at nearly 700,000 tons last year, meaning that total exports tripled. In gold, James R. Steel, a metals analyst with Refco Inc., a commodities trading firm in New York, said that exports had been holding steady at about 210 tons a year in the early 90's, and 1989 exports were 285 tons, with another 260 tons last year. Platinum exports probably hit 1 million ounces last year, up from 400,000 in normal times, Ms. Lipton said.
This is not the first episode of a surge in exports from what had been the Soviet Union. Mr. Regan pointed out that aluminum exports surged in the late 1950's and again in the early 60's, after wheat crop failures. John Lichtblau, president of the Petroleum Industry Research Foundation, said that the Russians did the same thing with oil at the time, raising fears that a rising tide of "Red oil" would threaten American producers at a time when "anything the Soviet Union did that could hurt Western companies was viewed as a hostile act."
The latest surge of exports has not included oil, the volume of which has actually declined lately because of production problems. Mr. Lichtblau and others say the rate of oil exports will depend on a race between declining production and declining consumption, the latter dragged down by general economic decline.
Although the short-term cause of the surge is sales of stockpiled material, another difference from the late 50's and early 60's is that this time the Soviet collapse could lead to a sustained increase in the level of exports. The republics want to integrate their economies with the West, a step that will require hard currency, and the likely source is exports of raw materials. Now, however, those exports can be mined, drilled, smelted and refined with Western capital and technology.
"This is imperialism at its best for American capitalists," said Ms. Lipton. The largest country on earth, rich in all manner of natural resources, is being opened to the world.

HEADLINE: THE WORLD;
Taiwan Becomes a Tiger With an Identity Crisis

BYLINE: By NICHOLAS D. KRISTOF

DATELINE: TAIPEI, Taiwan

 BODY:
LIKE a compulsive overachiever who impresses everybody but himself, Taiwan has enjoyed stunning successes in recent years but is gripped by an identity crisis. Despite having engineered an economic rise that makes Japan look like a slowpoke, and despite having introduced free speech and free elections, Taiwan still seems full of anxiety about itself and uncertainty about what it is.
Until five years ago, when four decades of martial law gave way to a sometimes tempestuous political free-for-all, the answer was clear: Taiwan was an inseparable part of China. The Nationalist Government here claimed to be the ruler of all China, and in school children spoke Mandarin Chinese rather than the Taiwan dialect and learned about the history of mainland China rather than Taiwan. 
 These days, however, few Taiwanese seem enthused about identifying themselves with a largely peasant Communist society where people spit on streets and the army shoots student protesters. On the other hand, Taiwanese fear that if they try to establish an independent country, mainland China will attack.
Few countries recognize Taiwan, its top leaders aren't invited to the United States or other major countries, and citizens sometimes find that immigration officials at distant airports are puzzled by their Republic of China passports. "We don't know who we are," said Antonio Chiang, a magazine publisher in Taipei. "The uncertainty is enormous. We don't know what we'll be in the future, an independent country, a part of China or whatever. It's an unreal existence, and it's related to the lack of self-confidence."
For four decades, the 15 percent of Taiwan's 20 million people who are mainlanders -- whose families came from China with Chiang Kai-shek -- dominated Taiwan and sometimes seemed contemptuous of local culture and history. But in the last few years, after Taiwan allowed visits to the mainland for the first time since the Communist revolution of 1949, many people came back shaking their heads and exchanging tales of relatives demanding expensive gifts and of awful trains and shortages of toilet paper.
 
A Change of Vision
 Rather than seeing themselves as exiled mainlanders, many came back as confirmed Taiwanese. One survey found that only 36 percent of Taiwan people who visited the mainland wanted to do so again.
Yet because of the fear of inviting military attack from Beijing, a National Assembly election last month -- the first full election on Taiwan in four decades -- led to a crushing defeat for the opposition party after it proposed a declaration of independence from China.
"Most people in Taiwan don't have much confidence in the future," said Tim T. Y. Ting, a leading pollster. "It's unpredictable. Anything can change tomorrow and destroy everything you have." This uncertainty, coupled with the rapid change, seems to have provoked a malaise in some circles. People complain about crime, corruption, politicians, disintegrating moral values -- and this in a society that until recently played down discord and did not acknowledge uncertainty about national identity.
Diane Ying, publisher of a business magazine called Commonwealth, which recently devoted a special issue to Taiwan's history, cited a litany of concerns about the future and added: "All this is because of the uncertainty. There's nothing you can control about the future. Everything seems to be out of control."
Nowadays, some Taiwanese react by trying to forge their own identity and culture. The Taiwan dialect is having a renaissance, though it is still sometimes thought of as less cultured and sophisticated than Mandarin.
Democracy is speeding this, because with voters overwhelmingly Taiwanese, politicians try to portray themselves as Taiwanese as well. Thus, during the campaign, the opposition tried to portray the ruling Nationalists as carpetbaggers from the mainland, while the Nationalists used Taiwanese dialect in their campaign advertisements.
In any case, for younger people the distinction between mainlanders and Taiwanese is fading, and intermarriage is frequent. "I don't find any difficulty," said Jaw Shau-kong, a 41-year-old Taiwanese-speaking mainlander and a popular politician. "It doesn't matter if you're a mainlander or a Taiwanese, so long as you work for Taiwan."
Other Taiwan inhabitants also say that whatever one's background, a new Taiwan identity is slowly emerging that embraces everyone who lives here, and that this perhaps will foster more self-confidence.
"Before I entered university, there was no doubt about identity," Yvonne Yang, the 32-year-old administration manager at Taiwan's English-language radio station, remembers. "We were Chinese and we would go back to the mainland. But then I started to talk to some friends and I discovered that the textbooks had many errors. I thought that maybe they were lots of lies. But then I started to work and I really loved this country. I created my own sense of belonging."

HEADLINE: How to Sell More U.S. Cars: Japanese Drivers Offer Hints

BYLINE: By STEVEN R. WEISMAN, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: TOKYO, Jan. 11

 BODY:
The very moment that President Bush and American automobile executives were calling on Japan to buy more American cars this week, Tomio Sakamoto was looking over a shiny black Cadillac Seville in a showroom on the Ginza, where it was selling for a pricey $60,000.
"Of course I might buy an American car," said Mr. Sakamoto, a 43-year-old graphic designer. "But I remember that my friend had a Pontiac, and it breaks down very often. The brake gets loose and the blinker lever dropped. It's unbelievable it was so badly made." 
 American cars were on Japanese minds all week because of Mr. Bush's four-day visit, which ended on Friday. Talk of cars echoed in the Prime Minister's office, among the bureaucracy and in business corridors. But showrooms were a good place to hear discussions from the real experts: consumers.
 
Advice for U.S. Car Makers
 Among the customers interviewed at random at showrooms in downtown Tokyo, the comments were similar. Mr. Bush's efforts to get Japanese to buy cars would produce little unless Detroit made better cars, geared to Japanese tastes. At the same time, many of those interviewed felt that American cars would find a niche here if they could be marketed with a few crucial adjustments, most notably moving the steering wheel to the right-hand side of the car -- since Japanese drive on the left side of the road.
"I'm in the advertising business, so if they asked me to promote American cars, I bet I could come up with something that would work," said Hiroshi Minamidate, standing near a Pontiac Grand Am. Asked what that might be, he paused, tilted his head and said finally, "Maybe status?"
At present, American cars account for only about 16,000 of the 5.1 million cars sold in this country each year, or a little more than three-tenths of 1 percent, compared with the Japanese auto makers' approximately one-third share of the American market.
The most popular cars are sports models like the Chevrolet Corvette, the Pontiac Grand Am and several Cadillac models, which a few years ago became favored by the kingpins of organized-crime groups known as yakuza.
But the popular press reports that the yakuza have more recently switched to Mercedes and BMW because of their greater prestige. In 1990 the Germans sold 137,000 cars in this country, almost all at the high end of the market, more than eight times the number sold by American auto makers. Besides the prestige, Japanese customers say they like the German cars because of their safety features.
According to dealers, the poor image of American cars in Japan took root in the late 1970's and early 80's amid resentment here at being pressed to adopt restraints on car exports to the United States.
"Japanese say American cars are too big, too hard to maintain and inefficient in their mileage," said Teruo Ishii, a spokesman for Yanase & Company, the largest-volume American car importer. "But the images are out of date. American cars have improved and Japanese are buying bigger cars."
 
'No In-Between" for U.S.
 Other analysts say American cars will never be competitive until they are backed by solid warranties and with the kind of service and repair networks that Japanese insist on. Doing so would be a major investment that American companies might not be willing to make without more guarantees that their cars would sell.
"American companies would have to go all out and make costly time-consuming efforts to sell cars in Japan," said Kurt D. Hahn, a former auto-industry analyst for UBS Securities in Tokyo. "It would have to be all or nothing. There's no in-between."
The high prices of American cars here are a result of costs for shipping, Japanese standardization and high markups by dealers. Dealers and other specialists also agree that although American cars may have improved in quality, more work needs to be done.
Masahisa Hayashi, president of the Maruso Securities Company, said he that used to drive a Cadillac Seville but that it broke down after a year, and he switched to a Mercedes. "I was really disappointed by the maintenance problems," he said.
His daughter, Kumiko Shibamoto, a homemaker, said she drove an Opel station wagon, a General Motors car made in Germany, for safety reasons. "Japanese car makers weren't making good safe station wagons designed for families," she said. "But American wagons were too big and expensive."
Almost every obstacle to the expansion of American car sales in Japan seems to have a Catch-22 aspect. American car makers have declined to put steering wheels on the right side because of the expense, but without the steering-wheel changes, it is unlikely that they will ever sell many cars.
"The steering wheel is not a trivial thing," said Hideo Tanaka, an advertising executive. "If it's on the wrong side, you can't get tickets at toll booths or parking lots. It's a big nuisance." But he added that for car buffs like himself, real quality could overcome even this sort of handicap.
He especially admired an old-model Corvette, one no longer produced in the United States. "The Chevrolet Corvette Sting Ray," he said, "now there's a great car, wonderful quality and functions. I would buy it even with the steering-wheel problem."
 
High Prices Are a Barrier
 The high prices of American cars,far higher than in the United States -- that $60,000 Cadillac Seville sells for around $40,000 in Manhattan -- pose another circular problem for American auto makers in this country. Japanese auto dealers insist on a big markup to compensate for low sales volume, but the low volume keeps the prices high.
As the Japanese see it, this situation illustrates the need for American auto manufacturers to be willing to sacrifice in the early stages for success later, as the Japanese did in the late 60's and early 70's in the United States.
"I know American cars are very strong, but for Japanese people they are too big and their mileage is too low," said Keiko Shimizu, a teacher, at a Nissan showroom. "If Americans learn how to be more flexible and work hard, they can produce cars that Japanese people will buy."
Miss Shimizu said the overwhelming majority of Japanese people had a negative impression of Mr. Bush's pressure tactics on Japan to buy more cars and car parts -- until Mr. Bush collapsed with an attack of the flu.
 
Feeling Sorry for Bush
 "Now we feel very sorry for him," she said. "He's got so much pressure on his shoulders because of these economic problems. But my question is why don't the American people work harder and try to fit what they do into what other countries want to see?"
The Ginza showroom featuring American cars was run by Yanase, one of Japan's biggest trading companies. By the end of the week, the Cadillac had been replaced by a blue Grand Am, selling for $22,700.
Japanese cars are generally less expensive and easier to service, another advantage. The most expensive at the Nissan showroom on the Ginza was a top-of-the-line black Primera at $19,320. More reasonable were two family cars -- the Sunny, at $11,536 and a Bluebird, at $15,670.
Two students were looking at them, and one, Satoru Sayama, a law student, said he had a "nice feeling" about American cars because they appear in American movies. Asked what he would think of someone who owned an American car, Mr. Sayama said, "There goes a real individualist."

HEADLINE: PANEL FROM C.I.A. URGES CURTAILING OF AGENCY SECRECY

BYLINE: By ELAINE SCIOLINO, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
A panel established by Director Robert M. Gates to explore ways to lift the veil of secrecy at the Central Intelligence Agency has recommended declassifying vast quantities of older documents and making agency officials more accessible to the public.
Intelligence officials say the internal panel has sent Mr. Gates a list of options that also includes more on-the-record interviews, public speeches and public testimony to Congress by senior agency officials, as well as the release of new material to complement the current publication of maps, world fact books and economic reports. 
 The study group, the Openness Task Force, is one of about a dozen that Mr. Gates set up soon after taking office in November to study ways to reorganize the intelligence bureaucracy. Among the aims were to eliminate duplication, to give the White House and other policy-making agencies sharper reports on world developments and to insure that the reports were not slanted for political purposes.
 
Justifying Money Flow
 The internal soul-searching stems from the pragmatic concern that in a world where the historic enemy has ceased to exist, the intelligence community must justify its billion-dollar satellites and thousands of analysts and spies.
Under the openness panel's most sweeping recommendation, the C.I.A. would declassify millions of pages of documents, some of them dating to World War I, making them available to the public, perhaps in a computer information bank.
The officials who spoke about the panel's recommendations did not say how recent the declassified documents would be, or whether some categories of older documents would still be withheld.
At the end of the month, Mr. Gates is expected to make his decision on the recommendations of this and the otherstudy groups he named. During his Senate confirmation hearings, he was a strong proponent of more openness, and he is likely to accept many of the proposals.
But it is not clear how quickly the agency could carry them out. Declassification would require substantial manpower at a time when the agency is cutting back its work force from the present level, estimated at 20,000 people.
And some researchers outside the Government remain skeptical that any meaningful disclosure is possible. "I'm not optimistic there will be more than cosmetic changes," said Steven Aftergood, director of the Project on Secrecy and Government at the Federation of American Scientists. "The intelligence community reflexively classifies information and refuses to release it, for example. It pushes the limits of absurdity. But it's built into their mindset."
Mr. Aftergood cited what he called the oldest classified military document in United States Government files: a confidential file locked in the National Archives on troop movements in Europe, dated April 15, 1917, nine days after the United States entered World War I.
Other intelligence experts argue that a secret intelligence agency is inherent to America's greatness. "If this country is to continue as a leading world power, a secret intelligence agency is required," said James Schlesinger, the former Director of Central Intelligence and former Secretary of Defense. "And the pursuit of transparency is at least anomalous and may be inconsistent with that purpose."
Mr. Gates previewed the new trend during his Senate confirmation hearings in September when he said that the C.I.A. and its sister intelligence agencies needed to develop "better popular understanding and support" through "greater openness." The popular perception of what the intelligence agencies do is so bad, he testified, that "the most outrageous allegations are taken seriously, when the honor and integrity of thousands of patriotic public servants are suspect merely by virtue of where they work."
He said that the intelligence agencies "must change and be seen to change, or confront irrelevance and growing sentiment for their dismemberment." At his confirmation hearings, Mr. Gates suggested going even further, proposing a broad review of the rigid system under which Government documents are routinely classified, often with little regard to whether their disclosure would damage national security.
Intelligence officials acknowledge that any move toward more disclosure will inevitably be resisted in a closed world where the charter of the 39-year-old National Security Agency, which is responsible for eavesdropping around the world, and even the name of the National Reconnaissance Office, which manages the nation's satellite reconnaissance programs, are classified for what is described as "national security."
Congressional efforts in recent years to make public the total amount of money spent on intelligence -- widely believed to be about $30 billion -- have failed.
 
'Painful and Controversial'
 In his his testimony, Mr. Gates acknowledged that the steps required for greater openness are likely to be "painful and controversial." Even the issue of disclosing the budget figure is "very controversial" within the C.I.A., he said, because it is widely felt that such a disclosure would only whet the appetite for more information.
Even if Mr. Gates accepts his study group's recommendations, the next hurdle will be how to carry them out. Declassification will require a massive infusion of manpower, and it is unclear how the agency's three public affairs officers will handle a surge of requests for more background briefings.
The proposal that agency officials make more speeches and public appearances flies in the face of Mr. Gates's promise at his hearings that he would not make substantive speeches with policy implications, as he did when he was a senior C.I.A. official in the 1980's.
Some agency officials have expressed concern that a move toward openness can only widen what Mr. Gates himself has described as the "very real" divide between the analytical side of the agency and the operations side, which conducts activities in the field. These officials argue that there are real limits to just how public the intelligence world can become without exposing sources.
 
A Closed Headquarters
 Some things will not change. No one on the study group is advocating, for example, that journalists covering intelligence matters be issued press passes or be allowed to roam the halls of the Langley, Va., C.I.A. headquarters unescorted, the way they are at the State and Defense Departments.
Agency officials will continue to be prohibited by agency statutes to have unauthorized conversations with journalists. All authorized background briefings with journalists will continue to be conducted in the presence of a C.I.A. public affairs officer. And the agency will continue to turn down requests by foreign journalists for background briefings.
But Mr. Gates has already begun a quiet campaign to raise a positive profile of the C.I.A. among the American people. He decided, for example, to allow a funeral service for William Buckley, the former station chief in Beirut who was taken hostage and killed in captivity, to be public, complete with eulogies and full honors.
It was the first time in the C.I.A.'s history that a covert operator killed in the line of duty was accorded an official public burial.

HEADLINE: U.N. Ends Protection for Vietnamese at Sea

BYLINE: By BARBARA CROSSETTE, Special to The New York Times

DATELINE: WASHINGTON, Jan. 11

 BODY:
An anti-piracy program intended to protect Vietnamese refugees from brutal attacks in the Gulf of Thailand has been phased out by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees because the attacks have all but ceased in the last 18 months.
Responsibility for policing the seas where, since 1975, thousands of Vietnamese refugees have been robbed, raped, killed or drowned when their boats were attacked, will now rest with the Thai Navy. 
 Officials in the United States say that Washington will be watching the situation closely. The United States paid about $16 million of the $25 million needed to keep the program alive since its inception in 1982, following a year of extreme violence against refugees.
In 1981, 1,444 attacks on refugee boats were reported in the Gulf of Thailand and nearby waters, according to the United Nations refugee agency. Of the 71,667 people known to have fled Vietnam that year, 961 were reported killed, 257 taken hostage and 857 women said they had been raped.
As late as 1989, 762 Vietnamese or Cambodian refugees were reported killed or missing at sea, but American and United Nations officials say that a decision was made in November to end the program because there had been no reported attacks on Vietnamese refugee boats since July 1990. The program was ended with the new year.
Officials say that fewer refugees are fleeing Vietnam by sea since legal departure programs are now functioning.

Hong Kong to Speed Ousters
 LONDON, Jan. 11 (AP) -- Hong Kong officials plan to increase flights taking Vietnamese boat people back to their homeland, the British Government said today.
Vietnamese and British officials agreed to help speed the repatriation program during a meeting in Hanoi, the Foreign Office said.
More than 20,000 Vietnamese in refugee camps in Hong Kong await deportation and more than 36,000 await screening to determine whether they are political refugees or economic migrants. Hong Kong is seeking to empty the camps in two or three years.
So far 87 refugees in the former British colony have been forcibly returned to Vietnam on two flights, and Hong Kong officials say a third flight is scheduled this month. Several thousand Vietnamese have returned home voluntarily, officials have said.
The Foreign Office said Britain and Vietnam had "agreed to do what they could to increase the rate of repatriation under existing schemes."
